Parsing [sent. 1 len. 43]: A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR 'S COURT by MARK TWAIN -LRB- Samuel L. Clemens -RRB- PREFACE The ungentle laws and customs touched upon in this tale are historical , and the episodes which are used to illustrate them are also historical .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 66]: It is not pretended that these laws and customs existed in England in the sixth century ; no , it is only pretended that inasmuch as they existed in the English and other civilizations of far later times , it is safe to consider that it is no libel upon the sixth century to suppose them to have been in practice in that day also .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 31]: One is quite justified in inferring that whatever one of these laws or customs was lacking in that remote time , its place was competently filled by a worse one .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 22]: The question as to whether there is such a thing as divine right of kings is not settled in this book .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 6]: It was found too difficult .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 73]: That the executive head of a nation should be a person of lofty character and extraordinary ability , was manifest and indisputable ; that none but the Deity could select that head unerringly , was also manifest and indisputable ; that the Deity ought to make that selection , then , was likewise manifest and indisputable ; consequently , that He does make it , as claimed , was an unavoidable deduction .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 72]: I mean , until the author of this book encountered the Pompadour , and Lady Castlemaine , and some other executive heads of that kind ; these were found so difficult to work into the scheme , that it was judged better to take the other tack in this book -LRB- which must be issued this fall -RRB- , and then go into training and settle the question in another book .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 29]: It is , of course , a thing which ought to be settled , and I am not going to have anything particular to do next winter anyway .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 40]: MARK TWAIN HARTFORD , July 21 , 1889 A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR 'S COURT A WORD OF EXPLANATION It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 32]: He attracted me by three things : his candid simplicity , his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor , and the restfulness of his company -- for he did all the talking .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 33]: We fell together , as modest people will , in the tail of the herd that was being shown through , and he at once began to say things which interested me .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 71]: As he talked along , softly , pleasantly , flowingly , he seemed to drift away imperceptibly out of this world and time , and into some remote era and old forgotten country ; and so he gradually wove such a spell about me that I seemed to move among the specters and shadows and dust and mold of a gray antiquity , holding speech with a relic of it !
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 75]: Exactly as I would speak of my nearest personal friends or enemies , or my most familiar neighbors , he spoke of Sir Bedivere , Sir Bors de Ganis , Sir Launcelot of the Lake , Sir Galahad , and all the other great names of the Table Round -- and how old , old , unspeakably old and faded and dry and musty and ancient he came to look as he went on !
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 43]: Presently he turned to me and said , just as one might speak of the weather , or any other common matter -- `` You know about transmigration of souls ; do you know about transposition of epochs -- and bodies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 9]: I said I had not heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 29]: He was so little interested -- just as when people speak of the weather -- that he did not notice whether I made him any answer or not .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 89]: There was half a moment of silence , immediately interrupted by the droning voice of the salaried cicerone : `` Ancient hauberk , date of the sixth century , time of King Arthur and the Round Table ; said to have belonged to the knight Sir Sagramor le Desirous ; observe the round hole through the chain-mail in the left breast ; ca n't be accounted for ; supposed to have been done with a bullet since invention of firearms -- perhaps maliciously by Cromwell 's soldiers . ''
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 44]: My acquaintance smiled -- not a modern smile , but one that must have gone out of general use many , many centuries ago -- and muttered apparently to himself : `` Wit ye well , _ I saw it done _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 15]: Then , after a pause , added : `` I did it myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 18]: By the time I had recovered from the electric surprise of this remark , he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 40]: All that evening I sat by my fire at the Warwick Arms , steeped in a dream of the olden time , while the rain beat upon the windows , and the wind roared about the eaves and corners .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 39]: From time to time I dipped into old Sir Thomas Malory 's enchanting book , and fed at its rich feast of prodigies and adventures , breathed in the fragrance of its obsolete names , and dreamed again .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 61]: Midnight being come at length , I read another tale , for a nightcap -- this which here follows , to wit : HOW SIR LAUNCELOT SLEW TWO GIANTS , AND MADE A CASTLE FREE Anon withal came there upon him two great giants , well armed , all save the heads , with two horrible clubs in their hands .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 28]: Sir Launcelot put his shield afore him , and put the stroke away of the one giant , and with his sword he clave his head asunder .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 49]: When his fellow saw that , he ran away as he were wood -LSB- * demented -RSB- , for fear of the horrible strokes , and Sir Launcelot after him with all his might , and smote him on the shoulder , and clave him to the middle .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 34]: Then Sir Launcelot went into the hall , and there came afore him three score ladies and damsels , and all kneeled unto him , and thanked God and him of their deliverance .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 101]: For , sir , said they , the most part of us have been here this seven year their prisoners , and we have worked all manner of silk works for our meat , and we are all great gentle-women born , and blessed be the time , knight , that ever thou wert born ; for thou hast done the most worship that ever did knight in the world , that will we bear record , and we all pray you to tell us your name , that we may tell our friends who delivered us out of prison .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 14]: Fair damsels , he said , my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 12]: And so he departed from them and betaught them unto God .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 30]: And then he mounted upon his horse , and rode into many strange and wild countries , and through many waters and valleys , and evil was he lodged .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 44]: And at the last by fortune him happened against a night to come to a fair courtilage , and therein he found an old gentle-woman that lodged him with a good-will , and there he had good cheer for him and his horse .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 20]: And when time was , his host brought him into a fair garret over the gate to his bed .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 25]: There Sir Launcelot unarmed him , and set his harness by him , and went to bed , and anon he fell on sleep .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 19]: So , soon after there came one on horseback , and knocked at the gate in great haste .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 55]: And when Sir Launcelot heard this he rose up , and looked out at the window , and saw by the moonlight three knights come riding after that one man , and all three lashed on him at once with swords , and that one knight turned on them knightly again and defended him .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 38]: Truly , said Sir Launcelot , yonder one knight shall I help , for it were shame for me to see three knights on one , and if he be slain I am partner of his death .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 43]: And therewith he took his harness and went out at a window by a sheet down to the four knights , and then Sir Launcelot said on high , Turn you knights unto me , and leave your fighting with that knight .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 42]: And then they all three left Sir Kay , and turned unto Sir Launcelot , and there began great battle , for they alight all three , and strake many strokes at Sir Launcelot , and assailed him on every side .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 12]: Then Sir Kay dressed him for to have holpen Sir Launcelot .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 27]: Nay , sir , said he , I will none of your help , therefore as ye will have my help let me alone with them .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 21]: Sir Kay for the pleasure of the knight suffered him for to do his will , and so stood aside .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 15]: And then anon within six strokes Sir Launcelot had stricken them to the earth .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 21]: And then they all three cried , Sir Knight , we yield us unto you as man of might matchless .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 41]: As to that , said Sir Launcelot , I will not take your yielding unto me , but so that ye yield you unto Sir Kay the seneschal , on that covenant I will save your lives and else not .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 44]: Fair knight , said they , that were we loath to do ; for as for Sir Kay we chased him hither , and had overcome him had ye not been ; therefore , to yield us unto him it were no reason .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 38]: Well , as to that , said Sir Launcelot , advise you well , for ye may choose whether ye will die or live , for an ye be yielden , it shall be unto Sir Kay .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 19]: Fair knight , then they said , in saving our lives we will do as thou commandest us .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 54]: Then shall ye , said Sir Launcelot , on Whitsunday next coming go unto the court of King Arthur , and there shall ye yield you unto Queen Guenever , and put you all three in her grace and mercy , and say that Sir Kay sent you thither to be her prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 54]: On the morn Sir Launcelot arose early , and left Sir Kay sleeping ; and Sir Launcelot took Sir Kay 's armor and his shield and armed him , and so he went to the stable and took his horse , and took his leave of his host , and so he departed .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 24]: Then soon after arose Sir Kay and missed Sir Launcelot ; and then he espied that he had his armor and his horse .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 56]: Now by my faith I know well that he will grieve some of the court of King Arthur ; for on him knights will be bold , and deem that it is I , and that will beguile them ; and because of his armor and shield I am sure I shall ride in peace .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 13]: And then soon after departed Sir Kay , and thanked his host .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 20]: As I laid the book down there was a knock at the door , and my stranger came in .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 14]: I gave him a pipe and a chair , and made him welcome .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 25]: I also comforted him with a hot Scotch whisky ; gave him another one ; then still another -- hoping always for his story .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 28]: After a fourth persuader , he drifted into it himself , in a quite simple and natural way : THE STRANGER 'S HISTORY I am an American .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 25]: I was born and reared in Hartford , in the State of Connecticut -- anyway , just over the river , in the country .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 30]: So I am a Yankee of the Yankees -- and practical ; yes , and nearly barren of sentiment , I suppose -- or poetry , in other words .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 22]: My father was a blacksmith , my uncle was a horse doctor , and I was both , along at first .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 43]: Then I went over to the great arms factory and learned my real trade ; learned all there was to it ; learned to make everything : guns , revolvers , cannon , boilers , engines , all sorts of labor-saving machinery .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 53]: Why , I could make anything a body wanted -- anything in the world , it did n't make any difference what ; and if there was n't any quick new-fangled way to make a thing , I could invent one -- and do it as easy as rolling off a log .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 14]: I became head superintendent ; had a couple of thousand men under me .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 20]: Well , a man like that is a man that is full of fight -- that goes without saying .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 19]: With a couple of thousand rough men under one , one has plenty of that sort of amusement .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 5]: I had , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 13]: At last I met my match , and I got my dose .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 17]: It was during a misunderstanding conducted with crowbars with a fellow we used to call Hercules .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 31]: He laid me out with a crusher alongside the head that made everything crack , and seemed to spring every joint in my skull and made it overlap its neighbor .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 30]: Then the world went out in darkness , and I did n't feel anything more , and did n't know anything at all -- at least for a while .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 32]: When I came to again , I was sitting under an oak tree , on the grass , with a whole beautiful and broad country landscape all to myself -- nearly .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 25]: Not entirely ; for there was a fellow on a horse , looking down at me -- a fellow fresh out of a picture-book .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 82]: He was in old-time iron armor from head to heel , with a helmet on his head the shape of a nail-keg with slits in it ; and he had a shield , and a sword , and a prodigious spear ; and his horse had armor on , too , and a steel horn projecting from his forehead , and gorgeous red and green silk trappings that hung down all around him like a bedquilt , nearly to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 9]: `` Fair sir , will ye just ? ''
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 4]: said this fellow .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 6]: `` Will I which ? ''
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 24]: `` Will ye try a passage of arms for land or lady or for -- '' `` What are you giving me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 15]: `` Get along back to your circus , or I 'll report you . ''
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 46]: Now what does this man do but fall back a couple of hundred yards and then come rushing at me as hard as he could tear , with his nail-keg bent down nearly to his horse 's neck and his long spear pointed straight ahead .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 16]: I saw he meant business , so I was up the tree when he arrived .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 14]: He allowed that I was his property , the captive of his spear .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 23]: There was argument on his side -- and the bulk of the advantage -- so I judged it best to humor him .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 20]: We fixed up an agreement whereby I was to go with him and he was not to hurt me .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 18]: I came down , and we started away , I walking by the side of his horse .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 43]: We marched comfortably along , through glades and over brooks which I could not remember to have seen before -- which puzzled me and made me wonder -- and yet we did not come to any circus or sign of a circus .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 18]: So I gave up the idea of a circus , and concluded he was from an asylum .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 20]: But we never came to an asylum -- so I was up a stump , as you may say .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 10]: I asked him how far we were from Hartford .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 26]: He said he had never heard of the place ; which I took to be a lie , but allowed it to go at that .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 48]: At the end of an hour we saw a far-away town sleeping in a valley by a winding river ; and beyond it on a hill , a vast gray fortress , with towers and turrets , the first I had ever seen out of a picture .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 4]: `` Bridgeport ? ''
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 5]: said I , pointing .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 7]: `` Camelot , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 9]: My stranger had been showing signs of sleepiness .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 54]: He caught himself nodding , now , and smiled one of those pathetic , obsolete smiles of his , and said : `` I find I ca n't go on ; but come with me , I 've got it all written out , and you can read it if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 34]: In his chamber , he said : `` First , I kept a journal ; then by and by , after years , I took the journal and turned it into a book .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 7]: How long ago that was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 30]: He handed me his manuscript , and pointed out the place where I should begin : `` Begin here -- I 've already told you what goes before . ''
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 9]: He was steeped in drowsiness by this time .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 23]: As I went out at his door I heard him murmur sleepily : `` Give you good den , fair sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 11]: I sat down by my fire and examined my treasure .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 20]: The first part of it -- the great bulk of it -- was parchment , and yellow with age .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 13]: I scanned a leaf particularly and saw that it was a palimpsest .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 34]: Under the old dim writing of the Yankee historian appeared traces of a penmanship which was older and dimmer still -- Latin words and sentences : fragments from old monkish legends , evidently .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 37]: I turned to the place indicated by my stranger and began to read -- as follows : THE TALE OF THE LOST LAND CHAPTER I CAMELOT `` Camelot -- Camelot , '' said I to myself .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 12]: `` I do n't seem to remember hearing of it before .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 8]: Name of the asylum , likely . ''
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 21]: It was a soft , reposeful summer landscape , as lovely as a dream , and as lonesome as Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 42]: The air was full of the smell of flowers , and the buzzing of insects , and the twittering of birds , and there were no people , no wagons , there was no stir of life , nothing going on .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 41]: The road was mainly a winding path with hoof-prints in it , and now and then a faint trace of wheels on either side in the grass -- wheels that apparently had a tire as broad as one 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 28]: Presently a fair slip of a girl , about ten years old , with a cataract of golden hair streaming down over her shoulders , came along .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 11]: Around her head she wore a hoop of flame-red poppies .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 17]: It was as sweet an outfit as ever I saw , what there was of it .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 19]: She walked indolently along , with a mind at rest , its peace reflected in her innocent face .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 17]: The circus man paid no attention to her ; did n't even seem to see her .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 26]: And she -- she was no more startled at his fantastic make-up than if she was used to his like every day of her life .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 33]: She was going by as indifferently as she might have gone by a couple of cows ; but when she happened to notice me , _ then _ there was a change !
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 35]: Up went her hands , and she was turned to stone ; her mouth dropped open , her eyes stared wide and timorously , she was the picture of astonished curiosity touched with fear .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 28]: And there she stood gazing , in a sort of stupefied fascination , till we turned a corner of the wood and were lost to her view .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 30]: That she should be startled at me instead of at the other man , was too many for me ; I could n't make head or tail of it .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 42]: And that she should seem to consider me a spectacle , and totally overlook her own merits in that respect , was another puzzling thing , and a display of magnanimity , too , that was surprising in one so young .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 7]: There was food for thought here .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 9]: I moved along as one in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 13]: As we approached the town , signs of life began to appear .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 28]: At intervals we passed a wretched cabin , with a thatched roof , and about it small fields and garden patches in an indifferent state of cultivation .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 29]: There were people , too ; brawny men , with long , coarse , uncombed hair that hung down over their faces and made them look like animals .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 35]: They and the women , as a rule , wore a coarse tow-linen robe that came well below the knee , and a rude sort of sandal , and many wore an iron collar .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 16]: The small boys and girls were always naked ; but nobody seemed to know it .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 48]: All of these people stared at me , talked about me , ran into the huts and fetched out their families to gape at me ; but nobody ever noticed that other fellow , except to make him humble salutation and get no response for their pains .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 72]: In the town were some substantial windowless houses of stone scattered among a wilderness of thatched cabins ; the streets were mere crooked alleys , and unpaved ; troops of dogs and nude children played in the sun and made life and noise ; hogs roamed and rooted contentedly about , and one of them lay in a reeking wallow in the middle of the main thoroughfare and suckled her family .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 77]: Presently there was a distant blare of military music ; it came nearer , still nearer , and soon a noble cavalcade wound into view , glorious with plumed helmets and flashing mail and flaunting banners and rich doublets and horse-cloths and gilded spearheads ; and through the muck and swine , and naked brats , and joyous dogs , and shabby huts , it took its gallant way , and in its wake we followed .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 30]: Followed through one winding alley and then another , -- and climbing , always climbing -- till at last we gained the breezy height where the huge castle stood .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 144]: There was an exchange of bugle blasts ; then a parley from the walls , where men-at-arms , in hauberk and morion , marched back and forth with halberd at shoulder under flapping banners with the rude figure of a dragon displayed upon them ; and then the great gates were flung open , the drawbridge was lowered , and the head of the cavalcade swept forward under the frowning arches ; and we , following , soon found ourselves in a great paved court , with towers and turrets stretching up into the blue air on all the four sides ; and all about us the dismount was going on , and much greeting and ceremony , and running to and fro , and a gay display of moving and intermingling colors , and an altogether pleasant stir and noise and confusion .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 44]: CHAPTER II KING ARTHUR 'S COURT The moment I got a chance I slipped aside privately and touched an ancient common looking man on the shoulder and said , in an insinuating , confidential way : `` Friend , do me a kindness .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 20]: Do you belong to the asylum , or are you just on a visit or something like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 37]: He looked me over stupidly , and said : `` Marry , fair sir , me seemeth -- '' `` That will do , '' I said ; `` I reckon you are a patient . ''
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 33]: I moved away , cogitating , and at the same time keeping an eye out for any chance passenger in his right mind that might come along and give me some light .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 45]: I judged I had found one , presently ; so I drew him aside and said in his ear : `` If I could see the head keeper a minute -- only just a minute -- '' `` Prithee do not let me . ''
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 9]: `` Let you _ what _ ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 14]: _ Hinder _ me , then , if the word please thee better .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 40]: Then he went on to say he was an under-cook and could not stop to gossip , though he would like it another time ; for it would comfort his very liver to know where I got my clothes .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 28]: As he started away he pointed and said yonder was one who was idle enough for my purpose , and was seeking me besides , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 52]: This was an airy slim boy in shrimp-colored tights that made him look like a forked carrot , the rest of his gear was blue silk and dainty laces and ruffles ; and he had long yellow curls , and wore a plumed pink satin cap tilted complacently over his ear .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 18]: By his look , he was good-natured ; by his gait , he was satisfied with himself .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 7]: He was pretty enough to frame .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 29]: He arrived , looked me over with a smiling and impudent curiosity ; said he had come for me , and informed me that he was a page .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 19]: `` Go ` long , '' I said ; `` you ai n't more than a paragraph . ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 10]: It was pretty severe , but I was nettled .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 17]: However , it never phazed him ; he did n't appear to know he was hurt .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 92]: He began to talk and laugh , in happy , thoughtless , boyish fashion , as we walked along , and made himself old friends with me at once ; asked me all sorts of questions about myself and about my clothes , but never waited for an answer -- always chattered straight ahead , as if he did n't know he had asked a question and was n't expecting any reply , until at last he happened to mention that he was born in the beginning of the year 513 .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 9]: It made the cold chills creep over me !
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 19]: I stopped and said , a little faintly : `` Maybe I did n't hear you just right .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 9]: Say it again -- and say it slow .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 6]: What year was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 4]: `` 513 . ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 3]: `` 513 !
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 6]: You do n't look it !
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 19]: Come , my boy , I am a stranger and friendless ; be honest and honorable with me .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 8]: Are you in your right mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 5]: He said he was .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 11]: `` Are these other people in their right minds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 5]: He said they were .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 8]: `` And this is n't an asylum ?
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 15]: I mean , it is n't a place where they cure crazy people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 6]: He said it was n't .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 24]: `` Well , then , '' I said , `` either I am a lunatic , or something just as awful has happened .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 13]: Now tell me , honest and true , where am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 8]: `` IN KING ARTHUR 'S COURT . ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 32]: I waited a minute , to let that idea shudder its way home , and then said : `` And according to your notions , what year is it now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 8]: `` 528 -- nineteenth of June . ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 26]: I felt a mournful sinking at the heart , and muttered : `` I shall never see my friends again -- never , never again .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 14]: They will not be born for more than thirteen hundred years yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 13]: I seemed to believe the boy , I did n't know why .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 24]: _ Something _ in me seemed to believe him -- my consciousness , as you may say ; but my reason did n't .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 11]: My reason straightway began to clamor ; that was natural .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 37]: I did n't know how to go about satisfying it , because I knew that the testimony of men would n't serve -- my reason would say they were lunatics , and throw out their evidence .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 16]: But all of a sudden I stumbled on the very thing , just by luck .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 39]: I knew that the only total eclipse of the sun in the first half of the sixth century occurred on the 21st of June , A.D. 528 , O.S. , and began at 3 minutes after 12 noon .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 27]: I also knew that no total eclipse of the sun was due in what to _ me _ was the present year -- i.e. , 1879 .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 39]: So , if I could keep my anxiety and curiosity from eating the heart out of me for forty-eight hours , I should then find out for certain whether this boy was telling me the truth or not .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 62]: Wherefore , being a practical Connecticut man , I now shoved this whole problem clear out of my mind till its appointed day and hour should come , in order that I might turn all my attention to the circumstances of the present moment , and be alert and ready to make the most out of them that could be made .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 32]: One thing at a time , is my motto -- and just play that thing for all it is worth , even if it 's only two pair and a jack .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 101]: I made up my mind to two things : if it was still the nineteenth century and I was among lunatics and could n't get away , I would presently boss that asylum or know the reason why ; and if , on the other hand , it was really the sixth century , all right , I did n't want any softer thing : I would boss the whole country inside of three months ; for I judged I would have the start of the best-educated man in the kingdom by a matter of thirteen hundred years and upward .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 61]: I 'm not a man to waste time after my mind 's made up and there 's work on hand ; so I said to the page : `` Now , Clarence , my boy -- if that might happen to be your name -- I 'll get you to post me up a little if you do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 13]: What is the name of that apparition that brought me here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 6]: `` My master and thine ?
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 22]: That is the good knight and great lord Sir Kay the Seneschal , foster brother to our liege the king . ''
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 12]: `` Very good ; go on , tell me everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 64]: He made a long story of it ; but the part that had immediate interest for me was this : He said I was Sir Kay 's prisoner , and that in the due course of custom I would be flung into a dungeon and left there on scant commons until my friends ransomed me -- unless I chanced to rot , first .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 26]: I saw that the last chance had the best show , but I did n't waste any bother about that ; time was too precious .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 141]: The page said , further , that dinner was about ended in the great hall by this time , and that as soon as the sociability and the heavy drinking should begin , Sir Kay would have me in and exhibit me before King Arthur and his illustrious knights seated at the Table Round , and would brag about his exploit in capturing me , and would probably exaggerate the facts a little , but it would n't be good form for me to correct him , and not over safe , either ; and when I was done being exhibited , then ho for the dungeon ; but he , Clarence , would find a way to come and see me every now and then , and cheer me up , and help me get word to my friends .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 6]: Get word to my friends !
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 41]: I thanked him ; I could n't do less ; and about this time a lackey came to say I was wanted ; so Clarence led me in and took me off to one side and sat down by me .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 13]: Well , it was a curious kind of spectacle , and interesting .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 18]: It was an immense place , and rather naked -- yes , and full of loud contrasts .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 59]: It was very , very lofty ; so lofty that the banners depending from the arched beams and girders away up there floated in a sort of twilight ; there was a stone-railed gallery at each end , high up , with musicians in the one , and women , clothed in stunning colors , in the other .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 25]: The floor was of big stone flags laid in black and white squares , rather battered by age and use , and needing repair .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 82]: As to ornament , there was n't any , strictly speaking ; though on the walls hung some huge tapestries which were probably taxed as works of art ; battle-pieces , they were , with horses shaped like those which children cut out of paper or create in gingerbread ; with men on them in scale armor whose scales are represented by round holes -- so that the man 's coat looks as if it had been done with a biscuit-punch .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 31]: There was a fireplace big enough to camp in ; and its projecting sides and hood , of carved and pillared stonework , had the look of a cathedral door .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 30]: Along the walls stood men-at-arms , in breastplate and morion , with halberds for their only weapon -- rigid as statues ; and that is what they looked like .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 21]: In the middle of this groined and vaulted public square was an oaken table which they called the Table Round .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 36]: It was as large as a circus ring ; and around it sat a great company of men dressed in such various and splendid colors that it hurt one 's eyes to look at them .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 34]: They wore their plumed hats , right along , except that whenever one addressed himself directly to the king , he lifted his hat a trifle just as he was beginning his remark .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 22]: Mainly they were drinking -- from entire ox horns ; but a few were still munching bread or gnawing beef bones .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 138]: There was about an average of two dogs to one man ; and these sat in expectant attitudes till a spent bone was flung to them , and then they went for it by brigades and divisions , with a rush , and there ensued a fight which filled the prospect with a tumultuous chaos of plunging heads and bodies and flashing tails , and the storm of howlings and barkings deafened all speech for the time ; but that was no matter , for the dog-fight was always a bigger interest anyway ; the men rose , sometimes , to observe it the better and bet on it , and the ladies and the musicians stretched themselves out over their balusters with the same object ; and all broke into delighted ejaculations from time to time .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 57]: In the end , the winning dog stretched himself out comfortably with his bone between his paws , and proceeded to growl over it , and gnaw it , and grease the floor with it , just as fifty others were already doing ; and the rest of the court resumed their previous industries and entertainments .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 39]: As a rule , the speech and behavior of these people were gracious and courtly ; and I noticed that they were good and serious listeners when anybody was telling anything -- I mean in a dog-fightless interval .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 45]: And plainly , too , they were a childlike and innocent lot ; telling lies of the stateliest pattern with a most gentle and winning naivety , and ready and willing to listen to anybody else 's lie , and believe it , too .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 34]: It was hard to associate them with anything cruel or dreadful ; and yet they dealt in tales of blood and suffering with a guileless relish that made me almost forget to shudder .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 8]: I was not the only prisoner present .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 6]: There were twenty or more .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 38]: Poor devils , many of them were maimed , hacked , carved , in a frightful way ; and their hair , their faces , their clothing , were caked with black and stiffened drenchings of blood .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 73]: They were suffering sharp physical pain , of course ; and weariness , and hunger and thirst , no doubt ; and at least none had given them the comfort of a wash , or even the poor charity of a lotion for their wounds ; yet you never heard them utter a moan or a groan , or saw them show any sign of restlessness , or any disposition to complain .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 70]: The thought was forced upon me : `` The rascals -- _ they _ have served other people so in their day ; it being their own turn , now , they were not expecting any better treatment than this ; so their philosophical bearing is not an outcome of mental training , intellectual fortitude , reasoning ; it is mere animal training ; they are white Indians . ''
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 40]: CHAPTER III KNIGHTS OF THE TABLE ROUND Mainly the Round Table talk was monologues -- narrative accounts of the adventures in which these prisoners were captured and their friends and backers killed and stripped of their steeds and armor .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 69]: As a general thing -- as far as I could make out -- these murderous adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries , nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings out ; no , as a rule they were simply duels between strangers -- duels between people who had never even been introduced to each other , and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 84]: Many a time I had seen a couple of boys , strangers , meet by chance , and say simultaneously , `` I can lick you , '' and go at it on the spot ; but I had always imagined until now that that sort of thing belonged to children only , and was a sign and mark of childhood ; but here were these big boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 17]: Yet there was something very engaging about these great simple-hearted creatures , something attractive and lovable .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 71]: There did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery , so to speak , to bait a fish-hook with ; but you did n't seem to mind that , after a little , because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that , and indeed would have marred it , hindered it , spoiled its symmetry -- perhaps rendered its existence impossible .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 28]: There was a fine manliness observable in almost every face ; and in some a certain loftiness and sweetness that rebuked your belittling criticisms and stilled them .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 45]: A most noble benignity and purity reposed in the countenance of him they called Sir Galahad , and likewise in the king 's also ; and there was majesty and greatness in the giant frame and high bearing of Sir Launcelot of the Lake .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 15]: There was presently an incident which centered the general interest upon this Sir Launcelot .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 50]: At a sign from a sort of master of ceremonies , six or eight of the prisoners rose and came forward in a body and knelt on the floor and lifted up their hands toward the ladies ' gallery and begged the grace of a word with the queen .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 97]: The most conspicuously situated lady in that massed flower-bed of feminine show and finery inclined her head by way of assent , and then the spokesman of the prisoners delivered himself and his fellows into her hands for free pardon , ransom , captivity , or death , as she in her good pleasure might elect ; and this , as he said , he was doing by command of Sir Kay the Seneschal , whose prisoners they were , he having vanquished them by his single might and prowess in sturdy conflict in the field .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 57]: Surprise and astonishment flashed from face to face all over the house ; the queen 's gratified smile faded out at the name of Sir Kay , and she looked disappointed ; and the page whispered in my ear with an accent and manner expressive of extravagant derision -- `` Sir _ Kay _ , forsooth !
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 14]: Oh , call me pet names , dearest , call me a marine !
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 24]: In twice a thousand years shall the unholy invention of man labor at odds to beget the fellow to this majestic lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 11]: Every eye was fastened with severe inquiry upon Sir Kay .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 8]: But he was equal to the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 16]: He got up and played his hand like a major -- and took every trick .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 80]: He said he would state the case exactly according to the facts ; he would tell the simple straightforward tale , without comment of his own ; `` and then , '' said he , `` if ye find glory and honor due , ye will give it unto him who is the mightiest man of his hands that ever bare shield or strake with sword in the ranks of Christian battle -- even him that sitteth there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 7]: and he pointed to Sir Launcelot .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 13]: Ah , he fetched them ; it was a rattling good stroke .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 192]: Then he went on and told how Sir Launcelot , seeking adventures , some brief time gone by , killed seven giants at one sweep of his sword , and set a hundred and forty-two captive maidens free ; and then went further , still seeking adventures , and found him -LRB- Sir Kay -RRB- fighting a desperate fight against nine foreign knights , and straightway took the battle solely into his own hands , and conquered the nine ; and that night Sir Launcelot rose quietly , and dressed him in Sir Kay 's armor and took Sir Kay 's horse and gat him away into distant lands , and vanquished sixteen knights in one pitched battle and thirty-four in another ; and all these and the former nine he made to swear that about Whitsuntide they would ride to Arthur 's court and yield them to Queen Guenever 's hands as captives of Sir Kay the Seneschal , spoil of his knightly prowess ; and now here were these half dozen , and the rest would be along as soon as they might be healed of their desperate wounds .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 40]: Well , it was touching to see the queen blush and smile , and look embarrassed and happy , and fling furtive glances at Sir Launcelot that would have got him shot in Arkansas , to a dead certainty .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 43]: Everybody praised the valor and magnanimity of Sir Launcelot ; and as for me , I was perfectly amazed , that one man , all by himself , should have been able to beat down and capture such battalions of practiced fighters .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 39]: I said as much to Clarence ; but this mocking featherhead only said : `` An Sir Kay had had time to get another skin of sour wine into him , ye had seen the accompt doubled . ''
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 25]: I looked at the boy in sorrow ; and as I looked I saw the cloud of a deep despondency settle upon his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 54]: I followed the direction of his eye , and saw that a very old and white-bearded man , clothed in a flowing black gown , had risen and was standing at the table upon unsteady legs , and feebly swaying his ancient head and surveying the company with his watery and wandering eye .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 35]: The same suffering look that was in the page 's face was observable in all the faces around -- the look of dumb creatures who know that they must endure and make no moan .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 57]: `` Marry , we shall have it again , '' sighed the boy ; `` that same old weary tale that he hath told a thousand times in the same words , and that he _ will _ tell till he dieth , every time he hath gotten his barrel full and feeleth his exaggeration-mill a-working .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 12]: Would God I had died or I saw this day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 6]: `` Who is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 22]: `` Merlin , the mighty liar and magician , perdition singe him for the weariness he worketh with his one tale !
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 48]: But that men fear him for that he hath the storms and the lightnings and all the devils that be in hell at his beck and call , they would have dug his entrails out these many years ago to get at that tale and squelch it .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 29]: He telleth it always in the third person , making believe he is too modest to glorify himself -- maledictions light upon him , misfortune be his dole !
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 10]: Good friend , prithee call me for evensong . ''
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 14]: The boy nestled himself upon my shoulder and pretended to go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 35]: The old man began his tale ; and presently the lad was asleep in reality ; so also were the dogs , and the court , the lackeys , and the files of men-at-arms .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 26]: The droning voice droned on ; a soft snoring arose on all sides and supported it like a deep and subdued accompaniment of wind instruments .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 90]: Some heads were bowed upon folded arms , some lay back with open mouths that issued unconscious music ; the flies buzzed and bit , unmolested , the rats swarmed softly out from a hundred holes , and pattered about , and made themselves at home everywhere ; and one of them sat up like a squirrel on the king 's head and held a bit of cheese in its hands and nibbled it , and dribbled the crumbs in the king 's face with naive and impudent irreverence .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 17]: It was a tranquil scene , and restful to the weary eye and the jaded spirit .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 8]: This was the old man 's tale .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 27]: He said : `` Right so the king and Merlin departed , and went until an hermit that was a good man and a great leech .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 39]: So the hermit searched all his wounds and gave him good salves ; so the king was there three days , and then were his wounds well amended that he might ride and go , and so departed .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 13]: And as they rode , Arthur said , I have no sword .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 14]: No force , * -LSB- * Footnote from M.T. : No matter . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 15]: said Merlin , hereby is a sword that shall be yours and I may .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 46]: So they rode till they came to a lake , the which was a fair water and broad , and in the midst of the lake Arthur was ware of an arm clothed in white samite , that held a fair sword in that hand .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 14]: Lo , said Merlin , yonder is that sword that I spake of .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 11]: With that they saw a damsel going upon the lake .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 5]: What damsel is that ?
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 3]: said Arthur .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 59]: That is the Lady of the lake , said Merlin ; and within that lake is a rock , and therein is as fair a place as any on earth , and richly beseen , and this damsel will come to you anon , and then speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 16]: Anon withal came the damsel unto Arthur and saluted him , and he her again .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 19]: Damsel , said Arthur , what sword is that , that yonder the arm holdeth above the water ?
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 12]: I would it were mine , for I have no sword .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 32]: Sir Arthur King , said the damsel , that sword is mine , and if ye will give me a gift when I ask it you , ye shall have it .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 17]: By my faith , said Arthur , I will give you what gift ye will ask .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 39]: Well , said the damsel , go ye into yonder barge and row yourself to the sword , and take it and the scabbard with you , and I will ask my gift when I see my time .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 50]: So Sir Arthur and Merlin alight , and tied their horses to two trees , and so they went into the ship , and when they came to the sword that the hand held , Sir Arthur took it up by the handles , and took it with him .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 22]: And the arm and the hand went under the water ; and so they came unto the land and rode forth .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 9]: And then Sir Arthur saw a rich pavilion .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 5]: What signifieth yonder pavilion ?
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 82]: It is the knight 's pavilion , said Merlin , that ye fought with last , Sir Pellinore , but he is out , he is not there ; he hath ado with a knight of yours , that hight Egglame , and they have fought together , but at the last Egglame fled , and else he had been dead , and he hath chased him even to Carlion , and we shall meet with him anon in the highway .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 28]: That is well said , said Arthur , now have I a sword , now will I wage battle with him , and be avenged on him .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 76]: Sir , ye shall not so , said Merlin , for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing , so that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him ; also , he will not lightly be matched of one knight living ; and therefore it is my counsel , let him pass , for he shall do you good service in short time , and his sons , after his days .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 22]: Also ye shall see that day in short space ye shall be right glad to give him your sister to wed. .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 16]: When I see him , I will do as ye advise me , said Arthur .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 14]: Then Sir Arthur looked on the sword , and liked it passing well .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 14]: Whether liketh you better , said Merlin , the sword or the scabbard ?
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 9]: Me liketh better the sword , said Arthur .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 50]: Ye are more unwise , said Merlin , for the scabbard is worth ten of the sword , for while ye have the scabbard upon you ye shall never lose no blood , be ye never so sore wounded ; therefore , keep well the scabbard always with you .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 37]: So they rode into Carlion , and by the way they met with Sir Pellinore ; but Merlin had done such a craft that Pellinore saw not Arthur , and he passed by without any words .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 13]: I marvel , said Arthur , that the knight would not speak .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 22]: Sir , said Merlin , he saw you not ; for and he had seen you ye had not lightly departed .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 13]: So they came unto Carlion , whereof his knights were passing glad .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 18]: And when they heard of his adventures they marveled that he would jeopard his person so alone .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 29]: But all men of worship said it was merry to be under such a chieftain that would put his person in adventure as other poor knights did . ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 50]: CHAPTER IV SIR DINADAN THE HUMORIST It seemed to me that this quaint lie was most simply and beautifully told ; but then I had heard it only once , and that makes a difference ; it was pleasant to the others when it was fresh , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 26]: Sir Dinadan the Humorist was the first to awake , and he soon roused the rest with a practical joke of a sufficiently poor quality .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 93]: He tied some metal mugs to a dog 's tail and turned him loose , and he tore around and around the place in a frenzy of fright , with all the other dogs bellowing after him and battering and crashing against everything that came in their way and making altogether a chaos of confusion and a most deafening din and turmoil ; at which every man and woman of the multitude laughed till the tears flowed , and some fell out of their chairs and wallowed on the floor in ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 8]: It was just like so many children .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 57]: Sir Dinadan was so proud of his exploit that he could not keep from telling over and over again , to weariness , how the immortal idea happened to occur to him ; and as is the way with humorists of his breed , he was still laughing at it after everybody else had got through .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 19]: He was so set up that he concluded to make a speech -- of course a humorous speech .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 16]: I think I never heard so many old played-out jokes strung together in my life .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 15]: He was worse than the minstrels , worse than the clown in the circus .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 43]: It seemed peculiarly sad to sit here , thirteen hundred years before I was born , and listen again to poor , flat , worm-eaten jokes that had given me the dry gripes when I was a boy thirteen hundred years afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 17]: It about convinced me that there is n't any such thing as a new joke possible .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 20]: Everybody laughed at these antiquities -- but then they always do ; I had noticed that , centuries later .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 15]: However , of course the scoffer did n't laugh -- I mean the boy .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 15]: No , he scoffed ; there was n't anything he would n't scoff at .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 17]: He said the most of Sir Dinadan 's jokes were rotten and the rest were petrified .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 34]: I said `` petrified '' was good ; as I believed , myself , that the only right way to classify the majestic ages of some of those jokes was by geologic periods .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 20]: But that neat idea hit the boy in a blank place , for geology had n't been invented yet .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 24]: However , I made a note of the remark , and calculated to educate the commonwealth up to it if I pulled through .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 19]: It is no use to throw a good thing away merely because the market is n't ripe yet .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 17]: Now Sir Kay arose and began to fire up on his history-mill with me for fuel .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 13]: It was time for me to feel serious , and I did .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 48]: Sir Kay told how he had encountered me in a far land of barbarians , who all wore the same ridiculous garb that I did -- a garb that was a work of enchantment , and intended to make the wearer secure from hurt by human hands .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 58]: However he had nullified the force of the enchantment by prayer , and had killed my thirteen knights in a three hours ' battle , and taken me prisoner , sparing my life in order that so strange a curiosity as I was might be exhibited to the wonder and admiration of the king and the court .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 69]: He spoke of me all the time , in the blandest way , as `` this prodigious giant , '' and `` this horrible sky-towering monster , '' and `` this tusked and taloned man-devouring ogre '' , and everybody took in all this bosh in the naivest way , and never smiled or seemed to notice that there was any discrepancy between these watered statistics and me .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 63]: He said that in trying to escape from him I sprang into the top of a tree two hundred cubits high at a single bound , but he dislodged me with a stone the size of a cow , which `` all-to brast '' the most of my bones , and then swore me to appear at Arthur 's court for sentence .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 31]: He ended by condemning me to die at noon on the 21st ; and was so little concerned about it that he stopped to yawn before he named the date .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 57]: I was in a dismal state by this time ; indeed , I was hardly enough in my right mind to keep the run of a dispute that sprung up as to how I had better be killed , the possibility of the killing being doubted by some , because of the enchantment in my clothes .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 13]: And yet it was nothing but an ordinary suit of fifteen-dollar slop-shops .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 44]: Still , I was sane enough to notice this detail , to wit : many of the terms used in the most matter-of-fact way by this great assemblage of the first ladies and gentlemen in the land would have made a Comanche blush .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 11]: Indelicacy is too mild a term to convey the idea .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 113]: However , I had read `` Tom Jones , '' and `` Roderick Random , '' and other books of that kind , and knew that the highest and first ladies and gentlemen in England had remained little or no cleaner in their talk , and in the morals and conduct which such talk implies , clear up to a hundred years ago ; in fact clear into our own nineteenth century -- in which century , broadly speaking , the earliest samples of the real lady and real gentleman discoverable in English history -- or in European history , for that matter -- may be said to have made their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 25]: Suppose Sir Walter , instead of putting the conversations into the mouths of his characters , had allowed the characters to speak for themselves ?
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 23]: We should have had talk from Rebecca and Ivanhoe and the soft lady Rowena which would embarrass a tramp in our day .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 11]: However , to the unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 23]: King Arthur 's people were not aware that they were indecent and I had presence of mind enough not to mention it .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 31]: They were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were mightily relieved , at last , when old Merlin swept the difficulty away for them with a common-sense hint .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 20]: He asked them why they were so dull -- why did n't it occur to them to strip me .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 14]: In half a minute I was as naked as a pair of tongs !
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 18]: And dear , dear , to think of it : I was the only embarrassed person there .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 17]: Everybody discussed me ; and did it as unconcernedly as if I had been a cabbage .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 24]: Queen Guenever was as naively interested as the rest , and said she had never seen anybody with legs just like mine before .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 14]: It was the only compliment I got -- if it was a compliment .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 16]: Finally I was carried off in one direction , and my perilous clothes in another .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 35]: I was shoved into a dark and narrow cell in a dungeon , with some scant remnants for dinner , some moldy straw for a bed , and no end of rats for company .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 21]: CHAPTER V AN INSPIRATION I was so tired that even my fears were not able to keep me awake long .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 18]: When I next came to myself , I seemed to have been asleep a very long time .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 16]: My first thought was , `` Well , what an astonishing dream I 've had !
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 48]: I reckon I 've waked only just in time to keep from being hanged or drowned or burned or something ... I 'll nap again till the whistle blows , and then I 'll go down to the arms factory and have it out with Hercules . ''
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 31]: But just then I heard the harsh music of rusty chains and bolts , a light flashed in my eyes , and that butterfly , Clarence , stood before me !
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 13]: I gasped with surprise ; my breath almost got away from me .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 8]: I said , `` you here yet ?
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 9]: Go along with the rest of the dream !
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 3]: scatter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 20]: But he only laughed , in his light-hearted way , and fell to making fun of my sorry plight .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 23]: `` All right , '' I said resignedly , `` let the dream go on ; I 'm in no hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 6]: `` Prithee what dream ? ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 4]: `` What dream ?
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 37]: Why , the dream that I am in Arthur 's court -- a person who never existed ; and that I am talking to you , who are nothing but a work of the imagination . ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 7]: `` Oh , la , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 13]: and is it a dream that you 're to be burned to-morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 7]: Ho-ho -- answer me that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 9]: The shock that went through me was distressing .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 75]: I now began to reason that my situation was in the last degree serious , dream or no dream ; for I knew by past experience of the lifelike intensity of dreams , that to be burned to death , even in a dream , would be very far from being a jest , and was a thing to be avoided , by any means , fair or foul , that I could contrive .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 32]: So I said beseechingly : `` Ah , Clarence , good boy , only friend I 've got , -- for you _ are _ my friend , are n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 19]: -- do n't fail me ; help me to devise some way of escaping from this place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 7]: `` Now do but hear thyself !
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 2]: Escape ?
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 15]: Why , man , the corridors are in guard and keep of men-at-arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 7]: `` No doubt , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 6]: But how many , Clarence ?
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 7]: Not many , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 5]: `` Full a score .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 8]: One may not hope to escape . ''
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 17]: After a pause -- hesitatingly : `` and there be other reasons -- and weightier . ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 4]: `` Other ones ?
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 5]: What are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 18]: `` Well , they say -- oh , but I dare n't , indeed dare n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 11]: `` Why , poor lad , what is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 5]: Why do you blench ?
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 7]: Why do you tremble so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 10]: `` Oh , in sooth , there is need !
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 32]: I do want to tell you , but -- '' `` Come , come , be brave , be a man -- speak out , there 's a good lad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 77]: He hesitated , pulled one way by desire , the other way by fear ; then he stole to the door and peeped out , listening ; and finally crept close to me and put his mouth to my ear and told me his fearful news in a whisper , and with all the cowering apprehension of one who was venturing upon awful ground and speaking of things whose very mention might be freighted with death .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 38]: `` Merlin , in his malice , has woven a spell about this dungeon , and there bides not the man in these kingdoms that would be desperate enough to essay to cross its lines with you !
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 10]: Now God pity me , I have told it !
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 28]: Ah , be kind to me , be merciful to a poor boy who means thee well ; for an thou betray me I am lost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 24]: I laughed the only really refreshing laugh I had had for some time ; and shouted : `` Merlin has wrought a spell !
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 6]: _ Merlin _ , forsooth !
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 10]: That cheap old humbug , that maundering old ass ?
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 12]: Bosh , pure bosh , the silliest bosh in the world !
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 28]: Why , it does seem to me that of all the childish , idiotic , chuckle-headed , chicken-livered superstitions that ev -- oh , damn Merlin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 26]: But Clarence had slumped to his knees before I had half finished , and he was like to go out of his mind with fright .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 5]: `` Oh , beware !
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 5]: These are awful words !
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 14]: Any moment these walls may crumble upon us if you say such things .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 11]: Oh call them back before it is too late ! ''
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 15]: Now this strange exhibition gave me a good idea and set me to thinking .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 44]: If everybody about here was so honestly and sincerely afraid of Merlin 's pretended magic as Clarence was , certainly a superior man like me ought to be shrewd enough to contrive some way to take advantage of such a state of things .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 11]: I went on thinking , and worked out a plan .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 8]: Then I said : `` Get up .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 10]: Pull yourself together ; look me in the eye .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 8]: Do you know why I laughed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 17]: `` No -- but for our blessed Lady 's sake , do it no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 11]: `` Well , I 'll tell you why I laughed .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 8]: Because I 'm a magician myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 4]: `` Thou ! ''
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 32]: The boy recoiled a step , and caught his breath , for the thing hit him rather sudden ; but the aspect which he took on was very , very respectful .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 36]: I took quick note of that ; it indicated that a humbug did n't need to have a reputation in this asylum ; people stood ready to take him at his word , without that .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 3]: I resumed .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 24]: `` I 've known Merlin seven hundred years , and he -- '' `` Seven hun -- '' `` Do n't interrupt me .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 42]: He has died and come alive again thirteen times , and traveled under a new name every time : Smith , Jones , Robinson , Jackson , Peters , Haskins , Merlin -- a new alias every time he turns up .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 38]: I knew him in Egypt three hundred years ago ; I knew him in India five hundred years ago -- he is always blethering around in my way , everywhere I go ; he makes me tired .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 31]: He do n't amount to shucks , as a magician ; knows some of the old common tricks , but has never got beyond the rudiments , and never will .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 44]: He is well enough for the provinces -- one-night stands and that sort of thing , you know -- but dear me , _ he _ ought n't to set up for an expert -- anyway not where there 's a real artist .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 25]: Now look here , Clarence , I am going to stand your friend , right along , and in return you must be mine .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 9]: I want you to do me a favor .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 73]: I want you to get word to the king that I am a magician myself -- and the Supreme Grand High-yu-Muck-amuck and head of the tribe , at that ; and I want him to be made to understand that I am just quietly arranging a little calamity here that will make the fur fly in these realms if Sir Kay 's project is carried out and any harm comes to me .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 11]: Will you get that to the king for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 15]: The poor boy was in such a state that he could hardly answer me .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 16]: It was pitiful to see a creature so terrified , so unnerved , so demoralized .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 36]: But he promised everything ; and on my side he made me promise over and over again that I would remain his friend , and never turn against him or cast any enchantments upon him .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 21]: Then he worked his way out , staying himself with his hand along the wall , like a sick person .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 13]: Presently this thought occurred to me : how heedless I have been !
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 48]: When the boy gets calm , he will wonder why a great magician like me should have begged a boy like him to help me get out of this place ; he will put this and that together , and will see that I am a humbug .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 21]: I worried over that heedless blunder for an hour , and called myself a great many hard names , meantime .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 45]: But finally it occurred to me all of a sudden that these animals did n't reason ; that _ they _ never put this and that together ; that all their talk showed that they did n't know a discrepancy when they saw it .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 7]: I was at rest , then .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 23]: But as soon as one is at rest , in this world , off he goes on something else to worry about .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 72]: It occurred to me that I had made another blunder : I had sent the boy off to alarm his betters with a threat -- I intending to invent a calamity at my leisure ; now the people who are the readiest and eagerest and willingest to swallow miracles are the very ones who are hungriest to see you perform them ; suppose I should be called on for a sample ?
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 10]: Suppose I should be asked to name my calamity ?
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 17]: Yes , I had made a blunder ; I ought to have invented my calamity first .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 6]: `` What shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 12]: what can I say , to gain a little time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 19]: I was in trouble again ; in the deepest kind of trouble ... `` There 's a footstep !
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 5]: -- they 're coming .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 17]: If I had only just a moment to think ... Good , I 've got it .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 6]: I 'm all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 8]: You see , it was the eclipse .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 42]: It came into my mind in the nick of time , how Columbus , or Cortez , or one of those people , played an eclipse as a saving trump once , on some savages , and I saw my chance .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 33]: I could play it myself , now , and it would n't be any plagiarism , either , because I should get it in nearly a thousand years ahead of those parties .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 31]: Clarence came in , subdued , distressed , and said : `` I hasted the message to our liege the king , and straightway he had me to his presence .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 71]: He was frighted even to the marrow , and was minded to give order for your instant enlargement , and that you be clothed in fine raiment and lodged as befitted one so great ; but then came Merlin and spoiled all ; for he persuaded the king that you are mad , and know not whereof you speak ; and said your threat is but foolishness and idle vaporing .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 27]: They disputed long , but in the end , Merlin , scoffing , said , ` Wherefore hath he not _ named _ his brave calamity ?
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 9]: Verily it is because he can not . '
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 77]: This thrust did in a most sudden sort close the king 's mouth , and he could offer naught to turn the argument ; and so , reluctant , and full loth to do you the discourtesy , he yet prayeth you to consider his perplexed case , as noting how the matter stands , and name the calamity -- if so be you have determined the nature of it and the time of its coming .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 25]: Oh , prithee delay not ; to delay at such a time were to double and treble the perils that already compass thee about .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 11]: Oh , be thou wise -- name the calamity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 29]: I allowed silence to accumulate while I got my impressiveness together , and then said : `` How long have I been shut up in this hole ? ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 11]: `` Ye were shut up when yesterday was well spent .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 9]: It is 9 of the morning now . ''
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 9]: Then I have slept well , sure enough .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 6]: Nine in the morning now !
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 14]: And yet it is the very complexion of midnight , to a shade .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 8]: This is the 20th , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 7]: `` The 20th -- yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 11]: `` And I am to be burned alive to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 4]: The boy shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 6]: `` At what hour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 6]: `` At high noon . ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 13]: `` Now then , I will tell you what to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 133]: I paused , and stood over that cowering lad a whole minute in awful silence ; then , in a voice deep , measured , charged with doom , I began , and rose by dramatically graded stages to my colossal climax , which I delivered in as sublime and noble a way as ever I did such a thing in my life : `` Go back and tell the king that at that hour I will smother the whole world in the dead blackness of midnight ; I will blot out the sun , and he shall never shine again ; the fruits of the earth shall rot for lack of light and warmth , and the peoples of the earth shall famish and die , to the last man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 16]: I had to carry the boy out myself , he sunk into such a collapse .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 12]: I handed him over to the soldiers , and went back .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 18]: CHAPTER VI THE ECLIPSE In the stillness and the darkness , realization soon began to supplement knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 25]: The mere knowledge of a fact is pale ; but when you come to _ realize _ your fact , it takes on color .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 21]: It is all the difference between hearing of a man being stabbed to the heart , and seeing it done .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 43]: In the stillness and the darkness , the knowledge that I was in deadly danger took to itself deeper and deeper meaning all the time ; a something which was realization crept inch by inch through my veins and turned me cold .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 37]: But it is a blessed provision of nature that at times like these , as soon as a man 's mercury has got down to a certain point there comes a revulsion , and he rallies .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 29]: Hope springs up , and cheerfulness along with it , and then he is in good shape to do something for himself , if anything can be done .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 11]: When my rally came , it came with a bound .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 44]: I said to myself that my eclipse would be sure to save me , and make me the greatest man in the kingdom besides ; and straightway my mercury went up to the top of the tube , and my solicitudes all vanished .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 13]: I was as happy a man as there was in the world .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 31]: I was even impatient for to-morrow to come , I so wanted to gather in that great triumph and be the center of all the nation 's wonder and reverence .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 18]: Besides , in a business way it would be the making of me ; I knew that .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 16]: Meantime there was one thing which had got pushed into the background of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 33]: That was the half-conviction that when the nature of my proposed calamity should be reported to those superstitious people , it would have such an effect that they would want to compromise .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 35]: So , by and by when I heard footsteps coming , that thought was recalled to me , and I said to myself , `` As sure as anything , it 's the compromise .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 37]: Well , if it is good , all right , I will accept ; but if it is n't , I mean to stand my ground and play my hand for all it is worth . ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 9]: The door opened , and some men-at-arms appeared .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 10]: The leader said : `` The stake is ready .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 3]: Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 3]: The stake !
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 13]: The strength went out of me , and I almost fell down .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 49]: It is hard to get one 's breath at such a time , such lumps come into one 's throat , and such gaspings ; but as soon as I could speak , I said : `` But this is a mistake -- the execution is to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 10]: `` Order changed ; been set forward a day .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 4]: Haste thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 4]: I was lost .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 7]: There was no help for me .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 66]: I was dazed , stupefied ; I had no command over myself , I only wandered purposely about , like one out of his mind ; so the soldiers took hold of me , and pulled me along with them , out of the cell and along the maze of underground corridors , and finally into the fierce glare of daylight and the upper world .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 41]: As we stepped into the vast enclosed court of the castle I got a shock ; for the first thing I saw was the stake , standing in the center , and near it the piled fagots and a monk .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 24]: On all four sides of the court the seated multitudes rose rank above rank , forming sloping terraces that were rich with color .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 19]: The king and the queen sat in their thrones , the most conspicuous figures there , of course .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 10]: To note all this , occupied but a second .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 27]: The next second Clarence had slipped from some place of concealment and was pouring news into my ear , his eyes beaming with triumph and gladness .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 14]: He said : `` Tis through _ me _ the change was wrought !
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 12]: And main hard have I worked to do it , too .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 34]: But when I revealed to them the calamity in store , and saw how mighty was the terror it did engender , then saw I also that this was the time to strike !
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 59]: Wherefore I diligently pretended , unto this and that and the other one , that your power against the sun could not reach its full until the morrow ; and so if any would save the sun and the world , you must be slain to-day , while your enchantments are but in the weaving and lack potency .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 89]: Odsbodikins , it was but a dull lie , a most indifferent invention , but you should have seen them seize it and swallow it , in the frenzy of their fright , as it were salvation sent from heaven ; and all the while was I laughing in my sleeve the one moment , to see them so cheaply deceived , and glorifying God the next , that He was content to let the meanest of His creatures be His instrument to the saving of thy life .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 8]: Ah how happy has the matter sped !
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 27]: You will not need to do the sun a _ real _ hurt -- ah , forget not that , on your soul forget it not !
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 19]: Only make a little darkness -- only the littlest little darkness , mind , and cease with that .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 5]: It will be sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 48]: They will see that I spoke falsely , -- being ignorant , as they will fancy -- and with the falling of the first shadow of that darkness you shall see them go mad with fear ; and they will set you free and make you great !
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 7]: Go to thy triumph , now !
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 23]: But remember -- ah , good friend , I implore thee remember my supplication , and do the blessed sun no hurt .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 11]: For _ my _ sake , thy true friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 59]: I choked out some words through my grief and misery ; as much as to say I would spare the sun ; for which the lad 's eyes paid me back with such deep and loving gratitude that I had not the heart to tell him his good-hearted foolishness had ruined me and sent me to my death .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 37]: As the soldiers assisted me across the court the stillness was so profound that if I had been blindfold I should have supposed I was in a solitude instead of walled in by four thousand people .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 31]: There was not a movement perceptible in those masses of humanity ; they were as rigid as stone images , and as pale ; and dread sat upon every countenance .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 36]: This hush continued while I was being chained to the stake ; it still continued while the fagots were carefully and tediously piled about my ankles , my knees , my thighs , my body .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 85]: Then there was a pause , and a deeper hush , if possible , and a man knelt down at my feet with a blazing torch ; the multitude strained forward , gazing , and parting slightly from their seats without knowing it ; the monk raised his hands above my head , and his eyes toward the blue sky , and began some words in Latin ; in this attitude he droned on and on , a little while , and then stopped .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 17]: I waited two or three moments ; then looked up ; he was standing there petrified .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 15]: With a common impulse the multitude rose slowly up and stared into the sky .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 16]: I followed their eyes , as sure as guns , there was my eclipse beginning !
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 14]: The life went boiling through my veins ; I was a new man !
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 33]: The rim of black spread slowly into the sun 's disk , my heart beat higher and higher , and still the assemblage and the priest stared into the sky , motionless .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 13]: I knew that this gaze would be turned upon me , next .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 8]: When it was , I was ready .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 23]: I was in one of the most grand attitudes I ever struck , with my arm stretched up pointing to the sun .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 6]: It was a noble effect .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 14]: You could _ see _ the shudder sweep the mass like a wave .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 20]: Two shouts rang out , one close upon the heels of the other : `` Apply the torch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 6]: `` I forbid it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 12]: The one was from Merlin , the other from the king .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 15]: Merlin started from his place -- to apply the torch himself , I judged .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 9]: I said : `` Stay where you are .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 30]: If any man moves -- even the king -- before I give him leave , I will blast him with thunder , I will consume him with lightnings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 16]: The multitude sank meekly into their seats , and I was just expecting they would .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 19]: Merlin hesitated a moment or two , and I was on pins and needles during that little while .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 23]: Then he sat down , and I took a good breath ; for I knew I was master of the situation now .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 24]: The king said : `` Be merciful , fair sir , and essay no further in this perilous matter , lest disaster follow .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 34]: It was reported to us that your powers could not attain unto their full strength until the morrow ; but -- '' `` Your Majesty thinks the report may have been a lie ?
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 8]: It _ was _ a lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 37]: That made an immense effect ; up went appealing hands everywhere , and the king was assailed with a storm of supplications that I might be bought off at any price , and the calamity stayed .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 7]: The king was eager to comply .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 29]: He said : `` Name any terms , reverend sir , even to the halving of my kingdom ; but banish this calamity , spare the sun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 5]: My fortune was made .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 26]: I would have taken him up in a minute , but I could n't stop an eclipse ; the thing was out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 7]: So I asked time to consider .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 16]: The king said : `` How long -- ah , how long , good sir ?
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 13]: Be merciful ; look , it groweth darker , moment by moment .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 5]: Prithee how long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 4]: `` Not long .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 9]: Half an hour -- maybe an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 27]: There were a thousand pathetic protests , but I could n't shorten up any , for I could n't remember how long a total eclipse lasts .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 14]: I was in a puzzled condition , anyway , and wanted to think .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 14]: Something was wrong about that eclipse , and the fact was very unsettling .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 28]: If this was n't the one I was after , how was I to tell whether this was the sixth century , or nothing but a dream ?
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 13]: Dear me , if I could only prove it was the latter !
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 7]: Here was a glad new hope .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 25]: If the boy was right about the date , and this was surely the 20th , it _ was n't _ the sixth century .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 23]: I reached for the monk 's sleeve , in considerable excitement , and asked him what day of the month it was .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 12]: Hang him , he said it was the _ twenty-first _ !
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 9]: It made me turn cold to hear him .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 23]: I begged him not to make any mistake about it ; but he was sure ; he knew it was the 21st .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 10]: So , that feather-headed boy had botched things again !
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 30]: The time of the day was right for the eclipse ; I had seen that for myself , in the beginning , by the dial that was near by .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 24]: Yes , I was in King Arthur 's court , and I might as well make the most out of it I could .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 14]: The darkness was steadily growing , the people becoming more and more distressed .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 12]: I now said : `` I have reflected , Sir King .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 37]: For a lesson , I will let this darkness proceed , and spread night in the world ; but whether I blot out the sun for good , or restore it , shall rest with you .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 72]: These are the terms , to wit : You shall remain king over all your dominions , and receive all the glories and honors that belong to the kingship ; but you shall appoint me your perpetual minister and executive , and give me for my services one per cent of such actual increase of revenue over and above its present amount as I may succeed in creating for the state .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 20]: If I ca n't live on that , I sha 'n' t ask anybody to give me a lift .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 5]: Is it satisfactory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 34]: There was a prodigious roar of applause , and out of the midst of it the king 's voice rose , saying : `` Away with his bonds , and set him free !
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 42]: and do him homage , high and low , rich and poor , for he is become the king 's right hand , is clothed with power and authority , and his seat is upon the highest step of the throne !
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 24]: Now sweep away this creeping night , and bring the light and cheer again , that all the world may bless thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 45]: But I said : `` That a common man should be shamed before the world , is nothing ; but it were dishonor to the _ king _ if any that saw his minister naked should not also see him delivered from his shame .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 24]: If I might ask that my clothes be brought again -- '' `` They are not meet , '' the king broke in .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 14]: `` Fetch raiment of another sort ; clothe him like a prince ! ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 4]: My idea worked .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 37]: I wanted to keep things as they were till the eclipse was total , otherwise they would be trying again to get me to dismiss the darkness , and of course I could n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 12]: Sending for the clothes gained some delay , but not enough .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 8]: So I had to make another excuse .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 61]: I said it would be but natural if the king should change his mind and repent to some extent of what he had done under excitement ; therefore I would let the darkness grow a while , and if at the end of a reasonable time the king had kept his mind the same , the darkness should be dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 21]: Neither the king nor anybody else was satisfied with that arrangement , but I had to stick to my point .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 19]: It grew darker and darker and blacker and blacker , while I struggled with those awkward sixth-century clothes .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 39]: It got to be pitch dark , at last , and the multitude groaned with horror to feel the cold uncanny night breezes fan through the place and see the stars come out and twinkle in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 27]: At last the eclipse was total , and I was very glad of it , but everybody else was in misery ; which was quite natural .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 18]: I said : `` The king , by his silence , still stands to the terms . ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 34]: Then I lifted up my hands -- stood just so a moment -- then I said , with the most awful solemnity : `` Let the enchantment dissolve and pass harmless away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 18]: There was no response , for a moment , in that deep darkness and that graveyard hush .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 55]: But when the silver rim of the sun pushed itself out , a moment or two later , the assemblage broke loose with a vast shout and came pouring down like a deluge to smother me with blessings and gratitude ; and Clarence was not the last of the wash , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 33]: CHAPTER VII MERLIN 'S TOWER Inasmuch as I was now the second personage in the Kingdom , as far as political power and authority were concerned , much was made of me .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 22]: My raiment was of silks and velvets and cloth of gold , and by consequence was very showy , also uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 16]: But habit would soon reconcile me to my clothes ; I was aware of that .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 17]: I was given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle , after the king 's .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 37]: They were aglow with loud-colored silken hangings , but the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet , and they were misfit rushes at that , being not all of one breed .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 12]: As for conveniences , properly speaking , there were n't any .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 20]: I mean _ little _ conveniences ; it is the little conveniences that make the real comfort of life .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 21]: The big oaken chairs , graced with rude carvings , were well enough , but that was the stopping place .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 25]: There was no soap , no matches , no looking-glass -- except a metal one , about as powerful as a pail of water .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 5]: And not a chromo .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 40]: I had been used to chromos for years , and I saw now that without my suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the fabric of my being , and was become a part of me .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 63]: It made me homesick to look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness and remember that in our house in East Hartford , all unpretending as it was , you could n't go into a room but you would find an insurance-chromo , or at least a three-color God-Bless-Our-Home over the door ; and in the parlor we had nine .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 91]: But here , even in my grand room of state , there was n't anything in the nature of a picture except a thing the size of a bedquilt , which was either woven or knitted -LRB- it had darned places in it -RRB- , and nothing in it was the right color or the right shape ; and as for proportions , even Raphael himself could n't have botched them more formidably , after all his practice on those nightmares they call his `` celebrated Hampton Court cartoons . ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 5]: Raphael was a bird .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 43]: We had several of his chromos ; one was his `` Miraculous Draught of Fishes , '' where he puts in a miracle of his own -- puts three men into a canoe which would n't have held a dog without upsetting .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 16]: I always admired to study R. 's art , it was so fresh and unconventional .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 13]: There was n't even a bell or a speaking-tube in the castle .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 34]: I had a great many servants , and those that were on duty lolled in the anteroom ; and when I wanted one of them I had to go and call for him .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 36]: There was no gas , there were no candles ; a bronze dish half full of boarding-house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was the thing that produced what was regarded as light .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 23]: A lot of these hung along the walls and modified the dark , just toned it down enough to make it dismal .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 12]: If you went out at night , your servants carried torches .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 23]: There were no books , pens , paper or ink , and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 21]: It is a little thing -- glass is -- until it is absent , then it becomes a big thing .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 22]: But perhaps the worst of all was , that there was n't any sugar , coffee , tea , or tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 63]: I saw that I was just another Robinson Crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island , with no society but some more or less tame animals , and if I wanted to make life bearable I must do as he did -- invent , contrive , create , reorganize things ; set brain and hand to work , and keep them busy .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 8]: Well , that was in my line .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 17]: One thing troubled me along at first -- the immense interest which people took in me .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 10]: Apparently the whole nation wanted a look at me .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 63]: It soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the British world almost to death ; that while it lasted the whole country , from one end to the other , was in a pitiable state of panic , and the churches , hermitages , and monkeries overflowed with praying and weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world was come .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 82]: Then had followed the news that the producer of this awful event was a stranger , a mighty magician at Arthur 's court ; that he could have blown out the sun like a candle , and was just going to do it when his mercy was purchased , and he then dissolved his enchantments , and was now recognized and honored as the man who had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction and its peoples from extinction .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 50]: Now if you consider that everybody believed that , and not only believed it , but never even dreamed of doubting it , you will easily understand that there was not a person in all Britain that would not have walked fifty miles to get a sight of me .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 27]: Of course I was all the talk -- all other subjects were dropped ; even the king became suddenly a person of minor interest and notoriety .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 21]: Within twenty-four hours the delegations began to arrive , and from that time onward for a fortnight they kept coming .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 10]: The village was crowded , and all the countryside .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 20]: I had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these reverent and awe-stricken multitudes .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 36]: It came to be a great burden , as to time and trouble , but of course it was at the same time compensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center of homage .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 18]: It turned Brer Merlin green with envy and spite , which was a great satisfaction to me .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 17]: But there was one thing I could n't understand -- nobody had asked for an autograph .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 7]: I spoke to Clarence about it .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 3]: By George !
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 10]: I had to explain to him what it was .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 17]: Then he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen priests .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 2]: Land !
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 4]: think of that .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 10]: There was another thing that troubled me a little .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 10]: Those multitudes presently began to agitate for another miracle .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 4]: That was natural .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 79]: To be able to carry back to their far homes the boast that they had seen the man who could command the sun , riding in the heavens , and be obeyed , would make them great in the eyes of their neighbors , and envied by them all ; but to be able to also say they had seen him work a miracle themselves -- why , people would come a distance to see _ them _ .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 8]: The pressure got to be pretty strong .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 26]: There was going to be an eclipse of the moon , and I knew the date and hour , but it was too far away .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 3]: Two years .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 26]: I would have given a good deal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was a big market for it .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 34]: It seemed a great pity to have it wasted so , and come lagging along at a time when a body would n't have any use for it , as like as not .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 47]: If it had been booked for only a month away , I could have sold it short ; but , as matters stood , I could n't seem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good , so I gave up trying .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 18]: Next , Clarence found that old Merlin was making himself busy on the sly among those people .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 30]: He was spreading a report that I was a humbug , and that the reason I did n't accommodate the people with a miracle was because I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 8]: I saw that I must do something .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 7]: I presently thought out a plan .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 19]: By my authority as executive I threw Merlin into prison -- the same cell I had occupied myself .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 64]: Then I gave public notice by herald and trumpet that I should be busy with affairs of state for a fortnight , but about the end of that time I would take a moment 's leisure and blow up Merlin 's stone tower by fires from heaven ; in the meantime , whoso listened to evil reports about me , let him beware .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 39]: Furthermore , I would perform but this one miracle at this time , and no more ; if it failed to satisfy and any murmured , I would turn the murmurers into horses , and make them useful .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 3]: Quiet ensued .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 19]: I took Clarence into my confidence , to a certain degree , and we went to work privately .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 33]: I told him that this was a sort of miracle that required a trifle of preparation , and that it would be sudden death to ever talk about these preparations to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 7]: That made his mouth safe enough .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 25]: Clandestinely we made a few bushels of first-rate blasting powder , and I superintended my armorers while they constructed a lightning-rod and some wires .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 25]: This old stone tower was very massive -- and rather ruinous , too , for it was Roman , and four hundred years old .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 27]: Yes , and handsome , after a rude fashion , and clothed with ivy from base to summit , as with a shirt of scale mail .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 21]: It stood on a lonely eminence , in good view from the castle , and about half a mile away .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 38]: Working by night , we stowed the powder in the tower -- dug stones out , on the inside , and buried the powder in the walls themselves , which were fifteen feet thick at the base .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 14]: We put in a peck at a time , in a dozen places .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 13]: We could have blown up the Tower of London with these charges .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 32]: When the thirteenth night was come we put up our lightning-rod , bedded it in one of the batches of powder , and ran wires from it to the other batches .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 43]: Everybody had shunned that locality from the day of my proclamation , but on the morning of the fourteenth I thought best to warn the people , through the heralds , to keep clear away -- a quarter of a mile away .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 49]: Then added , by command , that at some time during the twenty-four hours I would consummate the miracle , but would first give a brief notice ; by flags on the castle towers if in the daytime , by torch-baskets in the same places if at night .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 54]: Thunder-showers had been tolerably frequent of late , and I was not much afraid of a failure ; still , I should n't have cared for a delay of a day or two ; I should have explained that I was busy with affairs of state yet , and the people must wait .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 26]: Of course , we had a blazing sunny day -- almost the first one without a cloud for three weeks ; things always happen so .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 9]: I kept secluded , and watched the weather .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 39]: Clarence dropped in from time to time and said the public excitement was growing and growing all the time , and the whole country filling up with human masses as far as one could see from the battlements .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 23]: At last the wind sprang up and a cloud appeared -- in the right quarter , too , and just at nightfall .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 24]: For a little while I watched that distant cloud spread and blacken , then I judged it was time for me to appear .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 16]: I ordered the torch-baskets to be lit , and Merlin liberated and sent to me .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 30]: A quarter of an hour later I ascended the parapet and there found the king and the court assembled and gazing off in the darkness toward Merlin 's Tower .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 45]: Already the darkness was so heavy that one could not see far ; these people and the old turrets , being partly in deep shadow and partly in the red glow from the great torch-baskets overhead , made a good deal of a picture .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 7]: Merlin arrived in a gloomy mood .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 31]: I said : `` You wanted to burn me alive when I had not done you any harm , and latterly you have been trying to injure my professional reputation .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 51]: Therefore I am going to call down fire and blow up your tower , but it is only fair to give you a chance ; now if you think you can break my enchantments and ward off the fires , step to the bat , it 's your innings . ''
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 11]: `` I can , fair sir , and I will .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 5]: Doubt it not . ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 44]: He drew an imaginary circle on the stones of the roof , and burnt a pinch of powder in it , which sent up a small cloud of aromatic smoke , whereat everybody fell back and began to cross themselves and get uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 15]: Then he began to mutter and make passes in the air with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 28]: He worked himself up slowly and gradually into a sort of frenzy , and got to thrashing around with his arms like the sails of a windmill .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 49]: By this time the storm had about reached us ; the gusts of wind were flaring the torches and making the shadows swash about , the first heavy drops of rain were falling , the world abroad was black as pitch , the lightning began to wink fitfully .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 11]: Of course , my rod would be loading itself now .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 7]: In fact , things were imminent .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 11]: So I said : `` You have had time enough .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 11]: I have given you every advantage , and not interfered .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 8]: It is plain your magic is weak .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 10]: It is only fair that I begin now . ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 60]: I made about three passes in the air , and then there was an awful crash and that old tower leaped into the sky in chunks , along with a vast volcanic fountain of fire that turned night to noonday , and showed a thousand acres of human beings groveling on the ground in a general collapse of consternation .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 13]: Well , it rained mortar and masonry the rest of the week .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 14]: This was the report ; but probably the facts would have modified it .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 6]: It was an effective miracle .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 7]: The great bothersome temporary population vanished .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 21]: There were a good many thousand tracks in the mud the next morning , but they were all outward bound .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 17]: If I had advertised another miracle I could n't have raised an audience with a sheriff .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 6]: Merlin 's stock was flat .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 19]: The king wanted to stop his wages ; he even wanted to banish him , but I interfered .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 38]: I said he would be useful to work the weather , and attend to small matters like that , and I would give him a lift now and then when his poor little parlor-magic soured on him .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 35]: There was n't a rag of his tower left , but I had the government rebuild it for him , and advised him to take boarders ; but he was too high-toned for that .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 13]: And as for being grateful , he never even said thank you .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 32]: He was a rather hard lot , take him how you might ; but then you could n't fairly expect a man to be sweet that had been set back so .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 28]: CHAPTER VIII THE BOSS To be vested with enormous authority is a fine thing ; but to have the on-looking world consent to it is a finer .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 12]: The tower episode solidified my power , and made it impregnable .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 22]: If any were perchance disposed to be jealous and critical before that , they experienced a change of heart , now .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 21]: There was not any one in the kingdom who would have considered it good judgment to meddle with my matters .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 11]: I was fast getting adjusted to my situation and circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 70]: For a time , I used to wake up , mornings , and smile at my `` dream , '' and listen for the Colt 's factory whistle ; but that sort of thing played itself out , gradually , and at last I was fully able to realize that I was actually living in the sixth century , and in Arthur 's court , not a lunatic asylum .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 37]: After that , I was just as much at home in that century as I could have been in any other ; and as for preference , I would n't have traded it for the twentieth .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 27]: Look at the opportunities here for a man of knowledge , brains , pluck , and enterprise to sail in and grow up with the country .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 43]: The grandest field that ever was ; and all my own ; not a competitor ; not a man who was n't a baby to me in acquirements and capacities ; whereas , what would I amount to in the twentieth century ?
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 31]: I should be foreman of a factory , that is about all ; and could drag a seine down street any day and catch a hundred better men than myself .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 7]: What a jump I had made !
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 22]: I could n't keep from thinking about it , and contemplating it , just as one does who has struck oil .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 34]: There was nothing back of me that could approach it , unless it might be Joseph 's case ; and Joseph 's only approached it , it did n't equal it , quite .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 54]: For it stands to reason that as Joseph 's splendid financial ingenuities advantaged nobody but the king , the general public must have regarded him with a good deal of disfavor , whereas I had done my entire public a kindness in sparing the sun , and was popular by reason of it .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 20]: I was no shadow of a king ; I was the substance ; the king himself was the shadow .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 26]: My power was colossal ; and it was not a mere name , as such things have generally been , it was the genuine article .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 102]: I stood here , at the very spring and source of the second great period of the world 's history ; and could see the trickling stream of that history gather and deepen and broaden , and roll its mighty tides down the far centuries ; and I could note the upspringing of adventurers like myself in the shelter of its long array of thrones : De Montforts , Gavestons , Mortimers , Villierses ; the war-making , campaign-directing wantons of France , and Charles the Second 's scepter-wielding drabs ; but nowhere in the procession was my full-sized fellow visible .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 28]: I was a Unique ; and glad to know that that fact could not be dislodged or challenged for thirteen centuries and a half , for sure .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 11]: Yes , in power I was equal to the king .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 20]: At the same time there was another power that was a trifle stronger than both of us put together .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 5]: That was the Church .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 9]: I do not wish to disguise that fact .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 9]: I could n't , if I wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 21]: But never mind about that , now ; it will show up , in its proper place , later on .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 17]: It did n't cause me any trouble in the beginning -- at least any of consequence .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 13]: Well , it was a curious country , and full of interest .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 4]: And the people !
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 18]: They were the quaintest and simplest and trustingest race ; why , they were nothing but rabbits .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 71]: It was pitiful for a person born in a wholesome free atmosphere to listen to their humble and hearty outpourings of loyalty toward their king and Church and nobility ; as if they had any more occasion to love and honor king and Church and noble than a slave has to love and honor the lash , or a dog has to love and honor the stranger that kicks him !
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 63]: Why , dear me , _ any _ kind of royalty , howsoever modified , _ any _ kind of aristocracy , howsoever pruned , is rightly an insult ; but if you are born and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably never find it out for yourself , and do n't believe it when somebody else tells you .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 74]: It is enough to make a body ashamed of his race to think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones without shadow of right or reason , and the seventh-rate people that have always figured as its aristocracies -- a company of monarchs and nobles who , as a rule , would have achieved only poverty and obscurity if left , like their betters , to their own exertions .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 54]: The most of King Arthur 's British nation were slaves , pure and simple , and bore that name , and wore the iron collar on their necks ; and the rest were slaves in fact , but without the name ; they imagined themselves men and freemen , and called themselves so .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 113]: The truth was , the nation as a body was in the world for one object , and one only : to grovel before king and Church and noble ; to slave for them , sweat blood for them , starve that they might be fed , work that they might play , drink misery to the dregs that they might be happy , go naked that they might wear silks and jewels , pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them , be familiar all their lives with the degrading language and postures of adulation that they might walk in pride and think themselves the gods of this world .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 31]: And for all this , the thanks they got were cuffs and contempt ; and so poor-spirited were they that they took even this sort of attention as an honor .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 14]: Inherited ideas are a curious thing , and interesting to observe and examine .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 12]: I had mine , the king and his people had theirs .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 38]: In both cases they flowed in ruts worn deep by time and habit , and the man who should have proposed to divert them by reason and argument would have had a long contract on his hands .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 80]: For instance , those people had inherited the idea that all men without title and a long pedigree , whether they had great natural gifts and acquirements or had n't , were creatures of no more consideration than so many animals , bugs , insects ; whereas I had inherited the idea that human daws who can consent to masquerade in the peacock-shams of inherited dignities and unearned titles , are of no good but to be laughed at .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 14]: The way I was looked upon was odd , but it was natural .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 22]: You know how the keeper and the public regard the elephant in the menagerie : well , that is the idea .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 63]: They are full of admiration of his vast bulk and his prodigious strength ; they speak with pride of the fact that he can do a hundred marvels which are far and away beyond their own powers ; and they speak with the same pride of the fact that in his wrath he is able to drive a thousand men before him .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 11]: But does that make him one of _ them _ ?
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 14]: No ; the raggedest tramp in the pit would smile at the idea .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 22]: He could n't comprehend it ; could n't take it in ; could n't in any remote way conceive of it .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 35]: Well , to the king , the nobles , and all the nation , down to the very slaves and tramps , I was just that kind of an elephant , and nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 18]: I was admired , also feared ; but it was as an animal is admired and feared .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 16]: The animal is not reverenced , neither was I ; I was not even respected .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 64]: I had no pedigree , no inherited title ; so in the king 's and nobles ' eyes I was mere dirt ; the people regarded me with wonder and awe , but there was no reverence mixed with it ; through the force of inherited ideas they were not able to conceive of anything being entitled to that except pedigree and lordship .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 15]: There you see the hand of that awful power , the Roman Catholic Church .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 19]: In two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 53]: Before the day of the Church 's supremacy in the world , men were men , and held their heads up , and had a man 's pride and spirit and independence ; and what of greatness and position a person got , he got mainly by achievement , not by birth .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 151]: But then the Church came to the front , with an axe to grind ; and she was wise , subtle , and knew more than one way to skin a cat -- or a nation ; she invented `` divine right of kings , '' and propped it all around , brick by brick , with the Beatitudes -- wrenching them from their good purpose to make them fortify an evil one ; she preached -LRB- to the commoner -RRB- humility , obedience to superiors , the beauty of self-sacrifice ; she preached -LRB- to the commoner -RRB- meekness under insult ; preached -LRB- still to the commoner , always to the commoner -RRB- patience , meanness of spirit , non-resistance under oppression ; and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies , and taught all the Christian populations of the earth to bow down to them and worship them .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 88]: Even down to my birth-century that poison was still in the blood of Christendom , and the best of English commoners was still content to see his inferiors impudently continuing to hold a number of positions , such as lordships and the throne , to which the grotesque laws of his country did not allow him to aspire ; in fact , he was not merely contented with this strange condition of things , he was even able to persuade himself that he was proud of it .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 24]: It seems to show that there is n't anything you ca n't stand , if you are only born and bred to it .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 42]: Of course that taint , that reverence for rank and title , had been in our American blood , too -- I know that ; but when I left America it had disappeared -- at least to all intents and purposes .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 12]: The remnant of it was restricted to the dudes and dudesses .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 24]: When a disease has worked its way down to that level , it may fairly be said to be out of the system .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 13]: But to return to my anomalous position in King Arthur 's kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 85]: Here I was , a giant among pigmies , a man among children , a master intelligence among intellectual moles : by all rational measurement the one and only actually great man in that whole British world ; and yet there and then , just as in the remote England of my birth-time , the sheep-witted earl who could claim long descent from a king 's leman , acquired at second-hand from the slums of London , was a better man than I was .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 38]: Such a personage was fawned upon in Arthur 's realm and reverently looked up to by everybody , even though his dispositions were as mean as his intelligence , and his morals as base as his lineage .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 21]: There were times when _ he _ could sit down in the king 's presence , but I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 34]: I could have got a title easily enough , and that would have raised me a large step in everybody 's eyes ; even in the king 's , the giver of it .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 17]: But I did n't ask for it ; and I declined it when it was offered .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 42]: I could n't have enjoyed such a thing with my notions ; and it would n't have been fair , anyway , because as far back as I could go , our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 67]: I could n't have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proud and set-up over any title except one that should come from the nation itself , the only legitimate source ; and such an one I hoped to win ; and in the course of years of honest and honorable endeavor , I did win it and did wear it with a high and clean pride .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 59]: This title fell casually from the lips of a blacksmith , one day , in a village , was caught up as a happy thought and tossed from mouth to mouth with a laugh and an affirmative vote ; in ten days it had swept the kingdom , and was become as familiar as the king 's name .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 31]: I was never known by any other designation afterward , whether in the nation 's talk or in grave debate upon matters of state at the council-board of the sovereign .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 13]: This title , translated into modern speech , would be THE BOSS .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 5]: Elected by the nation .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 4]: That suited me .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 8]: And it was a pretty high title .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 14]: There were very few THE 'S , and I was one of them .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 24]: If you spoke of the duke , or the earl , or the bishop , how could anybody tell which one you meant ?
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 18]: But if you spoke of The King or The Queen or The Boss , it was different .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 48]: Well , I liked the king , and as king I respected him -- respected the office ; at least respected it as much as I was capable of respecting any unearned supremacy ; but as MEN I looked down upon him and his nobles -- privately .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 39]: And he and they liked me , and respected my office ; but as an animal , without birth or sham title , they looked down upon me -- and were not particularly private about it , either .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 34]: I did n't charge for my opinion about them , and they did n't charge for their opinion about me : the account was square , the books balanced , everybody was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 38]: CHAPTER IX THE TOURNAMENT They were always having grand tournaments there at Camelot ; and very stirring and picturesque and ridiculous human bull-fights they were , too , but just a little wearisome to the practical mind .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 67]: However , I was generally on hand -- for two reasons : a man must not hold himself aloof from the things which his friends and his community have at heart if he would be liked -- especially as a statesman ; and both as business man and statesman I wanted to study the tournament and see if I could n't invent an improvement on it .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 72]: That reminds me to remark , in passing , that the very first official thing I did , in my administration -- and it was on the very first day of it , too -- was to start a patent office ; for I knew that a country without a patent office and good patent laws was just a crab , and could n't travel any way but sideways or backways .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 62]: Things ran along , a tournament nearly every week ; and now and then the boys used to want me to take a hand -- I mean Sir Launcelot and the rest -- but I said I would by and by ; no hurry yet , and too much government machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a-going .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 34]: We had one tournament which was continued from day to day during more than a week , and as many as five hundred knights took part in it , from first to last .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 5]: They were weeks gathering .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 36]: They came on horseback from everywhere ; from the very ends of the country , and even from beyond the sea ; and many brought ladies , and all brought squires and troops of servants .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 42]: It was a most gaudy and gorgeous crowd , as to costumery , and very characteristic of the country and the time , in the way of high animal spirits , innocent indecencies of language , and happy-hearted indifference to morals .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 27]: It was fight or look on , all day and every day ; and sing , gamble , dance , carouse half the night every night .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 8]: They had a most noble good time .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 6]: You never saw such people .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 98]: Those banks of beautiful ladies , shining in their barbaric splendors , would see a knight sprawl from his horse in the lists with a lanceshaft the thickness of your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting , and instead of fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each other for a better view ; only sometimes one would dive into her handkerchief , and look ostentatiously broken-hearted , and then you could lay two to one that there was a scandal there somewhere and she was afraid the public had n't found it out .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 41]: The noise at night would have been annoying to me ordinarily , but I did n't mind it in the present circumstances , because it kept me from hearing the quacks detaching legs and arms from the day 's cripples .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 24]: They ruined an uncommon good old cross-cut saw for me , and broke the saw-buck , too , but I let it pass .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 30]: And as for my axe -- well , I made up my mind that the next time I lent an axe to a surgeon I would pick my century .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 57]: I not only watched this tournament from day to day , but detailed an intelligent priest from my Department of Public Morals and Agriculture , and ordered him to report it ; for it was my purpose by and by , when I should have gotten the people along far enough , to start a newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 31]: The first thing you want in a new country , is a patent office ; then work up your school system ; and after that , out with your paper .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 33]: A newspaper has its faults , and plenty of them , but no matter , it 's hark from the tomb for a dead nation , and do n't you forget it .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 16]: You ca n't resurrect a dead nation without it ; there is n't any way .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 35]: So I wanted to sample things , and be finding out what sort of reporter-material I might be able to rake together out of the sixth century when I should come to need it .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 10]: Well , the priest did very well , considering .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 95]: He got in all the details , and that is a good thing in a local item : you see , he had kept books for the undertaker-department of his church when he was younger , and there , you know , the money 's in the details ; the more details , the more swag : bearers , mutes , candles , prayers -- everything counts ; and if the bereaved do n't buy prayers enough you mark up your candles with a forked pencil , and your bill shows up all right .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 65]: And he had a good knack at getting in the complimentary thing here and there about a knight that was likely to advertise -- no , I mean a knight that had influence ; and he also had a neat gift of exaggeration , for in his time he had kept door for a pious hermit who lived in a sty and worked miracles .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 58]: Of course this novice 's report lacked whoop and crash and lurid description , and therefore wanted the true ring ; but its antique wording was quaint and sweet and simple , and full of the fragrances and flavors of the time , and these little merits made up in a measure for its more important lacks .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 42]: Here is an extract from it : Then Sir Brian de les Isles and Grummore Grummorsum , knights of the castle , encountered with Sir Aglovale and Sir Tor , and Sir Tor smote down Sir Grummore Grummorsum to the earth .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 90]: Then came Sir Carados of the dolorous tower , and Sir Turquine , knights of the castle , and there encountered with them Sir Percivale de Galis and Sir Lamorak de Galis , that were two brethren , and there encountered Sir Percivale with Sir Carados , and either brake their spears unto their hands , and then Sir Turquine with Sir Lamorak , and either of them smote down other , horse and all , to the earth , and either parties rescued other and horsed them again .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 36]: And Sir Arnold , and Sir Gauter , knights of the castle , encountered with Sir Brandiles and Sir Kay , and these four knights encountered mightily , and brake their spears to their hands .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 33]: Then came Sir Pertolope from the castle , and there encountered with him Sir Lionel , and there Sir Pertolope the green knight smote down Sir Lionel , brother to Sir Launcelot .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 17]: All this was marked by noble heralds , who bare him best , and their names .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 21]: Then Sir Bleobaris brake his spear upon Sir Gareth , but of that stroke Sir Bleobaris fell to the earth .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 22]: When Sir Galihodin saw that , he bad Sir Gareth keep him , and Sir Gareth smote him to the earth .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 53]: Then Sir Galihud gat a spear to avenge his brother , and in the same wise Sir Gareth served him , and Sir Dinadan and his brother La Cote Male Taile , and Sir Sagramore le Disirous , and Sir Dodinas le Savage ; all these he bare down with one spear .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 36]: When King Aswisance of Ireland saw Sir Gareth fare so he marvelled what he might be , that one time seemed green , and another time , at his again coming , he seemed blue .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 30]: And thus at every course that he rode to and fro he changed his color , so that there might neither king nor knight have ready cognizance of him .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 26]: Then Sir Agwisance the King of Ireland encountered with Sir Gareth , and there Sir Gareth smote him from his horse , saddle and all .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 18]: And then came King Carados of Scotland , and Sir Gareth smote him down horse and man .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 15]: And in the same wise he served King Uriens of the land of Gore .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 21]: And then there came in Sir Bagdemagus , and Sir Gareth smote him down horse and man to the earth .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 15]: And Bagdemagus 's son Meliganus brake a spear upon Sir Gareth mightily and knightly .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 33]: And then Sir Galahault the noble prince cried on high , Knight with the many colors , well hast thou justed ; now make thee ready that I may just with thee .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 58]: Sir Gareth heard him , and he gat a great spear , and so they encountered together , and there the prince brake his spear ; but Sir Gareth smote him upon the left side of the helm , that he reeled here and there , and he had fallen down had not his men recovered him .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 17]: Truly , said King Arthur , that knight with the many colors is a good knight .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 18]: Wherefore the king called unto him Sir Launcelot , and prayed him to encounter with that knight .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 150]: Sir , said Launcelot , I may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at this time , for he hath had travail enough this day , and when a good knight doth so well upon some day , it is no good knight 's part to let him of his worship , and , namely , when he seeth a knight hath done so great labour ; for peradventure , said Sir Launcelot , his quarrel is here this day , and peradventure he is best beloved with this lady of all that be here , for I see well he paineth himself and enforceth him to do great deeds , and therefore , said Sir Launcelot , as for me , this day he shall have the honour ; though it lay in my power to put him from it , I would not .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 23]: There was an unpleasant little episode that day , which for reasons of state I struck out of my priest 's report .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 15]: You will have noticed that Garry was doing some great fighting in the engagement .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 9]: When I say Garry I mean Sir Gareth .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 26]: Garry was my private pet name for him ; it suggests that I had a deep affection for him , and that was the case .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 38]: But it was a private pet name only , and never spoken aloud to any one , much less to him ; being a noble , he would not have endured a familiarity like that from me .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 21]: Well , to proceed : I sat in the private box set apart for me as the king 's minister .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 77]: While Sir Dinadan was waiting for his turn to enter the lists , he came in there and sat down and began to talk ; for he was always making up to me , because I was a stranger and he liked to have a fresh market for his jokes , the most of them having reached that stage of wear where the teller has to do the laughing himself while the other person looks sick .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 65]: I had always responded to his efforts as well as I could , and felt a very deep and real kindness for him , too , for the reason that if by malice of fate he knew the one particular anecdote which I had heard oftenest and had most hated and most loathed all my life , he had at least spared it me .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 27]: It was one which I had heard attributed to every humorous person who had ever stood on American soil , from Columbus down to Artemus Ward .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 73]: It was about a humorous lecturer who flooded an ignorant audience with the killingest jokes for an hour and never got a laugh ; and then when he was leaving , some gray simpletons wrung him gratefully by the hand and said it had been the funniest thing they had ever heard , and `` it was all they could do to keep from laughin ' right out in meetin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 42]: That anecdote never saw the day that it was worth the telling ; and yet I had sat under the telling of it hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of times , and cried and cursed all the way through .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 62]: Then who can hope to know what my feelings were , to hear this armor-plated ass start in on it again , in the murky twilight of tradition , before the dawn of history , while even Lactantius might be referred to as `` the late Lactantius , '' and the Crusades would n't be born for five hundred years yet ?
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 35]: Just as he finished , the call-boy came ; so , haw-hawing like a demon , he went rattling and clanking out like a crate of loose castings , and I knew nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 46]: It was some minutes before I came to , and then I opened my eyes just in time to see Sir Gareth fetch him an awful welt , and I unconsciously out with the prayer , `` I hope to gracious he 's killed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 48]: But by ill-luck , before I had got half through with the words , Sir Gareth crashed into Sir Sagramor le Desirous and sent him thundering over his horse 's crupper , and Sir Sagramor caught my remark and thought I meant it for _ him _ .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 22]: Well , whenever one of those people got a thing into his head , there was no getting it out again .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 15]: I knew that , so I saved my breath , and offered no explanations .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 48]: As soon as Sir Sagramor got well , he notified me that there was a little account to settle between us , and he named a day three or four years in the future ; place of settlement , the lists where the offense had been given .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 11]: I said I would be ready when he got back .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 11]: You see , he was going for the Holy Grail .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 14]: The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail now and then .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 8]: It was a several years ' cruise .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 62]: They always put in the long absence snooping around , in the most conscientious way , though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was , and I do n't think any of them actually expected to find it , or would have known what to do with it if he _ had _ run across it .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 22]: You see , it was just the Northwest Passage of that day , as you may say ; that was all .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 22]: Every year expeditions went out holy grailing , and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for _ them _ .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 12]: There was worlds of reputation in it , but no money .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 12]: Why , they actually wanted _ me _ to put in !
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 6]: Well , I should smile .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 31]: CHAPTER X BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION The Round Table soon heard of the challenge , and of course it was a good deal discussed , for such things interested the boys .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 38]: The king thought I ought now to set forth in quest of adventures , so that I might gain renown and be the more worthy to meet Sir Sagramor when the several years should have rolled away .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 100]: I excused myself for the present ; I said it would take me three or four years yet to get things well fixed up and going smoothly ; then I should be ready ; all the chances were that at the end of that time Sir Sagramor would still be out grailing , so no valuable time would be lost by the postponement ; I should then have been in office six or seven years , and I believed my system and machinery would be so well developed that I could take a holiday without its working any harm .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 12]: I was pretty well satisfied with what I had already accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 34]: In various quiet nooks and corners I had the beginnings of all sorts of industries under way -- nuclei of future vast factories , the iron and steel missionaries of my future civilization .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 28]: In these were gathered together the brightest young minds I could find , and I kept agents out raking the country for more , all the time .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 21]: I was training a crowd of ignorant folk into experts -- experts in every sort of handiwork and scientific calling .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 38]: These nurseries of mine went smoothly and privately along undisturbed in their obscure country retreats , for nobody was allowed to come into their precincts without a special permit -- for I was afraid of the Church .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 50]: I had started a teacher-factory and a lot of Sunday-schools the first thing ; as a result , I now had an admirable system of graded schools in full blast in those places , and also a complete variety of Protestant congregations all in a prosperous and growing condition .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 20]: Everybody could be any kind of a Christian he wanted to ; there was perfect freedom in that matter .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 23]: But I confined public religious teaching to the churches and the Sunday-schools , permitting nothing of it in my other educational buildings .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 151]: I could have given my own sect the preference and made everybody a Presbyterian without any trouble , but that would have been to affront a law of human nature : spiritual wants and instincts are as various in the human family as are physical appetites , complexions , and features , and a man is only at his best , morally , when he is equipped with the religious garment whose color and shape and size most nicely accommodate themselves to the spiritual complexion , angularities , and stature of the individual who wears it ; and , besides , I was afraid of a united Church ; it makes a mighty power , the mightiest conceivable , and then when it by and by gets into selfish hands , as it is always bound to do , it means death to human liberty and paralysis to human thought .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 15]: All mines were royal property , and there were a good many of them .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 55]: They had formerly been worked as savages always work mines -- holes grubbed in the earth and the mineral brought up in sacks of hide by hand , at the rate of a ton a day ; but I had begun to put the mining on a scientific basis as early as I could .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 16]: Yes , I had made pretty handsome progress when Sir Sagramor 's challenge struck me .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 8]: Four years rolled by -- and then !
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 11]: Well , you would never imagine it in the world .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 13]: Unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in safe hands .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 11]: The despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect government .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 37]: An earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect earthly government , if the conditions were the same , namely , the despot the perfectest individual of the human race , and his lease of life perpetual .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 42]: But as a perishable perfect man must die , and leave his despotism in the hands of an imperfect successor , an earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of government , it is the worst form that is possible .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 18]: My works showed what a despot could do with the resources of a kingdom at his command .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 20]: Unsuspected by this dark land , I had the civilization of the nineteenth century booming under its very nose !
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 35]: It was fenced away from the public view , but there it was , a gigantic and unassailable fact -- and to be heard from , yet , if I lived and had luck .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 40]: There it was , as sure a fact and as substantial a fact as any serene volcano , standing innocent with its smokeless summit in the blue sky and giving no sign of the rising hell in its bowels .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 53]: My schools and churches were children four years before ; they were grown-up now ; my shops of that day were vast factories now ; where I had a dozen trained men then , I had a thousand now ; where I had one brilliant expert then , I had fifty now .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 29]: I stood with my hand on the cock , so to speak , ready to turn it on and flood the midnight world with light at any moment .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 14]: But I was not going to do the thing in that sudden way .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 6]: It was not my policy .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 28]: The people could not have stood it ; and , moreover , I should have had the Established Roman Catholic Church on my back in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 11]: No , I had been going cautiously all the while .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 49]: I had had confidential agents trickling through the country some time , whose office was to undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees , and to gnaw a little at this and that and the other superstition , and so prepare the way gradually for a better order of things .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 19]: I was turning on my light one-candle-power at a time , and meant to continue to do so .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 18]: I had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom , and they were doing very well .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 22]: I meant to work this racket more and more , as time wore on , if nothing occurred to frighten me .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 14]: One of my deepest secrets was my West Point -- my military academy .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 27]: I kept that most jealously out of sight ; and I did the same with my naval academy which I had established at a remote seaport .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 7]: Both were prospering to my satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 15]: Clarence was twenty-two now , and was my head executive , my right hand .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 23]: He was a darling ; he was equal to anything ; there was n't anything he could n't turn his hand to .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 39]: Of late I had been training him for journalism , for the time seemed about right for a start in the newspaper line ; nothing big , but just a small weekly for experimental circulation in my civilization-nurseries .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 18]: He took to it like a duck ; there was an editor concealed in him , sure .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 17]: Already he had doubled himself in one way ; he talked sixth century and wrote nineteenth .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 37]: His journalistic style was climbing , steadily ; it was already up to the back settlement Alabama mark , and could n't be told from the editorial output of that region either by matter or flavor .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 10]: We had another large departure on hand , too .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 15]: This was a telegraph and a telephone ; our first venture in this line .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 23]: These wires were for private service only , as yet , and must be kept private until a riper day should come .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 15]: We had a gang of men on the road , working mainly by night .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 22]: They were stringing ground wires ; we were afraid to put up poles , for they would attract too much inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 26]: Ground wires were good enough , in both instances , for my wires were protected by an insulation of my own invention which was perfect .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 31]: My men had orders to strike across country , avoiding roads , and establishing connection with any considerable towns whose lights betrayed their presence , and leaving experts in charge .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 46]: Nobody could tell you how to find any place in the kingdom , for nobody ever went intentionally to any place , but only struck it by accident in his wanderings , and then generally left it without thinking to inquire what its name was .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 28]: At one time and another we had sent out topographical expeditions to survey and map the kingdom , but the priests had always interfered and raised trouble .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 22]: So we had given the thing up , for the present ; it would be poor wisdom to antagonize the Church .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 27]: As for the general condition of the country , it was as it had been when I arrived in it , to all intents and purposes .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 17]: I had made changes , but they were necessarily slight , and they were not noticeable .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 21]: Thus far , I had not even meddled with taxation , outside of the taxes which provided the royal revenues .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 16]: I had systematized those , and put the service on an effective and righteous basis .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 44]: As a result , these revenues were already quadrupled , and yet the burden was so much more equably distributed than before , that all the kingdom felt a sense of relief , and the praises of my administration were hearty and general .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 26]: Personally , I struck an interruption , now , but I did not mind it , it could not have happened at a better time .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 19]: Earlier it could have annoyed me , but now everything was in good hands and swimming right along .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 29]: The king had reminded me several times , of late , that the postponement I had asked for , four years before , had about run out now .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 62]: It was a hint that I ought to be starting out to seek adventures and get up a reputation of a size to make me worthy of the honor of breaking a lance with Sir Sagramor , who was still out grailing , but was being hunted for by various relief expeditions , and might be found any year , now .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 17]: So you see I was expecting this interruption ; it did not take me by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 25]: CHAPTER XI THE YANKEE IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURES There never was such a country for wandering liars ; and they were of both sexes .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 48]: Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving ; and generally loaded with a tale about some princess or other wanting help to get her out of some far-away castle where she was held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel , usually a giant .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 52]: Now you would think that the first thing the king would do after listening to such a novelette from an entire stranger , would be to ask for credentials -- yes , and a pointer or two as to locality of castle , best route to it , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 14]: But nobody ever thought of so simple and common-sense a thing at that .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 22]: No , everybody swallowed these people 's lies whole , and never asked a question of any sort or about anything .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 35]: Well , one day when I was not around , one of these people came along -- it was a she one , this time -- and told a tale of the usual pattern .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 74]: Her mistress was a captive in a vast and gloomy castle , along with forty-four other young and beautiful girls , pretty much all of them princesses ; they had been languishing in that cruel captivity for twenty-six years ; the masters of the castle were three stupendous brothers , each with four arms and one eye -- the eye in the center of the forehead , and as big as a fruit .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 12]: Sort of fruit not mentioned ; their usual slovenliness in statistics .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 5]: Would you believe it ?
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 17]: The king and the whole Round Table were in raptures over this preposterous opportunity for adventure .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 37]: Every knight of the Table jumped for the chance , and begged for it ; but to their vexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me , who had not asked for it at all .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 15]: By an effort , I contained my joy when Clarence brought me the news .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 9]: But he -- he could not contain his .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 31]: His mouth gushed delight and gratitude in a steady discharge -- delight in my good fortune , gratitude to the king for this splendid mark of his favor for me .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 23]: He could keep neither his legs nor his body still , but pirouetted about the place in an airy ecstasy of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 42]: On my side , I could have cursed the kindness that conferred upon me this benefaction , but I kept my vexation under the surface for policy 's sake , and did what I could to let on to be glad .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 10]: Indeed , I _ said _ I was glad .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 21]: And in a way it was true ; I was as glad as a person is when he is scalped .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 30]: Well , one must make the best of things , and not waste time with useless fretting , but get down to business and see what can be done .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 30]: In all lies there is wheat among the chaff ; I must get at the wheat in this case : so I sent for the girl and she came .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 32]: She was a comely enough creature , and soft and modest , but , if signs went for anything , she did n't know as much as a lady 's watch .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 16]: I said : `` My dear , have you been questioned as to particulars ? ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 6]: She said she had n't .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 30]: `` Well , I did n't expect you had , but I thought I would ask , to make sure ; it 's the way I 've been raised .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 26]: Now you must n't take it unkindly if I remind you that as we do n't know you , we must go a little slow .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 27]: You may be all right , of course , and we 'll hope that you are ; but to take it for granted is n't business .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 6]: _ You _ understand that .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 23]: I 'm obliged to ask you a few questions ; just answer up fair and square , and do n't be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 12]: Where do you live , when you are at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 11]: `` In the land of Moder , fair sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 5]: `` Land of Moder .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 9]: I do n't remember hearing of it before .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 4]: Parents living ? ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 31]: `` As to that , I know not if they be yet on live , sith it is many years that I have lain shut up in the castle . ''
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 7]: `` Your name , please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 15]: `` I hight the Demoiselle Alisande la Carteloise , an it please you . ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 12]: `` Do you know anybody here who can identify you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 20]: `` That were not likely , fair lord , I being come hither now for the first time . ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 20]: `` Have you brought any letters -- any documents -- any proofs that you are trustworthy and truthful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 12]: `` Of a surety , no ; and wherefore should I ?
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 16]: Have I not a tongue , and can not I say all that myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 22]: `` But _ your _ saying it , you know , and somebody else 's saying it , is different . ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 3]: `` Different ?
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 5]: How might that be ?
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 9]: I fear me I do not understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 7]: `` Do n't _ understand _ ?
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 26]: Land of -- why , you see -- you see -- why , great Scott , ca n't you understand a little thing like that ?
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 21]: Ca n't you understand the difference between your -- _ why _ do you look so innocent and idiotic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 16]: In truth I know not , but an it were the will of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 15]: `` Yes , yes , I reckon that 's about the size of it .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 11]: Do n't mind my seeming excited ; I 'm not .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 6]: Let us change the subject .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 30]: Now as to this castle , with forty-five princesses in it , and three ogres at the head of it , tell me -- where is this harem ? ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 4]: `` Harem ? ''
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 15]: `` The _ castle _ , you understand ; where is the castle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 25]: `` Oh , as to that , it is great , and strong , and well beseen , and lieth in a far country .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 9]: Yes , it is many leagues . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 6]: _ How _ many ? ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 112]: `` Ah , fair sir , it were woundily hard to tell , they are so many , and do so lap the one upon the other , and being made all in the same image and tincted with the same color , one may not know the one league from its fellow , nor how to count them except they be taken apart , and ye wit well it were God 's work to do that , being not within man 's capacity ; for ye will note -- '' `` Hold on , hold on , never mind about the distance ; _ whereabouts _ does the castle lie ?
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 8]: What 's the direction from here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 286]: `` Ah , please you sir , it hath no direction from here ; by reason that the road lieth not straight , but turneth evermore ; wherefore the direction of its place abideth not , but is some time under the one sky and anon under another , whereso if ye be minded that it is in the east , and wend thitherward , ye shall observe that the way of the road doth yet again turn upon itself by the space of half a circle , and this marvel happing again and yet again and still again , it will grieve you that you had thought by vanities of the mind to thwart and bring to naught the will of Him that giveth not a castle a direction from a place except it pleaseth Him , and if it please Him not , will the rather that even all castles and all directions thereunto vanish out of the earth , leaving the places wherein they tarried desolate and vacant , so warning His creatures that where He will He will , and where He will not He -- '' `` Oh , that 's all right , that 's all right , give us a rest ; never mind about the direction , _ hang _ the direction -- I beg pardon , I beg a thousand pardons , I am not well to-day ; pay no attention when I soliloquize , it is an old habit , an old , bad habit , and hard to get rid of when one 's digestion is all disordered with eating food that was raised forever and ever before he was born ; good land !
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 16]: a man ca n't keep his functions regular on spring chickens thirteen hundred years old .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 26]: But come -- never mind about that ; let 's -- have you got such a thing as a map of that region about you ?
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 51]: Now a good map -- '' `` Is it peradventure that manner of thing which of late the unbelievers have brought from over the great seas , which , being boiled in oil , and an onion and salt added thereto , doth -- '' `` What , a map ?
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 6]: What are you talking about ?
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 9]: Do n't you know what a map is ?
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 30]: There , there , never mind , do n't explain , I hate explanations ; they fog a thing up so that you ca n't tell anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 15]: Run along , dear ; good-day ; show her the way , Clarence . ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 22]: Oh , well , it was reasonably plain , now , why these donkeys did n't prospect these liars for details .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 47]: It may be that this girl had a fact in her somewhere , but I do n't believe you could have sluiced it out with a hydraulic ; nor got it with the earlier forms of blasting , even ; it was a case for dynamite .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 31]: Why , she was a perfect ass ; and yet the king and his knights had listened to her as if she had been a leaf out of the gospel .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 9]: It kind of sizes up the whole party .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 43]: And think of the simple ways of this court : this wandering wench had n't any more trouble to get access to the king in his palace than she would have had to get into the poorhouse in my day and country .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 36]: In fact , he was glad to see her , glad to hear her tale ; with that adventure of hers to offer , she was as welcome as a corpse is to a coroner .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 12]: Just as I was ending-up these reflections , Clarence came back .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 30]: I remarked upon the barren result of my efforts with the girl ; had n't got hold of a single point that could help me to find the castle .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 35]: The youth looked a little surprised , or puzzled , or something , and intimated that he had been wondering to himself what I had wanted to ask the girl all those questions for .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 20]: `` Why , great guns , '' I said , `` do n't I want to find the castle ?
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 10]: And how else would I go about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 16]: `` La , sweet your worship , one may lightly answer that , I ween .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 6]: She will go with thee .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 4]: They always do .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 7]: She will ride with thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 5]: `` Ride with me ?
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 3]: Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 8]: `` But of a truth she will .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 6]: She will ride with thee .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 5]: Thou shalt see . ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 24]: She browse around the hills and scour the woods with me -- alone -- and I as good as engaged to be married ?
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 6]: Why , it 's scandalous .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 7]: Think how it would look . ''
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 10]: My , the dear face that rose before me !
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 12]: The boy was eager to know all about this tender matter .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 16]: I swore him to secrecy and then whispered her name -- `` Puss Flanagan . ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 13]: He looked disappointed , and said he did n't remember the countess .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 14]: How natural it was for the little courtier to give her a rank .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 7]: He asked me where she lived .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 35]: `` In East Har -- '' I came to myself and stopped , a little confused ; then I said , `` Never mind , now ; I 'll tell you some time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 6]: And might he see her ?
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 9]: Would I let him see her some day ?
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 25]: It was but a little thing to promise -- thirteen hundred years or so -- and he so eager ; so I said Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 10]: But I sighed ; I could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 16]: And yet there was no sense in sighing , for she was n't born yet .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 22]: But that is the way we are made : we do n't reason , where we feel ; we just feel .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 66]: My expedition was all the talk that day and that night , and the boys were very good to me , and made much of me , and seemed to have forgotten their vexation and disappointment , and come to be as anxious for me to hive those ogres and set those ripe old virgins loose as if it were themselves that had the contract .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 17]: Well , they _ were _ good children -- but just children , that is all .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 46]: And they gave me no end of points about how to scout for giants , and how to scoop them in ; and they told me all sorts of charms against enchantments , and gave me salves and other rubbish to put on my wounds .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 86]: But it never occurred to one of them to reflect that if I was such a wonderful necromancer as I was pretending to be , I ought not to need salves or instructions , or charms against enchantments , and , least of all , arms and armor , on a foray of any kind -- even against fire-spouting dragons , and devils hot from perdition , let alone such poor adversaries as these I was after , these commonplace ogres of the back settlements .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 39]: I was to have an early breakfast , and start at dawn , for that was the usual way ; but I had the demon 's own time with my armor , and this delayed me a little .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 14]: It is troublesome to get into , and there is so much detail .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 147]: First you wrap a layer or two of blanket around your body , for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold iron ; then you put on your sleeves and shirt of chain mail -- these are made of small steel links woven together , and they form a fabric so flexible that if you toss your shirt onto the floor , it slumps into a pile like a peck of wet fish-net ; it is very heavy and is nearly the uncomfortablest material in the world for a night shirt , yet plenty used it for that -- tax collectors , and reformers , and one-horse kings with a defective title , and those sorts of people ; then you put on your shoes -- flat-boats roofed over with interleaving bands of steel -- and screw your clumsy spurs into the heels .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 149]: Next you buckle your greaves on your legs , and your cuisses on your thighs ; then come your backplate and your breastplate , and you begin to feel crowded ; then you hitch onto the breastplate the half-petticoat of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs down in front but is scolloped out behind so you can sit down , and is n't any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle , either for looks or for wear , or to wipe your hands on ; next you belt on your sword ; then you put your stove-pipe joints onto your arms , your iron gauntlets onto your hands , your iron rat-trap onto your head , with a rag of steel web hitched onto it to hang over the back of your neck -- and there you are , snug as a candle in a candle-mould .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 7]: This is no time to dance .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 41]: Well , a man that is packed away like that is a nut that is n't worth the cracking , there is so little of the meat , when you get down to it , by comparison with the shell .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 13]: The boys helped me , or I never could have got in .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 31]: Just as we finished , Sir Bedivere happened in , and I saw that as like as not I had n't chosen the most convenient outfit for a long trip .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 12]: How stately he looked ; and tall and broad and grand .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 59]: He had on his head a conical steel casque that only came down to his ears , and for visor had only a narrow steel bar that extended down to his upper lip and protected his nose ; and all the rest of him , from neck to heel , was flexible chain mail , trousers and all .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 66]: But pretty much all of him was hidden under his outside garment , which of course was of chain mail , as I said , and hung straight from his shoulders to his ankles ; and from his middle to the bottom , both before and behind , was divided , so that he could ride and let the skirts hang down on each side .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 16]: He was going grailing , and it was just the outfit for it , too .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 22]: I would have given a good deal for that ulster , but it was too late now to be fooling around .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 35]: The sun was just up , the king and the court were all on hand to see me off and wish me luck ; so it would n't be etiquette for me to tarry .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 20]: You do n't get on your horse yourself ; no , if you tried it you would get disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 95]: They carry you out , just as they carry a sun-struck man to the drug store , and put you on , and help get you to rights , and fix your feet in the stirrups ; and all the while you do feel so strange and stuffy and like somebody else -- like somebody that has been married on a sudden , or struck by lightning , or something like that , and has n't quite fetched around yet , and is sort of numb , and ca n't just get his bearings .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 51]: Then they stood up the mast they called a spear , in its socket by my left foot , and I gripped it with my hand ; lastly they hung my shield around my neck , and I was all complete and ready to up anchor and get to sea .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 24]: Everybody was as good to me as they could be , and a maid of honor gave me the stirrup-cup her own self .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 37]: There was nothing more to do now , but for that damsel to get up behind me on a pillion , which she did , and put an arm or so around me to hold on .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 18]: And so we started , and everybody gave us a goodbye and waved their handkerchiefs or helmets .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 27]: And everybody we met , going down the hill and through the village was respectful to us , except some shabby little boys on the outskirts .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 11]: They said : `` Oh , what a guy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 6]: And hove clods at us .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 11]: In my experience boys are the same in all ages .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 15]: They do n't respect anything , they do n't care for anything or anybody .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 57]: They say `` Go up , baldhead '' to the prophet going his unoffending way in the gray of antiquity ; they sass me in the holy gloom of the Middle Ages ; and I had seen them act the same way in Buchanan 's administration ; I remember , because I was there and helped .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 37]: The prophet had his bears and settled with his boys ; and I wanted to get down and settle with mine , but it would n't answer , because I could n't have got up again .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 8]: I hate a country without a derrick .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 13]: CHAPTER XII SLOW TORTURE Straight off , we were in the country .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 22]: It was most lovely and pleasant in those sylvan solitudes in the early cool morning in the first freshness of autumn .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 86]: From hilltops we saw fair green valleys lying spread out below , with streams winding through them , and island groves of trees here and there , and huge lonely oaks scattered about and casting black blots of shade ; and beyond the valleys we saw the ranges of hills , blue with haze , stretching away in billowy perspective to the horizon , with at wide intervals a dim fleck of white or gray on a wave-summit , which we knew was a castle .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 169]: We crossed broad natural lawns sparkling with dew , and we moved like spirits , the cushioned turf giving out no sound of footfall ; we dreamed along through glades in a mist of green light that got its tint from the sun-drenched roof of leaves overhead , and by our feet the clearest and coldest of runlets went frisking and gossiping over its reefs and making a sort of whispering music , comfortable to hear ; and at times we left the world behind and entered into the solemn great deeps and rich gloom of the forest , where furtive wild things whisked and scurried by and were gone before you could even get your eye on the place where the noise was ; and where only the earliest birds were turning out and getting to business with a song here and a quarrel yonder and a mysterious far-off hammering and drumming for worms on a tree trunk away somewhere in the impenetrable remotenesses of the woods .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 13]: And by and by out we would swing again into the glare .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 41]: About the third or fourth or fifth time that we swung out into the glare -- it was along there somewhere , a couple of hours or so after sun-up -- it was n't as pleasant as it had been .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 7]: It was beginning to get hot .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 5]: This was quite noticeable .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 14]: We had a very long pull , after that , without any shade .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 18]: Now it is curious how progressively little frets grow and multiply after they once get a start .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 29]: Things which I did n't mind at all , at first , I began to mind now -- and more and more , too , all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 40]: The first ten or fifteen times I wanted my handkerchief I did n't seem to care ; I got along , and said never mind , it is n't any matter , and dropped it out of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 64]: But now it was different ; I wanted it all the time ; it was nag , nag , nag , right along , and no rest ; I could n't get it out of my mind ; and so at last I lost my temper and said hang a man that would make a suit of armor without any pockets in it .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 32]: You see I had my handkerchief in my helmet ; and some other things ; but it was that kind of a helmet that you ca n't take off by yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 21]: That had n't occurred to me when I put it there ; and in fact I did n't know it .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 9]: I supposed it would be particularly convenient there .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 33]: And so now , the thought of its being there , so handy and close by , and yet not get-at-able , made it all the worse and the harder to bear .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 24]: Yes , the thing that you ca n't get is the thing that you want , mainly ; every one has noticed that .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 66]: Well , it took my mind off from everything else ; took it clear off , and centered it in my helmet ; and mile after mile , there it stayed , imagining the handkerchief , picturing the handkerchief ; and it was bitter and aggravating to have the salt sweat keep trickling down into my eyes , and I could n't get at it .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 29]: It seems like a little thing , on paper , but it was not a little thing at all ; it was the most real kind of misery .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 11]: I would not say it if it was not so .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 29]: I made up my mind that I would carry along a reticule next time , let it look how it might , and people say what they would .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 36]: Of course these iron dudes of the Round Table would think it was scandalous , and maybe raise Sheol about it , but as for me , give me comfort first , and style afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 54]: So we jogged along , and now and then we struck a stretch of dust , and it would tumble up in clouds and get into my nose and make me sneeze and cry ; and of course I said things I ought n't to have said , I do n't deny that .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 7]: I am not better than others .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 43]: We could n't seem to meet anybody in this lonesome Britain , not even an ogre ; and , in the mood I was in then , it was well for the ogre ; that is , an ogre with a handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 30]: Most knights would have thought of nothing but getting his armor ; but so I got his bandanna , he could keep his hardware , for all of me .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 11]: Meantime , it was getting hotter and hotter in there .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 20]: You see , the sun was beating down and warming up the iron more and more all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 16]: Well , when you are hot , that way , every little thing irritates you .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 112]: When I trotted , I rattled like a crate of dishes , and that annoyed me ; and moreover I could n't seem to stand that shield slatting and banging , now about my breast , now around my back ; and if I dropped into a walk my joints creaked and screeched in that wearisome way that a wheelbarrow does , and as we did n't create any breeze at that gait , I was like to get fried in that stove ; and besides , the quieter you went the heavier the iron settled down on you and the more and more tons you seemed to weigh every minute .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 34]: And you had to be always changing hands , and passing your spear over to the other foot , it got so irksome for one hand to hold it long at a time .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 30]: Well , you know , when you perspire that way , in rivers , there comes a time when you -- when you -- well , when you itch .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 19]: You are inside , your hands are outside ; so there you are ; nothing but iron between .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 14]: It is not a light thing , let it sound as it may .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 45]: First it is one place ; then another ; then some more ; and it goes on spreading and spreading , and at last the territory is all occupied , and nobody can imagine what you feel like , nor how unpleasant it is .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 142]: And when it had got to the worst , and it seemed to me that I could not stand anything more , a fly got in through the bars and settled on my nose , and the bars were stuck and would n't work , and I could n't get the visor up ; and I could only shake my head , which was baking hot by this time , and the fly -- well , you know how a fly acts when he has got a certainty -- he only minded the shaking enough to change from nose to lip , and lip to ear , and buzz and buzz all around in there , and keep on lighting and biting , in a way that a person , already so distressed as I was , simply could not stand .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 18]: So I gave in , and got Alisande to unship the helmet and relieve me of it .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 33]: Then she emptied the conveniences out of it and fetched it full of water , and I drank and then stood up , and she poured the rest down inside the armor .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 9]: One can not think how refreshing it was .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 15]: She continued to fetch and pour until I was well soaked and thoroughly comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 11]: It was good to have a rest -- and peace .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 13]: But nothing is quite perfect in this life , at any time .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 38]: I had made a pipe a while back , and also some pretty fair tobacco ; not the real thing , but what some of the Indians use : the inside bark of the willow , dried .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 19]: These comforts had been in the helmet , and now I had them again , but no matches .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 23]: Gradually , as the time wore along , one annoying fact was borne in upon my understanding -- that we were weather-bound .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 15]: An armed novice can not mount his horse without help and plenty of it .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 12]: Sandy was not enough ; not enough for me , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 10]: We had to wait until somebody should come along .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 30]: Waiting , in silence , would have been agreeable enough , for I was full of matter for reflection , and wanted to give it a chance to work .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 63]: I wanted to try and think out how it was that rational or even half-rational men could ever have learned to wear armor , considering its inconveniences ; and how they had managed to keep up such a fashion for generations when it was plain that what I had suffered to-day they had had to suffer all the days of their lives .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 43]: I wanted to think that out ; and moreover I wanted to think out some way to reform this evil and persuade the people to let the foolish fashion die out ; but thinking was out of the question in the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 9]: You could n't think , where Sandy was .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 38]: She was a quite biddable creature and good-hearted , but she had a flow of talk that was as steady as a mill , and made your head sore like the drays and wagons in a city .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 13]: If she had had a cork she would have been a comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 12]: But you ca n't cork that kind ; they would die .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 43]: Her clack was going all day , and you would think something would surely happen to her works , by and by ; but no , they never got out of order ; and she never had to slack up for words .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 26]: She could grind , and pump , and churn , and buzz by the week , and never stop to oil up or blow out .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 10]: And yet the result was just nothing but wind .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 13]: She never had any ideas , any more than a fog has .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 36]: She was a perfect blatherskite ; I mean for jaw , jaw , jaw , talk , talk , talk , jabber , jabber , jabber ; but just as good as she could be .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 74]: I had n't minded her mill that morning , on account of having that hornets ' nest of other troubles ; but more than once in the afternoon I had to say : `` Take a rest , child ; the way you are using up all the domestic air , the kingdom will have to go to importing it by to-morrow , and it 's a low enough treasury without that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 21]: CHAPTER XIII FREEMEN Yes , it is strange how little a while at a time a person can be contented .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 106]: Only a little while back , when I was riding and suffering , what a heaven this peace , this rest , this sweet serenity in this secluded shady nook by this purling stream would have seemed , where I could keep perfectly comfortable all the time by pouring a dipper of water into my armor now and then ; yet already I was getting dissatisfied ; partly because I could not light my pipe -- for , although I had long ago started a match factory , I had forgotten to bring matches with me -- and partly because we had nothing to eat .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 14]: Here was another illustration of the childlike improvidence of this age and people .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 33]: A man in armor always trusted to chance for his food on a journey , and would have been scandalized at the idea of hanging a basket of sandwiches on his spear .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 31]: There was probably not a knight of all the Round Table combination who would not rather have died than been caught carrying such a thing as that on his flagstaff .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 10]: And yet there could not be anything more sensible .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 40]: It had been my intention to smuggle a couple of sandwiches into my helmet , but I was interrupted in the act , and had to make an excuse and lay them aside , and a dog got them .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 9]: Night approached , and with it a storm .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 6]: The darkness came on fast .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 7]: We must camp , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 21]: I found a good shelter for the demoiselle under a rock , and went off and found another for myself .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 39]: But I was obliged to remain in my armor , because I could not get it off by myself and yet could not allow Alisande to help , because it would have seemed so like undressing before folk .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 53]: It would not have amounted to that in reality , because I had clothes on underneath ; but the prejudices of one 's breeding are not gotten rid of just at a jump , and I knew that when it came to stripping off that bob-tailed iron petticoat I should be embarrassed .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 31]: With the storm came a change of weather ; and the stronger the wind blew , and the wilder the rain lashed around , the colder and colder it got .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 116]: Pretty soon , various kinds of bugs and ants and worms and things began to flock in out of the wet and crawl down inside my armor to get warm ; and while some of them behaved well enough , and snuggled up amongst my clothes and got quiet , the majority were of a restless , uncomfortable sort , and never stayed still , but went on prowling and hunting for they did not know what ; especially the ants , which went tickling along in wearisome procession from one end of me to the other by the hour , and are a kind of creatures which I never wish to sleep with again .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 73]: It would be my advice to persons situated in this way , to not roll or thrash around , because this excites the interest of all the different sorts of animals and makes every last one of them want to turn out and see what is going on , and this makes things worse than they were before , and of course makes you objurgate harder , too , if you can .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 34]: Still , if one did not roll and thrash around he would die ; so perhaps it is as well to do one way as the other ; there is no real choice .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 25]: Even after I was frozen solid I could still distinguish that tickling , just as a corpse does when he is taking electric treatment .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 11]: I said I would never wear armor after this trip .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 50]: All those trying hours whilst I was frozen and yet was in a living fire , as you may say , on account of that swarm of crawlers , that same unanswerable question kept circling and circling through my tired head : How do people stand this miserable armor ?
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 11]: How have they managed to stand it all these generations ?
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 14]: How can they sleep at night for dreading the tortures of next day ?
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 54]: When the morning came at last , I was in a bad enough plight : seedy , drowsy , fagged , from want of sleep ; weary from thrashing around , famished from long fasting ; pining for a bath , and to get rid of the animals ; and crippled with rheumatism .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 20]: And how had it fared with the nobly born , the titled aristocrat , the Demoiselle Alisande la Carteloise ?
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 46]: Why , she was as fresh as a squirrel ; she had slept like the dead ; and as for a bath , probably neither she nor any other noble in the land had ever had one , and so she was not missing it .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 14]: Measured by modern standards , they were merely modified savages , those people .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 20]: This noble lady showed no impatience to get to breakfast -- and that smacks of the savage , too .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 40]: On their journeys those Britons were used to long fasts , and knew how to bear them ; and also how to freight up against probable fasts before starting , after the style of the Indian and the anaconda .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 13]: As like as not , Sandy was loaded for a three-day stretch .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 14]: We were off before sunrise , Sandy riding and I limping along behind .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 27]: In half an hour we came upon a group of ragged poor creatures who had assembled to mend the thing which was regarded as a road .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 46]: They were as humble as animals to me ; and when I proposed to breakfast with them , they were so flattered , so overwhelmed by this extraordinary condescension of mine that at first they were not able to believe that I was in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 59]: My lady put up her scornful lip and withdrew to one side ; she said in their hearing that she would as soon think of eating with the other cattle -- a remark which embarrassed these poor devils merely because it referred to them , and not because it insulted or offended them , for it did n't .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 10]: And yet they were not slaves , not chattels .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 11]: By a sarcasm of law and phrase they were freemen .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 117]: Seven-tenths of the free population of the country were of just their class and degree : small `` independent '' farmers , artisans , etc. ; which is to say , they were the nation , the actual Nation ; they were about all of it that was useful , or worth saving , or really respect-worthy , and to subtract them would have been to subtract the Nation and leave behind some dregs , some refuse , in the shape of a king , nobility and gentry , idle , unproductive , acquainted mainly with the arts of wasting and destroying , and of no sort of use or value in any rationally constructed world .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 85]: And yet , by ingenious contrivance , this gilded minority , instead of being in the tail of the procession where it belonged , was marching head up and banners flying , at the other end of it ; had elected itself to be the Nation , and these innumerable clams had permitted it so long that they had come at last to accept it as a truth ; and not only that , but to believe it right and as it should be .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 57]: The priests had told their fathers and themselves that this ironical state of things was ordained of God ; and so , not reflecting upon how unlike God it would be to amuse himself with sarcasms , and especially such poor transparent ones as this , they had dropped the matter there and become respectfully quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 17]: The talk of these meek people had a strange enough sound in a formerly American ear .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 471]: They were freemen , but they could not leave the estates of their lord or their bishop without his permission ; they could not prepare their own bread , but must have their corn ground and their bread baked at his mill and his bakery , and pay roundly for the same ; they could not sell a piece of their own property without paying him a handsome percentage of the proceeds , nor buy a piece of somebody else 's without remembering him in cash for the privilege ; they had to harvest his grain for him gratis , and be ready to come at a moment 's notice , leaving their own crop to destruction by the threatened storm ; they had to let him plant fruit trees in their fields , and then keep their indignation to themselves when his heedless fruit-gatherers trampled the grain around the trees ; they had to smother their anger when his hunting parties galloped through their fields laying waste the result of their patient toil ; they were not allowed to keep doves themselves , and when the swarms from my lord 's dovecote settled on their crops they must not lose their temper and kill a bird , for awful would the penalty be ; when the harvest was at last gathered , then came the procession of robbers to levy their blackmail upon it : first the Church carted off its fat tenth , then the king 's commissioner took his twentieth , then my lord 's people made a mighty inroad upon the remainder ; after which , the skinned freeman had liberty to bestow the remnant in his barn , in case it was worth the trouble ; there were taxes , and taxes , and taxes , and more taxes , and taxes again , and yet other taxes -- upon this free and independent pauper , but none upon his lord the baron or the bishop , none upon the wasteful nobility or the all-devouring Church ; if the baron would sleep unvexed , the freeman must sit up all night after his day 's work and whip the ponds to keep the frogs quiet ; if the freeman 's daughter -- but no , that last infamy of monarchical government is unprintable ; and finally , if the freeman , grown desperate with his tortures , found his life unendurable under such conditions , and sacrificed it and fled to death for mercy and refuge , the gentle Church condemned him to eternal fire , the gentle law buried him at midnight at the cross-roads with a stake through his back , and his master the baron or the bishop confiscated all his property and turned his widow and his orphans out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 54]: And here were these freemen assembled in the early morning to work on their lord the bishop 's road three days each -- gratis ; every head of a family , and every son of a family , three days each , gratis , and a day or so added for their servants .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 95]: Why , it was like reading about France and the French , before the ever memorable and blessed Revolution , which swept a thousand years of such villany away in one swift tidal-wave of blood -- one : a settlement of that hoary debt in the proportion of half a drop of blood for each hogshead of it that had been pressed by slow tortures out of that people in the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong and shame and misery the like of which was not to be mated but in hell .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 116]: There were two `` Reigns of Terror , '' if we would but remember it and consider it ; the one wrought murder in hot passion , the other in heartless cold blood ; the one lasted mere months , the other had lasted a thousand years ; the one inflicted death upon ten thousand persons , the other upon a hundred millions ; but our shudders are all for the `` horrors '' of the minor Terror , the momentary Terror , so to speak ; whereas , what is the horror of swift death by the axe , compared with lifelong death from hunger , cold , insult , cruelty , and heart-break ?
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 16]: What is swift death by lightning compared with death by slow fire at the stake ?
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 67]: A city cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief Terror which we have all been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over ; but all France could hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real Terror -- that unspeakably bitter and awful Terror which none of us has been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 35]: These poor ostensible freemen who were sharing their breakfast and their talk with me , were as full of humble reverence for their king and Church and nobility as their worst enemy could desire .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 8]: There was something pitifully ludicrous about it .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 103]: I asked them if they supposed a nation of people ever existed , who , with a free vote in every man 's hand , would elect that a single family and its descendants should reign over it forever , whether gifted or boobies , to the exclusion of all other families -- including the voter 's ; and would also elect that a certain hundred families should be raised to dizzy summits of rank , and clothed on with offensive transmissible glories and privileges to the exclusion of the rest of the nation 's families -- _ including his own _ .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 49]: They all looked unhit , and said they did n't know ; that they had never thought about it before , and it had n't ever occurred to them that a nation could be so situated that every man _ could _ have a say in the government .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 19]: I said I had seen one -- and that it would last until it had an Established Church .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 9]: Again they were all unhit -- at first .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 28]: But presently one man looked up and asked me to state that proposition again ; and state it slowly , so it could soak into his understanding .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 71]: I did it ; and after a little he had the idea , and he brought his fist down and said _ he _ did n't believe a nation where every man had a vote would voluntarily get down in the mud and dirt in any such way ; and that to steal from a nation its will and preference must be a crime and the first of all crimes .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 12]: I said to myself : `` This one 's a man .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 42]: If I were backed by enough of his sort , I would make a strike for the welfare of this country , and try to prove myself its loyalest citizen by making a wholesome change in its system of government . ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 21]: You see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to one 's country , not to its institutions or its office-holders .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 69]: The country is the real thing , the substantial thing , the eternal thing ; it is the thing to watch over , and care for , and be loyal to ; institutions are extraneous , they are its mere clothing , and clothing can wear out , become ragged , cease to be comfortable , cease to protect the body from winter , disease , and death .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 47]: To be loyal to rags , to shout for rags , to worship rags , to die for rags -- that is a loyalty of unreason , it is pure animal ; it belongs to monarchy , was invented by monarchy ; let monarchy keep it .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 67]: I was from Connecticut , whose Constitution declares `` that all political power is inherent in the people , and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their benefit ; and that they have _ at all times _ an undeniable and indefeasible right to _ alter their form of government _ in such a manner as they may think expedient . ''
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 42]: Under that gospel , the citizen who thinks he sees that the commonwealth 's political clothes are worn out , and yet holds his peace and does not agitate for a new suit , is disloyal ; he is a traitor .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 50]: That he may be the only one who thinks he sees this decay , does not excuse him ; it is his duty to agitate anyway , and it is the duty of the others to vote him down if they do not see the matter as he does .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 32]: And now here I was , in a country where a right to say how the country should be governed was restricted to six persons in each thousand of its population .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 45]: For the nine hundred and ninety-four to express dissatisfaction with the regnant system and propose to change it , would have made the whole six shudder as one man , it would have been so disloyal , so dishonorable , such putrid black treason .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 47]: So to speak , I was become a stockholder in a corporation where nine hundred and ninety-four of the members furnished all the money and did all the work , and the other six elected themselves a permanent board of direction and took all the dividends .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 18]: It seemed to me that what the nine hundred and ninety-four dupes needed was a new deal .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 65]: The thing that would have best suited the circus side of my nature would have been to resign the Boss-ship and get up an insurrection and turn it into a revolution ; but I knew that the Jack Cade or the Wat Tyler who tries such a thing without first educating his materials up to revolution grade is almost absolutely certain to get left .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 17]: I had never been accustomed to getting left , even if I do say it myself .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 29]: Wherefore , the `` deal '' which had been for some time working into shape in my mind was of a quite different pattern from the Cade-Tyler sort .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 40]: So I did not talk blood and insurrection to that man there who sat munching black bread with that abused and mistaught herd of human sheep , but took him aside and talked matter of another sort to him .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 77]: After I had finished , I got him to lend me a little ink from his veins ; and with this and a sliver I wrote on a piece of bark -- Put him in the Man-factory -- and gave it to him , and said : `` Take it to the palace at Camelot and give it into the hands of Amyas le Poulet , whom I call Clarence , and he will understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 24]: `` He is a priest , then , '' said the man , and some of the enthusiasm went out of his face .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 6]: `` How -- a priest ?
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 23]: Did n't I tell you that no chattel of the Church , no bond-slave of pope or bishop can enter my Man-Factory ?
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 28]: Did n't I tell you that _ you _ could n't enter unless your religion , whatever it might be , was your own free property ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 37]: `` Marry , it is so , and for that I was glad ; wherefore it liked me not , and bred in me a cold doubt , to hear of this priest being there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 13]: `` But he is n't a priest , I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 7]: The man looked far from satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 16]: He said : `` He is not a priest , and yet can read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 22]: `` He is not a priest and yet can read -- yes , and write , too , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 6]: I taught him myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 6]: The man 's face cleared .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 21]: `` And it is the first thing that you yourself will be taught in that Factory -- '' `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 13]: I would give blood out of my heart to know that art .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 25]: Why , I will be your slave , your -- '' `` No you wo n't , you wo n't be anybody 's slave .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 7]: Take your family and go along .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 14]: Your lord the bishop will confiscate your small property , but no matter .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 8]: Clarence will fix you all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 143]: CHAPTER XIV `` DEFEND THEE , LORD '' I paid three pennies for my breakfast , and a most extravagant price it was , too , seeing that one could have breakfasted a dozen persons for that money ; but I was feeling good by this time , and I had always been a kind of spendthrift anyway ; and then these people had wanted to give me the food for nothing , scant as their provision was , and so it was a grateful pleasure to emphasize my appreciation and sincere thankfulness with a good big financial lift where the money would do so much more good than it would in my helmet , where , these pennies being made of iron and not stinted in weight , my half-dollar 's worth was a good deal of a burden to me .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 89]: I spent money rather too freely in those days , it is true ; but one reason for it was that I had n't got the proportions of things entirely adjusted , even yet , after so long a sojourn in Britain -- had n't got along to where I was able to absolutely realize that a penny in Arthur 's land and a couple of dollars in Connecticut were about one and the same thing : just twins , as you may say , in purchasing power .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 43]: If my start from Camelot could have been delayed a very few days I could have paid these people in beautiful new coins from our own mint , and that would have pleased me ; and them , too , not less .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 8]: I had adopted the American values exclusively .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 55]: In a week or two now , cents , nickels , dimes , quarters , and half-dollars , and also a trifle of gold , would be trickling in thin but steady streams all through the commercial veins of the kingdom , and I looked to see this new blood freshen up its life .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 53]: The farmers were bound to throw in something , to sort of offset my liberality , whether I would or no ; so I let them give me a flint and steel ; and as soon as they had comfortably bestowed Sandy and me on our horse , I lit my pipe .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 37]: When the first blast of smoke shot out through the bars of my helmet , all those people broke for the woods , and Sandy went over backwards and struck the ground with a dull thud .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 22]: They thought I was one of those fire-belching dragons they had heard so much about from knights and other professional liars .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 15]: I had infinite trouble to persuade those people to venture back within explaining distance .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 22]: Then I told them that this was only a bit of enchantment which would work harm to none but my enemies .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 41]: And I promised , with my hand on my heart , that if all who felt no enmity toward me would come forward and pass before me they should see that only those who remained behind would be struck dead .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 10]: The procession moved with a good deal of promptness .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 21]: There were no casualties to report , for nobody had curiosity enough to remain behind to see what would happen .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 45]: I lost some time , now , for these big children , their fears gone , became so ravished with wonder over my awe-compelling fireworks that I had to stay there and smoke a couple of pipes out before they would let me go .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 34]: Still the delay was not wholly unproductive , for it took all that time to get Sandy thoroughly wonted to the new thing , she being so close to it , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 20]: It plugged up her conversation mill , too , for a considerable while , and that was a gain .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 12]: But above all other benefits accruing , I had learned something .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 16]: I was ready for any giant or any ogre that might come along , now .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 22]: We tarried with a holy hermit , that night , and my opportunity came about the middle of the next afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 46]: We were crossing a vast meadow by way of short-cut , and I was musing absently , hearing nothing , seeing nothing , when Sandy suddenly interrupted a remark which she had begun that morning , with the cry : `` Defend thee , lord !
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 8]: -- peril of life is toward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 15]: And she slipped down from the horse and ran a little way and stood .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 39]: I looked up and saw , far off in the shade of a tree , half a dozen armed knights and their squires ; and straightway there was bustle among them and tightening of saddle-girths for the mount .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 41]: My pipe was ready and would have been lit , if I had not been lost in thinking about how to banish oppression from this land and restore to all its people their stolen rights and manhood without disobliging anybody .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 25]: I lit up at once , and by the time I had got a good head of reserved steam on , here they came .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 34]: All together , too ; none of those chivalrous magnanimities which one reads so much about -- one courtly rascal at a time , and the rest standing by to see fair play .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 43]: No , they came in a body , they came with a whirr and a rush , they came like a volley from a battery ; came with heads low down , plumes streaming out behind , lances advanced at a level .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 17]: It was a handsome sight , a beautiful sight -- for a man up a tree .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 40]: I laid my lance in rest and waited , with my heart beating , till the iron wave was just ready to break over me , then spouted a column of white smoke through the bars of my helmet .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 12]: You should have seen the wave go to pieces and scatter !
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 10]: This was a finer sight than the other one .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 17]: But these people stopped , two or three hundred yards away , and this troubled me .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 16]: My satisfaction collapsed , and fear came ; I judged I was a lost man .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 45]: But Sandy was radiant ; and was going to be eloquent -- but I stopped her , and told her my magic had miscarried , somehow or other , and she must mount , with all despatch , and we must ride for life .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 6]: No , she would n't .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 41]: She said that my enchantment had disabled those knights ; they were not riding on , because they could n't ; wait , they would drop out of their saddles presently , and we would get their horses and harness .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 70]: I could not deceive such trusting simplicity , so I said it was a mistake ; that when my fireworks killed at all , they killed instantly ; no , the men would not die , there was something wrong about my apparatus , I could n't tell what ; but we must hurry and get away , for those people would attack us again , in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 18]: Sandy laughed , and said : `` Lack-a-day , sir , they be not of that breed !
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 72]: Sir Launcelot will give battle to dragons , and will abide by them , and will assail them again , and yet again , and still again , until he do conquer and destroy them ; and so likewise will Sir Pellinore and Sir Aglovale and Sir Carados , and mayhap others , but there be none else that will venture it , let the idle say what the idle will .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 24]: And , la , as to yonder base rufflers , think ye they have not their fill , but yet desire more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 11]: `` Well , then , what are they waiting for ?
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 6]: Why do n't they leave ?
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 4]: Nobody 's hindering .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 17]: Good land , I 'm willing to let bygones be bygones , I 'm sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 6]: `` Leave , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 9]: Oh , give thyself easement as to that .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 11]: They dream not of it , no , not they .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 7]: They wait to yield them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 16]: `` Come -- really , is that ` sooth ' -- as you people say ?
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 11]: If they want to , why do n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 23]: `` It would like them much ; but an ye wot how dragons are esteemed , ye would not hold them blamable .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 6]: They fear to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 28]: `` Well , then , suppose I go to them instead , and -- '' `` Ah , wit ye well they would not abide your coming .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 5]: I will go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 4]: And she did .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 12]: She was a handy person to have along on a raid .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 11]: I would have considered this a doubtful errand , myself .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 13]: I presently saw the knights riding away , and Sandy coming back .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 5]: That was a relief .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 28]: I judged she had somehow failed to get the first innings -- I mean in the conversation ; otherwise the interview would n't have been so short .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 17]: But it turned out that she had managed the business well ; in fact , admirably .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 47]: She said that when she told those people I was The Boss , it hit them where they lived : `` smote them sore with fear and dread '' was her word ; and then they were ready to put up with anything she might require .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 34]: So she swore them to appear at Arthur 's court within two days and yield them , with horse and harness , and be my knights henceforth , and subject to my command .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 15]: How much better she managed that thing than I should have done it myself !
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 5]: She was a daisy .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 24]: CHAPTER XV SANDY 'S TALE `` And so I 'm proprietor of some knights , '' said I , as we rode off .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 18]: `` Who would ever have supposed that I should live to list up assets of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 16]: I sha n't know what to do with them ; unless I raffle them off .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 10]: How many of them are there , Sandy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 13]: `` Seven , please you , sir , and their squires . ''
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 7]: `` It is a good haul .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 4]: Who are they ?
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 7]: Where do they hang out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 8]: `` Where do they hang out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 9]: `` Yes , where do they live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 8]: `` Ah , I understood thee not .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 7]: That will I tell eftsoons . ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 45]: Then she said musingly , and softly , turning the words daintily over her tongue : `` Hang they out -- hang they out -- where hang -- where do they hang out ; eh , right so ; where do they hang out .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 18]: Of a truth the phrase hath a fair and winsome grace , and is prettily worded withal .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 18]: I will repeat it anon and anon in mine idlesse , whereby I may peradventure learn it .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 6]: Where do they hang out .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 3]: Even so !
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 23]: already it falleth trippingly from my tongue , and forasmuch as -- '' `` Do n't forget the cowboys , Sandy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 4]: `` Cowboys ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 18]: `` Yes ; the knights , you know : You were going to tell me about them .

Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 11]: `` Game -- '' `` Yes , yes , yes !

Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 10]: `` I will well , and lightly will begin .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 11]: So they two departed and rode into a great forest .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 8]: And -- '' `` Great Scott ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 10]: You see , I recognized my mistake at once .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 24]: I had set her works a-going ; it was my own fault ; she would be thirty days getting down to those facts .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 13]: And she generally began without a preface and finished without a result .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 31]: If you interrupted her she would either go right along without noticing , or answer with a couple of words , and go back and say the sentence over again .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 45]: So , interruptions only did harm ; and yet I had to interrupt , and interrupt pretty frequently , too , in order to save my life ; a person would die if he let her monotony drip on him right along all day .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 5]: `` Great Scott ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 6]: I said in my distress .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 21]: She went right back and began over again : `` So they two departed and rode into a great forest .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 10]: And -- '' '' _ Which _ two ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 7]: `` Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 16]: And so they came to an abbey of monks , and there were well lodged .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 61]: So on the morn they heard their masses in the abbey , and so they rode forth till they came to a great forest ; then was Sir Gawaine ware in a valley by a turret , of twelve fair damsels , and two knights armed on great horses , and the damsels went to and fro by a tree .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 61]: And then was Sir Gawaine ware how there hung a white shield on that tree , and ever as the damsels came by it they spit upon it , and some threw mire upon the shield -- '' `` Now , if I had n't seen the like myself in this country , Sandy , I would n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 24]: But I 've seen it , and I can just see those creatures now , parading before that shield and acting like that .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 10]: The women here do certainly act like all possessed .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 16]: Yes , and I mean your best , too , society 's very choicest brands .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 29]: The humblest hello-girl along ten thousand miles of wire could teach gentleness , patience , modesty , manners , to the highest duchess in Arthur 's land . ''
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 4]: `` Hello-girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 127]: `` Yes , but do n't you ask me to explain ; it 's a new kind of a girl ; they do n't have them here ; one often speaks sharply to them when they are not the least in fault , and he ca n't get over feeling sorry for it and ashamed of himself in thirteen hundred years , it 's such shabby mean conduct and so unprovoked ; the fact is , no gentleman ever does it -- though I -- well , I myself , if I 've got to confess -- '' `` Peradventure she -- '' `` Never mind her ; never mind her ; I tell you I could n't ever explain her so you would understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 12]: `` Even so be it , sith ye are so minded .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 23]: Then Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine went and saluted them , and asked them why they did that despite to the shield .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 11]: Sirs , said the damsels , we shall tell you .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 43]: There is a knight in this country that owneth this white shield , and he is a passing good man of his hands , but he hateth all ladies and gentlewomen , and therefore we do all this despite to the shield .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 81]: I will say you , said Sir Gawaine , it beseemeth evil a good knight to despise all ladies and gentlewomen , and peradventure though he hate you he hath some cause , and peradventure he loveth in some other places ladies and gentlewomen , and to be loved again , and he such a man of prowess as ye speak of -- '' `` Man of prowess -- yes , that is the man to please them , Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 13]: Man of brains -- that is a thing they never think of .

Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 45]: You would have your legs under the Round Table and a ` Sir ' in front of your names within the twenty-four hours ; and you could bring about a new distribution of the married princesses and duchesses of the Court in another twenty-four .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 51]: The fact is , it is just a sort of polished-up court of Comanches , and there is n't a squaw in it who does n't stand ready at the dropping of a hat to desert to the buck with the biggest string of scalps at his belt . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 18]: -- and he be such a man of prowess as ye speak of , said Sir Gawaine .

Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 17]: Sir , said they , his name is Marhaus the king 's son of Ireland . ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 19]: `` Son of the king of Ireland , you mean ; the other form does n't mean anything .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 24]: And look out and hold on tight , now , we must jump this gully ... There , we are all right now .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 15]: This horse belongs in the circus ; he is born before his time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 24]: `` I know him well , said Sir Uwaine , he is a passing good knight as any is on live . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 5]: _ On live _ .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 22]: If you 've got a fault in the world , Sandy , it is that you are a shade too archaic .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 9]: But it is n't any matter . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 26]: -- for I saw him once proved at a justs where many knights were gathered , and that time there might no man withstand him .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 64]: Ah , said Sir Gawaine , damsels , methinketh ye are to blame , for it is to suppose he that hung that shield there will not be long therefrom , and then may those knights match him on horseback , and that is more your worship than thus ; for I will abide no longer to see a knight 's shield dishonored .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 31]: And therewith Sir Uwaine and Sir Gawaine departed a little from them , and then were they ware where Sir Marhaus came riding on a great horse straight toward them .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 28]: And when the twelve damsels saw Sir Marhaus they fled into the turret as they were wild , so that some of them fell by the way .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 23]: Then the one of the knights of the tower dressed his shield , and said on high , Sir Marhaus defend thee .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 54]: And so they ran together that the knight brake his spear on Marhaus , and Sir Marhaus smote him so hard that he brake his neck and the horse 's back -- '' `` Well , that is just the trouble about this state of things , it ruins so many horses . ''
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 63]: `` That saw the other knight of the turret , and dressed him toward Marhaus , and they went so eagerly together , that the knight of the turret was soon smitten down , horse and man , stark dead -- '' '' _ Another _ horse gone ; I tell you it is a custom that ought to be broken up .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 20]: I do n't see how people with any feeling can applaud and support it . '' . . . .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 31]: `` So these two knights came together with great random -- '' I saw that I had been asleep and missed a chapter , but I did n't say anything .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 26]: I judged that the Irish knight was in trouble with the visitors by this time , and this turned out to be the case . ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 160]: -- that Sir Uwaine smote Sir Marhaus that his spear brast in pieces on the shield , and Sir Marhaus smote him so sore that horse and man he bare to the earth , and hurt Sir Uwaine on the left side -- '' `` The truth is , Alisande , these archaics are a little _ too _ simple ; the vocabulary is too limited , and so , by consequence , descriptions suffer in the matter of variety ; they run too much to level Saharas of fact , and not enough to picturesque detail ; this throws about them a certain air of the monotonous ; in fact the fights are all alike : a couple of people come together with great random -- random is a good word , and so is exegesis , for that matter , and so is holocaust , and defalcation , and usufruct and a hundred others , but land !
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 152]: a body ought to discriminate -- they come together with great random , and a spear is brast , and one party brake his shield and the other one goes down , horse and man , over his horse-tail and brake his neck , and then the next candidate comes randoming in , and brast _ his _ spear , and the other man brast his shield , and down _ he _ goes , horse and man , over his horse-tail , and brake _ his _ neck , and then there 's another elected , and another and another and still another , till the material is all used up ; and when you come to figure up results , you ca n't tell one fight from another , nor who whipped ; and as a _ picture _ , of living , raging , roaring battle , sho !
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 15]: why , it 's pale and noiseless -- just ghosts scuffling in a fog .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 15]: Dear me , what would this barren vocabulary get out of the mightiest spectacle ?
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 13]: -- the burning of Rome in Nero 's time , for instance ?
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 26]: Why , it would merely say , ` Town burned down ; no insurance ; boy brast a window , fireman brake his neck ! '
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 11]: Why , _ that _ ai n't a picture ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 55]: It was a good deal of a lecture , I thought , but it did n't disturb Sandy , did n't turn a feather ; her steam soared steadily up again , the minute I took off the lid : `` Then Sir Marhaus turned his horse and rode toward Gawaine with his spear .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 59]: And when Sir Gawaine saw that , he dressed his shield , and they aventred their spears , and they came together with all the might of their horses , that either knight smote other so hard in the midst of their shields , but Sir Gawaine 's spear brake -- '' `` I knew it would . ''
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 33]: -- `` but Sir Marhaus 's spear held ; and therewith Sir Gawaine and his horse rushed down to the earth -- '' `` Just so -- and brake his back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 61]: -- `` and lightly Sir Gawaine rose upon his feet and pulled out his sword , and dressed him toward Sir Marhaus on foot , and therewith either came unto other eagerly , and smote together with their swords , that their shields flew in cantels , and they bruised their helms and their hauberks , and wounded either other .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 30]: But Sir Gawaine , fro it passed nine of the clock , waxed by the space of three hours ever stronger and stronger and thrice his might was increased .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 53]: All this espied Sir Marhaus , and had great wonder how his might increased , and so they wounded other passing sore ; and then when it was come noon -- '' The pelting sing-song of it carried me forward to scenes and sounds of my boyhood days : `` N-e-e-ew Haven !

Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 53]: Sir Gawaine 's strength feebled and waxed passing faint , that unnethes he might dure any longer , and Sir Marhaus was then bigger and bigger -- '' `` Which strained his armor , of course ; and yet little would one of these people mind a small thing like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 66]: -- `` and so , Sir Knight , said Sir Marhaus , I have well felt that ye are a passing good knight , and a marvelous man of might as ever I felt any , while it lasteth , and our quarrels are not great , and therefore it were a pity to do you hurt , for I feel you are passing feeble .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 18]: Ah , said Sir Gawaine , gentle knight , ye say the word that I should say .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 101]: And therewith they took off their helms and either kissed other , and there they swore together either to love other as brethren -- '' But I lost the thread there , and dozed off to slumber , thinking about what a pity it was that men with such superb strength -- strength enabling them to stand up cased in cruelly burdensome iron and drenched with perspiration , and hack and batter and bang each other for six hours on a stretch -- should not have been born at a time when they could put it to some useful purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 47]: Take a jackass , for instance : a jackass has that kind of strength , and puts it to a useful purpose , and is valuable to this world because he is a jackass ; but a nobleman is not valuable because he is a jackass .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 20]: It is a mixture that is always ineffectual , and should never have been attempted in the first place .

Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 33]: When I came to myself again and began to listen , I perceived that I had lost another chapter , and that Alisande had wandered a long way off with her people .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 44]: `` And so they rode and came into a deep valley full of stones , and thereby they saw a fair stream of water ; above thereby was the head of the stream , a fair fountain , and three damsels sitting thereby .

Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 11]: It is a common literary device with the great authors .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 32]: You should make him say , ` In this country , be jabers , came never knight since it was christened , but he found strange adventures , be jabers . '
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 9]: You see how much better that sounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 14]: -- `` came never knight but he found strange adventures , be jabers .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 30]: Of a truth it doth indeed , fair lord , albeit 't is passing hard to say , though peradventure that will not tarry but better speed with usage .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 44]: And then they rode to the damsels , and either saluted other , and the eldest had a garland of gold about her head , and she was threescore winter of age or more -- '' `` The _ damsel _ was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 55]: `` Even so , dear lord -- and her hair was white under the garland -- '' `` Celluloid teeth , nine dollars a set , as like as not -- the loose-fit kind , that go up and down like a portcullis when you eat , and fall out when you laugh . ''
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 20]: `` The second damsel was of thirty winter of age , with a circlet of gold about her head .

Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 26]: Just her age who was so gentle , and lovely , and all the world to me , and whom I shall never see again !
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 56]: How the thought of her carries me back over wide seas of memory to a vague dim time , a happy time , so many , many centuries hence , when I used to wake in the soft summer mornings , out of sweet dreams of her , and say `` Hello , Central ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 19]: just to hear her dear voice come melting back to me with a `` Hello , Hank ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 11]: that was music of the spheres to my enchanted ear .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 13]: She got three dollars a week , but she was worth it .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 31]: I could not follow Alisande 's further explanation of who our captured knights were , now -- I mean in case she should ever get to explaining who they were .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 14]: My interest was gone , my thoughts were far away , and sad .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 70]: By fitful glimpses of the drifting tale , caught here and there and now and then , I merely noted in a vague way that each of these three knights took one of these three damsels up behind him on his horse , and one rode north , another east , the other south , to seek adventures , and meet again and lie , after year and day .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 8]: Year and day -- and without baggage .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 13]: It was of a piece with the general simplicity of the country .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 6]: The sun was now setting .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 32]: It was about three in the afternoon when Alisande had begun to tell me who the cowboys were ; so she had made pretty good progress with it -- for her .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 22]: She would arrive some time or other , no doubt , but she was not a person who could be hurried .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 45]: We were approaching a castle which stood on high ground ; a huge , strong , venerable structure , whose gray towers and battlements were charmingly draped with ivy , and whose whole majestic mass was drenched with splendors flung from the sinking sun .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 27]: It was the largest castle we had seen , and so I thought it might be the one we were after , but Sandy said no .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 24]: She did not know who owned it ; she said she had passed it without calling , when she went down to Camelot .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 24]: CHAPTER XVI MORGAN LE FAY If knights errant were to be believed , not all castles were desirable places to seek hospitality in .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 47]: As a matter of fact , knights errant were _ not _ persons to be believed -- that is , measured by modern standards of veracity ; yet , measured by the standards of their own time , and scaled accordingly , you got the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 18]: It was very simple : you discounted a statement ninety-seven per cent ; the rest was fact .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 38]: Now after making this allowance , the truth remained that if I could find out something about a castle before ringing the door-bell -- I mean hailing the warders -- it was the sensible thing to do .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 26]: So I was pleased when I saw in the distance a horseman making the bottom turn of the road that wound down from this castle .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 41]: As we approached each other , I saw that he wore a plumed helmet , and seemed to be otherwise clothed in steel , but bore a curious addition also -- a stiff square garment like a herald 's tabard .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 34]: However , I had to smile at my own forgetfulness when I got nearer and read this sign on his tabard : `` Persimmon 's Soap -- All the Prime-Donna Use It . ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 25]: That was a little idea of my own , and had several wholesome purposes in view toward the civilizing and uplifting of this nation .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 26]: In the first place , it was a furtive , underhand blow at this nonsense of knight errantry , though nobody suspected that but me .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 76]: I had started a number of these people out -- the bravest knights I could get -- each sandwiched between bulletin-boards bearing one device or another , and I judged that by and by when they got to be numerous enough they would begin to look ridiculous ; and then , even the steel-clad ass that _ had n't _ any board would himself begin to look ridiculous because he was out of the fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 42]: Secondly , these missionaries would gradually , and without creating suspicion or exciting alarm , introduce a rudimentary cleanliness among the nobility , and from them it would work down to the people , if the priests could be kept quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 6]: This would undermine the Church .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 9]: I mean would be a step toward that .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 16]: Next , education -- next , freedom -- and then she would begin to crumble .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 41]: It being my conviction that any Established Church is an established crime , an established slave-pen , I had no scruples , but was willing to assail it in any way or with any weapon that promised to hurt it .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 71]: Why , in my own former day -- in remote centuries not yet stirring in the womb of time -- there were old Englishmen who imagined that they had been born in a free country : a `` free '' country with the Corporation Act and the Test still in force in it -- timbers propped against men 's liberties and dishonored consciences to shore up an Established Anachronism with .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 79]: My missionaries were taught to spell out the gilt signs on their tabards -- the showy gilding was a neat idea , I could have got the king to wear a bulletin-board for the sake of that barbaric splendor -- they were to spell out these signs and then explain to the lords and ladies what soap was ; and if the lords and ladies were afraid of it , get them to try it on a dog .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 70]: The missionary 's next move was to get the family together and try it on himself ; he was to stop at no experiment , however desperate , that could convince the nobility that soap was harmless ; if any final doubt remained , he must catch a hermit -- the woods were full of them ; saints they called themselves , and saints they were believed to be .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 17]: They were unspeakably holy , and worked miracles , and everybody stood in awe of them .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 24]: If a hermit could survive a wash , and that failed to convince a duke , give him up , let him alone .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 39]: Whenever my missionaries overcame a knight errant on the road they washed him , and when he got well they swore him to go and get a bulletin-board and disseminate soap and civilization the rest of his days .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 20]: As a consequence the workers in the field were increasing by degrees , and the reform was steadily spreading .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 8]: My soap factory felt the strain early .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 139]: At first I had only two hands ; but before I had left home I was already employing fifteen , and running night and day ; and the atmospheric result was getting so pronounced that the king went sort of fainting and gasping around and said he did not believe he could stand it much longer , and Sir Launcelot got so that he did hardly anything but walk up and down the roof and swear , although I told him it was worse up there than anywhere else , but he said he wanted plenty of air ; and he was always complaining that a palace was no place for a soap factory anyway , and said if a man was to start one in his house he would be damned if he would n't strangle him .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 34]: There were ladies present , too , but much these people ever cared for that ; they would swear before children , if the wind was their way when the factory was going .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 65]: This missionary knight 's name was La Cote Male Taile , and he said that this castle was the abode of Morgan le Fay , sister of King Arthur , and wife of King Uriens , monarch of a realm about as big as the District of Columbia -- you could stand in the middle of it and throw bricks into the next kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 44]: `` Kings '' and `` Kingdoms '' were as thick in Britain as they had been in little Palestine in Joshua 's time , when people had to sleep with their knees pulled up because they could n't stretch out without a passport .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 18]: La Cote was much depressed , for he had scored here the worst failure of his campaign .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 32]: He had not worked off a cake ; yet he had tried all the tricks of the trade , even to the washing of a hermit ; but the hermit died .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 32]: This was , indeed , a bad failure , for this animal would now be dubbed a martyr , and would take his place among the saints of the Roman calendar .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 19]: Thus made he his moan , this poor Sir La Cote Male Taile , and sorrowed passing sore .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 18]: And so my heart bled for him , and I was moved to comfort and stay him .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 19]: Wherefore I said : `` Forbear to grieve , fair knight , for this is not a defeat .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 23]: We have brains , you and I ; and for such as have brains there are no defeats , but only victories .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 46]: Observe how we will turn this seeming disaster into an advertisement ; an advertisement for our soap ; and the biggest one , to draw , that was ever thought of ; an advertisement that will transform that Mount Washington defeat into a Matterhorn victory .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 16]: We will put on your bulletin-board , ' _ Patronized by the elect _ . '
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 7]: How does that strike you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 9]: `` Verily , it is wonderly bethought ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 24]: `` Well , a body is bound to admit that for just a modest little one-line ad , it 's a corker . ''
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 9]: So the poor colporteur 's griefs vanished away .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 17]: He was a brave fellow , and had done mighty feats of arms in his time .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 64]: His chief celebrity rested upon the events of an excursion like this one of mine , which he had once made with a damsel named Maledisant , who was as handy with her tongue as was Sandy , though in a different way , for her tongue churned forth only railings and insult , whereas Sandy 's music was of a kindlier sort .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 26]: I knew his story well , and so I knew how to interpret the compassion that was in his face when he bade me farewell .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 12]: He supposed I was having a bitter hard time of it .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 81]: Sandy and I discussed his story , as we rode along , and she said that La Cote 's bad luck had begun with the very beginning of that trip ; for the king 's fool had overthrown him on the first day , and in such cases it was customary for the girl to desert to the conqueror , but Maledisant did n't do it ; and also persisted afterward in sticking to him , after all his defeats .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 15]: But , said I , suppose the victor should decline to accept his spoil ?
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 11]: She said that that would n't answer -- he must .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 11]: He could n't decline ; it would n't be regular .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 7]: I made a note of that .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 31]: If Sandy 's music got to be too burdensome , some time , I would let a knight defeat me , on the chance that she would desert to him .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 21]: In due time we were challenged by the warders , from the castle walls , and after a parley admitted .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 10]: I have nothing pleasant to tell about that visit .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 23]: But it was not a disappointment , for I knew Mrs. le Fay by reputation , and was not expecting anything pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 22]: She was held in awe by the whole realm , for she had made everybody believe she was a great sorceress .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 11]: All her ways were wicked , all her instincts devilish .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 10]: She was loaded to the eyelids with cold malice .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 16]: All her history was black with crime ; and among her crimes murder was common .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 19]: I was most curious to see her ; as curious as I could have been to see Satan .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 31]: To my surprise she was beautiful ; black thoughts had failed to make her expression repulsive , age had failed to wrinkle her satin skin or mar its bloomy freshness .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 22]: She could have passed for old Uriens ' granddaughter , she could have been mistaken for sister to her own son .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 17]: As soon as we were fairly within the castle gates we were ordered into her presence .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 70]: King Uriens was there , a kind-faced old man with a subdued look ; and also the son , Sir Uwaine le Blanchemains , in whom I was , of course , interested on account of the tradition that he had once done battle with thirty knights , and also on account of his trip with Sir Gawaine and Sir Marhaus , which Sandy had been aging me with .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 24]: But Morgan was the main attraction , the conspicuous personality here ; she was head chief of this household , that was plain .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 26]: She caused us to be seated , and then she began , with all manner of pretty graces and graciousnesses , to ask me questions .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 17]: Dear me , it was like a bird or a flute , or something , talking .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 14]: I felt persuaded that this woman must have been misrepresented , lied about .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 64]: She trilled along , and trilled along , and presently a handsome young page , clothed like the rainbow , and as easy and undulatory of movement as a wave , came with something on a golden salver , and , kneeling to present it to her , overdid his graces and lost his balance , and so fell lightly against her knee .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 20]: She slipped a dirk into him in as matter-of-course a way as another person would have harpooned a rat !
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 3]: Poor child !
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 22]: he slumped to the floor , twisted his silken limbs in one great straining contortion of pain , and was dead .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 13]: Out of the old king was wrung an involuntary `` O-h ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 3]: of compassion .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 20]: The look he got , made him cut it suddenly short and not put any more hyphens in it .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 30]: Sir Uwaine , at a sign from his mother , went to the anteroom and called some servants , and meanwhile madame went rippling sweetly along with her talk .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 84]: I saw that she was a good housekeeper , for while she talked she kept a corner of her eye on the servants to see that they made no balks in handling the body and getting it out ; when they came with fresh clean towels , she sent back for the other kind ; and when they had finished wiping the floor and were going , she indicated a crimson fleck the size of a tear which their duller eyes had overlooked .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 20]: It was plain to me that La Cote Male Taile had failed to see the mistress of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 16]: Often , how louder and clearer than any tongue , does dumb circumstantial evidence speak .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 10]: Morgan le Fay rippled along as musically as ever .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 3]: Marvelous woman .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 33]: And what a glance she had : when it fell in reproof upon those servants , they shrunk and quailed as timid people do when the lightning flashes out of a cloud .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 8]: I could have got the habit myself .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 32]: It was the same with that poor old Brer Uriens ; he was always on the ragged edge of apprehension ; she could not even turn toward him but he winced .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 27]: In the midst of the talk I let drop a complimentary word about King Arthur , forgetting for the moment how this woman hated her brother .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 7]: That one little compliment was enough .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 25]: She clouded up like storm ; she called for her guards , and said : `` Hale me these varlets to the dungeons . ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 14]: That struck cold on my ears , for her dungeons had a reputation .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 10]: Nothing occurred to me to say -- or do .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 6]: But not so with Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 33]: As the guard laid a hand upon me , she piped up with the tranquilest confidence , and said : `` God 's wounds , dost thou covet destruction , thou maniac ?
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 6]: It is The Boss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 8]: Now what a happy idea that was !
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 14]: -- and so simple ; yet it would never have occurred to me .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 21]: I was born modest ; not all over , but in spots ; and this was one of the spots .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 7]: The effect upon madame was electrical .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 39]: It cleared her countenance and brought back her smiles and all her persuasive graces and blandishments ; but nevertheless she was not able to entirely cover up with them the fact that she was in a ghastly fright .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 13]: She said : `` La , but do list to thine handmaid !
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 29]: as if one gifted with powers like to mine might say the thing which I have said unto one who has vanquished Merlin , and not be jesting .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 19]: By mine enchantments I foresaw your coming , and by them I knew you when you entered here .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 60]: I did but play this little jest with hope to surprise you into some display of your art , as not doubting you would blast the guards with occult fires , consuming them to ashes on the spot , a marvel much beyond mine own ability , yet one which I have long been childishly curious to see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 16]: The guards were less curious , and got out as soon as they got permission .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 54]: CHAPTER XVII A ROYAL BANQUET Madame , seeing me pacific and unresentful , no doubt judged that I was deceived by her excuse ; for her fright dissolved away , and she was soon so importunate to have me give an exhibition and kill somebody , that the thing grew to be embarrassing .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 15]: However , to my relief she was presently interrupted by the call to prayers .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 31]: I will say this much for the nobility : that , tyrannical , murderous , rapacious , and morally rotten as they were , they were deeply and enthusiastically religious .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 18]: Nothing could divert them from the regular and faithful performance of the pieties enjoined by the Church .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 60]: More than once I had seen a noble who had gotten his enemy at a disadvantage , stop to pray before cutting his throat ; more than once I had seen a noble , after ambushing and despatching his enemy , retire to the nearest wayside shrine and humbly give thanks , without even waiting to rob the body .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 24]: There was to be nothing finer or sweeter in the life of even Benvenuto Cellini , that rough-hewn saint , ten centuries later .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 40]: All the nobles of Britain , with their families , attended divine service morning and night daily , in their private chapels , and even the worst of them had family worship five or six times a day besides .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 10]: The credit of this belonged entirely to the Church .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 17]: Although I was no friend to that Catholic Church , I was obliged to admit this .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 24]: And often , in spite of me , I found myself saying , `` What would this country be without the Church ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 38]: After prayers we had dinner in a great banqueting hall which was lighted by hundreds of grease-jets , and everything was as fine and lavish and rudely splendid as might become the royal degree of the hosts .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 27]: At the head of the hall , on a dais , was the table of the king , queen , and their son , Prince Uwaine .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 16]: Stretching down the hall from this , was the general table , on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 76]: At this , above the salt , sat the visiting nobles and the grown members of their families , of both sexes , -- the resident Court , in effect -- sixty-one persons ; below the salt sat minor officers of the household , with their principal subordinates : altogether a hundred and eighteen persons sitting , and about as many liveried servants standing behind their chairs , or serving in one capacity or another .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 7]: It was a very fine show .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 47]: In a gallery a band with cymbals , horns , harps , and other horrors , opened the proceedings with what seemed to be the crude first-draft or original agony of the wail known to later centuries as `` In the Sweet Bye and Bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 14]: It was new , and ought to have been rehearsed a little more .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 15]: For some reason or other the queen had the composer hanged , after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 21]: After this music , the priest who stood behind the royal table said a noble long grace in ostensible Latin .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 38]: Then the battalion of waiters broke away from their posts , and darted , rushed , flew , fetched and carried , and the mighty feeding began ; no words anywhere , but absorbing attention to business .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 26]: The rows of chops opened and shut in vast unison , and the sound of it was like to the muffled burr of subterranean machinery .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 17]: The havoc continued an hour and a half , and unimaginable was the destruction of substantials .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 52]: Of the chief feature of the feast -- the huge wild boar that lay stretched out so portly and imposing at the start -- nothing was left but the semblance of a hoop-skirt ; and he was but the type and symbol of what had happened to all the other dishes .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 16]: With the pastries and so on , the heavy drinking began -- and the talk .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 32]: Gallon after gallon of wine and mead disappeared , and everybody got comfortable , then happy , then sparklingly joyous -- both sexes , -- and by and by pretty noisy .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 32]: Men told anecdotes that were terrific to hear , but nobody blushed ; and when the nub was sprung , the assemblage let go with a horse-laugh that shook the fortress .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 41]: Ladies answered back with historiettes that would almost have made Queen Margaret of Navarre or even the great Elizabeth of England hide behind a handkerchief , but nobody hid here , but only laughed -- howled , you may say .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 58]: In pretty much all of these dreadful stories , ecclesiastics were the hardy heroes , but that did n't worry the chaplain any , he had his laugh with the rest ; more than that , upon invitation he roared out a song which was of as daring a sort as any that was sung that night .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 39]: By midnight everybody was fagged out , and sore with laughing ; and , as a rule , drunk : some weepingly , some affectionately , some hilariously , some quarrelsomely , some dead and under the table .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 28]: Of the ladies , the worst spectacle was a lovely young duchess , whose wedding-eve this was ; and indeed she was a spectacle , sure enough .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 53]: Just as she was she could have sat in advance for the portrait of the young daughter of the Regent d'Orleans , at the famous dinner whence she was carried , foul-mouthed , intoxicated , and helpless , to her bed , in the lost and lamented days of the Ancient Regime .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 114]: Suddenly , even while the priest was lifting his hands , and all conscious heads were bowed in reverent expectation of the coming blessing , there appeared under the arch of the far-off door at the bottom of the hall an old and bent and white-haired lady , leaning upon a crutch-stick ; and she lifted the stick and pointed it toward the queen and cried out : `` The wrath and curse of God fall upon you , woman without pity , who have slain mine innocent grandchild and made desolate this old heart that had nor chick , nor friend nor stay nor comfort in all this world but him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 46]: Everybody crossed himself in a grisly fright , for a curse was an awful thing to those people ; but the queen rose up majestic , with the death-light in her eye , and flung back this ruthless command : `` Lay hands on her !
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 7]: To the stake with her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 8]: The guards left their posts to obey .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 13]: It was a shame ; it was a cruel thing to see .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 5]: What could be done ?
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 13]: Sandy gave me a look ; I knew she had another inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 10]: I said : `` Do what you choose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 12]: She was up and facing toward the queen in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 19]: She indicated me , and said : `` Madame , _ he _ saith this may not be .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 24]: Recall the commandment , or he will dissolve the castle and it shall vanish away like the instable fabric of a dream ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 13]: Confound it , what a crazy contract to pledge a person to !
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 42]: What if the queen -- But my consternation subsided there , and my panic passed off ; for the queen , all in a collapse , made no show of resistance but gave a countermanding sign and sunk into her seat .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 8]: When she reached it she was sober .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 7]: So were many of the others .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 55]: The assemblage rose , whiffed ceremony to the winds , and rushed for the door like a mob ; overturning chairs , smashing crockery , tugging , struggling , shouldering , crowding -- anything to get out before I should change my mind and puff the castle into the measureless dim vacancies of space .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 14]: Well , well , well , they _ were _ a superstitious lot .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 12]: It is all a body can do to conceive of it .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 22]: The poor queen was so scared and humbled that she was even afraid to hang the composer without first consulting me .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 43]: I was very sorry for her -- indeed , any one would have been , for she was really suffering ; so I was willing to do anything that was reasonable , and had no desire to carry things to wanton extremities .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 30]: I therefore considered the matter thoughtfully , and ended by having the musicians ordered into our presence to play that Sweet Bye and Bye again , which they did .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 18]: Then I saw that she was right , and gave her permission to hang the whole band .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 13]: This little relaxation of sternness had a good effect upon the queen .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 35]: A statesman gains little by the arbitrary exercise of iron-clad authority upon all occasions that offer , for this wounds the just pride of his subordinates , and thus tends to undermine his strength .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 20]: A little concession , now and then , where it can do no harm , is the wiser policy .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 36]: Now that the queen was at ease in her mind once more , and measurably happy , her wine naturally began to assert itself again , and it got a little the start of her .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 15]: I mean it set her music going -- her silver bell of a tongue .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 9]: Dear me , she was a master talker .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 23]: It would not become me to suggest that it was pretty late and that I was a tired man and very sleepy .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 14]: I wished I had gone off to bed when I had the chance .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 13]: Now I must stick it out ; there was no other way .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 57]: So she tinkled along and along , in the otherwise profound and ghostly hush of the sleeping castle , until by and by there came , as if from deep down under us , a far-away sound , as of a muffled shriek -- with an expression of agony about it that made my flesh crawl .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 24]: The queen stopped , and her eyes lighted with pleasure ; she tilted her graceful head as a bird does when it listens .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 11]: The sound bored its way up through the stillness again .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 12]: `` It is truly a stubborn soul , and endureth long .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 7]: It is many hours now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 5]: `` Endureth what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 4]: `` The rack .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 9]: Come -- ye shall see a blithe sight .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 16]: An he yield not his secret now , ye shall see him torn asunder . ''
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 31]: What a silky smooth hellion she was ; and so composed and serene , when the cords all down my legs were hurting in sympathy with that man 's pain .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 65]: Conducted by mailed guards bearing flaring torches , we tramped along echoing corridors , and down stone stairways dank and dripping , and smelling of mould and ages of imprisoned night -- a chill , uncanny journey and a long one , and not made the shorter or the cheerier by the sorceress 's talk , which was about this sufferer and his crime .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 19]: He had been accused by an anonymous informer , of having killed a stag in the royal preserves .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 16]: I said : `` Anonymous testimony is n't just the right thing , your Highness .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 12]: It were fairer to confront the accused with the accuser . ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 15]: `` I had not thought of that , it being but of small consequence .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 39]: But an I would , I could not , for that the accuser came masked by night , and told the forester , and straightway got him hence again , and so the forester knoweth him not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 15]: `` Then is this Unknown the only person who saw the stag killed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 43]: `` Marry , _ no _ man _ saw _ the killing , but this Unknown saw this hardy wretch near to the spot where the stag lay , and came with right loyal zeal and betrayed him to the forester . ''
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 12]: `` So the Unknown was near the dead stag , too ?
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 12]: Is n't it just possible that he did the killing himself ?
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 14]: His loyal zeal -- in a mask -- looks just a shade suspicious .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 12]: But what is your highness 's idea for racking the prisoner ?
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 6]: Where is the profit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 15]: `` He will not confess , else ; and then were his soul lost .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 23]: For his crime his life is forfeited by the law -- and of a surety will I see that he payeth it !
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 17]: -- but it were peril to my own soul to let him die unconfessed and unabsolved .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 18]: Nay , I were a fool to fling me into hell for _ his _ accommodation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 14]: `` But , your Highness , suppose he has nothing to confess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 11]: `` As to that , we shall see , anon .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 31]: An I rack him to death and he confess not , it will peradventure show that he had indeed naught to confess -- ye will grant that that is sooth ?
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 24]: Then shall I not be damned for an unconfessed man that had naught to confess -- wherefore , I shall be safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 9]: It was the stubborn unreasoning of the time .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 8]: It was useless to argue with her .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 20]: Arguments have no chance against petrified training ; they wear it as little as the waves wear a cliff .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 7]: And her training was everybody 's .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 19]: The brightest intellect in the land would not have been able to see that her position was defective .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 21]: As we entered the rack-cell I caught a picture that will not go from me ; I wish it would .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 33]: A native young giant of thirty or thereabouts lay stretched upon the frame on his back , with his wrists and ankles tied to ropes which led over windlasses at either end .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 21]: There was no color in him ; his features were contorted and set , and sweat-drops stood upon his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 62]: A priest bent over him on each side ; the executioner stood by ; guards were on duty ; smoking torches stood in sockets along the walls ; in a corner crouched a poor young creature , her face drawn with anguish , a half-wild and hunted look in her eyes , and in her lap lay a little child asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 45]: Just as we stepped across the threshold the executioner gave his machine a slight turn , which wrung a cry from both the prisoner and the woman ; but I shouted , and the executioner released the strain without waiting to see who spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 18]: I could not let this horror go on ; it would have killed me to see it .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 66]: I asked the queen to let me clear the place and speak to the prisoner privately ; and when she was going to object I spoke in a low voice and said I did not want to make a scene before her servants , but I must have my way ; for I was King Arthur 's representative , and was speaking in his name .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 7]: She saw she had to yield .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 15]: I asked her to indorse me to these people , and then leave me .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 24]: It was not pleasant for her , but she took the pill ; and even went further than I was meaning to require .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 27]: I only wanted the backing of her own authority ; but she said : `` Ye will do in all things as this lord shall command .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 6]: It is The Boss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 21]: It was certainly a good word to conjure with : you could see it by the squirming of these rats .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 36]: The queen 's guards fell into line , and she and they marched away , with their torch-bearers , and woke the echoes of the cavernous tunnels with the measured beat of their retreating footfalls .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 28]: I had the prisoner taken from the rack and placed upon his bed , and medicaments applied to his hurts , and wine given him to drink .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 51]: The woman crept near and looked on , eagerly , lovingly , but timorously , -- like one who fears a repulse ; indeed , she tried furtively to touch the man 's forehead , and jumped back , the picture of fright , when I turned unconsciously toward her .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 6]: It was pitiful to see .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 18]: `` Lord , '' I said , `` stroke him , lass , if you want to .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 14]: Do anything you 're a mind to ; do n't mind me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 22]: Why , her eyes were as grateful as an animal 's , when you do it a kindness that it understands .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 33]: The baby was out of her way and she had her cheek against the man 's in a minute and her hands fondling his hair , and her happy tears running down .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 18]: The man revived and caressed his wife with his eyes , which was all he could do .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 24]: I judged I might clear the den , now , and I did ; cleared it of all but the family and myself .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 25]: Then I said : `` Now , my friend , tell me your side of this matter ; I know the other side . ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 10]: The man moved his head in sign of refusal .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 17]: But the woman looked pleased -- as it seemed to me -- pleased with my suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 11]: I went on -- `` You know of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 9]: All do , in Arthur 's realms . ''
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 21]: `` If my reputation has come to you right and straight , you should not be afraid to speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 19]: The woman broke in , eagerly : `` Ah , fair my lord , do thou persuade him !
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 6]: Thou canst an thou wilt .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 17]: Ah , he suffereth so ; and it is for me -- for _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 7]: And how can I bear it ?
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 27]: I would I might see him die -- a sweet , swift death ; oh , my Hugo , I can not bear this one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 15]: And she fell to sobbing and grovelling about my feet , and still imploring .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 3]: Imploring what ?
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 5]: The man 's death ?
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 11]: I could not quite get the bearings of the thing .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 10]: But Hugo interrupted her and said : `` Peace !
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 7]: Ye wit not what ye ask .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 13]: Shall I starve whom I love , to win a gentle death ?
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 8]: I wend thou knewest me better . ''
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 16]: `` Well , '' I said , `` I ca n't quite make this out .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 5]: It is a puzzle .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 17]: Now -- '' `` Ah , dear my lord , an ye will but persuade him !
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 8]: Consider how these his tortures wound me !
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 8]: Oh , and he will not speak !
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 26]: -- whereas , the healing , the solace that lie in a blessed swift death -- '' `` What _ are _ you maundering about ?
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 20]: He 's going out from here a free man and whole -- he 's not going to die . ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 32]: The man 's white face lit up , and the woman flung herself at me in a most surprising explosion of joy , and cried out : `` He is saved !
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 27]: -- for it is the king 's word by the mouth of the king 's servant -- Arthur , the king whose word is gold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 15]: `` Well , then you do believe I can be trusted , after all .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 7]: Why did n't you before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 4]: `` Who doubted ?
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 10]: Not I , indeed ; and not she . ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 15]: `` Well , why would n't you tell me your story , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 14]: `` Ye had made no promise ; else had it been otherwise . ''
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 20]: `` I see , I see ... And yet I believe I do n't quite see , after all .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 32]: You stood the torture and refused to confess ; which shows plain enough to even the dullest understanding that you had nothing to confess -- '' `` I , my lord ?
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 3]: How so ?
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 9]: It was I that killed the deer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 6]: `` You _ did _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 36]: Oh , dear , this is the most mixed-up business that ever -- '' `` Dear lord , I begged him on my knees to confess , but -- '' `` You _ did _ !
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 6]: It gets thicker and thicker .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 11]: What did you want him to do that for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 18]: `` Sith it would bring him a quick death and save him all this cruel pain . ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 11]: `` Well -- yes , there is reason in that .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 12]: But _ he _ did n't want the quick death . ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 3]: `` He ?
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 11]: Why , of a surety he _ did _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 17]: `` Well , then , why in the world _ did n't _ he confess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 18]: `` Ah , sweet sir , and leave my wife and chick without bread and shelter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 12]: `` Oh , heart of gold , now I see it !
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 17]: The bitter law takes the convicted man 's estate and beggars his widow and his orphans .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 21]: They could torture you to death , but without conviction or confession they could not rob your wife and baby .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 59]: You stood by them like a man ; and _ you _ -- true wife and the woman that you are -- you would have bought him release from torture at cost to yourself of slow starvation and death -- well , it humbles a body to think what your sex can do when it comes to self-sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 35]: I 'll book you both for my colony ; you 'll like it there ; it 's a Factory where I 'm going to turn groping and grubbing automata into _ men _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 24]: CHAPTER XVIII IN THE QUEEN 'S DUNGEONS Well , I arranged all that ; and I had the man sent to his home .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 53]: I had a great desire to rack the executioner ; not because he was a good , painstaking and paingiving official , -- for surely it was not to his discredit that he performed his functions well -- but to pay him back for wantonly cuffing and otherwise distressing that young woman .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 16]: The priests told me about this , and were generously hot to have him punished .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 13]: Something of this disagreeable sort was turning up every now and then .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 53]: I mean , episodes that showed that not all priests were frauds and self-seekers , but that many , even the great majority , of these that were down on the ground among the common people , were sincere and right-hearted , and devoted to the alleviation of human troubles and sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 44]: Well , it was a thing which could not be helped , so I seldom fretted about it , and never many minutes at a time ; it has never been my way to bother much about things which you ca n't cure .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 24]: But I did not like it , for it was just the sort of thing to keep people reconciled to an Established Church .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 49]: We _ must _ have a religion -- it goes without saying -- but my idea is , to have it cut up into forty free sects , so that they will police each other , as had been the case in the United States in my time .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 61]: Concentration of power in a political machine is bad ; and an Established Church is only a political machine ; it was invented for that ; it is nursed , cradled , preserved for that ; it is an enemy to human liberty , and does no good which it could not better do in a split-up and scattered condition .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 49]: That was n't law ; it was n't gospel : it was only an opinion -- my opinion , and I was only a man , one man : so it was n't worth any more than the pope 's -- or any less , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 20]: Well , I could n't rack the executioner , neither would I overlook the just complaint of the priests .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 33]: The man must be punished somehow or other , so I degraded him from his office and made him leader of the band -- the new one that was to be started .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 30]: He begged hard , and said he could n't play -- a plausible excuse , but too thin ; there was n't a musician in the country that could .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 26]: The queen was a good deal outraged , next morning when she found she was going to have neither Hugo 's life nor his property .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 48]: But I told her she must bear this cross ; that while by law and custom she certainly was entitled to both the man 's life and his property , there were extenuating circumstances , and so in Arthur the king 's name I had pardoned him .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 45]: The deer was ravaging the man 's fields , and he had killed it in sudden passion , and not for gain ; and he had carried it into the royal forest in the hope that that might make detection of the misdoer impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 39]: Confound her , I could n't make her see that sudden passion is an extenuating circumstance in the killing of venison -- or of a person -- so I gave it up and let her sulk it out .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 30]: I _ did _ think I was going to make her see it by remarking that her own sudden passion in the case of the page modified that crime .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 4]: `` Crime ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 5]: `` How thou talkest !
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 4]: Crime , forsooth !
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 13]: Man , I am going to _ pay _ for him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 12]: Oh , it was no use to waste sense on her .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 17]: Training -- training is everything ; training is all there is _ to _ a person .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 30]: We speak of nature ; it is folly ; there is no such thing as nature ; what we call by that misleading name is merely heredity and training .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 24]: We have no thoughts of our own , no opinions of our own ; they are transmitted to us , trained into us .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 73]: All that is original in us , and therefore fairly creditable or discreditable to us , can be covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle , all the rest being atoms contributed by , and inherited from , a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years to the Adam-clam or grasshopper or monkey from whom our race has been so tediously and ostentatiously and unprofitably developed .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 66]: And as for me , all that I think about in this plodding sad pilgrimage , this pathetic drift between the eternities , is to look out and humbly live a pure and high and blameless life , and save that one microscopic atom in me that is truly _ me _ : the rest may land in Sheol and welcome for all I care .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 33]: No , confound her , her intellect was good , she had brains enough , but her training made her an ass -- that is , from a many-centuries-later point of view .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 26]: To kill the page was no crime -- it was her right ; and upon her right she stood , serenely and unconscious of offense .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 35]: She was a result of generations of training in the unexamined and unassailed belief that the law which permitted her to kill a subject when she chose was a perfectly right and righteous one .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 10]: Well , we must give even Satan his due .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 23]: She deserved a compliment for one thing ; and I tried to pay it , but the words stuck in my throat .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 21]: She had a right to kill the boy , but she was in no wise obliged to pay for him .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 13]: That was law for some other people , but not for her .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 44]: She knew quite well that she was doing a large and generous thing to pay for that lad , and that I ought in common fairness to come out with something handsome about it , but I could n't -- my mouth refused .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 39]: I could n't help seeing , in my fancy , that poor old grandma with the broken heart , and that fair young creature lying butchered , his little silken pomps and vanities laced with his golden blood .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 9]: How could she _ pay _ for him !
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 7]: _ Whom _ could she pay ?
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 36]: And so , well knowing that this woman , trained as she had been , deserved praise , even adulation , I was yet not able to utter it , trained as I had been .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 42]: The best I could do was to fish up a compliment from outside , so to speak -- and the pity of it was , that it was true : `` Madame , your people will adore you for this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 17]: Quite true , but I meant to hang her for it some day if I lived .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 12]: Some of those laws were too bad , altogether too bad .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 46]: A master might kill his slave for nothing -- for mere spite , malice , or to pass the time -- just as we have seen that the crowned head could do it with _ his _ slave , that is to say , anybody .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 17]: A gentleman could kill a free commoner , and pay for him -- cash or garden-truck .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 26]: A noble could kill a noble without expense , as far as the law was concerned , but reprisals in kind were to be expected .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 19]: _ Any_body could kill _ some_body , except the commoner and the slave ; these had no privileges .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 16]: If they killed , it was murder , and the law would n't stand murder .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 27]: It made short work of the experimenter -- and of his family , too , if he murdered somebody who belonged up among the ornamental ranks .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 104]: If a commoner gave a noble even so much as a Damiens-scratch which did n't kill or even hurt , he got Damiens ' dose for it just the same ; they pulled him to rags and tatters with horses , and all the world came to see the show , and crack jokes , and have a good time ; and some of the performances of the best people present were as tough , and as properly unprintable , as any that have been printed by the pleasant Casanova in his chapter about the dismemberment of Louis XV 's poor awkward enemy .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 44]: I had had enough of this grisly place by this time , and wanted to leave , but I could n't , because I had something on my mind that my conscience kept prodding me about , and would n't let me forget .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 15]: If I had the remaking of man , he would n't have any conscience .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 50]: It is one of the most disagreeable things connected with a person ; and although it certainly does a great deal of good , it can not be said to pay , in the long run ; it would be much better to have less good and more comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 25]: Still , this is only my opinion , and I am only one man ; others , with less experience , may think differently .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 8]: They have a right to their view .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 33]: I only stand to this : I have noticed my conscience for many years , and I know it is more trouble and bother to me than anything else I started with .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 28]: I suppose that in the beginning I prized it , because we prize anything that is ours ; and yet how foolish it was to think so .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 28]: If we look at it in another way , we see how absurd it is : if I had an anvil in me would I prize it ?
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 4]: Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 25]: And yet when you come to think , there is no real difference between a conscience and an anvil -- I mean for comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 8]: I have noticed it a thousand times .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 49]: And you could dissolve an anvil with acids , when you could n't stand it any longer ; but there is n't any way that you can work off a conscience -- at least so it will stay worked off ; not that I know of , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 25]: There was something I wanted to do before leaving , but it was a disagreeable matter , and I hated to go at it .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 9]: Well , it bothered me all the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 17]: I could have mentioned it to the old king , but what would be the use ?
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 51]: -- he was but an extinct volcano ; he had been active in his time , but his fire was out , this good while , he was only a stately ash-pile now ; gentle enough , and kindly enough for my purpose , without doubt , but not usable .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 16]: He was nothing , this so-called king : the queen was the only power there .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 6]: And she was a Vesuvius .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 33]: As a favor , she might consent to warm a flock of sparrows for you , but then she might take that very opportunity to turn herself loose and bury a city .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 31]: However , I reflected that as often as any other way , when you are expecting the worst , you get something that is not so bad , after all .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 13]: So I braced up and placed my matter before her royal Highness .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 39]: I said I had been having a general jail-delivery at Camelot and among neighboring castles , and with her permission I would like to examine her collection , her bric-a-brac -- that is to say , her prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 9]: She resisted ; but I was expecting that .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 5]: But she finally consented .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 12]: I was expecting that , too , but not so soon .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 6]: That about ended my discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 15]: She called her guards and torches , and we went down into the dungeons .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 21]: These were down under the castle 's foundations , and mainly were small cells hollowed out of the living rock .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 10]: Some of these cells had no light at all .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 96]: In one of them was a woman , in foul rags , who sat on the ground , and would not answer a question or speak a word , but only looked up at us once or twice , through a cobweb of tangled hair , as if to see what casual thing it might be that was disturbing with sound and light the meaningless dull dream that was become her life ; after that , she sat bowed , with her dirt-caked fingers idly interlocked in her lap , and gave no further sign .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 32]: This poor rack of bones was a woman of middle age , apparently ; but only apparently ; she had been there nine years , and was eighteen when she entered .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 67]: She was a commoner , and had been sent here on her bridal night by Sir Breuse Sance Pite , a neighboring lord whose vassal her father was , and to which said lord she had refused what has since been called le droit du seigneur , and , moreover , had opposed violence to violence and spilt half a gill of his almost sacred blood .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 57]: The young husband had interfered at that point , believing the bride 's life in danger , and had flung the noble out into the midst of the humble and trembling wedding guests , in the parlor , and left him there astonished at this strange treatment , and implacably embittered against both bride and groom .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 51]: The said lord being cramped for dungeon-room had asked the queen to accommodate his two criminals , and here in her bastile they had been ever since ; hither , indeed , they had come before their crime was an hour old , and had never seen each other since .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 37]: Here they were , kenneled like toads in the same rock ; they had passed nine pitch dark years within fifty feet of each other , yet neither knew whether the other was alive or not .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 39]: All the first years , their only question had been -- asked with beseechings and tears that might have moved stones , in time , perhaps , but hearts are not stones : `` Is he alive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 6]: `` Is she alive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 23]: But they had never got an answer ; and at last that question was not asked any more -- or any other .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 12]: I wanted to see the man , after hearing all this .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 10]: He was thirty-four years old , and looked sixty .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 40]: He sat upon a squared block of stone , with his head bent down , his forearms resting on his knees , his long hair hanging like a fringe before his face , and he was muttering to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 41]: He raised his chin and looked us slowly over , in a listless dull way , blinking with the distress of the torchlight , then dropped his head and fell to muttering again and took no further notice of us .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 9]: There were some pathetically suggestive dumb witnesses present .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 45]: On his wrists and ankles were cicatrices , old smooth scars , and fastened to the stone on which he sat was a chain with manacles and fetters attached ; but this apparatus lay idle on the ground , and was thick with rust .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 15]: Chains cease to be needed after the spirit has gone out of a prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 100]: I could not rouse the man ; so I said we would take him to her , and see -- to the bride who was the fairest thing in the earth to him , once -- roses , pearls , and dew made flesh , for him ; a wonder-work , the master-work of nature : with eyes like no other eyes , and voice like no other voice , and a freshness , and lithe young grace , and beauty , that belonged properly to the creatures of dreams -- as he thought -- and to no other .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 22]: The sight of her would set his stagnant blood leaping ; the sight of her -- But it was a disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 62]: They sat together on the ground and looked dimly wondering into each other 's faces a while , with a sort of weak animal curiosity ; then forgot each other 's presence , and dropped their eyes , and you saw that they were away again and wandering in some far land of dreams and shadows that we know nothing about .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 11]: I had them taken out and sent to their friends .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 8]: The queen did not like it much .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 22]: Not that she felt any personal interest in the matter , but she thought it disrespectful to Sir Breuse Sance Pite .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 23]: However , I assured her that if he found he could n't stand it I would fix him so that he could .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 18]: I set forty-seven prisoners loose out of those awful rat-holes , and left only one in captivity .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 19]: He was a lord , and had killed another lord , a sort of kinsman of the queen .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 24]: That other lord had ambushed him to assassinate him , but this fellow had got the best of him and cut his throat .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 28]: However , it was not for that that I left him jailed , but for maliciously destroying the only public well in one of his wretched villages .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 28]: The queen was bound to hang him for killing her kinsman , but I would not allow it : it was no crime to kill an assassin .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 32]: But I said I was willing to let her hang him for destroying the well ; so she concluded to put up with that , as it was better than nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 20]: Dear me , for what trifling offenses the most of those forty-seven men and women were shut up there !
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 35]: Indeed , some were there for no distinct offense at all , but only to gratify somebody 's spite ; and not always the queen 's by any means , but a friend 's .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 14]: The newest prisoner 's crime was a mere remark which he had made .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 22]: He said he believed that men were about all alike , and one man as good as another , barring clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 40]: He said he believed that if you were to strip the nation naked and send a stranger through the crowd , he could n't tell the king from a quack doctor , nor a duke from a hotel clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 19]: Apparently here was a man whose brains had not been reduced to an ineffectual mush by idiotic training .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 11]: I set him loose and sent him to the Factory .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 49]: Some of the cells carved in the living rock were just behind the face of the precipice , and in each of these an arrow-slit had been pierced outward to the daylight , and so the captive had a thin ray from the blessed sun for his comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 12]: The case of one of these poor fellows was particularly hard .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 51]: From his dusky swallow 's hole high up in that vast wall of native rock he could peer out through the arrow-slit and see his own home off yonder in the valley ; and for twenty-two years he had watched it , with heartache and longing , through that crack .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 46]: He could see the lights shine there at night , and in the daytime he could see figures go in and come out -- his wife and children , some of them , no doubt , though he could not make out at that distance .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 27]: In the course of years he noted festivities there , and tried to rejoice , and wondered if they were weddings or what they might be .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 11]: And he noted funerals ; and they wrung his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 27]: He could make out the coffin , but he could not determine its size , and so could not tell whether it was wife or child .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 23]: He could see the procession form , with priests and mourners , and move solemnly away , bearing the secret with them .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 35]: He had left behind him five children and a wife ; and in nineteen years he had seen five funerals issue , and none of them humble enough in pomp to denote a servant .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 30]: So he had lost five of his treasures ; there must still be one remaining -- one now infinitely , unspeakably precious , -- but _ which _ one ?
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 5]: wife , or child ?
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 18]: That was the question that tortured him , by night and by day , asleep and awake .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 38]: Well , to have an interest , of some sort , and half a ray of light , when you are in a dungeon , is a great support to the body and preserver of the intellect .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 9]: This man was in pretty good condition yet .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 63]: By the time he had finished telling me his distressful tale , I was in the same state of mind that you would have been in yourself , if you have got average human curiosity ; that is to say , I was as burning up as he was to find out which member of the family it was that was left .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 39]: So I took him over home myself ; and an amazing kind of a surprise party it was , too -- typhoons and cyclones of frantic joy , and whole Niagaras of happy tears ; and by George !
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 44]: we found the aforetime young matron graying toward the imminent verge of her half century , and the babies all men and women , and some of them married and experimenting familywise themselves -- for not a soul of the tribe was dead !
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 68]: Conceive of the ingenious devilishness of that queen : she had a special hatred for this prisoner , and she had _ invented _ all those funerals herself , to scorch his heart with ; and the sublimest stroke of genius of the whole thing was leaving the family-invoice a funeral _ short _ , so as to let him wear his poor old soul out guessing .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 11]: But for me , he never would have got out .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 19]: Morgan le Fay hated him with her whole heart , and she never would have softened toward him .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 13]: And yet his crime was committed more in thoughtlessness than deliberate depravity .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 8]: He had said she had red hair .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 15]: Well , she had ; but that was no way to speak of it .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 14]: When red-headed people are above a certain social grade their hair is auburn .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 24]: Consider it : among these forty-seven captives there were five whose names , offenses , and dates of incarceration were no longer known !
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 16]: One woman and four men -- all bent , and wrinkled , and mind-extinguished patriarchs .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 33]: They themselves had long ago forgotten these details ; at any rate they had mere vague theories about them , nothing definite and nothing that they repeated twice in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 70]: The succession of priests whose office it had been to pray daily with the captives and remind them that God had put them there , for some wise purpose or other , and teach them that patience , humbleness , and submission to oppression was what He loved to see in parties of a subordinate rank , had traditions about these poor old human ruins , but nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 25]: These traditions went but little way , for they concerned the length of the incarceration only , and not the names of the offenses .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 38]: And even by the help of tradition the only thing that could be proven was that none of the five had seen daylight for thirty-five years : how much longer this privation has lasted was not guessable .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 31]: The king and the queen knew nothing about these poor creatures , except that they were heirlooms , assets inherited , along with the throne , from the former firm .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 31]: Nothing of their history had been transmitted with their persons , and so the inheriting owners had considered them of no value , and had felt no interest in them .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 20]: I said to the queen : `` Then why in the world did n't you set them free ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 6]: The question was a puzzler .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 21]: She did n't know _ why _ she had n't , the thing had never come up in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 21]: So here she was , forecasting the veritable history of future prisoners of the Castle d'If , without knowing it .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 25]: It seemed plain to me now , that with her training , those inherited prisoners were merely property -- nothing more , nothing less .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 26]: Well , when we inherit property , it does not occur to us to throw it away , even when we do not value it .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 43]: When I brought my procession of human bats up into the open world and the glare of the afternoon sun -- previously blindfolding them , in charity for eyes so long untortured by light -- they were a spectacle to look at .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 27]: Skeletons , scarecrows , goblins , pathetic frights , every one ; legitimatest possible children of Monarchy by the Grace of God and the Established Church .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 15]: I muttered absently : `` I _ wish _ I could photograph them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 25]: You have seen that kind of people who will never let on that they do n't know the meaning of a new big word .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 22]: The more ignorant they are , the more pitifully certain they are to pretend you have n't shot over their heads .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 21]: The queen was just one of that sort , and was always making the stupidest blunders by reason of it .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 24]: She hesitated a moment ; then her face brightened up with sudden comprehension , and she said she would do it for me .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 7]: I thought to myself : She ?
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 8]: why what can she know about photography ?
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 10]: But it was a poor time to be thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 15]: When I looked around , she was moving on the procession with an axe !
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 14]: Well , she certainly was a curious one , was Morgan le Fay .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 22]: I have seen a good many kinds of women in my time , but she laid over them all for variety .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 10]: And how sharply characteristic of her this episode was .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 34]: She had no more idea than a horse of how to photograph a procession ; but being in doubt , it was just like her to try to do it with an axe .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 22]: CHAPTER XIX KNIGHT-ERRANTRY AS A TRADE Sandy and I were on the road again , next morning , bright and early .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 52]: It was so good to open up one 's lungs and take in whole luscious barrels-ful of the blessed God 's untainted , dew-fashioned , woodland-scented air once more , after suffocating body and mind for two days and nights in the moral and physical stenches of that intolerable old buzzard-roost !
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 31]: I mean , for me : of course the place was all right and agreeable enough for Sandy , for she had been used to high life all her days .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 24]: Poor girl , her jaws had had a wearisome rest now for a while , and I was expecting to get the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 115]: I was right ; but she had stood by me most helpfully in the castle , and had mightily supported and reinforced me with gigantic foolishnesses which were worth more for the occasion than wisdoms double their size ; so I thought she had earned a right to work her mill for a while , if she wanted to , and I felt not a pang when she started it up : `` Now turn we unto Sir Marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty winter of age southward -- '' `` Are you going to see if you can work up another half-stretch on the trail of the cowboys , Sandy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 9]: `` Even so , fair my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 6]: `` Go ahead , then .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 13]: I wo n't interrupt this time , if I can help it .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 26]: Begin over again ; start fair , and shake out all your reefs , and I will load my pipe and give good attention . ''
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 19]: `` Now turn we unto Sir Marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty winter of age southward .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 47]: And so they came into a deep forest , and by fortune they were nighted , and rode along in a deep way , and at the last they came into a courtelage where abode the duke of South Marches , and there they asked harbour .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 18]: And on the morn the duke sent unto Sir Marhaus , and bad him make him ready .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 43]: And so Sir Marhaus arose and armed him , and there was a mass sung afore him , and he brake his fast , and so mounted on horseback in the court of the castle , there they should do the battle .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 60]: So there was the duke already on horseback , clean armed , and his six sons by him , and every each had a spear in his hand , and so they encountered , whereas the duke and his two sons brake their spears upon him , but Sir Marhaus held up his spear and touched none of them .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 23]: Then came the four sons by couples , and two of them brake their spears , and so did the other two .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 10]: And all this while Sir Marhaus touched them not .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 23]: Then Sir Marhaus ran to the duke , and smote him with his spear that horse and man fell to the earth .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 7]: And so he served his sons .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 20]: And then Sir Marhaus alight down , and bad the duke yield him or else he would slay him .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 16]: And then some of his sons recovered , and would have set upon Sir Marhaus .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 23]: Then Sir Marhaus said to the duke , Cease thy sons , or else I will do the uttermost to you all .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 27]: When the duke saw he might not escape the death , he cried to his sons , and charged them to yield them to Sir Marhaus .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 22]: And they kneeled all down and put the pommels of their swords to the knight , and so he received them .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 48]: And then they holp up their father , and so by their common assent promised unto Sir Marhaus never to be foes unto King Arthur , and thereupon at Whitsuntide after , to come he and his sons , and put them in the king 's grace .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 19]: * -LSB- * Footnote : The story is borrowed , language and all , from the Morte d'Arthur .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 14]: -- M.T. -RSB- `` Even so standeth the history , fair Sir Boss .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 31]: Now ye shall wit that that very duke and his six sons are they whom but few days past you also did overcome and send to Arthur 's court ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 12]: `` Why , Sandy , you ca n't mean it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 16]: `` An I speak not sooth , let it be the worse for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 16]: `` Well , well , well , -- now who would ever have thought it ?
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 17]: One whole duke and six dukelets ; why , Sandy , it was an elegant haul .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 38]: Knight-errantry is a most chuckle-headed trade , and it is tedious hard work , too , but I begin to see that there _ is _ money in it , after all , if you have luck .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 17]: Not that I would ever engage in it as a business , for I would n't .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 14]: No sound and legitimate business can be established on a basis of speculation .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 26]: A successful whirl in the knight-errantry line -- now what is it when you blow away the nonsense and come down to the cold facts ?
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 23]: It 's just a corner in pork , that 's all , and you ca n't make anything else out of it .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 43]: You 're rich -- yes , -- suddenly rich -- for about a day , maybe a week ; then somebody corners the market on _ you _ , and down goes your bucket-shop ; ai n't that so , Sandy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 59]: `` Whethersoever it be that my mind miscarrieth , bewraying simple language in such sort that the words do seem to come endlong and overthwart -- '' `` There 's no use in beating about the bush and trying to get around it that way , Sandy , it 's _ so _ , just as I say .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 8]: I _ know _ it 's so .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 66]: And , moreover , when you come right down to the bedrock , knight-errantry is _ worse _ than pork ; for whatever happens , the pork 's left , and so somebody 's benefited anyway ; but when the market breaks , in a knight-errantry whirl , and every knight in the pool passes in his checks , what have you got for assets ?
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 15]: Just a rubbish-pile of battered corpses and a barrel or two of busted hardware .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 8]: Can you call _ those _ assets ?
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 7]: Give me pork , every time .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 5]: Am I right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 51]: `` Ah , peradventure my head being distraught by the manifold matters whereunto the confusions of these but late adventured haps and fortunings whereby not I alone nor you alone , but every each of us , meseemeth -- '' `` No , it 's not your head , Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 26]: Your head 's all right , as far as it goes , but you do n't know business ; that 's where the trouble is .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 17]: It unfits you to argue about business , and you 're wrong to be always trying .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 26]: However , that aside , it was a good haul , anyway , and will breed a handsome crop of reputation in Arthur 's court .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 21]: And speaking of the cowboys , what a curious country this is for women and men that never get old .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 53]: Now there 's Morgan le Fay , as fresh and young as a Vassar pullet , to all appearances , and here is this old duke of the South Marches still slashing away with sword and lance at his time of life , after raising such a family as he has raised .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 29]: As I understand it , Sir Gawaine killed seven of his sons , and still he had six left for Sir Marhaus and me to take into camp .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 27]: And then there was that damsel of sixty winter of age still excursioning around in her frosty bloom -- How old are you , Sandy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 14]: It was the first time I ever struck a still place in her .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 11]: The mill had shut down for repairs , or something .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 46]: CHAPTER XX THE OGRE 'S CASTLE Between six and nine we made ten miles , which was plenty for a horse carrying triple -- man , woman , and armor ; then we stopped for a long nooning under some trees by a limpid brook .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 74]: Right so came by and by a knight riding ; and as he drew near he made dolorous moan , and by the words of it I perceived that he was cursing and swearing ; yet nevertheless was I glad of his coming , for that I saw he bore a bulletin-board whereon in letters all of shining gold was writ : `` USE PETERSON 'S PROPHYLACTIC TOOTH-BRUSH -- ALL THE GO . ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 20]: I was glad of his coming , for even by this token I knew him for knight of mine .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 33]: It was Sir Madok de la Montaine , a burly great fellow whose chief distinction was that he had come within an ace of sending Sir Launcelot down over his horse-tail once .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 22]: He was never long in a stranger 's presence without finding some pretext or other to let out that great fact .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 50]: But there was another fact of nearly the same size , which he never pushed upon anybody unasked , and yet never withheld when asked : that was , that the reason he did n't quite succeed was , that he was interrupted and sent down over horse-tail himself .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 15]: This innocent vast lubber did not see any particular difference between the two facts .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 16]: I liked him , for he was earnest in his work , and very valuable .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 50]: And he was so fine to look at , with his broad mailed shoulders , and the grand leonine set of his plumed head , and his big shield with its quaint device of a gauntleted hand clutching a prophylactic tooth-brush , with motto : `` Try Noyoudont . ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 9]: This was a tooth-wash that I was introducing .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 19]: He was aweary , he said , and indeed he looked it ; but he would not alight .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 20]: He said he was after the stove-polish man ; and with this he broke out cursing and swearing anew .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 44]: The bulletin-boarder referred to was Sir Ossaise of Surluse , a brave knight , and of considerable celebrity on account of his having tried conclusions in a tournament once , with no less a Mogul than Sir Gaheris himself -- although not successfully .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 19]: He was of a light and laughing disposition , and to him nothing in this world was serious .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 17]: It was for this reason that I had chosen him to work up a stove-polish sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 16]: There were no stoves yet , and so there could be nothing serious about stove-polish .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 41]: All that the agent needed to do was to deftly and by degrees prepare the public for the great change , and have them established in predilections toward neatness against the time when the stove should appear upon the stage .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 13]: Sir Madok was very bitter , and brake out anew with cursings .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 46]: He said he had cursed his soul to rags ; and yet he would not get down from his horse , neither would he take any rest , or listen to any comfort , until he should have found Sir Ossaise and settled this account .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 70]: It appeared , by what I could piece together of the unprofane fragments of his statement , that he had chanced upon Sir Ossaise at dawn of the morning , and been told that if he would make a short cut across the fields and swamps and broken hills and glades , he could head off a company of travelers who would be rare customers for prophylactics and tooth-wash .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 27]: With characteristic zeal Sir Madok had plunged away at once upon this quest , and after three hours of awful crosslot riding had overhauled his game .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 19]: And behold , it was the five patriarchs that had been released from the dungeons the evening before !
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 33]: Poor old creatures , it was all of twenty years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 66]: `` Blank-blank-blank him , '' said Sir Madok , `` an I do not stove-polish him an I may find him , leave it to me ; for never no knight that hight Ossaise or aught else may do me this disservice and bide on live , an I may find him , the which I have thereunto sworn a great oath this day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 17]: And with these words and others , he lightly took his spear and gat him thence .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 24]: In the middle of the afternoon we came upon one of those very patriarchs ourselves , in the edge of a poor village .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 60]: He was basking in the love of relatives and friends whom he had not seen for fifty years ; and about him and caressing him were also descendants of his own body whom he had never seen at all till now ; but to him these were all strangers , his memory was gone , his mind was stagnant .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 36]: It seemed incredible that a man could outlast half a century shut up in a dark hole like a rat , but here were his old wife and some old comrades to testify to it .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 38]: They could remember him as he was in the freshness and strength of his young manhood , when he kissed his child and delivered it to its mother 's hands and went away into that long oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 95]: The people at the castle could not tell within half a generation the length of time the man had been shut up there for his unrecorded and forgotten offense ; but this old wife knew ; and so did her old child , who stood there among her married sons and daughters trying to realize a father who had been to her a name , a thought , a formless image , a tradition , all her life , and now was suddenly concreted into actual flesh and blood and set before her face .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 36]: It was a curious situation ; yet it is not on that account that I have made room for it here , but on account of a thing which seemed to me still more curious .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 20]: To wit , that this dreadful matter brought from these downtrodden people no outburst of rage against these oppressors .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 22]: They had been heritors and subjects of cruelty and outrage so long that nothing could have startled them but a kindness .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 23]: Yes , here was a curious revelation , indeed , of the depth to which this people had been sunk in slavery .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 27]: Their entire being was reduced to a monotonous dead level of patience , resignation , dumb uncomplaining acceptance of whatever might befall them in this life .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 6]: Their very imagination was dead .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 25]: When you can say that of a man , he has struck bottom , I reckon ; there is no lower deep for him .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 10]: I rather wished I had gone some other road .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 23]: This was not the sort of experience for a statesman to encounter who was planning out a peaceful revolution in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 61]: For it could not help bringing up the unget-aroundable fact that , all gentle cant and philosophizing to the contrary notwithstanding , no people in the world ever did achieve their freedom by goody-goody talk and moral suasion : it being immutable law that all revolutions that will succeed must _ begin _ in blood , whatever may answer afterward .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 9]: If history teaches anything , it teaches that .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 25]: What this folk needed , then , was a Reign of Terror and a guillotine , and I was the wrong man for them .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 18]: Two days later , toward noon , Sandy began to show signs of excitement and feverish expectancy .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 10]: She said we were approaching the ogre 's castle .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 8]: I was surprised into an uncomfortable shock .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 40]: The object of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind ; this sudden resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing for a moment , and roused up in me a smart interest .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 20]: Sandy 's excitement increased every moment ; and so did mine , for that sort of thing is catching .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 6]: My heart got to thumping .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 23]: You ca n't reason with your heart ; it has its own laws , and thumps about things which the intellect scorns .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 45]: Presently , when Sandy slid from the horse , motioned me to stop , and went creeping stealthily , with her head bent nearly to her knees , toward a row of bushes that bordered a declivity , the thumpings grew stronger and quicker .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 32]: And they kept it up while she was gaining her ambush and getting her glimpse over the declivity ; and also while I was creeping to her side on my knees .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 24]: Her eyes were burning now , as she pointed with her finger , and said in a panting whisper : `` The castle !
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 3]: The castle !
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 7]: Lo , where it looms ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 7]: What a welcome disappointment I experienced !
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 6]: I said : `` Castle ?
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 17]: It is nothing but a pigsty ; a pigsty with a wattled fence around it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 6]: She looked surprised and distressed .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 20]: The animation faded out of her face ; and during many moments she was lost in thought and silent .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 22]: Then : `` It was not enchanted aforetime , '' she said in a musing fashion , as if to herself .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 69]: `` And how strange is this marvel , and how awful -- that to the one perception it is enchanted and dight in a base and shameful aspect ; yet to the perception of the other it is not enchanted , hath suffered no change , but stands firm and stately still , girt with its moat and waving its banners in the blue air from its towers .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 26]: And God shield us , how it pricks the heart to see again these gracious captives , and the sorrow deepened in their sweet faces !
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 11]: We have tarried along , and are to blame . ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 5]: I saw my cue .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 13]: The castle was enchanted to _ me _ , not to her .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 27]: It would be wasted time to try to argue her out of her delusion , it could n't be done ; I must just humor it .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 29]: So I said : `` This is a common case -- the enchanting of a thing to one eye and leaving it in its proper form to another .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 18]: You have heard of it before , Sandy , though you have n't happened to experience it .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 6]: But no harm is done .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 11]: In fact , it is lucky the way it is .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 38]: If these ladies were hogs to everybody and to themselves , it would be necessary to break the enchantment , and that might be impossible if one failed to find out the particular process of the enchantment .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 75]: And hazardous , too ; for in attempting a disenchantment without the true key , you are liable to err , and turn your hogs into dogs , and the dogs into cats , the cats into rats , and so on , and end by reducing your materials to nothing finally , or to an odorless gas which you ca n't follow -- which , of course , amounts to the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 29]: But here , by good luck , no one 's eyes but mine are under the enchantment , and so it is of no consequence to dissolve it .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 57]: These ladies remain ladies to you , and to themselves , and to everybody else ; and at the same time they will suffer in no way from my delusion , for when I know that an ostensible hog is a lady , that is enough for me , I know how to treat her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 15]: `` Thanks , oh , sweet my lord , thou talkest like an angel .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 43]: And I know that thou wilt deliver them , for that thou art minded to great deeds and art as strong a knight of your hands and as brave to will and to do , as any that is on live . ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 13]: `` I will not leave a princess in the sty , Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 25]: Are those three yonder that to my disordered eyes are starveling swine-herds -- '' `` The ogres , Are _ they _ changed also ?
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 5]: It is most wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 26]: Now am I fearful ; for how canst thou strike with sure aim when five of their nine cubits of stature are to thee invisible ?
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 18]: Ah , go warily , fair sir ; this is a mightier emprise than I wend . ''
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 7]: `` You be easy , Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 26]: All I need to know is , how _ much _ of an ogre is invisible ; then I know how to locate his vitals .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 15]: Do n't you be afraid , I will make short work of these bunco-steerers .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 6]: Stay where you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 28]: I left Sandy kneeling there , corpse-faced but plucky and hopeful , and rode down to the pigsty , and struck up a trade with the swine-herds .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 25]: I won their gratitude by buying out all the hogs at the lump sum of sixteen pennies , which was rather above latest quotations .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 50]: I was just in time ; for the Church , the lord of the manor , and the rest of the tax-gatherers would have been along next day and swept off pretty much all the stock , leaving the swine-herds very short of hogs and Sandy out of princesses .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 20]: But now the tax people could be paid in cash , and there would be a stake left besides .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 70]: One of the men had ten children ; and he said that last year when a priest came and of his ten pigs took the fattest one for tithes , the wife burst out upon him , and offered him a child and said : `` Thou beast without bowels of mercy , why leave me my child , yet rob me of the wherewithal to feed it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 3]: How curious .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 35]: The same thing had happened in the Wales of my day , under this same old Established Church , which was supposed by many to have changed its nature when it changed its disguise .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 36]: I sent the three men away , and then opened the sty gate and beckoned Sandy to come -- which she did ; and not leisurely , but with the rush of a prairie fire .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 56]: And when I saw her fling herself upon those hogs , with tears of joy running down her cheeks , and strain them to her heart , and kiss them , and caress them , and call them reverently by grand princely names , I was ashamed of her , ashamed of the human race .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 21]: We had to drive those hogs home -- ten miles ; and no ladies were ever more fickle-minded or contrary .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 41]: They would stay in no road , no path ; they broke out through the brush on all sides , and flowed away in all directions , over rocks , and hills , and the roughest places they could find .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 25]: And they must not be struck , or roughly accosted ; Sandy could not bear to see them treated in ways unbecoming their rank .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 22]: The troublesomest old sow of the lot had to be called my Lady , and your Highness , like the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 14]: It is annoying and difficult to scour around after hogs , in armor .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 28]: There was one small countess , with an iron ring in her snout and hardly any hair on her back , that was the devil for perversity .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 35]: She gave me a race of an hour , over all sorts of country , and then we were right where we had started from , having made not a rod of real progress .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 15]: I seized her at last by the tail , and brought her along squealing .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 25]: When I overtook Sandy she was horrified , and said it was in the last degree indelicate to drag a countess by her train .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 13]: We got the hogs home just at dark -- most of them .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 81]: The princess Nerovens de Morganore was missing , and two of her ladies in waiting : namely , Miss Angela Bohun , and the Demoiselle Elaine Courtemains , the former of these two being a young black sow with a white star in her forehead , and the latter a brown one with thin legs and a slight limp in the forward shank on the starboard side -- a couple of the tryingest blisters to drive that I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 45]: Also among the missing were several mere baronesses -- and I wanted them to stay missing ; but no , all that sausage-meat had to be found ; so servants were sent out with torches to scour the woods and hills to that end .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 17]: Of course , the whole drove was housed in the house , and , great guns !
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 10]: -- well , I never saw anything like it .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 7]: Nor ever heard anything like it .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 7]: And never smelt anything like it .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 9]: It was like an insurrection in a gasometer .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 35]: CHAPTER XXI THE PILGRIMS When I did get to bed at last I was unspeakably tired ; the stretching out , and the relaxing of the long-tense muscles , how luxurious , how delicious !
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 20]: but that was as far as I could get -- sleep was out of the question for the present .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 27]: The ripping and tearing and squealing of the nobility up and down the halls and corridors was pandemonium come again , and kept me broad awake .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 22]: Being awake , my thoughts were busy , of course ; and mainly they busied themselves with Sandy 's curious delusion .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 30]: Here she was , as sane a person as the kingdom could produce ; and yet , from my point of view she was acting like a crazy woman .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 8]: My land , the power of training !
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 3]: of influence !
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 3]: of education !
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 10]: It can bring a body up to believe anything .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 18]: I had to put myself in Sandy 's place to realize that she was not a lunatic .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 32]: Yes , and put her in mine , to demonstrate how easy it is to seem a lunatic to a person who has not been taught as you have been taught .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 87]: If I had told Sandy I had seen a wagon , uninfluenced by enchantment , spin along fifty miles an hour ; had seen a man , unequipped with magic powers , get into a basket and soar out of sight among the clouds ; and had listened , without any necromancer 's help , to the conversation of a person who was several hundred miles away , Sandy would not merely have supposed me to be crazy , she would have thought she knew it .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 68]: Everybody around her believed in enchantments ; nobody had any doubts ; to doubt that a castle could be turned into a sty , and its occupants into hogs , would have been the same as my doubting among Connecticut people the actuality of the telephone and its wonders , -- and in both cases would be absolute proof of a diseased mind , an unsettled reason .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 11]: Yes , Sandy was sane ; that must be admitted .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 29]: If I also would be sane -- to Sandy -- I must keep my superstitions about unenchanted and unmiraculous locomotives , balloons , and telephones , to myself .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 91]: Also , I believed that the world was not flat , and had n't pillars under it to support it , nor a canopy over it to turn off a universe of water that occupied all space above ; but as I was the only person in the kingdom afflicted with such impious and criminal opinions , I recognized that it would be good wisdom to keep quiet about this matter , too , if I did not wish to be suddenly shunned and forsaken by everybody as a madman .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 60]: The next morning Sandy assembled the swine in the dining-room and gave them their breakfast , waiting upon them personally and manifesting in every way the deep reverence which the natives of her island , ancient and modern , have always felt for rank , let its outward casket and the mental and moral contents be what they may .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 34]: I could have eaten with the hogs if I had had birth approaching my lofty official rank ; but I had n't , and so accepted the unavoidable slight and made no complaint .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 11]: Sandy and I had our breakfast at the second table .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 7]: The family were not at home .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 21]: I said : `` How many are in the family , Sandy , and where do they keep themselves ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 4]: `` Family ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 9]: `` Which family , good my lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 11]: `` Why , this family ; your own family . ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 10]: `` Sooth to say , I understand you not .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 6]: I have no family . ''
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 4]: `` No family ?
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 11]: Why , Sandy , is n't this your home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 8]: `` Now how indeed might that be ?
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 6]: I have no home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 11]: `` Well , then , whose house is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 16]: `` Ah , wit you well I would tell you an I knew myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 11]: `` Come -- you do n't even know these people ?
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 7]: Then who invited us here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 5]: `` None invited us .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 9]: We but came ; that is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 12]: `` Why , woman , this is a most extraordinary performance .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 8]: The effrontery of it is beyond admiration .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 44]: We blandly march into a man 's house , and cram it full of the only really valuable nobility the sun has yet discovered in the earth , and then it turns out that we do n't even know the man 's name .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 11]: How did you ever venture to take this extravagant liberty ?
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 11]: I supposed , of course , it was your home .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 7]: What will the man say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 6]: `` What will he say ?
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 10]: Forsooth what can he say but give thanks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 6]: `` Thanks for what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 20]: Her face was filled with a puzzled surprise : `` Verily , thou troublest mine understanding with strange words .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 33]: Do ye dream that one of his estate is like to have the honor twice in his life to entertain company such as we have brought to grace his house withal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 11]: `` Well , no -- when you come to that .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 22]: No , it 's an even bet that this is the first time he has had a treat like this . ''
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 34]: `` Then let him be thankful , and manifest the same by grateful speech and due humility ; he were a dog , else , and the heir and ancestor of dogs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 9]: To my mind , the situation was uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 6]: It might become more so .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 14]: It might be a good idea to muster the hogs and move on .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 12]: So I said : `` The day is wasting , Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 13]: It is time to get the nobility together and be moving . ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 9]: `` Wherefore , fair sir and Boss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 15]: `` We want to take them to their home , do n't we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 8]: `` La , but list to him !
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 10]: They be of all the regions of the earth !
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 137]: Each must hie to her own home ; wend you we might do all these journeys in one so brief life as He hath appointed that created life , and thereto death likewise with help of Adam , who by sin done through persuasion of his helpmeet , she being wrought upon and bewrayed by the beguilements of the great enemy of man , that serpent hight Satan , aforetime consecrated and set apart unto that evil work by overmastering spite and envy begotten in his heart through fell ambitions that did blight and mildew a nature erst so white and pure whenso it hove with the shining multitudes its brethren-born in glade and shade of that fair heaven wherein all such as native be to that rich estate and -- '' `` Great Scott ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 5]: `` My lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 16]: `` Well , you know we have n't got time for this sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 30]: Do n't you see , we could distribute these people around the earth in less time than it is going to take you to explain that we ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 10]: We must n't talk now , we must act .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 26]: You want to be careful ; you must n't let your mill get the start of you that way , at a time like this .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 10]: To business now -- and sharp 's the word .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 9]: Who is to take the aristocracy home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 5]: `` Even their friends .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 14]: These will come for them from the far parts of the earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 23]: This was lightning from a clear sky , for unexpectedness ; and the relief of it was like pardon to a prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 11]: She would remain to deliver the goods , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 43]: `` Well , then , Sandy , as our enterprise is handsomely and successfully ended , I will go home and report ; and if ever another one -- '' `` I also am ready ; I will go with thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 6]: This was recalling the pardon .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 3]: `` How ?
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 6]: You will go with me ?
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 5]: Why should you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 12]: `` Will I be traitor to my knight , dost think ?
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 4]: That were dishonor .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 24]: I may not part from thee until in knightly encounter in the field some overmatching champion shall fairly win and fairly wear me .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 14]: I were to blame an I thought that that might ever hap . ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 13]: `` Elected for the long term , '' I sighed to myself .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 12]: `` I may as well make the best of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 19]: So then I spoke up and said : `` All right ; let us make a start . ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 22]: While she was gone to cry her farewells over the pork , I gave that whole peerage away to the servants .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 51]: And I asked them to take a duster and dust around a little where the nobilities had mainly lodged and promenaded ; but they considered that that would be hardly worth while , and would moreover be a rather grave departure from custom , and therefore likely to make talk .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 21]: A departure from custom -- that settled it ; it was a nation capable of committing any crime but that .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 43]: The servants said they would follow the fashion , a fashion grown sacred through immemorial observance ; they would scatter fresh rushes in all the rooms and halls , and then the evidence of the aristocratic visitation would be no longer visible .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 60]: It was a kind of satire on Nature : it was the scientific method , the geologic method ; it deposited the history of the family in a stratified record ; and the antiquary could dig through it and tell by the remains of each period what changes of diet the family had introduced successively for a hundred years .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 13]: The first thing we struck that day was a procession of pilgrims .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 58]: It was not going our way , but we joined it , nevertheless ; for it was hourly being borne in upon me now , that if I would govern this country wisely , I must be posted in the details of its life , and not at second hand , but by personal observation and scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 37]: This company of pilgrims resembled Chaucer 's in this : that it had in it a sample of about all the upper occupations and professions the country could show , and a corresponding variety of costume .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 20]: There were young men and old men , young women and old women , lively folk and grave folk .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 32]: They rode upon mules and horses , and there was not a side-saddle in the party ; for this specialty was to remain unknown in England for nine hundred years yet .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 24]: It was a pleasant , friendly , sociable herd ; pious , happy , merry and full of unconscious coarsenesses and innocent indecencies .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 30]: What they regarded as the merry tale went the continual round and caused no more embarrassment than it would have caused in the best English society twelve centuries later .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 93]: Practical jokes worthy of the English wits of the first quarter of the far-off nineteenth century were sprung here and there and yonder along the line , and compelled the delightedest applause ; and sometimes when a bright remark was made at one end of the procession and started on its travels toward the other , you could note its progress all the way by the sparkling spray of laughter it threw off from its bows as it plowed along ; and also by the blushes of the mules in its wake .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 15]: Sandy knew the goal and purpose of this pilgrimage , and she posted me .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 33]: She said : `` They journey to the Valley of Holiness , for to be blessed of the godly hermits and drink of the miraculous waters and be cleansed from sin . ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 8]: `` Where is this watering place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 21]: `` It lieth a two-day journey hence , by the borders of the land that hight the Cuckoo Kingdom . ''
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 6]: `` Tell me about it .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 7]: Is it a celebrated place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 9]: `` Oh , of a truth , yes .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 6]: There be none more so .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 12]: Of old time there lived there an abbot and his monks .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 72]: Belike were none in the world more holy than these ; for they gave themselves to study of pious books , and spoke not the one to the other , or indeed to any , and ate decayed herbs and naught thereto , and slept hard , and prayed much , and washed never ; also they wore the same garment until it fell from their bodies through age and decay .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 29]: Right so came they to be known of all the world by reason of these holy austerities , and visited by rich and poor , and reverenced . ''
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 4]: `` Proceed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 10]: `` But always there was lack of water there .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 29]: Whereas , upon a time , the holy abbot prayed , and for answer a great stream of clear water burst forth by miracle in a desert place .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 55]: Now were the fickle monks tempted of the Fiend , and they wrought with their abbot unceasingly by beggings and beseechings that he would construct a bath ; and when he was become aweary and might not resist more , he said have ye your will , then , and granted that they asked .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 28]: Now mark thou what 't is to forsake the ways of purity the which He loveth , and wanton with such as be worldly and an offense .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 30]: These monks did enter into the bath and come thence washed as white as snow ; and lo , in that moment His sign appeared , in miraculous rebuke !
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 14]: for His insulted waters ceased to flow , and utterly vanished away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 20]: `` They fared mildly , Sandy , considering how that kind of crime is regarded in this country . ''
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 28]: `` Belike ; but it was their first sin ; and they had been of perfect life for long , and differing in naught from the angels .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 20]: Prayers , tears , torturings of the flesh , all was vain to beguile that water to flow again .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 29]: Even processions ; even burnt-offerings ; even votive candles to the Virgin , did fail every each of them ; and all in the land did marvel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 33]: `` How odd to find that even this industry has its financial panics , and at times sees its assignats and greenbacks languish to zero , and everything come to a standstill .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 6]: Go on , Sandy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 23]: `` And so upon a time , after year and day , the good abbot made humble surrender and destroyed the bath .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 36]: And behold , His anger was in that moment appeased , and the waters gushed richly forth again , and even unto this day they have not ceased to flow in that generous measure . ''
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 11]: `` Then I take it nobody has washed since . ''
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 24]: `` He that would essay it could have his halter free ; yes , and swiftly would he need it , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 8]: `` The community has prospered since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 7]: `` Even from that very day .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 11]: The fame of the miracle went abroad into all lands .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 44]: From every land came monks to join ; they came even as the fishes come , in shoals ; and the monastery added building to building , and yet others to these , and so spread wide its arms and took them in .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 40]: And nuns came , also ; and more again , and yet more ; and built over against the monastery on the yon side of the vale , and added building to building , until mighty was that nunnery .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 31]: And these were friendly unto those , and they joined their loving labors together , and together they built a fair great foundling asylum midway of the valley between . ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 10]: `` You spoke of some hermits , Sandy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 12]: `` These have gathered there from the ends of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 11]: A hermit thriveth best where there be multitudes of pilgrims .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 11]: Ye shall not find no hermit of no sort wanting .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 62]: If any shall mention a hermit of a kind he thinketh new and not to be found but in some far strange land , let him but scratch among the holes and caves and swamps that line that Valley of Holiness , and whatsoever be his breed , it skills not , he shall find a sample of it there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 85]: I closed up alongside of a burly fellow with a fat good-humored face , purposing to make myself agreeable and pick up some further crumbs of fact ; but I had hardly more than scraped acquaintance with him when he began eagerly and awkwardly to lead up , in the immemorial way , to that same old anecdote -- the one Sir Dinadan told me , what time I got into trouble with Sir Sagramor and was challenged of him on account of it .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 74]: I excused myself and dropped to the rear of the procession , sad at heart , willing to go hence from this troubled life , this vale of tears , this brief day of broken rest , of cloud and storm , of weary struggle and monotonous defeat ; and yet shrinking from the change , as remembering how long eternity is , and how many have wended thither who know that anecdote .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 40]: Early in the afternoon we overtook another procession of pilgrims ; but in this one was no merriment , no jokes , no laughter , no playful ways , nor any happy giddiness , whether of youth or age .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 42]: Yet both were here , both age and youth ; gray old men and women , strong men and women of middle age , young husbands , young wives , little boys and girls , and three babies at the breast .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 44]: Even the children were smileless ; there was not a face among all these half a hundred people but was cast down , and bore that set expression of hopelessness which is bred of long and hard trials and old acquaintance with despair .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 4]: They were slaves .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 49]: Chains led from their fettered feet and their manacled hands to a sole-leather belt about their waists ; and all except the children were also linked together in a file six feet apart , by a single chain which led from collar to collar all down the line .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 30]: They were on foot , and had tramped three hundred miles in eighteen days , upon the cheapest odds and ends of food , and stingy rations of that .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 14]: They had slept in these chains every night , bundled together like swine .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 19]: They had upon their bodies some poor rags , but they could not be said to be clothed .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 18]: Their irons had chafed the skin from their ankles and made sores which were ulcerated and wormy .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 13]: Their naked feet were torn , and none walked without a limp .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 20]: Originally there had been a hundred of these unfortunates , but about half had been sold on the trip .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 31]: The trader in charge of them rode a horse and carried a whip with a short handle and a long heavy lash divided into several knotted tails at the end .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 21]: With this whip he cut the shoulders of any that tottered from weariness and pain , and straightened them up .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 13]: He did not speak ; the whip conveyed his desire without that .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 21]: None of these poor creatures looked up as we rode along by ; they showed no consciousness of our presence .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 37]: And they made no sound but one ; that was the dull and awful clank of their chains from end to end of the long file , as forty-three burdened feet rose and fell in unison .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 11]: The file moved in a cloud of its own making .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 11]: All these faces were gray with a coating of dust .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 26]: One has seen the like of this coating upon furniture in unoccupied houses , and has written his idle thought in it with his finger .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 55]: I was reminded of this when I noticed the faces of some of those women , young mothers carrying babes that were near to death and freedom , how a something in their hearts was written in the dust upon their faces , plain to see , and lord , how plain to read !
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 8]: for it was the track of tears .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 87]: One of these young mothers was but a girl , and it hurt me to the heart to read that writing , and reflect that it was come up out of the breast of such a child , a breast that ought not to know trouble yet , but only the gladness of the morning of life ; and no doubt -- She reeled just then , giddy with fatigue , and down came the lash and flicked a flake of skin from her naked shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 11]: It stung me as if I had been hit instead .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 11]: The master halted the file and jumped from his horse .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 37]: He stormed and swore at this girl , and said she had made annoyance enough with her laziness , and as this was the last chance he should have , he would settle the account now .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 34]: She dropped on her knees and put up her hands and began to beg , and cry , and implore , in a passion of terror , but the master gave no attention .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 58]: He snatched the child from her , and then made the men-slaves who were chained before and behind her throw her on the ground and hold her there and expose her body ; and then he laid on with his lash like a madman till her back was flayed , she shrieking and struggling the while piteously .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 23]: One of the men who was holding her turned away his face , and for this humanity he was reviled and flogged .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 19]: All our pilgrims looked on and commented -- on the expert way in which the whip was handled .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 25]: They were too much hardened by lifelong everyday familiarity with slavery to notice that there was anything else in the exhibition that invited comment .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 45]: This was what slavery could do , in the way of ossifying what one may call the superior lobe of human feeling ; for these pilgrims were kind-hearted people , and they would not have allowed that man to treat a horse like that .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 19]: I wanted to stop the whole thing and set the slaves free , but that would not do .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 25]: I must not interfere too much and get myself a name for riding over the country 's laws and the citizen 's rights roughshod .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 42]: If I lived and prospered I would be the death of slavery , that I was resolved upon ; but I would try to fix it so that when I became its executioner it should be by command of the nation .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 36]: Just here was the wayside shop of a smith ; and now arrived a landed proprietor who had bought this girl a few miles back , deliverable here where her irons could be taken off .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 23]: They were removed ; then there was a squabble between the gentleman and the dealer as to which should pay the blacksmith .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 37]: The moment the girl was delivered from her irons , she flung herself , all tears and frantic sobbings , into the arms of the slave who had turned away his face when she was whipped .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 28]: He strained her to his breast , and smothered her face and the child 's with kisses , and washed them with the rain of his tears .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 3]: I suspected .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 12]: Yes , I was right ; it was husband and wife .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 57]: They had to be torn apart by force ; the girl had to be dragged away , and she struggled and fought and shrieked like one gone mad till a turn of the road hid her from sight ; and even after that , we could still make out the fading plaint of those receding shrieks .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 23]: And the husband and father , with his wife and child gone , never to be seen by him again in life ?
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 53]: -- well , the look of him one might not bear at all , and so I turned away ; but I knew I should never get his picture out of my mind again , and there it is to this day , to wring my heartstrings whenever I think of it .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 54]: We put up at the inn in a village just at nightfall , and when I rose next morning and looked abroad , I was ware where a knight came riding in the golden glory of the new day , and recognized him for knight of mine -- Sir Ozana le Cure Hardy .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 17]: He was in the gentlemen 's furnishing line , and his missionarying specialty was plug hats .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 51]: He was clothed all in steel , in the beautifulest armor of the time -- up to where his helmet ought to have been ; but he had n't any helmet , he wore a shiny stove-pipe hat , and was ridiculous a spectacle as one might want to see .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 17]: It was another of my surreptitious schemes for extinguishing knighthood by making it grotesque and absurd .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 38]: Sir Ozana 's saddle was hung about with leather hat boxes , and every time he overcame a wandering knight he swore him into my service and fitted him with a plug and made him wear it .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 14]: I dressed and ran down to welcome Sir Ozana and get his news .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 6]: `` How is trade ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 24]: `` Ye will note that I have but these four left ; yet were they sixteen whenas I got me from Camelot . ''
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 12]: `` Why , you have certainly done nobly , Sir Ozana .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 9]: Where have you been foraging of late ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 17]: `` I am but now come from the Valley of Holiness , please you sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 9]: `` I am pointed for that place myself .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 13]: Is there anything stirring in the monkery , more than common ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 10]: `` By the mass ye may not question it !
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 48]: ... Give him good feed , boy , and stint it not , an thou valuest thy crown ; so get ye lightly to the stable and do even as I bid ... Sir , it is parlous news I bring , and -- be these pilgrims ?
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 134]: Then ye may not do better , good folk , than gather and hear the tale I have to tell , sith it concerneth you , forasmuch as ye go to find that ye will not find , and seek that ye will seek in vain , my life being hostage for my word , and my word and message being these , namely : That a hap has happened whereof the like has not been seen no more but once this two hundred years , which was the first and last time that that said misfortune strake the holy valley in that form by commandment of the Most High whereto by reasons just and causes thereunto contributing , wherein the matter -- '' `` The miraculous fount hath ceased to flow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 10]: This shout burst from twenty pilgrim mouths at once .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 8]: `` Ye say well , good people .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 12]: I was verging to it , even when ye spake . ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 8]: `` Has somebody been washing again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 12]: `` Nay , it is suspected , but none believe it .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 15]: It is thought to be some other sin , but none wit what . ''
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 10]: `` How are they feeling about the calamity ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 8]: `` None may describe it in words .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 8]: The fount is these nine days dry .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 66]: The prayers that did begin then , and the lamentations in sackcloth and ashes , and the holy processions , none of these have ceased nor night nor day ; and so the monks and the nuns and the foundlings be all exhausted , and do hang up prayers writ upon parchment , sith that no strength is left in man to lift up voice .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 135]: And at last they sent for thee , Sir Boss , to try magic and enchantment ; and if you could not come , then was the messenger to fetch Merlin , and he is there these three days now , and saith he will fetch that water though he burst the globe and wreck its kingdoms to accomplish it ; and right bravely doth he work his magic and call upon his hellions to hie them hither and help , but not a whiff of moisture hath he started yet , even so much as might qualify as mist upon a copper mirror an ye count not the barrel of sweat he sweateth betwixt sun and sun over the dire labors of his task ; and if ye -- '' Breakfast was ready .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 35]: As soon as it was over I showed to Sir Ozana these words which I had written on the inside of his hat : `` Chemical Department , Laboratory extension , Section G. Pxxp .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 32]: Send two of first size , two of No. 3 , and six of No. 4 , together with the proper complementary details -- and two of my trained assistants . ''
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 46]: And I said : `` Now get you to Camelot as fast as you can fly , brave knight , and show the writing to Clarence , and tell him to have these required matters in the Valley of Holiness with all possible dispatch . ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 14]: `` I will well , Sir Boss , '' and he was off .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 11]: CHAPTER XXII THE HOLY FOUNTAIN The pilgrims were human beings .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 7]: Otherwise they would have acted differently .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 92]: They had come a long and difficult journey , and now when the journey was nearly finished , and they learned that the main thing they had come for had ceased to exist , they did n't do as horses or cats or angle-worms would probably have done -- turn back and get at something profitable -- no , anxious as they had before been to see the miraculous fountain , they were as much as forty times as anxious now to see the place where it had used to be .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 8]: There is no accounting for human beings .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 38]: We made good time ; and a couple of hours before sunset we stood upon the high confines of the Valley of Holiness , and our eyes swept it from end to end and noted its features .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 7]: That is , its large features .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 8]: These were the three masses of buildings .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 23]: They were distant and isolated temporalities shrunken to toy constructions in the lonely waste of what seemed a desert -- and was .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 20]: Such a scene is always mournful , it is so impressively still , and looks so steeped in death .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 59]: But there was a sound here which interrupted the stillness only to add to its mournfulness ; this was the faint far sound of tolling bells which floated fitfully to us on the passing breeze , and so faintly , so softly , that we hardly knew whether we heard it with our ears or with our spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 25]: We reached the monastery before dark , and there the males were given lodging , but the women were sent over to the nunnery .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 22]: The bells were close at hand now , and their solemn booming smote upon the ear like a message of doom .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 17]: A superstitious despair possessed the heart of every monk and published itself in his ghastly face .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 29]: Everywhere , these black-robed , soft-sandaled , tallow-visaged specters appeared , flitted about and disappeared , noiseless as the creatures of a troubled dream , and as uncanny .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 11]: The old abbot 's joy to see me was pathetic .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 11]: Even to tears ; but he did the shedding himself .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 16]: He said : `` Delay not , son , but get to thy saving work .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 27]: An we bring not the water back again , and soon , we are ruined , and the good work of two hundred years must end .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 30]: And see thou do it with enchantments that be holy , for the Church will not endure that work in her cause be done by devil 's magic . ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 20]: `` When I work , Father , be sure there will be no devil 's work connected with it .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 22]: I shall use no arts that come of the devil , and no elements not created by the hand of God .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 10]: But is Merlin working strictly on pious lines ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 26]: `` Ah , he said he would , my son , he said he would , and took oath to make his promise good . ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 12]: `` Well , in that case , let him proceed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 14]: `` But surely you will not sit idle by , but help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 18]: `` It will not answer to mix methods , Father ; neither would it be professional courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 10]: Two of a trade must not underbid each other .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 21]: We might as well cut rates and be done with it ; it would arrive at that in the end .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 18]: Merlin has the contract ; no other magician can touch it till he throws it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 21]: `` But I will take it from him ; it is a terrible emergency and the act is thereby justified .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 15]: And if it were not so , who will give law to the Church ?
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 24]: The Church giveth law to all ; and what she wills to do , that she may do , hurt whom it may .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 15]: I will take it from him ; you shall begin upon the moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 8]: `` It may not be , Father .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 32]: No doubt , as you say , where power is supreme , one can do as one likes and suffer no injury ; but we poor magicians are not so situated .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 19]: Merlin is a very good magician in a small way , and has quite a neat provincial reputation .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 30]: He is struggling along , doing the best he can , and it would not be etiquette for me to take his job until he himself abandons it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 6]: The abbot 's face lighted .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 7]: `` Ah , that is simple .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 11]: There are ways to persuade him to abandon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 14]: `` No-no , Father , it skills not , as these people say .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 28]: If he were persuaded against his will , he would load that well with a malicious enchantment which would balk me until I found out its secret .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 6]: It might take a month .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 28]: I could set up a little enchantment of mine which I call the telephone , and he could not find out its secret in a hundred years .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 13]: Yes , you perceive , he might block me for a month .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 15]: Would you like to risk a month in a dry time like this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 4]: `` A month !
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 10]: The mere thought of it maketh me to shudder .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 8]: Have it thy way , my son .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 9]: But my heart is heavy with this disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 47]: Leave me , and let me wear my spirit with weariness and waiting , even as I have done these ten long days , counterfeiting thus the thing that is called rest , the prone body making outward sign of repose where inwardly is none . ''
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 138]: Of course , it would have been best , all round , for Merlin to waive etiquette and quit and call it half a day , since he would never be able to start that water , for he was a true magician of the time ; which is to say , the big miracles , the ones that gave him his reputation , always had the luck to be performed when nobody but Merlin was present ; he could n't start this well with all this crowd around to see ; a crowd was as bad for a magician 's miracle in that day as it was for a spiritualist 's miracle in mine ; there was sure to be some skeptic on hand to turn up the gas at the crucial moment and spoil everything .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 46]: But I did not want Merlin to retire from the job until I was ready to take hold of it effectively myself ; and I could not do that until I got my things from Camelot , and that would take two or three days .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 32]: My presence gave the monks hope , and cheered them up a good deal ; insomuch that they ate a square meal that night for the first time in ten days .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 30]: As soon as their stomachs had been properly reinforced with food , their spirits began to rise fast ; when the mead began to go round they rose faster .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 36]: By the time everybody was half-seas over , the holy community was in good shape to make a night of it ; so we stayed by the board and put it through on that line .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 7]: Matters got to be very jolly .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 44]: Good old questionable stories were told that made the tears run down and cavernous mouths stand wide and the round bellies shake with laughter ; and questionable songs were bellowed out in a mighty chorus that drowned the boom of the tolling bells .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 16]: At last I ventured a story myself ; and vast was the success of it .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 84]: Not right off , of course , for the native of those islands does not , as a rule , dissolve upon the early applications of a humorous thing ; but the fifth time I told it , they began to crack in places ; the eight time I told it , they began to crumble ; at the twelfth repetition they fell apart in chunks ; and at the fifteenth they disintegrated , and I got a broom and swept them up .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 5]: This language is figurative .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 41]: Those islanders -- well , they are slow pay at first , in the matter of return for your investment of effort , but in the end they make the pay of all other nations poor and small by contrast .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 9]: I was at the well next day betimes .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 16]: Merlin was there , enchanting away like a beaver , but not raising the moisture .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 45]: He was not in a pleasant humor ; and every time I hinted that perhaps this contract was a shade too hefty for a novice he unlimbered his tongue and cursed like a bishop -- French bishop of the Regency days , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 10]: Matters were about as I expected to find them .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 26]: The `` fountain '' was an ordinary well , it had been dug in the ordinary way , and stoned up in the ordinary way .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 7]: There was no miracle about it .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 26]: Even the lie that had created its reputation was not miraculous ; I could have told it myself , with one hand tied behind me .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 54]: The well was in a dark chamber which stood in the center of a cut-stone chapel , whose walls were hung with pious pictures of a workmanship that would have made a chromo feel good ; pictures historically commemorative of curative miracles which had been achieved by the waters when nobody was looking .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 32]: That is , nobody but angels ; they are always on deck when there is a miracle to the fore -- so as to get put in the picture , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 17]: Angels are as fond of that as a fire company ; look at the old masters .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 54]: The well-chamber was dimly lighted by lamps ; the water was drawn with a windlass and chain by monks , and poured into troughs which delivered it into stone reservoirs outside in the chapel -- when there was water to draw , I mean -- and none but monks could enter the well-chamber .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 22]: I entered it , for I had temporary authority to do so , by courtesy of my professional brother and subordinate .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 8]: But he had n't entered it himself .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 12]: He did everything by incantations ; he never worked his intellect .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 71]: If he had stepped in there and used his eyes , instead of his disordered mind , he could have cured the well by natural means , and then turned it into a miracle in the customary way ; but no , he was an old numskull , a magician who believed in his own magic ; and no magician can thrive who is handicapped with a superstition like that .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 33]: I had an idea that the well had sprung a leak ; that some of the wall stones near the bottom had fallen and exposed fissures that allowed the water to escape .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 8]: I measured the chain -- 98 feet .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 26]: Then I called in a couple of monks , locked the door , took a candle , and made them lower me in the bucket .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 29]: When the chain was all paid out , the candle confirmed my suspicion ; a considerable section of the wall was gone , exposing a good big fissure .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 32]: I almost regretted that my theory about the well 's trouble was correct , because I had another one that had a showy point or two about it for a miracle .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 29]: I remembered that in America , many centuries later , when an oil well ceased to flow , they used to blast it out with a dynamite torpedo .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 35]: If I should find this well dry and no explanation of it , I could astonish these people most nobly by having a person of no especial value drop a dynamite bomb into it .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 8]: It was my idea to appoint Merlin .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 14]: However , it was plain that there was no occasion for the bomb .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 12]: One can not have everything the way he would like it .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 25]: A man has no business to be depressed by a disappointment , anyway ; he ought to make up his mind to get even .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 6]: That is what I did .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 22]: I said to myself , I am in no hurry , I can wait ; that bomb will come good yet .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 6]: And it did , too .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 39]: When I was above ground again , I turned out the monks , and let down a fish-line ; the well was a hundred and fifty feet deep , and there was forty-one feet of water in it .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 16]: I called in a monk and asked : `` How deep is the well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 15]: `` That , sir , I wit not , having never been told . ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 11]: `` How does the water usually stand in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 24]: `` Near to the top , these two centuries , as the testimony goeth , brought down to us through our predecessors . ''
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 48]: It was true -- as to recent times at least -- for there was witness to it , and better witness than a monk ; only about twenty or thirty feet of the chain showed wear and use , the rest of it was unworn and rusty .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 12]: What had happened when the well gave out that other time ?
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 40]: Without doubt some practical person had come along and mended the leak , and then had come up and told the abbot he had discovered by divination that if the sinful bath were destroyed the well would flow again .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 64]: The leak had befallen again now , and these children would have prayed , and processioned , and tolled their bells for heavenly succor till they all dried up and blew away , and no innocent of them all would ever have thought to drop a fish-line into the well or go down in it and find out what was really the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 18]: Old habit of mind is one of the toughest things to get away from in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 40]: It transmits itself like physical form and feature ; and for a man , in those days , to have had an idea that his ancestors had n't had , would have brought him under suspicion of being illegitimate .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 31]: I said to the monk : `` It is a difficult miracle to restore water in a dry well , but we will try , if my brother Merlin fails .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 30]: Brother Merlin is a very passable artist , but only in the parlor-magic line , and he may not succeed ; in fact , is not likely to succeed .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 27]: But that should be nothing to his discredit ; the man that can do _ this _ kind of miracle knows enough to keep hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 3]: `` Hotel ?
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 12]: I mind not to have heard -- '' `` Of hotel ?
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 7]: It 's what you call hostel .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 11]: The man that can do this miracle can keep hostel .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 37]: I can do this miracle ; I shall do this miracle ; yet I do not try to conceal from you that it is a miracle to tax the occult powers to the last strain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 28]: `` None knoweth that truth better than the brotherhood , indeed ; for it is of record that aforetime it was parlous difficult and took a year .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 17]: Natheless , God send you good success , and to that end will we pray . ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 21]: As a matter of business it was a good idea to get the notion around that the thing was difficult .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 15]: Many a small thing has been made large by the right kind of advertising .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 19]: That monk was filled up with the difficulty of this enterprise ; he would fill up the others .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 9]: In two days the solicitude would be booming .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 11]: On my way home at noon , I met Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 7]: She had been sampling the hermits .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 12]: I said : `` I would like to do that myself .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 4]: This is Wednesday .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 6]: Is there a matinee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 10]: `` A which , please you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 3]: `` Matinee .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 7]: Do they keep open afternoons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 8]: `` The hermits , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 5]: `` Keep open ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 6]: `` Yes , keep open .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 6]: Is n't that plain enough ?
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 8]: Do they knock off at noon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 5]: `` Knock off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 4]: `` Knock off ?
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 6]: -- yes , knock off .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 8]: What is the matter with knock off ?
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 15]: I never saw such a dunderhead ; ca n't you understand anything at all ?
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 42]: In plain terms , do they shut up shop , draw the game , bank the fires -- '' `` Shut up shop , draw -- '' `` There , never mind , let it go ; you make me tired .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 11]: You ca n't seem to understand the simplest thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 331]: `` I would I might please thee , sir , and it is to me dole and sorrow that I fail , albeit sith I am but a simple damsel and taught of none , being from the cradle unbaptized in those deep waters of learning that do anoint with a sovereignty him that partaketh of that most noble sacrament , investing him with reverend state to the mental eye of the humble mortal who , by bar and lack of that great consecration seeth in his own unlearned estate but a symbol of that other sort of lack and loss which men do publish to the pitying eye with sackcloth trappings whereon the ashes of grief do lie bepowdered and bestrewn , and so , when such shall in the darkness of his mind encounter these golden phrases of high mystery , these shut-up-shops , and draw-the-game , and bank-the-fires , it is but by the grace of God that he burst not for envy of the mind that can beget , and tongue that can deliver so great and mellow-sounding miracles of speech , and if there do ensue confusion in that humbler mind , and failure to divine the meanings of these wonders , then if so be this miscomprehension is not vain but sooth and true , wit ye well it is the very substance of worshipful dear homage and may not lightly be misprized , nor had been , an ye had noted this complexion of mood and mind and understood that that I would I could not , and that I could not I might not , nor yet nor might _ nor _ could , nor might-not nor could-not , might be by advantage turned to the desired _ would _ , and so I pray you mercy of my fault , and that ye will of your kindness and your charity forgive it , good my master and most dear lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 32]: I could n't make it all out -- that is , the details -- but I got the general idea ; and enough of it , too , to be ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 65]: It was not fair to spring those nineteenth century technicalities upon the untutored infant of the sixth and then rail at her because she could n't get their drift ; and when she was making the honest best drive at it she could , too , and no fault of hers that she could n't fetch the home plate ; and so I apologized .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 20]: Then we meandered pleasantly away toward the hermit holes in sociable converse together , and better friends than ever .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 61]: I was gradually coming to have a mysterious and shuddery reverence for this girl ; nowadays whenever she pulled out from the station and got her train fairly started on one of those horizonless transcontinental sentences of hers , it was borne in upon me that I was standing in the awful presence of the Mother of the German Language .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 47]: I was so impressed with this , that sometimes when she began to empty one of these sentences on me I unconsciously took the very attitude of reverence , and stood uncovered ; and if words had been water , I had been drowned , sure .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 47]: She had exactly the German way ; whatever was in her mind to be delivered , whether a mere remark , or a sermon , or a cyclopedia , or the history of a war , she would get it into a single sentence or die .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 37]: Whenever the literary German dives into a sentence , that is the last you are going to see of him till he emerges on the other side of his Atlantic with his verb in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 10]: We drifted from hermit to hermit all the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 7]: It was a most strange menagerie .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 24]: The chief emulation among them seemed to be , to see which could manage to be the uncleanest and most prosperous with vermin .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 12]: Their manner and attitudes were the last expression of complacent self-righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 143]: It was one anchorite 's pride to lie naked in the mud and let the insects bite him and blister him unmolested ; it was another 's to lean against a rock , all day long , conspicuous to the admiration of the throng of pilgrims and pray ; it was another 's to go naked and crawl around on all fours ; it was another 's to drag about with him , year in and year out , eighty pounds of iron ; it was another 's to never lie down when he slept , but to stand among the thorn-bushes and snore when there were pilgrims around to look ; a woman , who had the white hair of age , and no other apparel , was black from crown to heel with forty-seven years of holy abstinence from water .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 38]: Groups of gazing pilgrims stood around all and every of these strange objects , lost in reverent wonder , and envious of the fleckless sanctity which these pious austerities had won for them from an exacting heaven .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 14]: By and by we went to see one of the supremely great ones .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 31]: He was a mighty celebrity ; his fame had penetrated all Christendom ; the noble and the renowned journeyed from the remotest lands on the globe to pay him reverence .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 25]: His stand was in the center of the widest part of the valley ; and it took all that space to hold his crowds .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 19]: His stand was a pillar sixty feet high , with a broad platform on the top of it .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 28]: He was now doing what he had been doing every day for twenty years up there -- bowing his body ceaselessly and rapidly almost to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 7]: It was his way of praying .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 20]: I timed him with a stop watch , and he made 1,244 revolutions in 24 minutes and 46 seconds .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 13]: It seemed a pity to have all this power going to waste .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 45]: It was one of the most useful motions in mechanics , the pedal movement ; so I made a note in my memorandum book , purposing some day to apply a system of elastic cords to him and run a sewing machine with it .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 38]: I afterward carried out that scheme , and got five years ' good service out of him ; in which time he turned out upward of eighteen thousand first-rate tow-linen shirts , which was ten a day .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 29]: I worked him Sundays and all ; he was going , Sundays , the same as week days , and it was no use to waste the power .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 61]: These shirts cost me nothing but just the mere trifle for the materials -- I furnished those myself , it would not have been right to make him do that -- and they sold like smoke to pilgrims at a dollar and a half apiece , which was the price of fifty cows or a blooded race horse in Arthurdom .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 65]: They were regarded as a perfect protection against sin , and advertised as such by my knights everywhere , with the paint-pot and stencil-plate ; insomuch that there was not a cliff or a bowlder or a dead wall in England but you could read on it at a mile distance : `` Buy the only genuine St. Stylite ; patronized by the Nobility .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 5]: Patent applied for . ''
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 15]: There was more money in the business than one knew what to do with .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 62]: As it extended , I brought out a line of goods suitable for kings , and a nobby thing for duchesses and that sort , with ruffles down the forehatch and the running-gear clewed up with a featherstitch to leeward and then hauled aft with a back-stay and triced up with a half-turn in the standing rigging forward of the weather-gaskets .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 7]: Yes , it was a daisy .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 73]: But about that time I noticed that the motive power had taken to standing on one leg , and I found that there was something the matter with the other one ; so I stocked the business and unloaded , taking Sir Bors de Ganis into camp financially along with certain of his friends ; for the works stopped within a year , and the good saint got him to his rest .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 6]: But he had earned it .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 7]: I can say that for him .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 20]: When I saw him that first time -- however , his personal condition will not quite bear description here .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 11]: You can read it in the Lives of the Saints .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 22]: * -LSB- * All the details concerning the hermits , in this chapter , are from Lecky -- but greatly modified .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 27]: This book not being a history but only a tale , the majority of the historian 's frank details were too strong for reproduction in it .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 24]: -- _ Editor _ -RSB- CHAPTER XXIII RESTORATION OF THE FOUNTAIN Saturday noon I went to the well and looked on a while .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 39]: Merlin was still burning smoke-powders , and pawing the air , and muttering gibberish as hard as ever , but looking pretty down-hearted , for of course he had not started even a perspiration in that well yet .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 17]: Finally I said : `` How does the thing promise by this time , partner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 38]: `` Behold , I am even now busied with trial of the powerfulest enchantment known to the princes of the occult arts in the lands of the East ; an it fail me , naught can avail .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 7]: Peace , until I finish . ''
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 43]: He raised a smoke this time that darkened all the region , and must have made matters uncomfortable for the hermits , for the wind was their way , and it rolled down over their dens in a dense and billowy fog .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 26]: He poured out volumes of speech to match , and contorted his body and sawed the air with his hands in a most extraordinary way .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 15]: At the end of twenty minutes he dropped down panting , and about exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 42]: Now arrived the abbot and several hundred monks and nuns , and behind them a multitude of pilgrims and a couple of acres of foundlings , all drawn by the prodigious smoke , and all in a grand state of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 7]: The abbot inquired anxiously for results .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 29]: Merlin said : `` If any labor of mortal might break the spell that binds these waters , this which I have but just essayed had done it .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 57]: It has failed ; whereby I do now know that that which I had feared is a truth established ; the sign of this failure is , that the most potent spirit known to the magicians of the East , and whose name none may utter and live , has laid his spell upon this well .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 28]: The mortal does not breathe , nor ever will , who can penetrate the secret of that spell , and without that secret none can break it .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 11]: The water will flow no more forever , good Father .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 7]: I have done what man could .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 6]: Suffer me to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 14]: Of course this threw the abbot into a good deal of a consternation .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 22]: He turned to me with the signs of it in his face , and said : `` Ye have heard him .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 5]: Is it true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 7]: `` Part of it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 9]: `` Not all , then , not all !
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 6]: What part is true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 17]: `` That that spirit with the Russian name has put his spell upon the well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 11]: `` God 's wounds , then are we ruined ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 4]: `` Possibly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 5]: `` But not certainly ?
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 7]: Ye mean , not certainly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 6]: `` That is it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 33]: `` Wherefore , ye also mean that when he saith none can break the spell -- '' `` Yes , when he says that , he says what is n't necessarily true .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 29]: There are conditions under which an effort to break it may have some chance -- that is , some small , some trifling chance -- of success . ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 13]: `` The conditions -- '' `` Oh , they are nothing difficult .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 43]: Only these : I want the well and the surroundings for the space of half a mile , entirely to myself from sunset to-day until I remove the ban -- and nobody allowed to cross the ground but by my authority . ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 6]: `` Are these all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 10]: `` And you have no fear to try ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 5]: `` Oh , none .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 13]: One may fail , of course ; and one may also succeed .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 12]: One can try , and I am ready to chance it .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 6]: I have my conditions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 9]: `` These and all others ye may name .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 9]: I will issue commandment to that effect . ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 12]: `` Wait , '' said Merlin , with an evil smile .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 18]: `` Ye wit that he that would break this spell must know that spirit 's name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 9]: `` Yes , I know his name . ''
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 21]: `` And wit you also that to know it skills not of itself , but ye must likewise pronounce it ?
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 2]: Ha-ha !
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 5]: Knew ye that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 10]: `` Yes , I knew that , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 6]: `` You had that knowledge !
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 4]: Art a fool ?
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 11]: Are ye minded to utter that name and die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 4]: `` Utter it ?
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 3]: Why certainly .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 10]: I would utter it if it was Welsh . ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 18]: `` Ye are even a dead man , then ; and I go to tell Arthur . ''
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 6]: `` That 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 7]: Take your gripsack and get along .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 22]: The thing for _ you _ to do is to go home and work the weather , John W. Merlin . ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 22]: It was a home shot , and it made him wince ; for he was the worst weather-failure in the kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 30]: Whenever he ordered up the danger-signals along the coast there was a week 's dead calm , sure , and every time he prophesied fair weather it rained brickbats .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 16]: But I kept him in the weather bureau right along , to undermine his reputation .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 27]: However , that shot raised his bile , and instead of starting home to report my death , he said he would remain and enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 20]: My two experts arrived in the evening , and pretty well fagged , for they had traveled double tides .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 53]: They had pack-mules along , and had brought everything I needed -- tools , pump , lead pipe , Greek fire , sheaves of big rockets , roman candles , colored fire sprays , electric apparatus , and a lot of sundries -- everything necessary for the stateliest kind of a miracle .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 30]: They got their supper and a nap , and about midnight we sallied out through a solitude so wholly vacant and complete that it quite overpassed the required conditions .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 10]: We took possession of the well and its surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 25]: My boys were experts in all sorts of things , from the stoning up of a well to the constructing of a mathematical instrument .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 20]: An hour before sunrise we had that leak mended in ship-shape fashion , and the water began to rise .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 20]: Then we stowed our fireworks in the chapel , locked up the place , and went home to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 71]: Before the noon mass was over , we were at the well again ; for there was a deal to do yet , and I was determined to spring the miracle before midnight , for business reasons : for whereas a miracle worked for the Church on a week-day is worth a good deal , it is worth six times as much if you get it in on a Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 26]: In nine hours the water had risen to its customary level -- that is to say , it was within twenty-three feet of the top .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 99]: We put in a little iron pump , one of the first turned out by my works near the capital ; we bored into a stone reservoir which stood against the outer wall of the well-chamber and inserted a section of lead pipe that was long enough to reach to the door of the chapel and project beyond the threshold , where the gushing water would be visible to the two hundred and fifty acres of people I was intending should be present on the flat plain in front of this little holy hillock at the proper time .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 81]: We knocked the head out of an empty hogshead and hoisted this hogshead to the flat roof of the chapel , where we clamped it down fast , poured in gunpowder till it lay loosely an inch deep on the bottom , then we stood up rockets in the hogshead as thick as they could loosely stand , all the different breeds of rockets there are ; and they made a portly and imposing sheaf , I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 54]: We grounded the wire of a pocket electrical battery in that powder , we placed a whole magazine of Greek fire on each corner of the roof -- blue on one corner , green on another , red on another , and purple on the last -- and grounded a wire in each .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 34]: About two hundred yards off , in the flat , we built a pen of scantlings , about four feet high , and laid planks on it , and so made a platform .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 22]: We covered it with swell tapestries borrowed for the occasion , and topped it off with the abbot 's own throne .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 64]: When you are going to do a miracle for an ignorant race , you want to get in every detail that will count ; you want to make all the properties impressive to the public eye ; you want to make matters comfortable for your head guest ; then you can turn yourself loose and play your effects for all they are worth .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 14]: I know the value of these things , for I know human nature .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 11]: You ca n't throw too much style into a miracle .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 18]: It costs trouble , and work , and sometimes money ; but it pays in the end .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 30]: Well , we brought the wires to the ground at the chapel , and then brought them under the ground to the platform , and hid the batteries there .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 25]: We put a rope fence a hundred feet square around the platform to keep off the common multitude , and that finished the work .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 16]: My idea was , doors open at 10:30 , performance to begin at 11:25 sharp .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 15]: I wished I could charge admission , but of course that would n't answer .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 37]: I instructed my boys to be in the chapel as early as 10 , before anybody was around , and be ready to man the pumps at the proper time , and make the fur fly .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 7]: Then we went home to supper .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 34]: The news of the disaster to the well had traveled far by this time ; and now for two or three days a steady avalanche of people had been pouring into the valley .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 24]: The lower end of the valley was become one huge camp ; we should have a good house , no question about that .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 23]: Criers went the rounds early in the evening and announced the coming attempt , which put every pulse up to fever heat .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 62]: They gave notice that the abbot and his official suite would move in state and occupy the platform at 10:30 , up to which time all the region which was under my ban must be clear ; the bells would then cease from tolling , and this sign should be permission to the multitudes to close in and take their places .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 48]: I was at the platform and all ready to do the honors when the abbot 's solemn procession hove in sight -- which it did not do till it was nearly to the rope fence , because it was a starless black night and no torches permitted .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 24]: With it came Merlin , and took a front seat on the platform ; he was as good as his word for once .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 21]: One could not see the multitudes banked together beyond the ban , but they were there , just the same .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 57]: The moment the bells stopped , those banked masses broke and poured over the line like a vast black wave , and for as much as a half hour it continued to flow , and then it solidified itself , and you could have walked upon a pavement of human heads to -- well , miles .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 39]: We had a solemn stage-wait , now , for about twenty minutes -- a thing I had counted on for effect ; it is always good to let your audience have a chance to work up its expectancy .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 33]: At length , out of the silence a noble Latin chant -- men 's voices -- broke and swelled up and rolled away into the night , a majestic tide of melody .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 20]: I had put that up , too , and it was one of the best effects I ever invented .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 60]: When it was finished I stood up on the platform and extended my hands abroad , for two minutes , with my face uplifted -- that always produces a dead hush -- and then slowly pronounced this ghastly word with a kind of awfulness which caused hundreds to tremble , and many women to faint : `` Constantinopolitanischerdudelsackspfeifenmachersgesellschafft ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 36]: Just as I was moaning out the closing hunks of that word , I touched off one of my electric connections and all that murky world of people stood revealed in a hideous blue glare !
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 7]: It was immense -- that effect !
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 19]: Lots of people shrieked , women curled up and quit in every direction , foundlings collapsed by platoons .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 16]: The abbot and the monks crossed themselves nimbly and their lips fluttered with agitated prayers .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 27]: Merlin held his grip , but he was astonished clear down to his corns ; he had never seen anything to begin with that , before .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 10]: Now was the time to pile in the effects .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 20]: I lifted my hands and groaned out this word -- as it were in agony : `` Nihilistendynamittheaterkaestchenssprengungsattentaetsversuchungen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 8]: -- and turned on the red fire !
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 19]: You should have heard that Atlantic of people moan and howl when that crimson hell joined the blue !
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 12]: After sixty seconds I shouted : `` Transvaaltruppentropentransporttrampelthiertreibertrauungsthraenen - tragoedie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 8]: -- and lit up the green fire !
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 29]: After waiting only forty seconds this time , I spread my arms abroad and thundered out the devastating syllables of this word of words : `` Mekkamuselmannenmassenmenchenmoerdermohrenmuttermarmormonumentenmacher ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 8]: -- and whirled on the purple glare !
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 17]: There they were , all going at once , red , blue , green , purple !
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 26]: -- four furious volcanoes pouring vast clouds of radiant smoke aloft , and spreading a blinding rainbowed noonday to the furthest confines of that valley .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 30]: In the distance one could see that fellow on the pillar standing rigid against the background of sky , his seesaw stopped for the first time in twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 12]: I knew the boys were at the pump now and ready .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 15]: So I said to the abbot : `` The time is come , Father .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 15]: I am about to pronounce the dread name and command the spell to dissolve .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 13]: You want to brace up , and take hold of something . ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 26]: Then I shouted to the people : `` Behold , in another minute the spell will be broken , or no mortal can break it .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 23]: If it break , all will know it , for you will see the sacred water gush from the chapel door ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 97]: I stood a few moments , to let the hearers have a chance to spread my announcement to those who could n't hear , and so convey it to the furthest ranks , then I made a grand exhibition of extra posturing and gesturing , and shouted : `` Lo , I command the fell spirit that possesses the holy fountain to now disgorge into the skies all the infernal fires that still remain in him , and straightway dissolve his spell and flee hence to the pit , there to lie bound a thousand years .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 12]: By his own dread name I command it -- BGWJJILLIGKKK ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 39]: Then I touched off the hogshead of rockets , and a vast fountain of dazzling lances of fire vomited itself toward the zenith with a hissing rush , and burst in mid-sky into a storm of flashing jewels !
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 41]: One mighty groan of terror started up from the massed people -- then suddenly broke into a wild hosannah of joy -- for there , fair and plain in the uncanny glare , they saw the freed water leaping forth !
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 34]: The old abbot could not speak a word , for tears and the chokings in his throat ; without utterance of any sort , he folded me in his arms and mashed me .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 7]: It was more eloquent than speech .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 24]: And harder to get over , too , in a country where there were really no doctors that were worth a damaged nickel .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 74]: You should have seen those acres of people throw themselves down in that water and kiss it ; kiss it , and pet it , and fondle it , and talk to it as if it were alive , and welcome it back with the dear names they gave their darlings , just as if it had been a friend who was long gone away and lost , and was come home again .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 21]: Yes , it was pretty to see , and made me think more of them than I had done before .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 8]: I sent Merlin home on a shutter .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 24]: He had caved in and gone down like a landslide when I pronounced that fearful name , and had never come to since .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 22]: He never had heard that name before , -- neither had I -- but to him it was the right one .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 9]: Any jumble would have been the right one .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 22]: He admitted , afterward , that that spirit 's own mother could not have pronounced that name better than I did .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 16]: He never could understand how I survived it , and I did n't tell him .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 13]: It is only young magicians that give away a secret like that .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 24]: Merlin spent three months working enchantments to try to find out the deep trick of how to pronounce that name and outlive it .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 6]: But he did n't arrive .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 38]: When I started to the chapel , the populace uncovered and fell back reverently to make a wide way for me , as if I had been some kind of a superior being -- and I was .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 6]: I was aware of that .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 63]: I took along a night shift of monks , and taught them the mystery of the pump , and set them to work , for it was plain that a good part of the people out there were going to sit up with the water all night , consequently it was but right that they should have all they wanted of it .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 37]: To those monks that pump was a good deal of a miracle itself , and they were full of wonder over it ; and of admiration , too , of the exceeding effectiveness of its performance .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 10]: It was a great night , an immense night .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 6]: There was reputation in it .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 11]: I could hardly get to sleep for glorying over it .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 17]: CHAPTER XXIV A RIVAL MAGICIAN My influence in the Valley of Holiness was something prodigious now .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 14]: It seemed worth while to try to turn it to some valuable account .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 29]: The thought came to me the next morning , and was suggested by my seeing one of my knights who was in the soap line come riding in .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 22]: According to history , the monks of this place two centuries before had been worldly minded enough to want to wash .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 14]: It might be that there was a leaven of this unrighteousness still remaining .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 15]: So I sounded a Brother : `` Would n't you like a bath ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 48]: He shuddered at the thought -- the thought of the peril of it to the well -- but he said with feeling : `` One needs not to ask that of a poor body who has not known that blessed refreshment sith that he was a boy .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 7]: Would God I might wash me !
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 18]: but it may not be , fair sir , tempt me not ; it is forbidden . ''
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 38]: And then he sighed in such a sorrowful way that I was resolved he should have at least one layer of his real estate removed , if it sized up my whole influence and bankrupted the pile .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 15]: So I went to the abbot and asked for a permit for this Brother .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 71]: He blenched at the idea -- I do n't mean that you could see him blench , for of course you could n't see it without you scraped him , and I did n't care enough about it to scrape him , but I knew the blench was there , just the same , and within a book-cover 's thickness of the surface , too -- blenched , and trembled .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 35]: He said : `` Ah , son , ask aught else thou wilt , and it is thine , and freely granted out of a grateful heart -- but this , oh , this !
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 10]: Would you drive away the blessed water again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 12]: `` No , Father , I will not drive it away .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 29]: I have mysterious knowledge which teaches me that there was an error that other time when it was thought the institution of the bath banished the fountain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 14]: A large interest began to show up in the old man 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 25]: `` My knowledge informs me that the bath was innocent of that misfortune , which was caused by quite another sort of sin . ''
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 18]: `` These are brave words -- but -- but right welcome , if they be true . ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 7]: `` They are true , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 9]: Let me build the bath again , Father .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 14]: Let me build it again , and the fountain shall flow forever . ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 5]: `` You promise this ?
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 5]: -- you promise it ?
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 10]: Say the word -- say you promise it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 7]: `` I do promise it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 10]: `` Then will I have the first bath myself !
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 8]: Go -- get ye to your work .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 10]: Tarry not , tarry not , but go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 11]: I and my boys were at work , straight off .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 21]: The ruins of the old bath were there yet in the basement of the monastery , not a stone missing .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 22]: They had been left just so , all these lifetimes , and avoided with a pious fear , as things accursed .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 27]: In two days we had it all done and the water in -- a spacious pool of clear pure water that a body could swim in .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 7]: It was running water , too .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 13]: It came in , and went out , through the ancient pipes .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 15]: The old abbot kept his word , and was the first to try it .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 35]: He went down black and shaky , leaving the whole black community above troubled and worried and full of bodings ; but he came back white and joyful , and the game was made !
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 4]: another triumph scored .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 34]: It was a good campaign that we made in that Valley of Holiness , and I was very well satisfied , and ready to move on now , but I struck a disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 17]: I caught a heavy cold , and it started up an old lurking rheumatism of mine .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 14]: Of course the rheumatism hunted up my weakest place and located itself there .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 31]: This was the place where the abbot put his arms about me and mashed me , what time he was moved to testify his gratitude to me with an embrace .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 12]: When at last I got out , I was a shadow .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 40]: But everybody was full of attentions and kindnesses , and these brought cheer back into my life , and were the right medicine to help a convalescent swiftly up toward health and strength again ; so I gained fast .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 31]: Sandy was worn out with nursing ; so I made up my mind to turn out and go a cruise alone , leaving her at the nunnery to rest up .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 24]: My idea was to disguise myself as a freeman of peasant degree and wander through the country a week or two on foot .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 23]: This would give me a chance to eat and lodge with the lowliest and poorest class of free citizens on equal terms .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 22]: There was no other way to inform myself perfectly of their everyday life and the operation of the laws upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 38]: If I went among them as a gentleman , there would be restraints and conventionalities which would shut me out from their private joys and troubles , and I should get no further than the outside shell .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 80]: One morning I was out on a long walk to get up muscle for my trip , and had climbed the ridge which bordered the northern extremity of the valley , when I came upon an artificial opening in the face of a low precipice , and recognized it by its location as a hermitage which had often been pointed out to me from a distance as the den of a hermit of high renown for dirt and austerity .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 55]: I knew he had lately been offered a situation in the Great Sahara , where lions and sandflies made the hermit-life peculiarly attractive and difficult , and had gone to Africa to take possession , so I thought I would look in and see how the atmosphere of this den agreed with its reputation .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 13]: My surprise was great : the place was newly swept and scoured .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 6]: Then there was another surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 25]: Back in the gloom of the cavern I heard the clink of a little bell , and then this exclamation : `` Hello Central !
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 6]: Is this you , Camelot ?
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 53]: -- Behold , thou mayst glad thy heart an thou hast faith to believe the wonderful when that it cometh in unexpected guise and maketh itself manifest in impossible places -- here standeth in the flesh his mightiness The Boss , and with thine own ears shall ye hear him speak ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 53]: Now what a radical reversal of things this was ; what a jumbling together of extravagant incongruities ; what a fantastic conjunction of opposites and irreconcilables -- the home of the bogus miracle become the home of a real one , the den of a mediaeval hermit turned into a telephone office !
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 17]: The telephone clerk stepped into the light , and I recognized one of my young fellows .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 16]: I said : `` How long has this office been established here , Ulfius ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 14]: `` But since midnight , fair Sir Boss , an it please you .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 36]: We saw many lights in the valley , and so judged it well to make a station , for that where so many lights be needs must they indicate a town of goodly size . ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 4]: `` Quite right .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 19]: It is n't a town in the customary sense , but it 's a good stand , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 8]: Do you know where you are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 53]: `` Of that I have had no time to make inquiry ; for whenas my comradeship moved hence upon their labors , leaving me in charge , I got me to needed rest , purposing to inquire when I waked , and report the place 's name to Camelot for record . ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 11]: `` Well , this is the Valley of Holiness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 23]: It did n't take ; I mean , he did n't start at the name , as I had supposed he would .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 12]: He merely said : `` I will so report it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 19]: `` Why , the surrounding regions are filled with the noise of late wonders that have happened here !
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 8]: You did n't hear of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 17]: `` Ah , ye will remember we move by night , and avoid speech with all .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 14]: We learn naught but that we get by the telephone from Camelot . ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 11]: `` Why _ they _ know all about this thing .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 19]: Have n't they told you anything about the great miracle of the restoration of a holy fountain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 7]: `` Oh , _ that _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 3]: Indeed yes .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 38]: But the name of _ this _ valley doth woundily differ from the name of _ that _ one ; indeed to differ wider were not pos -- '' `` What was that name , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 8]: `` The Valley of Hellishness . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 6]: _ That _ explains it .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 6]: Confound a telephone , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 20]: It is the very demon for conveying similarities of sound that are miracles of divergence from similarity of sense .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 13]: But no matter , you know the name of the place now .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 5]: Call up Camelot . ''
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 10]: He did it , and had Clarence sent for .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 11]: It was good to hear my boy 's voice again .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 6]: It was like being home .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 22]: After some affectionate interchanges , and some account of my late illness , I said : `` What is new ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 93]: `` The king and queen and many of the court do start even in this hour , to go to your valley to pay pious homage to the waters ye have restored , and cleanse themselves of sin , and see the place where the infernal spirit spouted true hell-flames to the clouds -- an ye listen sharply ye may hear me wink and hear me likewise smile a smile , sith 't was I that made selection of those flames from out our stock and sent them by your order . ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 12]: `` Does the king know the way to this place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 4]: `` The king ?
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 45]: -- no , nor to any other in his realms , mayhap ; but the lads that holp you with your miracle will be his guide and lead the way , and appoint the places for rests at noons and sleeps at night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 10]: `` This will bring them here -- when ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 11]: `` Mid-afternoon , or later , the third day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 10]: `` Anything else in the way of news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 24]: `` The king hath begun the raising of the standing army ye suggested to him ; one regiment is complete and officered . ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 4]: `` The mischief !
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 9]: I wanted a main hand in that myself .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 20]: There is only one body of men in the kingdom that are fitted to officer a regular army . ''
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 24]: `` Yes -- and now ye will marvel to know there 's not so much as one West Pointer in that regiment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 7]: `` What are you talking about ?
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 6]: Are you in earnest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 10]: `` It is truly as I have said . ''
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 8]: `` Why , this makes me uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 10]: Who were chosen , and what was the method ?
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 4]: Competitive examination ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 10]: `` Indeed , I know naught of the method .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 24]: I but know this -- these officers be all of noble family , and are born -- what is it you call it ?
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 4]: -- chuckleheads . ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 9]: `` There 's something wrong , Clarence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 38]: `` Comfort yourself , then ; for two candidates for a lieutenancy do travel hence with the king -- young nobles both -- and if you but wait where you are you will hear them questioned . ''
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 8]: `` That is news to the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 10]: I will get one West Pointer in , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 39]: Mount a man and send him to that school with a message ; let him kill horses , if necessary , but he must be there before sunset to-night and say -- '' `` There is no need .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 10]: I have laid a ground wire to the school .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 9]: Prithee let me connect you with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 4]: It sounded good !
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 24]: In this atmosphere of telephones and lightning communication with distant regions , I was breathing the breath of life again after long suffocation .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 50]: I realized , then , what a creepy , dull , inanimate horror this land had been to me all these years , and how I had been in such a stifled condition of mind as to have grown used to it almost beyond the power to notice it .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 12]: I gave my order to the superintendent of the Academy personally .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 22]: I also asked him to bring me some paper and a fountain pen and a box or so of safety matches .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 10]: I was getting tired of doing without these conveniences .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 27]: I could have them now , as I was n't going to wear armor any more at present , and therefore could get at my pockets .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 17]: When I got back to the monastery , I found a thing of interest going on .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 29]: The abbot and his monks were assembled in the great hall , observing with childish wonder and faith the performances of a new magician , a fresh arrival .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 23]: His dress was the extreme of the fantastic ; as showy and foolish as the sort of thing an Indian medicine-man wears .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 30]: He was mowing , and mumbling , and gesticulating , and drawing mystical figures in the air and on the floor , -- the regular thing , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 16]: He was a celebrity from Asia -- so he said , and that was enough .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 15]: That sort of evidence was as good as gold , and passed current everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 17]: How easy and cheap it was to be a great magician on this fellow 's terms .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 45]: His specialty was to tell you what any individual on the face of the globe was doing at the moment ; and what he had done at any time in the past , and what he would do at any time in the future .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 18]: He asked if any would like to know what the Emperor of the East was doing now ?
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 33]: The sparkling eyes and the delighted rubbing of hands made eloquent answer -- this reverend crowd _ would _ like to know what that monarch was at , just as this moment .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 53]: The fraud went through some more mummery , and then made grave announcement : `` The high and mighty Emperor of the East doth at this moment put money in the palm of a holy begging friar -- one , two , three pieces , and they be all of silver . ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 17]: A buzz of admiring exclamations broke out , all around : `` It is marvelous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 4]: `` Wonderful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 18]: `` What study , what labor , to have acquired a so amazing power as this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 14]: Would they like to know what the Supreme Lord of Inde was doing ?
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 12]: He told them what the Supreme Lord of Inde was doing .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 23]: Then he told them what the Sultan of Egypt was at ; also what the King of the Remote Seas was about .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 22]: And so on and so on ; and with each new marvel the astonishment at his accuracy rose higher and higher .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 31]: They thought he must surely strike an uncertain place some time ; but no , he never had to hesitate , he always knew , and always with unerring precision .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 30]: I saw that if this thing went on I should lose my supremacy , this fellow would capture my following , I should be left out in the cold .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 17]: I must put a cog in his wheel , and do it right away , too .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 24]: I said : `` If I might ask , I should very greatly like to know what a certain person is doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 6]: `` Speak , and freely .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 6]: I will tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 10]: `` It will be difficult -- perhaps impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 8]: `` My art knoweth not that word .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 17]: The more difficult it is , the more certainly will I reveal it to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 10]: You see , I was working up the interest .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 24]: It was getting pretty high , too ; you could see that by the craning necks all around , and the half-suspended breathing .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 34]: So now I climaxed it : `` If you make no mistake -- if you tell me truly what I want to know -- I will give you two hundred silver pennies . ''
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 6]: `` The fortune is mine !
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 10]: I will tell you what you would know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 14]: `` Then tell me what I am doing with my right hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 4]: `` Ah-h ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 8]: There was a general gasp of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 25]: It had not occurred to anybody in the crowd -- that simple trick of inquiring about somebody who was n't ten thousand miles away .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 33]: The magician was hit hard ; it was an emergency that had never happened in his experience before , and it corked him ; he did n't know how to meet it .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 13]: He looked stunned , confused ; he could n't say a word .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 14]: `` Come , '' I said , `` what are you waiting for ?
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 43]: Is it possible you can answer up , right off , and tell what anybody on the other side of the earth is doing , and yet ca n't tell what a person is doing who is n't three yards from you ?
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 23]: Persons behind me know what I am doing with my right hand -- they will indorse you if you tell correctly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 5]: He was still dumb .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 25]: `` Very well , I 'll tell you why you do n't speak up and tell ; it is because you do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 6]: _ You _ a magician !
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 13]: Good friends , this tramp is a mere fraud and liar . ''
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 8]: This distressed the monks and terrified them .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 23]: They were not used to hearing these awful beings called names , and they did not know what might be the consequence .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 14]: There was a dead silence now ; superstitious bodings were in every mind .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 37]: The magician began to pull his wits together , and when he presently smiled an easy , nonchalant smile , it spread a mighty relief around ; for it indicated that his mood was not destructive .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 18]: He said : `` It hath struck me speechless , the frivolity of this person 's speech .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 47]: Let all know , if perchance there be any who know it not , that enchanters of my degree deign not to concern themselves with the doings of any but kings , princes , emperors , them that be born in the purple and them only .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 34]: Had ye asked me what Arthur the great king is doing , it were another matter , and I had told ye ; but the doings of a subject interest me not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 7]: `` Oh , I misunderstood you .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 27]: I thought you said ` anybody , ' and so I supposed ` anybody ' included -- well , anybody ; that is , everybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 20]: `` It doth -- anybody that is of lofty birth ; and the better if he be royal . ''
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 63]: `` That , it meseemeth , might well be , '' said the abbot , who saw his opportunity to smooth things and avert disaster , `` for it were not likely that so wonderful a gift as this would be conferred for the revelation of the concerns of lesser beings than such as be born near to the summits of greatness .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 14]: Our Arthur the king -- '' `` Would you know of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 5]: broke in the enchanter .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 10]: `` Most gladly , yea , and gratefully . ''
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 15]: Everybody was full of awe and interest again right away , the incorrigible idiots .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 25]: They watched the incantations absorbingly , and looked at me with a `` There , now , what can you say to that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 30]: air , when the announcement came : `` The king is weary with the chase , and lieth in his palace these two hours sleeping a dreamless sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 8]: `` God 's benison upon him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 24]: said the abbot , and crossed himself ; `` may that sleep be to the refreshment of his body and his soul . ''
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 29]: `` And so it might be , if he were sleeping , '' I said , `` but the king is not sleeping , the king rides . ''
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 10]: Here was trouble again -- a conflict of authority .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 15]: Nobody knew which of us to believe ; I still had some reputation left .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 51]: The magician 's scorn was stirred , and he said : `` Lo , I have seen many wonderful soothsayers and prophets and magicians in my life days , but none before that could sit idle and see to the heart of things with never an incantation to help . ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 14]: `` You have lived in the woods , and lost much by it .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 20]: I use incantations myself , as this good brotherhood are aware -- but only on occasions of moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 17]: When it comes to sarcasming , I reckon I know how to keep my end up .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 7]: That jab made this fellow squirm .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 34]: The abbot inquired after the queen and the court , and got this information : `` They be all on sleep , being overcome by fatigue , like as to the king . ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 10]: I said : `` That is merely another lie .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 21]: Half of them are about their amusements , the queen and the other half are not sleeping , they ride .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 30]: Now perhaps you can spread yourself a little , and tell us where the king and queen and all that are this moment riding with them are going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 27]: `` They sleep now , as I said ; but on the morrow they will ride , for they go a journey toward the sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 14]: `` And where will they be the day after to-morrow at vespers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 17]: `` Far to the north of Camelot , and half their journey will be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 16]: `` That is another lie , by the space of a hundred and fifty miles .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 28]: Their journey will not be merely half done , it will be all done , and they will be _ here _ , in this valley . ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 8]: _ That _ was a noble shot !
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 22]: It set the abbot and the monks in a whirl of excitement , and it rocked the enchanter to his base .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 37]: I followed the thing right up : `` If the king does not arrive , I will have myself ridden on a rail : if he does I will ride you on a rail instead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 25]: Next day I went up to the telephone office and found that the king had passed through two towns that were on the line .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 13]: I spotted his progress on the succeeding day in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 7]: I kept these matters to myself .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 22]: The third day 's reports showed that if he kept up his gait he would arrive by four in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 31]: There was still no sign anywhere of interest in his coming ; there seemed to be no preparations making to receive him in state ; a strange thing , truly .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 18]: Only one thing could explain this : that other magician had been cutting under me , sure .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 4]: This was true .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 46]: I asked a friend of mine , a monk , about it , and he said , yes , the magician had tried some further enchantments and found out that the court had concluded to make no journey at all , but stay at home .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 4]: Think of that !
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 12]: Observe how much a reputation was worth in such a country .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 55]: These people had seen me do the very showiest bit of magic in history , and the only one within their memory that had a positive value , and yet here they were , ready to take up with an adventurer who could offer no evidence of his powers but his mere unproven word .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 49]: However , it was not good politics to let the king come without any fuss and feathers at all , so I went down and drummed up a procession of pilgrims and smoked out a batch of hermits and started them out at two o'clock to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 11]: And that was the sort of state he arrived in .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 51]: The abbot was helpless with rage and humiliation when I brought him out on a balcony and showed him the head of the state marching in and never a monk on hand to offer him welcome , and no stir of life or clang of joy-bell to glad his spirit .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 13]: He took one look and then flew to rouse out his forces .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 68]: The next minute the bells were dinning furiously , and the various buildings were vomiting monks and nuns , who went swarming in a rush toward the coming procession ; and with them went that magician -- and he was on a rail , too , by the abbot 's order ; and his reputation was in the mud , and mine was in the sky again .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 38]: Yes , a man can keep his trademark current in such a country , but he ca n't sit around and do it ; he has got to be on deck and attending to business right along .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 44]: CHAPTER XXV A COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION When the king traveled for change of air , or made a progress , or visited a distant noble whom he wished to bankrupt with the cost of his keep , part of the administration moved with him .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 8]: It was a fashion of the time .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 34]: The Commission charged with the examination of candidates for posts in the army came with the king to the Valley , whereas they could have transacted their business just as well at home .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 25]: And although this expedition was strictly a holiday excursion for the king , he kept some of his business functions going just the same .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 33]: He touched for the evil , as usual ; he held court in the gate at sunrise and tried cases , for he was himself Chief Justice of the King 's Bench .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 9]: He shone very well in this latter office .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 24]: He was a wise and humane judge , and he clearly did his honest best and fairest , -- according to his lights .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 6]: That is a large reservation .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 13]: His lights -- I mean his rearing -- often colored his decisions .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 37]: Whenever there was a dispute between a noble or gentleman and a person of lower degree , the king 's leanings and sympathies were for the former class always , whether he suspected it or not .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 9]: It was impossible that this should be otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 38]: The blunting effects of slavery upon the slaveholder 's moral perceptions are known and conceded , the world over ; and a privileged class , an aristocracy , is but a band of slaveholders under another name .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 37]: This has a harsh sound , and yet should not be offensive to any -- even to the noble himself -- unless the fact itself be an offense : for the statement simply formulates a fact .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 15]: The repulsive feature of slavery is the _ thing _ , not its name .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 50]: One needs but to hear an aristocrat speak of the classes that are below him to recognize -- and in but indifferently modified measure -- the very air and tone of the actual slaveholder ; and behind these are the slaveholder 's spirit , the slaveholder 's blunted feeling .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 27]: They are the result of the same cause in both cases : the possessor 's old and inbred custom of regarding himself as a superior being .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 24]: The king 's judgments wrought frequent injustices , but it was merely the fault of his training , his natural and unalterable sympathies .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 36]: He was as unfitted for a judgeship as would be the average mother for the position of milk-distributor to starving children in famine-time ; her own children would fare a shade better than the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 9]: One very curious case came before the king .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 22]: A young girl , an orphan , who had a considerable estate , married a fine young fellow who had nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 13]: The girl 's property was within a seigniory held by the Church .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 57]: The bishop of the diocese , an arrogant scion of the great nobility , claimed the girl 's estate on the ground that she had married privately , and thus had cheated the Church out of one of its rights as lord of the seigniory -- the one heretofore referred to as le droit du seigneur .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 9]: The penalty of refusal or avoidance was confiscation .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 59]: The girl 's defense was , that the lordship of the seigniory was vested in the bishop , and the particular right here involved was not transferable , but must be exercised by the lord himself or stand vacated ; and that an older law , of the Church itself , strictly barred the bishop from exercising it .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 9]: It was a very odd case , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 30]: It reminded me of something I had read in my youth about the ingenious way in which the aldermen of London raised the money that built the Mansion House .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 24]: A person who had not taken the Sacrament according to the Anglican rite could not stand as a candidate for sheriff of London .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 19]: Thus Dissenters were ineligible ; they could not run if asked , they could not serve if elected .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 59]: The aldermen , who without any question were Yankees in disguise , hit upon this neat device : they passed a by-law imposing a fine of L400 upon any one who should refuse to be a candidate for sheriff , and a fine of L600 upon any person who , after being elected sheriff , refused to serve .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 91]: Then they went to work and elected a lot of Dissenters , one after another , and kept it up until they had collected L15 ,000 in fines ; and there stands the stately Mansion House to this day , to keep the blushing citizen in mind of a long past and lamented day when a band of Yankees slipped into London and played games of the sort that has given their race a unique and shady reputation among all truly good and holy peoples that be in the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 18]: The girl 's case seemed strong to me ; the bishop 's case was just as strong .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 16]: I did not see how the king was going to get out of this hole .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 5]: But he got out .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 24]: I append his decision : `` Truly I find small difficulty here , the matter being even a child 's affair for simpleness .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 66]: An the young bride had conveyed notice , as in duty bound , to her feudal lord and proper master and protector the bishop , she had suffered no loss , for the said bishop could have got a dispensation making him , for temporary conveniency , eligible to the exercise of his said right , and thus would she have kept all she had .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 61]: Whereas , failing in her first duty , she hath by that failure failed in all ; for whoso , clinging to a rope , severeth it above his hands , must fall ; it being no defense to claim that the rest of the rope is sound , neither any deliverance from his peril , as he shall find .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 12]: Pardy , the woman 's case is rotten at the source .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 37]: It is the decree of the court that she forfeit to the said lord bishop all her goods , even to the last farthing that she doth possess , and be thereto mulcted in the costs .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 3]: Next ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 15]: Here was a tragic end to a beautiful honeymoon not yet three months old .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 4]: Poor young creatures !
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 14]: They had lived these three months lapped to the lips in worldly comforts .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 86]: These clothes and trinkets they were wearing were as fine and dainty as the shrewdest stretch of the sumptuary laws allowed to people of their degree ; and in these pretty clothes , she crying on his shoulder , and he trying to comfort her with hopeful words set to the music of despair , they went from the judgment seat out into the world homeless , bedless , breadless ; why , the very beggars by the roadsides were not so poor as they .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 27]: Well , the king was out of the hole ; and on terms satisfactory to the Church and the rest of the aristocracy , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 32]: Men write many fine and plausible arguments in support of monarchy , but the fact remains that where every man in a State has a vote , brutal laws are impossible .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 57]: Arthur 's people were of course poor material for a republic , because they had been debased so long by monarchy ; and yet even they would have been intelligent enough to make short work of that law which the king had just been administering if it had been submitted to their full and free vote .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 107]: There is a phrase which has grown so common in the world 's mouth that it has come to seem to have sense and meaning -- the sense and meaning implied when it is used ; that is the phrase which refers to this or that or the other nation as possibly being `` capable of self-government '' ; and the implied sense of it is , that there has been a nation somewhere , some time or other which _ was n't _ capable of it -- was n't as able to govern itself as some self-appointed specialists were or would be to govern it .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 93]: The master minds of all nations , in all ages , have sprung in affluent multitude from the mass of the nation , and from the mass of the nation only -- not from its privileged classes ; and so , no matter what the nation 's intellectual grade was ; whether high or low , the bulk of its ability was in the long ranks of its nameless and its poor , and so it never saw the day that it had not the material in abundance whereby to govern itself .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 53]: Which is to assert an always self-proven fact : that even the best governed and most free and most enlightened monarchy is still behind the best condition attainable by its people ; and that the same is true of kindred governments of lower grades , all the way down to the lowest .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 13]: King Arthur had hurried up the army business altogether beyond my calculations .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 73]: I had not supposed he would move in the matter while I was away ; and so I had not mapped out a scheme for determining the merits of officers ; I had only remarked that it would be wise to submit every candidate to a sharp and searching examination ; and privately I meant to put together a list of military qualifications that nobody could answer to but my West Pointers .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 56]: That ought to have been attended to before I left ; for the king was so taken with the idea of a standing army that he could n't wait but must get about it at once , and get up as good a scheme of examination as he could invent out of his own head .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 31]: I was impatient to see what this was ; and to show , too , how much more admirable was the one which I should display to the Examining Board .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 16]: I intimated this , gently , to the king , and it fired his curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 18]: When the Board was assembled , I followed him in ; and behind us came the candidates .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 25]: One of these candidates was a bright young West Pointer of mine , and with him were a couple of my West Point professors .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 17]: When I saw the Board , I did not know whether to cry or to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 15]: The head of it was the officer known to later centuries as Norroy King-at-Arms !
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 35]: The two other members were chiefs of bureaus in his department ; and all three were priests , of course ; all officials who had to know how to read and write were priests .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 29]: My candidate was called first , out of courtesy to me , and the head of the Board opened on him with official solemnity : `` Name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 4]: `` Mal-ease . ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 5]: `` Son of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 4]: `` Webster . ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 5]: `` Webster -- Webster .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 13]: H 'm -- I -- my memory faileth to recall the name .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 3]: Condition ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 4]: `` Weaver . ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 3]: `` Weaver !
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 6]: -- God keep us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 23]: The king was staggered , from his summit to his foundations ; one clerk fainted , and the others came near it .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 15]: The chairman pulled himself together , and said indignantly : `` It is sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 5]: Get you hence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 7]: But I appealed to the king .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 9]: I begged that my candidate might be examined .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 30]: The king was willing , but the Board , who were all well-born folk , implored the king to spare them the indignity of examining the weaver 's son .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 30]: I knew they did n't know enough to examine him anyway , so I joined my prayers to theirs and the king turned the duty over to my professors .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 19]: I had had a blackboard prepared , and it was put up now , and the circus began .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 226]: It was beautiful to hear the lad lay out the science of war , and wallow in details of battle and siege , of supply , transportation , mining and countermining , grand tactics , big strategy and little strategy , signal service , infantry , cavalry , artillery , and all about siege guns , field guns , gatling guns , rifled guns , smooth bores , musket practice , revolver practice -- and not a solitary word of it all could these catfish make head or tail of , you understand -- and it was handsome to see him chalk off mathematical nightmares on the blackboard that would stump the angels themselves , and do it like nothing , too -- all about eclipses , and comets , and solstices , and constellations , and mean time , and sidereal time , and dinner time , and bedtime , and every other imaginable thing above the clouds or under them that you could harry or bullyrag an enemy with and make him wish he had n't come -- and when the boy made his military salute and stood aside at last , I was proud enough to hug him , and all those other people were so dazed they looked partly petrified , partly drunk , and wholly caught out and snowed under .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 14]: I judged that the cake was ours , and by a large majority .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 6]: Education is a great thing .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 44]: This was the same youth who had come to West Point so ignorant that when I asked him , `` If a general officer should have a horse shot under him on the field of battle , what ought he to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 14]: answered up naively and said : `` Get up and brush himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 10]: One of the young nobles was called up now .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 10]: I thought I would question him a little myself .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 10]: I said : `` Can your lordship read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 19]: His face flushed indignantly , and he fired this at me : `` Takest me for a clerk ?
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 17]: I trow I am not of a blood that -- '' `` Answer the question ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 14]: He crowded his wrath down and made out to answer `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 6]: `` Can you write ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 26]: He wanted to resent this , too , but I said : `` You will confine yourself to the questions , and make no comments .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 21]: You are not here to air your blood or your graces , and nothing of the sort will be permitted .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 5]: Can you write ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 9]: `` Do you know the multiplication table ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 10]: `` I wit not what ye refer to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 9]: `` How much is 9 times 6 ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 47]: `` It is a mystery that is hidden from me by reason that the emergency requiring the fathoming of it hath not in my life-days occurred , and so , not having no need to know this thing , I abide barren of the knowledge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 80]: `` If A trade a barrel of onions to B , worth 2 pence the bushel , in exchange for a sheep worth 4 pence and a dog worth a penny , and C kill the dog before delivery , because bitten by the same , who mistook him for D , what sum is still due to A from B , and which party pays for the dog , C or D , and who gets the money ?
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 47]: If A , is the penny sufficient , or may he claim consequential damages in the form of additional money to represent the possible profit which might have inured from the dog , and classifiable as earned increment , that is to say , usufruct ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 44]: `` Verily , in the all-wise and unknowable providence of God , who moveth in mysterious ways his wonders to perform , have I never heard the fellow to this question for confusion of the mind and congestion of the ducts of thought .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 72]: Wherefore I beseech you let the dog and the onions and these people of the strange and godless names work out their several salvations from their piteous and wonderful difficulties without help of mine , for indeed their trouble is sufficient as it is , whereas an I tried to help I should but damage their cause the more and yet mayhap not live myself to see the desolation wrought . ''
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 14]: `` What do you know of the laws of attraction and gravitation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 34]: `` If there be such , mayhap his grace the king did promulgate them whilst that I lay sick about the beginning of the year and thereby failed to hear his proclamation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 12]: `` What do you know of the science of optics ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 51]: `` I know of governors of places , and seneschals of castles , and sheriffs of counties , and many like small offices and titles of honor , but him you call the Science of Optics I have not heard of before ; peradventure it is a new dignity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 8]: `` Yes , in this country . ''
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 20]: Try to conceive of this mollusk gravely applying for an official position , of any kind under the sun !
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 28]: Why , he had all the earmarks of a typewriter copyist , if you leave out the disposition to contribute uninvited emendations of your grammar and punctuation .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 25]: It was unaccountable that he did n't attempt a little help of that sort out of his majestic supply of incapacity for the job .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 28]: But that did n't prove that he had n't material in him for the disposition , it only proved that he was n't a typewriter copyist yet .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 36]: After nagging him a little more , I let the professors loose on him and they turned him inside out , on the line of scientific war , and found him empty , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 34]: He knew somewhat about the warfare of the time -- bushwhacking around for ogres , and bull-fights in the tournament ring , and such things -- but otherwise he was empty and useless .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 24]: Then we took the other young noble in hand , and he was the first one 's twin , for ignorance and incapacity .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 22]: I delivered them into the hands of the chairman of the Board with the comfortable consciousness that their cake was dough .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 10]: They were examined in the previous order of precedence .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 8]: `` Name , so please you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 14]: `` Pertipole , son of Sir Pertipole , Baron of Barley Mash . ''
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 4]: `` Grandfather ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 11]: `` Also Sir Pertipole , Baron of Barley Mash . ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 4]: `` Great-grandfather ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 8]: `` The same name and title . ''
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 4]: `` Great-great-grandfather ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 20]: `` We had none , worshipful sir , the line failing before it had reached so far back . ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 5]: `` It mattereth not .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 16]: It is a good four generations , and fulfilleth the requirements of the rule . ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 6]: `` Fulfills what rule ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 17]: `` The rule requiring four generations of nobility or else the candidate is not eligible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 22]: `` A man not eligible for a lieutenancy in the army unless he can prove four generations of noble descent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 18]: `` Even so ; neither lieutenant nor any other officer may be commissioned without that qualification . ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 11]: `` Oh , come , this is an astonishing thing .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 10]: What good is such a qualification as that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 4]: `` What good ?
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 29]: It is a hardy question , fair sir and Boss , since it doth go far to impugn the wisdom of even our holy Mother Church herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 5]: `` As how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 12]: `` For that she hath established the self-same rule regarding saints .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 16]: By her law none may be canonized until he hath lain dead four generations . ''
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 13]: `` I see , I see -- it is the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 4]: It is wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 65]: In the one case a man lies dead-alive four generations -- mummified in ignorance and sloth -- and that qualifies him to command live people , and take their weal and woe into his impotent hands ; and in the other case , a man lies bedded with death and worms four generations , and that qualifies him for office in the celestial camp .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 12]: Does the king 's grace approve of this strange law ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 17]: The king said : `` Why , truly I see naught about it that is strange .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 42]: All places of honor and of profit do belong , by natural right , to them that be of noble blood , and so these dignities in the army are their property and would be so without this or any rule .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 9]: The rule is but to mark a limit .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 33]: Its purpose is to keep out too recent blood , which would bring into contempt these offices , and men of lofty lineage would turn their backs and scorn to take them .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 10]: I were to blame an I permitted this calamity .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 40]: _ You _ can permit it an you are minded so to do , for you have the delegated authority , but that the king should do it were a most strange madness and not comprehensible to any . ''
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 4]: `` I yield .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 11]: Proceed , sir Chief of the Herald 's College . ''
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 38]: The chairman resumed as follows : `` By what illustrious achievement for the honor of the Throne and State did the founder of your great line lift himself to the sacred dignity of the British nobility ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 7]: `` He built a brewery . ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 35]: `` Sire , the Board finds this candidate perfect in all the requirements and qualifications for military command , and doth hold his case open for decision after due examination of his competitor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 13]: The competitor came forward and proved exactly four generations of nobility himself .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 11]: So there was a tie in military qualifications that far .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 28]: He stood aside a moment , and Sir Pertipole was questioned further : `` Of what condition was the wife of the founder of your line ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 47]: `` She came of the highest landed gentry , yet she was not noble ; she was gracious and pure and charitable , of a blameless life and character , insomuch that in these regards was she peer of the best lady in the land . ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 5]: `` That will do .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 4]: Stand down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 31]: He called up the competing lordling again , and asked : `` What was the rank and condition of the great-grandmother who conferred British nobility upon your great house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 28]: `` She was a king 's leman and did climb to that splendid eminence by her own unholpen merit from the sewer where she was born . ''
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 19]: `` Ah , this , indeed , is true nobility , this is the right and perfect intermixture .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 8]: The lieutenancy is yours , fair lord .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 29]: Hold it not in contempt ; it is the humble step which will lead to grandeurs more worthy of the splendor of an origin like to thine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 10]: I was down in the bottomless pit of humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 16]: I had promised myself an easy and zenith-scouring triumph , and this was the outcome !
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 14]: I was almost ashamed to look my poor disappointed cadet in the face .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 16]: I told him to go home and be patient , this was n't the end .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 14]: I had a private audience with the king , and made a proposition .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 23]: I said it was quite right to officer that regiment with nobilities , and he could n't have done a wiser thing .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 105]: It would also be a good idea to add five hundred officers to it ; in fact , add as many officers as there were nobles and relatives of nobles in the country , even if there should finally be five times as many officers as privates in it ; and thus make it the crack regiment , the envied regiment , the King 's Own regiment , and entitled to fight on its own hook and in its own way , and go whither it would and come when it pleased , in time of war , and be utterly swell and independent .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 23]: This would make that regiment the heart 's desire of all the nobility , and they would all be satisfied and happy .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 126]: Then we would make up the rest of the standing army out of commonplace materials , and officer it with nobodies , as was proper -- nobodies selected on a basis of mere efficiency -- and we would make this regiment toe the line , allow it no aristocratic freedom from restraint , and force it to do all the work and persistent hammering , to the end that whenever the King 's Own was tired and wanted to go off for a change and rummage around amongst ogres and have a good time , it could go without uneasiness , knowing that matters were in safe hands behind it , and business going to be continued at the old stand , same as usual .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 8]: The king was charmed with the idea .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 12]: When I noticed that , it gave me a valuable notion .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 16]: I thought I saw my way out of an old and stubborn difficulty at last .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 17]: You see , the royalties of the Pendragon stock were a long-lived race and very fruitful .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 35]: Whenever a child was born to any of these -- and it was pretty often -- there was wild joy in the nation 's mouth , and piteous sorrow in the nation 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 11]: The joy was questionable , but the grief was honest .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 11]: Because the event meant another call for a Royal Grant .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 27]: Long was the list of these royalties , and they were a heavy and steadily increasing burden upon the treasury and a menace to the crown .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 31]: Yet Arthur could not believe this latter fact , and he would not listen to any of my various projects for substituting something in the place of the royal grants .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 58]: If I could have persuaded him to now and then provide a support for one of these outlying scions from his own pocket , I could have made a grand to-do over it , and it would have had a good effect with the nation ; but no , he would n't hear of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 47]: He had something like a religious passion for royal grant ; he seemed to look upon it as a sort of sacred swag , and one could not irritate him in any way so quickly and so surely as by an attack upon that venerable institution .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 48]: If I ventured to cautiously hint that there was not another respectable family in England that would humble itself to hold out the hat -- however , that is as far as I ever got ; he always cut me short there , and peremptorily , too .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 10]: But I believed I saw my chance at last .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 16]: I would form this crack regiment out of officers alone -- not a single private .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 54]: Half of it should consist of nobles , who should fill all the places up to Major-General , and serve gratis and pay their own expenses ; and they would be glad to do this when they should learn that the rest of the regiment would consist exclusively of princes of the blood .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 28]: These princes of the blood should range in rank from Lieutenant-General up to Field Marshal , and be gorgeously salaried and equipped and fed by the state .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 49]: Moreover -- and this was the master stroke -- it should be decreed that these princely grandees should be always addressed by a stunningly gaudy and awe-compelling title -LRB- which I would presently invent -RRB- , and they and they only in all England should be so addressed .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 35]: Finally , all princes of the blood should have free choice ; join that regiment , get that great title , and renounce the royal grant , or stay out and receive a grant .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 40]: Neatest touch of all : unborn but imminent princes of the blood could be _ born _ into the regiment , and start fair , with good wages and a permanent situation , upon due notice from the parents .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 32]: All the boys would join , I was sure of that ; so , all existing grants would be relinquished ; that the newly born would always join was equally certain .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 32]: Within sixty days that quaint and bizarre anomaly , the Royal Grant , would cease to be a living fact , and take its place among the curiosities of the past .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 87]: CHAPTER XXVI THE FIRST NEWSPAPER When I told the king I was going out disguised as a petty freeman to scour the country and familiarize myself with the humbler life of the people , he was all afire with the novelty of the thing in a minute , and was bound to take a chance in the adventure himself -- nothing should stop him -- he would drop everything and go along -- it was the prettiest idea he had run across for many a day .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 23]: He wanted to glide out the back way and start at once ; but I showed him that that would n't answer .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 50]: You see , he was billed for the king 's - evil -- to touch for it , I mean -- and it would n't be right to disappoint the house and it would n't make a delay worth considering , anyway , it was only a one-night stand .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 14]: And I thought he ought to tell the queen he was going away .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 9]: He clouded up at that and looked sad .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 43]: I was sorry I had spoken , especially when he said mournfully : `` Thou forgettest that Launcelot is here ; and where Launcelot is , she noteth not the going forth of the king , nor what day he returneth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 8]: Of course , I changed the Subject .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 20]: Yes , Guenever was beautiful , it is true , but take her all around she was pretty slack .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 35]: I never meddled in these matters , they were n't my affair , but I did hate to see the way things were going on , and I do n't mind saying that much .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 20]: Many 's the time she had asked me , `` Sir Boss , hast seen Sir Launcelot about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 21]: but if ever she went fretting around for the king I did n't happen to be around at the time .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 19]: There was a very good lay-out for the king 's - evil business -- very tidy and creditable .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 23]: The king sat under a canopy of state ; about him were clustered a large body of the clergy in full canonicals .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 24]: Conspicuous , both for location and personal outfit , stood Marinel , a hermit of the quack-doctor species , to introduce the sick .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 30]: All abroad over the spacious floor , and clear down to the doors , in a thick jumble , lay or sat the scrofulous , under a strong light .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 28]: It was as good as a tableau ; in fact , it had all the look of being gotten up for that , though it was n't .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 8]: There were eight hundred sick people present .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 38]: The work was slow ; it lacked the interest of novelty for me , because I had seen the ceremonies before ; the thing soon became tedious , but the proprieties required me to stick it out .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 65]: The doctor was there for the reason that in all such crowds there were many people who only imagined something was the matter with them , and many who were consciously sound but wanted the immortal honor of fleshly contact with a king , and yet others who pretended to illness in order to get the piece of coin that went with the touch .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 21]: Up to this time this coin had been a wee little gold piece worth about a third of a dollar .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 70]: When you consider how much that amount of money would buy , in that age and country , and how usual it was to be scrofulous , when not dead , you would understand that the annual king 's - evil appropriation was just the River and Harbor bill of that government for the grip it took on the treasury and the chance it afforded for skinning the surplus .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 17]: So I had privately concluded to touch the treasury itself for the king 's - evil .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 67]: I covered six-sevenths of the appropriation into the treasury a week before starting from Camelot on my adventures , and ordered that the other seventh be inflated into five-cent nickels and delivered into the hands of the head clerk of the King 's Evil Department ; a nickel to take the place of each gold coin , you see , and do its work for it .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 15]: It might strain the nickel some , but I judged it could stand it .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 31]: As a rule , I do not approve of watering stock , but I considered it square enough in this case , for it was just a gift , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 20]: Of course , you can water a gift as much as you want to ; and I generally do .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 75]: The old gold and silver coins of the country were of ancient and unknown origin , as a rule , but some of them were Roman ; they were ill-shapen , and seldom rounder than a moon that is a week past the full ; they were hammered , not minted , and they were so worn with use that the devices upon them were as illegible as blisters , and looked like them .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 59]: I judged that a sharp , bright new nickel , with a first-rate likeness of the king on one side of it and Guenever on the other , and a blooming pious motto , would take the tuck out of scrofula as handy as a nobler coin and please the scrofulous fancy more ; and I was right .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 17]: This batch was the first it was tried on , and it worked to a charm .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 9]: The saving in expense was a notable economy .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 55]: You will see that by these figures : We touched a trifle over 700 of the 800 patients ; at former rates , this would have cost the government about $ 240 ; at the new rate we pulled through for about $ 35 , thus saving upward of $ 200 at one swoop .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 51]: To appreciate the full magnitude of this stroke , consider these other figures : the annual expenses of a national government amount to the equivalent of a contribution of three days ' average wages of every individual of the population , counting every individual as if he were a man .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 36]: If you take a nation of 60,000,000 , where average wages are $ 2 per day , three days ' wages taken from each individual will provide $ 360,000,000 and pay the government 's expenses .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 86]: In my day , in my own country , this money was collected from imposts , and the citizen imagined that the foreign importer paid it , and it made him comfortable to think so ; whereas , in fact , it was paid by the American people , and was so equally and exactly distributed among them that the annual cost to the 100-millionaire and the annual cost to the sucking child of the day-laborer was precisely the same -- each paid $ 6 .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 10]: Nothing could be equaler than that , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 25]: Well , Scotland and Ireland were tributary to Arthur , and the united populations of the British Islands amounted to something less than 1,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 18]: A mechanic 's average wage was 3 cents a day , when he paid his own keep .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 21]: By this rule the national government 's expenses were $ 90,000 a year , or about $ 250 a day .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 62]: Thus , by the substitution of nickels for gold on a king 's - evil day , I not only injured no one , dissatisfied no one , but pleased all concerned and saved four-fifths of that day 's national expense into the bargain -- a saving which would have been the equivalent of $ 800,000 in my day in America .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 57]: In making this substitution I had drawn upon the wisdom of a very remote source -- the wisdom of my boyhood -- for the true statesman does not despise any wisdom , howsoever lowly may be its origin : in my boyhood I had always saved my pennies and contributed buttons to the foreign missionary cause .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 31]: The buttons would answer the ignorant savage as well as the coin , the coin would answer me better than the buttons ; all hands were happy and nobody hurt .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 8]: Marinel took the patients as they came .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 26]: He examined the candidate ; if he could n't qualify he was warned off ; if he could he was passed along to the king .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 22]: A priest pronounced the words , `` They shall lay their hands on the sick , and they shall recover . ''
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 35]: Then the king stroked the ulcers , while the reading continued ; finally , the patient graduated and got his nickel -- the king hanging it around his neck himself -- and was dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 8]: Would you think that that would cure ?
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 4]: It certainly did .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 14]: Any mummery will cure if the patient 's faith is strong in it .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 101]: Up by Astolat there was a chapel where the Virgin had once appeared to a girl who used to herd geese around there -- the girl said so herself -- and they built the chapel upon that spot and hung a picture in it representing the occurrence -- a picture which you would think it dangerous for a sick person to approach ; whereas , on the contrary , thousands of the lame and the sick came and prayed before it every year and went away whole and sound ; and even the well could look upon it and live .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 28]: Of course , when I was told these things I did not believe them ; but when I went there and saw them I had to succumb .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 16]: I saw the cures effected myself ; and they were real cures and not questionable .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 33]: I saw cripples whom I had seen around Camelot for years on crutches , arrive and pray before that picture , and put down their crutches and walk off without a limp .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 17]: There were piles of crutches there which had been left by such people as a testimony .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 22]: In other places people operated on a patient 's mind , without saying a word to him , and cured him .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 27]: In others , experts assembled patients in a room and prayed over them , and appealed to their faith , and those patients went away cured .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 44]: Wherever you find a king who ca n't cure the king 's - evil you can be sure that the most valuable superstition that supports his throne -- the subject 's belief in the divine appointment of his sovereign -- has passed away .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 34]: In my youth the monarchs of England had ceased to touch for the evil , but there was no occasion for this diffidence : they could have cured it forty-nine times in fifty .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 39]: Well , when the priest had been droning for three hours , and the good king polishing the evidences , and the sick were still pressing forward as plenty as ever , I got to feeling intolerably bored .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 15]: I was sitting by an open window not far from the canopy of state .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 66]: For the five hundredth time a patient stood forward to have his repulsivenesses stroked ; again those words were being droned out : `` they shall lay their hands on the sick '' -- when outside there rang clear as a clarion a note that enchanted my soul and tumbled thirteen worthless centuries about my ears : `` Camelot _ Weekly Hosannah and Literary Volcano !
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 21]: _ -- latest irruption -- only two cents -- all about the big miracle in the Valley of Holiness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 10]: One greater than kings had arrived -- the newsboy .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 32]: But I was the only person in all that throng who knew the meaning of this mighty birth , and what this imperial magician was come into the world to do .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 33]: I dropped a nickel out of the window and got my paper ; the Adam-newsboy of the world went around the corner to get my change ; is around the corner yet .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 29]: It was delicious to see a newspaper again , yet I was conscious of a secret shock when my eye fell upon the first batch of display head-lines .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 35]: I had lived in a clammy atmosphere of reverence , respect , deference , so long that they sent a quivery little cold wave through me : HIGH TIMES IN THE VALLEY OF HOLINESS !
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 5]: -- THE WATER-WORKS CORKED !
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 11]: -- BRER MERLIN WORKS HIS ARTS , BUT GETS LEFT ?
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 10]: -- But the Boss scores on his first Innings !
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 15]: -- The Miraculous Well Uncorked amid awful outbursts of INFERNAL FIRE AND SMOKE ATHUNDER !
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 5]: -- THE BUZZARD-ROOST ASTONISHED !
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 4]: -- UNPARALLELED REJOIBINGS !
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 9]: -- and so on , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 7]: Yes , it was too loud .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 23]: Once I could have enjoyed it and seen nothing out of the way about it , but now its note was discordant .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 12]: It was good Arkansas journalism , but this was not Arkansas .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 24]: Moreover , the next to the last line was calculated to give offense to the hermits , and perhaps lose us their advertising .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 15]: Indeed , there was too lightsome a tone of flippancy all through the paper .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 13]: It was plain I had undergone a considerable change without noticing it .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 28]: I found myself unpleasantly affected by pert little irreverencies which would have seemed but proper and airy graces of speech at an earlier period of my life .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 21]: There was an abundance of the following breed of items , and they discomforted me : LOCAL SMOKE AND CINDERS .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 27]: Sir Launcelot met up with old King Agrivance of Ireland unexpectedly last weok over on the moor south of Sir Balmoral le Merveilleuse 's hog dasture .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 6]: The widow has been notified .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 20]: Expedition No. 3 will start adout the first of mext month on a search f8r Sir Sagramour le Desirous .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 26]: It is in com - and of the renowned Knight of the Red Lawns , assissted by Sir Persant of Inde , who is compete9t .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 32]: intelligent , courte - ous , and in every way a brick , and fur - tHer assisted by Sir Palamides the Sara - cen , who is no huckleberry hinself .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 12]: This is no pic-nic , these boys mean busine & s .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 58]: The readers of the Hosannah will re - gret to learn that the hadndsome and popular Sir Charolais of Gaul , who dur - ing his four weeks ' stay at the Bull and Halibut , this city , has won every heart by his polished manners and elegant cPnversation , will pUll out to-day for home .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 7]: Give us another call , Charley !
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 76]: The bdsiness end of the funeral of the late Sir Dalliance the duke 's son of Cornwall , killed in an encounter with the Giant of the Knotted Bludgeon last Tuesday on the borders of the Plain of Enchantment was in the hands of the ever affable and efficient Mumble , prince of un3ertakers , then whom there exists none by whom it were a more satisfying pleasure to have the last sad offices performed .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 5]: Give him a trial .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 66]: The cordial thanks of the Hosannah office are due , from editor down to devil , to the ever courteous and thought - ful Lord High Stew d of the Palace 's Third Assistant V t for several sau - ceTs of ice crEam a quality calculated to make the ey of the recipients hu - mid with grt ude ; and it done it .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 23]: When this administration wants to chalk up a desirable name for early promotion , the Hosannah would like a chance to sudgest .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 34]: The Demoiselle Irene Dewlap , of South Astolat , is visiting her uncle , the popular host of the Cattlemen 's Board - ing Ho & se , Liver Lane , this city .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 23]: Young Barker the bellows-mender is hoMe again , and looks much improved by his vacation round-up among the out - lying smithies .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 4]: See his ad .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 24]: Of course it was good enough journalism for a beginning ; I knew that quite well , and yet it was somehow disappointing .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 28]: The `` Court Circular '' pleased me better ; indeed , its simple and dignified respectfulness was a distinct refreshment to me after all those disgraceful familiarities .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 8]: But even it could have been improved .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 22]: Do what one may , there is no getting an air of variety into a court circular , I acknowledge that .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 23]: There is a profound monotonousness about its facts that baffles and defeats one 's sincerest efforts to make them sparkle and enthuse .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 39]: The best way to manage -- in fact , the only sensible way -- is to disguise repetitiousness of fact under variety of form : skin your fact each time and lay on a new cuticle of words .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 61]: It deceives the eye ; you think it is a new fact ; it gives you the idea that the court is carrying on like everything ; this excites you , and you drain the whole column , with a good appetite , and perhaps never notice that it 's a barrel of soup made out of a single bean .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 35]: Clarence 's way was good , it was simple , it was dignified , it was direct and business-like ; all I say is , it was not the best way : COURT CIRCULAR .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 11]: On Monday , the king rode in the park . ''
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 48]: Tuesday , '' '' '' '' Wendesday '' '' '' '' Thursday '' '' '' '' Friday , '' '' '' '' Saturday '' '' '' '' Sunday , '' '' '' However , take the paper by and large , I was vastly pleased with it .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 46]: Little crudities of a mechanical sort were observable here and there , but there were not enough of them to amount to anything , and it was good enough Arkansas proof-reading , anyhow , and better than was needed in Arthur 's day and realm .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 25]: As a rule , the grammar was leaky and the construction more or less lame ; but I did not much mind these things .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 25]: They are common defects of my own , and one must n't criticise other people on grounds where he ca n't stand perpendicular himself .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 51]: I was hungry enough for literature to want to take down the whole paper at this one meal , but I got only a few bites , and then had to postpone , because the monks around me besieged me so with eager questions : What is this curious thing ?
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 5]: What is it for ?
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 5]: Is it a handkerchief ?
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 4]: -- saddle blanket ?
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 6]: -- part of a shirt ?
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 6]: What is it made of ?
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 16]: How thin it is , and how dainty and frail ; and how it rattles .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 16]: Will it wear , do you think , and wo n't the rain injure it ?
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 14]: Is it writing that appears on it , or is it only ornamentation ?
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 42]: They suspected it was writing , because those among them who knew how to read Latin and had a smattering of Greek , recognized some of the letters , but they could make nothing out of the result as a whole .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 28]: I put my information in the simplest form I could : `` It is a public journal ; I will explain what that is , another time .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 20]: It is not cloth , it is made of paper ; some time I will explain what paper is .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 27]: The lines on it are reading matter ; and not written by hand , but printed ; by and by I will explain what printing is .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 27]: A thousand of these sheets have been made , all exactly like this , in every minute detail -- they ca n't be told apart . ''
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 16]: Then they all broke out with exclamations of surprise and admiration : `` A thousand !
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 14]: Verily a mighty work -- a year 's work for many men . ''
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 16]: `` No -- merely a day 's work for a man and a boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 13]: They crossed themselves , and whiffed out a protective prayer or two .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 9]: `` Ah-h -- a miracle , a wonder !
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 6]: Dark work of enchantment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 7]: I let it go at that .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 50]: Then I read in a low voice , to as many as could crowd their shaven heads within hearing distance , part of the account of the miracle of the restoration of the well , and was accompanied by astonished and reverent ejaculations all through : `` Ah-h-h ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 5]: `` How true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 6]: `` Amazing , amazing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 15]: `` These be the very haps as they happened , in marvelous exactness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 19]: And might they take this strange thing in their hands , and feel of it and examine it ?
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 7]: -- they would be very careful .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 50]: So they took it , handling it as cautiously and devoutly as if it had been some holy thing come from some supernatural region ; and gently felt of its texture , caressed its pleasant smooth surface with lingering touch , and scanned the mysterious characters with fascinated eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 18]: These grouped bent heads , these charmed faces , these speaking eyes -- how beautiful to me !
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 28]: For was not this my darling , and was not all this mute wonder and interest and homage a most eloquent tribute and unforced compliment to it ?
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 67]: I knew , then , how a mother feels when women , whether strangers or friends , take her new baby , and close themselves about it with one eager impulse , and bend their heads over it in a tranced adoration that makes all the rest of the universe vanish out of their consciousness and be as if it were not , for that time .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 41]: I knew how she feels , and that there is no other satisfied ambition , whether of king , conqueror , or poet , that ever reaches half-way to that serene far summit or yields half so divine a contentment .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 46]: During all the rest of the seance my paper traveled from group to group all up and down and about that huge hall , and my happy eye was upon it always , and I sat motionless , steeped in satisfaction , drunk with enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 20]: Yes , this was heaven ; I was tasting it once , if I might never taste it more .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 38]: CHAPTER XXVII THE YANKEE AND THE KING TRAVEL INCOGNITO About bedtime I took the king to my private quarters to cut his hair and help him get the hang of the lowly raiment he was to wear .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 47]: The high classes wore their hair banged across the forehead but hanging to the shoulders the rest of the way around , whereas the lowest ranks of commoners were banged fore and aft both ; the slaves were bangless , and allowed their hair free growth .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 19]: So I inverted a bowl over his head and cut away all the locks that hung below it .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 26]: I also trimmed his whiskers and mustache until they were only about a half-inch long ; and tried to do it inartistically , and succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 6]: It was a villainous disfigurement .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 50]: When he got his lubberly sandals on , and his long robe of coarse brown linen cloth , which hung straight from his neck to his ankle-bones , he was no longer the comeliest man in his kingdom , but one of the unhandsomest and most commonplace and unattractive .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 52]: We were dressed and barbered alike , and could pass for small farmers , or farm bailiffs , or shepherds , or carters ; yes , or for village artisans , if we chose , our costume being in effect universal among the poor , because of its strength and cheapness .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 37]: I do n't mean that it was really cheap to a very poor person , but I do mean that it was the cheapest material there was for male attire -- manufactured material , you understand .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 30]: We slipped away an hour before dawn , and by broad sun-up had made eight or ten miles , and were in the midst of a sparsely settled country .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 36]: I had a pretty heavy knapsack ; it was laden with provisions -- provisions for the king to taper down on , till he could take to the coarse fare of the country without damage .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 26]: I found a comfortable seat for the king by the roadside , and then gave him a morsel or two to stay his stomach with .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 15]: Then I said I would find some water for him , and strolled away .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 19]: Part of my project was to get out of sight and sit down and rest a little myself .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 59]: It had always been my custom to stand when in his presence ; even at the council board , except upon those rare occasions when the sitting was a very long one , extending over hours ; then I had a trifling little backless thing which was like a reversed culvert and was as comfortable as the toothache .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 16]: I did n't want to break him in suddenly , but do it by degrees .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 39]: We should have to sit together now when in company , or people would notice ; but it would not be good politics for me to be playing equality with him when there was no necessity for it .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 23]: I found the water some three hundred yards away , and had been resting about twenty minutes , when I heard voices .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 22]: That is all right , I thought -- peasants going to work ; nobody else likely to be stirring this early .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 30]: But the next moment these comers jingled into sight around a turn of the road -- smartly clad people of quality , with luggage-mules and servants in their train !
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 16]: I was off like a shot , through the bushes , by the shortest cut .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 47]: For a while it did seem that these people would pass the king before I could get to him ; but desperation gives you wings , you know , and I canted my body forward , inflated my breast , and held my breath and flew .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 3]: I arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 9]: And in plenty good enough time , too .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 16]: `` Pardon , my king , but it 's no time for ceremony -- jump !
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 11]: Jump to your feet -- some quality are coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 6]: `` Is that a marvel ?
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 5]: Let them come . ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 5]: `` But my liege !
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 7]: You must not be seen sitting .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 2]: Rise !
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 10]: -- and stand in humble posture while they pass .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 9]: You are a peasant , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 78]: `` True -- I had forgot it , so lost was I in planning of a huge war with Gaul '' -- he was up by this time , but a farm could have got up quicker , if there was any kind of a boom in real estate -- `` and right-so a thought came randoming overthwart this majestic dream the which -- '' `` A humbler attitude , my lord the king -- and quick !
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 4]: Duck your head !
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 3]: -- more !
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 4]: -- still more !
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 5]: -- droop it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 15]: He did his honest best , but lord , it was no great things .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 11]: He looked as humble as the leaning tower at Pisa .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 10]: It is the most you could say of it .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 71]: Indeed , it was such a thundering poor success that it raised wondering scowls all along the line , and a gorgeous flunkey at the tail end of it raised his whip ; but I jumped in time and was under it when it fell ; and under cover of the volley of coarse laughter which followed , I spoke up sharply and warned the king to take no notice .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 22]: He mastered himself for the moment , but it was a sore tax ; he wanted to eat up the procession .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 29]: I said : `` It would end our adventures at the very start ; and we , being without weapons , could do nothing with that armed gang .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 23]: If we are going to succeed in our emprise , we must not only look the peasant but act the peasant . ''
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 10]: `` It is wisdom ; none can gainsay it .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 8]: Let us go on , Sir Boss .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 15]: I will take note and learn , and do the best I may . ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 5]: He kept his word .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 13]: He did the best he could , but I 've seen better .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 63]: If you have ever seen an active , heedless , enterprising child going diligently out of one mischief and into another all day long , and an anxious mother at its heels all the while , and just saving it by a hair from drowning itself or breaking its neck with each new experiment , you 've seen the king and me .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 53]: If I could have foreseen what the thing was going to be like , I should have said , No , if anybody wants to make his living exhibiting a king as a peasant , let him take the layout ; I can do better with a menagerie , and last longer .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 20]: And yet , during the first three days I never allowed him to enter a hut or other dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 29]: If he could pass muster anywhere during his early novitiate it would be in small inns and on the road ; so to these places we confined ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 15]: Yes , he certainly did the best he could , but what of that ?
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 11]: He did n't improve a bit that I could see .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 19]: He was always frightening me , always breaking out with fresh astonishers , in new and unexpected places .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 22]: Toward evening on the second day , what does he do but blandly fetch out a dirk from inside his robe !
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 14]: `` Great guns , my liege , where did you get that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 12]: `` From a smuggler at the inn , yester eve . ''
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 12]: `` What in the world possessed you to buy it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 30]: `` We have escaped divers dangers by wit -- thy wit -- but I have bethought me that it were but prudence if I bore a weapon , too .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 9]: Thine might fail thee in some pinch . ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 13]: `` But people of our condition are not allowed to carry arms .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 30]: What would a lord say -- yes , or any other person of whatever condition -- if he caught an upstart peasant with a dagger on his person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 14]: It was a lucky thing for us that nobody came along just then .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 30]: I persuaded him to throw the dirk away ; and it was as easy as persuading a child to give up some bright fresh new way of killing itself .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 8]: We walked along , silent and thinking .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 37]: Finally the king said : `` When ye know that I meditate a thing inconvenient , or that hath a peril in it , why do you not warn me to cease from that project ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 10]: It was a startling question , and a puzzler .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 46]: I did n't quite know how to take hold of it , or what to say , and so , of course , I ended by saying the natural thing : `` But , sire , how can I know what your thoughts are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 13]: The king stopped dead in his tracks , and stared at me .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 16]: `` I believed thou wert greater than Merlin ; and truly in magic thou art .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 7]: But prophecy is greater than magic .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 6]: Merlin is a prophet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 8]: I saw I had made a blunder .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 8]: I must get back my lost ground .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 19]: After a deep reflection and careful planning , I said : `` Sire , I have been misunderstood .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 4]: I will explain .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 7]: There are two kinds of prophecy .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 31]: One is the gift to foretell things that are but a little way off , the other is the gift to foretell things that are whole ages and centuries away .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 11]: Which is the mightier gift , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 10]: `` Oh , the last , most surely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 3]: `` True .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 6]: Does Merlin possess it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 5]: `` Partly , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 16]: He foretold mysteries about my birth and future kingship that were twenty years away . ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 9]: `` Has he ever gone beyond that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 11]: `` He would not claim more , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 7]: `` It is probably his limit .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 6]: All prophets have their limit .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 15]: The limit of some of the great prophets has been a hundred years . ''
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 9]: `` These are few , I ween . ''
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 31]: `` There have been two still greater ones , whose limit was four hundred and six hundred years , and one whose limit compassed even seven hundred and twenty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 8]: `` Gramercy , it is marvelous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 10]: `` But what are these in comparison with me ?
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 5]: They are nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 20]: Canst thou truly look beyond even so vast a stretch of time as -- '' `` Seven hundred years ?
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 33]: My liege , as clear as the vision of an eagle does my prophetic eye penetrate and lay bare the future of this world for nearly thirteen centuries and a half ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 28]: My land , you should have seen the king 's eyes spread slowly open , and lift the earth 's entire atmosphere as much as an inch !
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 5]: That settled Brer Merlin .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 24]: One never had any occasion to prove his facts , with these people ; all he had to do was to state them .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 10]: It never occurred to anybody to doubt the statement .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 56]: `` Now , then , '' I continued , `` I _ could _ work both kinds of prophecy -- the long and the short -- if I chose to take the trouble to keep in practice ; but I seldom exercise any but the long kind , because the other is beneath my dignity .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 19]: It is properer to Merlin 's sort -- stump-tail prophets , as we call them in the profession .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 26]: Of course , I whet up now and then and flirt out a minor prophecy , but not often -- hardly ever , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 38]: You will remember that there was great talk , when you reached the Valley of Holiness , about my having prophesied your coming and the very hour of your arrival , two or three days beforehand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 11]: `` Indeed , yes , I mind it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 43]: `` Well , I could have done it as much as forty times easier , and piled on a thousand times more detail into the bargain , if it had been five hundred years away instead of two or three days . ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 10]: `` How amazing that it should be so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 32]: `` Yes , a genuine expert can always foretell a thing that is five hundred years away easier than he can a thing that 's only five hundred seconds off . ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 46]: `` And yet in reason it should clearly be the other way ; it should be five hundred times as easy to foretell the last as the first , for , indeed , it is so close by that one uninspired might almost see it .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 25]: In truth , the law of prophecy doth contradict the likelihoods , most strangely making the difficult easy , and the easy difficult . ''
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 6]: It was a wise head .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 32]: A peasant 's cap was no safe disguise for it ; you could know it for a king 's under a diving-bell , if you could hear it work its intellect .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 14]: I had a new trade now , and plenty of business in it .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 29]: The king was as hungry to find out everything that was going to happen during the next thirteen centuries as if he were expecting to live in them .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 15]: From that time out , I prophesied myself bald-headed trying to supply the demand .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 23]: I have done some indiscreet things in my day , but this thing of playing myself for a prophet was the worst .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 7]: Still , it had its ameliorations .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 10]: A prophet does n't have to have any brains .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 25]: They are good to have , of course , for the ordinary exigencies of life , but they are no use in professional work .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 8]: It is the restfulest vocation there is .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 45]: When the spirit of prophecy comes upon you , you merely cake your intellect and lay it off in a cool place for a rest , and unship your jaw and leave it alone ; it will work itself : the result is prophecy .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 23]: Every day a knight-errant or so came along , and the sight of them fired the king 's martial spirit every time .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 40]: He would have forgotten himself , sure , and said something to them in a style a suspicious shade or so above his ostensible degree , and so I always got him well out of the road in time .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 42]: Then he would stand and look with all his eyes ; and a proud light would flash from them , and his nostrils would inflate like a war-horse 's , and I knew he was longing for a brush with them .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 89]: But about noon of the third day I had stopped in the road to take a precaution which had been suggested by the whip-stroke that had fallen to my share two days before ; a precaution which I had afterward decided to leave untaken , I was so loath to institute it ; but now I had just had a fresh reminder : while striding heedlessly along , with jaw spread and intellect at rest , for I was prophesying , I stubbed my toe and fell sprawling .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 24]: I was so pale I could n't think for a moment ; then I got softly and carefully up and unstrapped my knapsack .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 16]: I had that dynamite bomb in it , done up in wool in a box .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 49]: It was a good thing to have along ; the time would come when I could do a valuable miracle with it , maybe , but it was a nervous thing to have about me , and I did n't like to ask the king to carry it .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 20]: Yet I must either throw it away or think up some safe way to get along with its society .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 21]: I got it out and slipped it into my scrip , and just then here came a couple of knights .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 49]: The king stood , stately as a statue , gazing toward them -- had forgotten himself again , of course -- and before I could get a word of warning out , it was time for him to skip , and well that he did it , too .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 7]: He supposed they would turn aside .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 10]: Turn aside to avoid trampling peasant dirt under foot ?
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 36]: When had he ever turned aside himself -- or ever had the chance to do it , if a peasant saw him or any other noble knight in time to judiciously save him the trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 39]: The knights paid no attention to the king at all ; it was his place to look out himself , and if he had n't skipped he would have been placidly ridden down , and laughed at besides .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 21]: The king was in a flaming fury , and launched out his challenge and epithets with a most royal vigor .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 9]: The knights were some little distance by now .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 32]: They halted , greatly surprised , and turned in their saddles and looked back , as if wondering if it might be worth while to bother with such scum as we .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 8]: Then they wheeled and started for us .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 7]: Not a moment must be lost .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 7]: I started for _ them _ .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 33]: I passed them at a rattling gait , and as I went by I flung out a hair-lifting soul-scorching thirteen-jointed insult which made the king 's effort poor and cheap by comparison .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 13]: I got it out of the nineteenth century where they know how .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 49]: They had such headway that they were nearly to the king before they could check up ; then , frantic with rage , they stood up their horses on their hind hoofs and whirled them around , and the next moment here they came , breast to breast .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 18]: I was seventy yards off , then , and scrambling up a great bowlder at the roadside .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 48]: When they were within thirty yards of me they let their long lances droop to a level , depressed their mailed heads , and so , with their horse-hair plumes streaming straight out behind , most gallant to see , this lightning express came tearing for me !
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 28]: When they were within fifteen yards , I sent that bomb with a sure aim , and it struck the ground just under the horses ' noses .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 15]: Yes , it was a neat thing , very neat and pretty to see .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 31]: It resembled a steamboat explosion on the Mississippi ; and during the next fifteen minutes we stood under a steady drizzle of microscopic fragments of knights and hardware and horse-flesh .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 24]: I say we , for the king joined the audience , of course , as soon as he had got his breath again .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 72]: There was a hole there which would afford steady work for all the people in that region for some years to come -- in trying to explain it , I mean ; as for filling it up , that service would be comparatively prompt , and would fall to the lot of a select few -- peasants of that seignory ; and they would n't get anything for it , either .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 9]: But I explained it to the king myself .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 10]: I said it was done with a dynamite bomb .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 18]: This information did him no damage , because it left him as intelligent as he was before .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 19]: However , it was a noble miracle , in his eyes , and was another settler for Merlin .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 32]: I thought it well enough to explain that this was a miracle of so rare a sort that it could n't be done except when the atmospheric conditions were just right .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 29]: Otherwise he would be encoring it every time we had a good subject , and that would be inconvenient , because I had n't any more bombs along .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 89]: CHAPTER XXVIII DRILLING THE KING On the morning of the fourth day , when it was just sunrise , and we had been tramping an hour in the chill dawn , I came to a resolution : the king _ must _ be drilled ; things could not go on so , he must be taken in hand and deliberately and conscientiously drilled , or we could n't ever venture to enter a dwelling ; the very cats would know this masquerader for a humbug and no peasant .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 48]: So I called a halt and said : `` Sire , as between clothes and countenance , you are all right , there is no discrepancy ; but as between your clothes and your bearing , you are all wrong , there is a most noticeable discrepancy .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 13]: Your soldierly stride , your lordly port -- these will not do .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 14]: You stand too straight , your looks are too high , too confident .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 53]: The cares of a kingdom do not stoop the shoulders , they do not droop the chin , they do not depress the high level of the eye-glance , they do not put doubt and fear in the heart and hang out the signs of them in slouching body and unsure step .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 14]: It is the sordid cares of the lowly born that do these things .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 79]: You must learn the trick ; you must imitate the trademarks of poverty , misery , oppression , insult , and the other several and common inhumanities that sap the manliness out of a man and make him a loyal and proper and approved subject and a satisfaction to his masters , or the very infants will know you for better than your disguise , and we shall go to pieces at the first hut we stop at .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 8]: Pray try to walk like this . ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 12]: The king took careful note , and then tried an imitation .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 7]: `` Pretty fair -- pretty fair .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 12]: Chin a little lower , please -- there , very good .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 24]: Eyes too high ; pray do n't look at the horizon , look at the ground , ten steps in front of you .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 11]: Ah -- that is better , that is very good .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 21]: Wait , please ; you betray too much vigor , too much decision ; you want more of a shamble .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 39]: Look at me , please -- this is what I mean ... Now you are getting it ; that is the idea -- at least , it sort of approaches it ... Yes , that is pretty fair .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 3]: _ But !
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 18]: _ There is a great big something wanting , I do n't quite know what it is .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 50]: Please walk thirty yards , so that I can get a perspective on the thing ... Now , then -- your head 's right , speed 's right , shoulders right , eyes right , chin right , gait , carriage , general style right -- everything 's right !
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 11]: And yet the fact remains , the aggregate 's wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 6]: The account do n't balance .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 19]: Do it again , please ... _ Now _ I think I begin to see what it is .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 7]: Yes , I 've struck it .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 16]: You see , the genuine spiritlessness is wanting ; that 's what 's the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 31]: It 's all _ amateur _ -- mechanical details all right , almost to a hair ; everything about the delusion perfect , except that it do n't delude . ''
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 13]: `` What , then , must one do , to prevail ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 15]: `` Let me think ... I ca n't seem to quite get at it .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 15]: In fact , there is n't anything that can right the matter but practice .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 48]: This is a good place for it : roots and stony ground to break up your stately gait , a region not liable to interruption , only one field and one hut in sight , and they so far away that nobody could see us from there .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 23]: It will be well to move a little off the road and put in the whole day drilling you , sire . ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 37]: After the drill had gone on a little while , I said : `` Now , sire , imagine that we are at the door of the hut yonder , and the family are before us .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 12]: Proceed , please -- accost the head of the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 33]: The king unconsciously straightened up like a monument , and said , with frozen austerity : `` Varlet , bring a seat ; and serve to me what cheer ye have . ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 13]: `` Ah , your grace , that is not well done . ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 7]: `` In what lacketh it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 13]: `` These people do not call _ each other _ varlets . ''
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 8]: `` Nay , is that true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 12]: `` Yes ; only those above them call them so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 7]: `` Then must I try again .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 7]: I will call him villein . ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 11]: `` No-no ; for he may be a freeman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 5]: `` Ah -- so .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 9]: Then peradventure I should call him goodman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 23]: `` That would answer , your grace , but it would be still better if you said friend , or brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 3]: `` Brother !
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 7]: -- to dirt like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 18]: `` Ah , but _ we _ are pretending to be dirt like that , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 6]: `` It is even true .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 5]: I will say it .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 15]: Brother , bring a seat , and thereto what cheer ye have , withal .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 6]: Now 't is right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 8]: `` Not quite , not wholly right .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 27]: You have asked for one , not _ us _ -- for one , not both ; food for one , a seat for one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 15]: The king looked puzzled -- he was n't a very heavy weight , intellectually .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 31]: His head was an hour-glass ; it could stow an idea , but it had to do it a grain at a time , not the whole idea at once .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 14]: `` Would _ you _ have a seat also -- and sit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 30]: `` If I did not sit , the man would perceive that we were only pretending to be equals -- and playing the deception pretty poorly , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 8]: `` It is well and truly said !
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 14]: How wonderful is truth , come it in whatsoever unexpected form it may !
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 35]: Yes , he must bring out seats and food for both , and in serving us present not ewer and napkin with more show of respect to the one than to the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 12]: `` And there is even yet a detail that needs correcting .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 73]: He must bring nothing outside ; we will go in -- in among the dirt , and possibly other repulsive things , -- and take the food with the household , and after the fashion of the house , and all on equal terms , except the man be of the serf class ; and finally , there will be no ewer and no napkin , whether he be serf or free .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 7]: Please walk again , my liege .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 16]: There -- it is better -- it is the best yet ; but not perfect .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 18]: The shoulders have known no ignobler burden than iron mail , and they will not stoop . ''
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 9]: `` Give me , then , the bag .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 14]: I will learn the spirit that goeth with burdens that have not honor .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 49]: It is the spirit that stoopeth the shoulders , I ween , and not the weight ; for armor is heavy , yet it is a proud burden , and a man standeth straight in it ... Nay , but me no buts , offer me no objections .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 6]: I will have the thing .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 7]: Strap it upon my back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 24]: He was complete now with that knapsack on , and looked as little like a king as any man I had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 26]: But it was an obstinate pair of shoulders ; they could not seem to learn the trick of stooping with any sort of deceptive naturalness .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 70]: The drill went on , I prompting and correcting : `` Now , make believe you are in debt , and eaten up by relentless creditors ; you are out of work -- which is horse-shoeing , let us say -- and can get none ; and your wife is sick , your children are crying because they are hungry -- '' And so on , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 21]: I drilled him as representing in turn all sorts of people out of luck and suffering dire privations and misfortunes .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 28]: But lord , it was only just words , words -- they meant nothing in the world to him , I might just as well have whistled .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 26]: Words realize nothing , vivify nothing to you , unless you have suffered in your own person the thing which the words try to describe .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 49]: There are wise people who talk ever so knowingly and complacently about `` the working classes , '' and satisfy themselves that a day 's hard intellectual work is very much harder than a day 's hard manual toil , and is righteously entitled to much bigger pay .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 25]: Why , they really think that , you know , because they know all about the one , but have n't tried the other .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 63]: But I know all about both ; and so far as I am concerned , there is n't money enough in the universe to hire me to swing a pickaxe thirty days , but I will do the hardest kind of intellectual work for just as near nothing as you can cipher it down -- and I will be satisfied , too .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 22]: Intellectual `` work '' is misnamed ; it is a pleasure , a dissipation , and is its own highest reward .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 97]: The poorest paid architect , engineer , general , author , sculptor , painter , lecturer , advocate , legislator , actor , preacher , singer is constructively in heaven when he is at work ; and as for the musician with the fiddle-bow in his hand who sits in the midst of a great orchestra with the ebbing and flowing tides of divine sound washing over him -- why , certainly , he is at work , if you wish to call it that , but lord , it 's a sarcasm just the same .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 44]: The law of work does seem utterly unfair -- but there it is , and nothing can change it : the higher the pay in enjoyment the worker gets out of it , the higher shall be his pay in cash , also .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 17]: And it 's also the very law of those transparent swindles , transmissible nobility and kingship .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 23]: CHAPTER XXIX THE SMALLPOX HUT When we arrived at that hut at mid-afternoon , we saw no signs of life about it .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 29]: The field near by had been denuded of its crop some time before , and had a skinned look , so exhaustively had it been harvested and gleaned .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 16]: Fences , sheds , everything had a ruined look , and were eloquent of poverty .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 12]: No animal was around anywhere , no living thing in sight .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 13]: The stillness was awful , it was like the stillness of death .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 21]: The cabin was a one-story one , whose thatch was black with age , and ragged from lack of repair .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 7]: The door stood a trifle ajar .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 28]: We approached it stealthily -- on tiptoe and at half-breath -- for that is the way one 's feeling makes him do , at such a time .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 4]: The king knocked .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 3]: We waited .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 3]: Knocked again .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 10]: I pushed the door softly open and looked in .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 29]: I made out some dim forms , and a woman started up from the ground and stared at me , as one does who is wakened from sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 11]: Presently she found her voice : `` Have mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 3]: she pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 10]: `` All is taken , nothing is left . ''
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 13]: `` I have not come to take anything , poor woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 8]: `` You are not a priest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 12]: `` Nor come not from the lord of the manor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 9]: `` No , I am a stranger . ''
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 29]: `` Oh , then , for the fear of God , who visits with misery and death such as be harmless , tarry not here , but fly !
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 13]: This place is under his curse -- and his Church 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 17]: `` Let me come in and help you -- you are sick and in trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 10]: I was better used to the dim light now .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 10]: I could see her hollow eyes fixed upon me .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 8]: I could see how emaciated she was .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 13]: `` I tell you the place is under the Church 's ban .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 18]: Save yourself -- and go , before some straggler see thee here , and report it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 19]: `` Give yourself no trouble about me ; I do n't care anything for the Church 's curse .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 6]: Let me help you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 18]: `` Now all good spirits -- if there be any such -- bless thee for that word .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 9]: Would God I had a sup of water !
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 36]: -- but hold , hold , forget I said it , and fly ; for there is that here that even he that feareth not the Church must fear : this disease whereof we die .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 27]: Leave us , thou brave , good stranger , and take with thee such whole and sincere blessing as them that be accursed can give . ''
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 23]: But before this I had picked up a wooden bowl and was rushing past the king on my way to the brook .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 6]: It was ten yards away .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 29]: When I got back and entered , the king was within , and was opening the shutter that closed the window-hole , to let in air and light .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 9]: The place was full of a foul stench .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 31]: I put the bowl to the woman 's lips , and as she gripped it with her eager talons the shutter came open and a strong light flooded her face .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 2]: Smallpox !
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 23]: I sprang to the king , and said in his ear : `` Out of the door on the instant , sire !
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 18]: the woman is dying of that disease that wasted the skirts of Camelot two years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 5]: He did not budge .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 13]: `` Of a truth I shall remain -- and likewise help . ''
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 12]: I whispered again : `` King , it must not be .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 5]: You must go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 11]: `` Ye mean well , and ye speak not unwisely .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 27]: But it were shame that a king should know fear , and shame that belted knight should withhold his hand where be such as need succor .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 7]: Peace , I will not go .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 7]: It is you who must go .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 37]: The Church 's ban is not upon me , but it forbiddeth you to be here , and she will deal with you with a heavy hand an word come to her of your trespass . ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 28]: It was a desperate place for him to be in , and might cost him his life , but it was no use to argue with him .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 33]: If he considered his knightly honor at stake here , that was the end of argument ; he would stay , and nothing could prevent it ; I was aware of that .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 7]: And so I dropped the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 27]: The woman spoke : `` Fair sir , of your kindness will ye climb the ladder there , and bring me news of what ye find ?
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 25]: Be not afraid to report , for times can come when even a mother 's heart is past breaking -- being already broke . ''
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 16]: `` Abide , '' said the king , `` and give the woman to eat .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 5]: I will go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 7]: And he put down the knapsack .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 12]: I turned to start , but the king had already started .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 27]: He halted , and looked down upon a man who lay in a dim light , and had not noticed us thus far , or spoken .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 7]: `` Is it your husband ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 4]: the king asked .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 6]: `` Is he asleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 15]: `` God be thanked for that one charity , yes -- these three hours .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 11]: Where shall I pay to the full , my gratitude !
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 15]: for my heart is bursting with it for that sleep he sleepeth now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 9]: I said : `` We will be careful .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 7]: We will not wake him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 16]: `` Ah , no , that ye will not , for he is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 4]: `` Dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 11]: `` Yes , what triumph it is to know it !
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 10]: None can harm him , none insult him more .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 35]: He is in heaven now , and happy ; or if not there , he bides in hell and is content ; for in that place he will find neither abbot nor yet bishop .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 25]: We were boy and girl together ; we were man and wife these five and twenty years , and never separated till this day .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 11]: Think how long that is to love and suffer together .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 62]: This morning was he out of his mind , and in his fancy we were boy and girl again and wandering in the happy fields ; and so in that innocent glad converse wandered he far and farther , still lightly gossiping , and entered into those other fields we know not of , and was shut away from mortal sight .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 40]: And so there was no parting , for in his fancy I went with him ; he knew not but I went with him , my hand in his -- my young soft hand , not this withered claw .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 29]: Ah , yes , to go , and know it not ; to separate and know it not ; how could one go peace -- fuller than that ?
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 12]: It was his reward for a cruel life patiently borne . ''
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 17]: There was a slight noise from the direction of the dim corner where the ladder was .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 6]: It was the king descending .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 19]: I could see that he was bearing something in one arm , and assisting himself with the other .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 17]: He came forward into the light ; upon his breast lay a slender girl of fifteen .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 12]: She was but half conscious ; she was dying of smallpox .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 86]: Here was heroism at its last and loftiest possibility , its utmost summit ; this was challenging death in the open field unarmed , with all the odds against the challenger , no reward set upon the contest , and no admiring world in silks and cloth of gold to gaze and applaud ; and yet the king 's bearing was as serenely brave as it had always been in those cheaper contests where knight meets knight in equal fight and clothed in protecting steel .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 8]: He was great now ; sublimely great .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 68]: The rude statues of his ancestors in his palace should have an addition -- I would see to that ; and it would not be a mailed king killing a giant or a dragon , like the rest , it would be a king in commoner 's garb bearing death in his arms that a peasant mother might look her last upon her child and be comforted .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 41]: He laid the girl down by her mother , who poured out endearments and caresses from an overflowing heart , and one could detect a flickering faint light of response in the child 's eyes , but that was all .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 28]: The mother hung over her , kissing her , petting her , and imploring her to speak , but the lips only moved and no sound came .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 31]: I snatched my liquor flask from my knapsack , but the woman forbade me , and said : `` No -- she does not suffer ; it is better so .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 8]: It might bring her back to life .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 17]: None that be so good and kind as ye are would do her that cruel hurt .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 11]: For look you -- what is left to live for ?
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 38]: Her brothers are gone , her father is gone , her mother goeth , the Church 's curse is upon her , and none may shelter or befriend her even though she lay perishing in the road .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 4]: She is desolate .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 57]: I have not asked you , good heart , if her sister be still on live , here overhead ; I had no need ; ye had gone back , else , and not left the poor thing forsaken -- '' `` She lieth at peace , '' interrupted the king , in a subdued voice .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 7]: `` I would not change it .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 8]: How rich is this day in happiness !
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 30]: Ah , my Annis , thou shalt join thy sister soon -- thou ` rt on thy way , and these be merciful friends that will not hinder . ''
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 44]: And so she fell to murmuring and cooing over the girl again , and softly stroking her face and hair , and kissing her and calling her by endearing names ; but there was scarcely sign of response now in the glazing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 16]: I saw tears well from the king 's eyes , and trickle down his face .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 79]: The woman noticed them , too , and said : `` Ah , I know that sign : thou ` st a wife at home , poor soul , and you and she have gone hungry to bed , many 's the time , that the little ones might have your crust ; you know what poverty is , and the daily insults of your betters , and the heavy hand of the Church and the king . ''
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 33]: The king winced under this accidental home-shot , but kept still ; he was learning his part ; and he was playing it well , too , for a pretty dull beginner .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 6]: I struck up a diversion .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 13]: I offered the woman food and liquor , but she refused both .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 14]: She would allow nothing to come between her and the release of death .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 18]: Then I slipped away and brought the dead child from aloft , and laid it by her .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 17]: This broke her down again , and there was another scene that was full of heartbreak .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 16]: By and by I made another diversion , and beguiled her to sketch her story .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 22]: `` Ye know it well yourselves , having suffered it -- for truly none of our condition in Britain escape it .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 8]: It is the old , weary tale .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 28]: We fought and struggled and succeeded ; meaning by success , that we lived and did not die ; more than that is not to be claimed .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 31]: No troubles came that we could not outlive , till this year brought them ; then came they all at once , as one might say , and overwhelmed us .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 43]: Years ago the lord of the manor planted certain fruit trees on our farm ; in the best part of it , too -- a grievous wrong and shame -- '' `` But it was his right , '' interrupted the king .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 29]: `` None denieth that , indeed ; an the law mean anything , what is the lord 's is his , and what is mine is his also .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 21]: Our farm was ours by lease , therefore 't was likewise his , to do with it as he would .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 14]: Some little time ago , three of those trees were found hewn down .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 11]: Our three grown sons ran frightened to report the crime .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 23]: Well , in his lordship 's dungeon there they lie , who saith there shall they lie and rot till they confess .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 18]: They have naught to confess , being innocent , wherefore there will they remain until they die .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 9]: Ye know that right well , I ween .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 55]: Think how this left us ; a man , a woman and two children , to gather a crop that was planted by so much greater force , yes , and protect it night and day from pigeons and prowling animals that be sacred and must not be hurt by any of our sort .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 70]: When my lord 's crop was nearly ready for the harvest , so also was ours ; when his bell rang to call us to his fields to harvest his crop for nothing , he would not allow that I and my two girls should count for our three captive sons , but for only two of them ; so , for the lacking one were we daily fined .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 31]: All this time our own crop was perishing through neglect ; and so both the priest and his lordship fined us because their shares of it were suffering through damage .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 37]: In the end the fines ate up our crop -- and they took it all ; they took it all and made us harvest it for them , without pay or food , and we starving .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 44]: Then the worst came when I , being out of my mind with hunger and loss of my boys , and grief to see my husband and my little maids in rags and misery and despair , uttered a deep blasphemy -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 5]: a thousand of them !
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 10]: -- against the Church and the Church 's ways .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 6]: It was ten days ago .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 38]: I had fallen sick with this disease , and it was to the priest I said the words , for he was come to chide me for lack of due humility under the chastening hand of God .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 34]: He carried my trespass to his betters ; I was stubborn ; wherefore , presently upon my head and upon all heads that were dear to me , fell the curse of Rome .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 12]: `` Since that day we are avoided , shunned with horror .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 14]: None has come near this hut to know whether we live or not .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 8]: The rest of us were taken down .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 14]: Then I roused me and got up , as wife and mother will .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 21]: It was little they could have eaten in any case ; it was less than little they had to eat .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 11]: But there was water , and I gave them that .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 5]: How they craved it !
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 6]: and how they blessed it !
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 11]: But the end came yesterday ; my strength broke down .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 16]: Yesterday was the last time I ever saw my husband and this youngest child alive .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 48]: I have lain here all these hours -- these ages , ye may say -- listening , listening for any sound up there that -- '' She gave a sharp quick glance at her eldest daughter , then cried out , `` Oh , my darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 11]: and feebly gathered the stiffening form to her sheltering arms .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 6]: She had recognized the death-rattle .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 23]: CHAPTER XXX THE TRAGEDY OF THE MANOR-HOUSE At midnight all was over , and we sat in the presence of four corpses .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 21]: We covered them with such rags as we could find , and started away , fastening the door behind us .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 24]: Their home must be these people 's grave , for they could not have Christian burial , or be admitted to consecrated ground .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 36]: They were as dogs , wild beasts , lepers , and no soul that valued its hope of eternal life would throw it away by meddling in any sort with these rebuked and smitten outcasts .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 17]: We had not moved four steps when I caught a sound as of footsteps upon gravel .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 7]: My heart flew to my throat .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 10]: We must not be seen coming from that house .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 21]: I plucked at the king 's robe and we drew back and took shelter behind the corner of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 22]: `` Now we are safe , '' I said , `` but it was a close call -- so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 23]: If the night had been lighter he might have seen us , no doubt , he seemed to be so near . ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 15]: `` Mayhap it is but a beast and not a man at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 3]: `` True .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 26]: But man or beast , it will be wise to stay here a minute and let it get by and out of the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 3]: `` Hark !
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 5]: It cometh hither . ''
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 3]: True again .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 12]: The step was coming toward us -- straight toward the hut .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 18]: It must be a beast , then , and we might as well have saved our trepidation .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 17]: I was going to step out , but the king laid his hand upon my arm .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 18]: There was a moment of silence , then we heard a soft knock on the cabin door .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 5]: It made me shiver .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 20]: Presently the knock was repeated , and then we heard these words in a guarded voice : `` Mother !
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 2]: Father !
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 30]: Open -- we have got free , and we bring news to pale your cheeks but glad your hearts ; and we may not tarry , but must fly !
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 7]: And -- but they answer not .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 2]: Mother !
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 2]: father !
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 28]: -- '' I drew the king toward the other end of the hut and whispered : `` Come -- now we can get to the road . ''
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 33]: The king hesitated , was going to demur ; but just then we heard the door give way , and knew that those desolate men were in the presence of their dead .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 6]: `` Come , my liege !
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 24]: in a moment they will strike a light , and then will follow that which it would break your heart to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 7]: He did not hesitate this time .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 21]: The moment we were in the road I ran ; and after a moment he threw dignity aside and followed .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 112]: I did not want to think of what was happening in the hut -- I could n't bear it ; I wanted to drive it out of my mind ; so I struck into the first subject that lay under that one in my mind : `` I have had the disease those people died of , and so have nothing to fear ; but if you have not had it also -- '' He broke in upon me to say he was in trouble , and it was his conscience that was troubling him : `` These young men have got free , they say -- but _ how _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 13]: It is not likely that their lord hath set them free . ''
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 13]: `` Oh , no , I make no doubt they escaped . ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 29]: `` That is my trouble ; I have a fear that this is so , and your suspicion doth confirm it , you having the same fear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 11]: `` I should not call it by that name though .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 20]: I do suspect that they escaped , but if they did , I am not sorry , certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 19]: `` I am not sorry , I _ think _ -- but -- '' `` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 12]: What is there for one to be troubled about ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 52]: _ If _ they did escape , then are we bound in duty to lay hands upon them and deliver them again to their lord ; for it is not seemly that one of his quality should suffer a so insolent and high-handed outrage from persons of their base degree . ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 5]: There it was again .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 9]: He could see only one side of it .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 46]: He was born so , educated so , his veins were full of ancestral blood that was rotten with this sort of unconscious brutality , brought down by inheritance from a long procession of hearts that had each done its share toward poisoning the stream .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 76]: To imprison these men without proof , and starve their kindred , was no harm , for they were merely peasants and subject to the will and pleasure of their lord , no matter what fearful form it might take ; but for these men to break out of unjust captivity was insult and outrage , and a thing not to be countenanced by any conscientious person who knew his duty to his sacred caste .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 27]: I worked more than half an hour before I got him to change the subject -- and even then an outside matter did it for me .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 27]: This was a something which caught our eyes as we struck the summit of a small hill -- a red glow , a good way off .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 51]: `` That 's a fire , '' said I. Fires interested me considerably , because I was getting a good deal of an insurance business started , and was also training some horses and building some steam fire-engines , with an eye to a paid fire department by and by .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 77]: The priests opposed both my fire and life insurance , on the ground that it was an insolent attempt to hinder the decrees of God ; and if you pointed out that they did not hinder the decrees in the least , but only modified the hard consequences of them if you took out policies and had luck , they retorted that that was gambling against the decrees of God , and was just as bad .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 20]: So they managed to damage those industries more or less , but I got even on my Accident business .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 75]: As a rule , a knight is a lummox , and some times even a labrick , and hence open to pretty poor arguments when they come glibly from a superstition-monger , but even _ he _ could see the practical side of a thing once in a while ; and so of late you could n't clean up a tournament and pile the result without finding one of my accident-tickets in every helmet .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 41]: We stood there awhile , in the thick darkness and stillness , looking toward the red blur in the distance , and trying to make out the meaning of a far-away murmur that rose and fell fitfully on the night .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 38]: Sometimes it swelled up and for a moment seemed less remote ; but when we were hopefully expecting it to betray its cause and nature , it dulled and sank again , carrying its mystery with it .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 35]: We started down the hill in its direction , and the winding road plunged us at once into almost solid darkness -- darkness that was packed and crammed in between two tall forest walls .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 22]: We groped along down for half a mile , perhaps , that murmur growing more and more distinct all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 31]: The coming storm threatening more and more , with now and then a little shiver of wind , a faint show of lightning , and dull grumblings of distant thunder .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 6]: I was in the lead .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 54]: I ran against something -- a soft heavy something which gave , slightly , to the impulse of my weight ; at the same moment the lightning glared out , and within a foot of my face was the writhing face of a man who was hanging from the limb of a tree !
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 14]: That is , it seemed to be writhing , but it was not .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 6]: It was a grewsome sight .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 25]: Straightway there was an ear-splitting explosion of thunder , and the bottom of heaven fell out ; the rain poured down in a deluge .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 28]: No matter , we must try to cut this man down , on the chance that there might be life in him yet , must n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 17]: The lightning came quick and sharp now , and the place was alternately noonday and midnight .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 26]: One moment the man would be hanging before me in an intense light , and the next he was blotted out again in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 10]: I told the king we must cut him down .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 6]: The king at once objected .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 22]: `` If he hanged himself , he was willing to lose him property to his lord ; so let him be .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 16]: If others hanged him , belike they had the right -- let him hang . ''
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 18]: `` But -- '' `` But me no buts , but even leave him as he is .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 6]: And for yet another reason .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 12]: When the lightning cometh again -- there , look abroad . ''
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 10]: Two others hanging , within fifty yards of us !
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 14]: `` It is not weather meet for doing useless courtesies unto dead folk .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 6]: They are past thanking you .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 10]: Come -- it is unprofitable to tarry here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 13]: There was reason in what he said , so we moved on .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 25]: Within the next mile we counted six more hanging forms by the blaze of the lightning , and altogether it was a grisly excursion .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 20]: That murmur was a murmur no longer , it was a roar ; a roar of men 's voices .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 18]: A man came flying by now , dimly through the darkness , and other men chasing him .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 3]: They disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 14]: Presently another case of the kind occurred , and then another and another .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 44]: Then a sudden turn of the road brought us in sight of that fire -- it was a large manor-house , and little or nothing was left of it -- and everywhere men were flying and other men raging after them in pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 14]: I warned the king that this was not a safe place for strangers .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 14]: We would better get away from the light , until matters should improve .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 15]: We stepped back a little , and hid in the edge of the wood .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 14]: From this hiding-place we saw both men and women hunted by the mob .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 9]: The fearful work went on until nearly dawn .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 26]: Then , the fire being out and the storm spent , the voices and flying footsteps presently ceased , and darkness and stillness reigned again .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 32]: We ventured out , and hurried cautiously away ; and although we were worn out and sleepy , we kept on until we had put this place some miles behind us .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 20]: Then we asked hospitality at the hut of a charcoal burner , and got what was to be had .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 24]: A woman was up and about , but the man was still asleep , on a straw shake-down , on the clay floor .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 25]: The woman seemed uneasy until I explained that we were travelers and had lost our way and been wandering in the woods all night .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 22]: She became talkative , then , and asked if we had heard of the terrible goings-on at the manor-house of Abblasoure .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 18]: Yes , we had heard of them , but what we wanted now was rest and sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 34]: The king broke in : `` Sell us the house and take yourselves away , for we be perilous company , being late come from people that died of the Spotted Death . ''
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 9]: It was good of him , but unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 13]: One of the commonest decorations of the nation was the waffle-iron face .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 15]: I had early noticed that the woman and her husband were both so decorated .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 68]: She made us entirely welcome , and had no fears ; and plainly she was immensely impressed by the king 's proposition ; for , of course , it was a good deal of an event in her life to run across a person of the king 's humble appearance who was ready to buy a man 's house for the sake of a night 's lodging .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 26]: It gave her a large respect for us , and she strained the lean possibilities of her hovel to the utmost to make us comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 34]: We slept till far into the afternoon , and then got up hungry enough to make cotter fare quite palatable to the king , the more particularly as it was scant in quantity .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 23]: And also in variety ; it consisted solely of onions , salt , and the national black bread made out of horse-feed .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 12]: The woman told us about the affair of the evening before .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 19]: At ten or eleven at night , when everybody was in bed , the manor-house burst into flames .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 20]: The country-side swarmed to the rescue , and the family were saved , with one exception , the master .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 5]: He did not appear .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 24]: Everybody was frantic over this loss , and two brave yeomen sacrificed their lives in ransacking the burning house seeking that valuable personage .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 19]: But after a while he was found -- what was left of him -- which was his corpse .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 20]: It was in a copse three hundred yards away , bound , gagged , stabbed in a dozen places .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 5]: Who had done this ?
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 36]: Suspicion fell upon a humble family in the neighborhood who had been lately treated with peculiar harshness by the baron ; and from these people the suspicion easily extended itself to their relatives and familiars .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 28]: A suspicion was enough ; my lord 's liveried retainers proclaimed an instant crusade against these people , and were promptly joined by the community in general .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 20]: The woman 's husband had been active with the mob , and had not returned home until nearly dawn .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 14]: He was gone now to find out what the general result had been .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 12]: While we were still talking he came back from his quest .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 6]: His report was revolting enough .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 17]: Eighteen persons hanged or butchered , and two yeomen and thirteen prisoners lost in the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 13]: `` And how many prisoners were there altogether in the vaults ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 4]: `` Thirteen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 10]: `` Then every one of them was lost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 6]: `` Yes , all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 24]: `` But the people arrived in time to save the family ; how is it they could save none of the prisoners ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 19]: The man looked puzzled , and said : `` Would one unlock the vaults at such a time ?
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 8]: Marry , some would have escaped . ''
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 13]: `` Then you mean that nobody _ did _ unlock them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 12]: `` None went near them , either to lock or unlock .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 36]: It standeth to reason that the bolts were fast ; wherefore it was only needful to establish a watch , so that if any broke the bonds he might not escape , but be taken .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 5]: None were taken . ''
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 39]: `` Natheless , three did escape , '' said the king , `` and ye will do well to publish it and set justice upon their track , for these murthered the baron and fired the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 11]: I was just expecting he would come out with that .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 43]: For a moment the man and his wife showed an eager interest in this news and an impatience to go out and spread it ; then a sudden something else betrayed itself in their faces , and they began to ask questions .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 13]: I answered the questions myself , and narrowly watched the effects produced .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 39]: I was soon satisfied that the knowledge of who these three prisoners were had somehow changed the atmosphere ; that our hosts ' continued eagerness to go and spread the news was now only pretended and not real .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 15]: The king did not notice the change , and I was glad of that .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 28]: I worked the conversation around toward other details of the night 's proceedings , and noted that these people were relieved to have it take that direction .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 33]: The painful thing observable about all this business was the alacrity with which this oppressed community had turned their cruel hands against their own class in the interest of the common oppressor .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 64]: This man and woman seemed to feel that in a quarrel between a person of their own class and his lord , it was the natural and proper and rightful thing for that poor devil 's whole caste to side with the master and fight his battle for him , without ever stopping to inquire into the rights or wrongs of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 57]: This man had been out helping to hang his neighbors , and had done his work with zeal , and yet was aware that there was nothing against them but a mere suspicion , with nothing back of it describable as evidence , still neither he nor his wife seemed to see anything horrible about it .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 17]: This was depressing -- to a man with the dream of a republic in his head .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 96]: It reminded me of a time thirteen centuries away , when the `` poor whites '' of our South who were always despised and frequently insulted by the slave-lords around them , and who owed their base condition simply to the presence of slavery in their midst , were yet pusillanimously ready to side with the slave-lords in all political moves for the upholding and perpetuating of slavery , and did also finally shoulder their muskets and pour out their lives in an effort to prevent the destruction of that very institution which degraded them .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 38]: And there was only one redeeming feature connected with that pitiful piece of history ; and that was , that secretly the `` poor white '' did detest the slave-lord , and did feel his own shame .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 62]: That feeling was not brought to the surface , but the fact that it was there and could have been brought out , under favoring circumstances , was something -- in fact , it was enough ; for it showed that a man is at bottom a man , after all , even if it does n't show on the outside .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 26]: Well , as it turned out , this charcoal burner was just the twin of the Southern `` poor white '' of the far future .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 22]: The king presently showed impatience , and said : `` An ye prattle here all the day , justice will miscarry .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 12]: Think ye the criminals will abide in their father 's house ?
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 9]: They are fleeing , they are not waiting .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 17]: You should look to it that a party of horse be set upon their track . ''
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 17]: The woman paled slightly , but quite perceptibly , and the man looked flustered and irresolute .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 29]: I said : `` Come , friend , I will walk a little way with you , and explain which direction I think they would try to take .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 42]: If they were merely resisters of the gabelle or some kindred absurdity I would try to protect them from capture ; but when men murder a person of high degree and likewise burn his house , that is another matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 12]: The last remark was for the king -- to quiet him .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 27]: On the road the man pulled his resolution together , and began the march with a steady gait , but there was no eagerness in it .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 18]: By and by I said : `` What relation were these men to you -- cousins ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 18]: He turned as white as his layer of charcoal would let him , and stopped , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 12]: `` Ah , my God , how know ye that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 14]: `` I did n't know it ; it was a chance guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 8]: `` Poor lads , they are lost .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 9]: And good lads they were , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 12]: `` Were you actually going yonder to tell on them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 20]: He did n't quite know how to take that ; but he said , hesitatingly : `` Ye-s . ''
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 11]: `` Then I think you are a damned scoundrel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 14]: It made him as glad as if I had called him an angel .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 9]: `` Say the good words again , brother !
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 18]: for surely ye mean that ye would not betray me an I failed of my duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 3]: `` Duty ?
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 21]: There is no duty in the matter , except the duty to keep still and let those men get away .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 8]: They 've done a righteous deed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 15]: He looked pleased ; pleased , and touched with apprehension at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 47]: He looked up and down the road to see that no one was coming , and then said in a cautious voice : `` From what land come you , brother , that you speak such perilous words , and seem not to be afraid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 19]: `` They are not perilous words when spoken to one of my own caste , I take it .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 10]: You would not tell anybody I said them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 11]: I would be drawn asunder by wild horses first . ''
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 11]: `` Well , then , let me say my say .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 9]: I have no fears of your repeating it .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 16]: I think devil 's work has been done last night upon those innocent poor people .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 9]: That old baron got only what he deserved .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 16]: If I had my way , all his kind should have the same luck . ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 74]: Fear and depression vanished from the man 's manner , and gratefulness and a brave animation took their place : `` Even though you be a spy , and your words a trap for my undoing , yet are they such refreshment that to hear them again and others like to them , I would go to the gallows happy , as having had one good feast at least in a starved life .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 19]: And I will say my say now , and ye may report it if ye be so minded .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 34]: I helped to hang my neighbors for that it were peril to my own life to show lack of zeal in the master 's cause ; the others helped for none other reason .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 29]: All rejoice to-day that he is dead , but all do go about seemingly sorrowing , and shedding the hypocrite 's tear , for in that lies safety .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 12]: I have said the words , I have said the words !
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 21]: the only ones that have ever tasted good in my mouth , and the reward of that taste is sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 20]: Lead on , an ye will , be it even to the scaffold , for I am ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 7]: There it was , you see .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 9]: A man is a man , at bottom .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 16]: Whole ages of abuse and oppression can not crush the manhood clear out of him .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 9]: Whoever thinks it a mistake is himself mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 71]: Yes , there is plenty good enough material for a republic in the most degraded people that ever existed -- even the Russians ; plenty of manhood in them -- even in the Germans -- if one could but force it out of its timid and suspicious privacy , to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 13]: We should see certain things yet , let us hope and believe .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 58]: First , a modified monarchy , till Arthur 's days were done , then the destruction of the throne , nobility abolished , every member of it bound out to some useful trade , universal suffrage instituted , and the whole government placed in the hands of the men and women of the nation there to remain .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 15]: Yes , there was no occasion to give up my dream yet a while .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 16]: CHAPTER XXXI MARCO We strolled along in a sufficiently indolent fashion now , and talked .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 36]: We must dispose of about the amount of time it ought to take to go to the little hamlet of Abblasoure and put justice on the track of those murderers and get back home again .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 47]: And meantime I had an auxiliary interest which had never paled yet , never lost its novelty for me since I had been in Arthur 's kingdom : the behavior -- born of nice and exact subdivisions of caste -- of chance passers-by toward each other .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 76]: Toward the shaven monk who trudged along with his cowl tilted back and the sweat washing down his fat jowls , the coal-burner was deeply reverent ; to the gentleman he was abject ; with the small farmer and the free mechanic he was cordial and gossipy ; and when a slave passed by with a countenance respectfully lowered , this chap 's nose was in the air -- he could n't even see him .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 20]: Well , there are times when one would like to hang the whole human race and finish the farce .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 6]: Presently we struck an incident .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 19]: A small mob of half-naked boys and girls came tearing out of the woods , scared and shrieking .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 14]: The eldest among them were not more than twelve or fourteen years old .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 21]: They implored help , but they were so beside themselves that we could n't make out what the matter was .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 47]: However , we plunged into the wood , they skurrying in the lead , and the trouble was quickly revealed : they had hanged a little fellow with a bark rope , and he was kicking and struggling , in the process of choking to death .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 9]: We rescued him , and fetched him around .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 40]: It was some more human nature ; the admiring little folk imitating their elders ; they were playing mob , and had achieved a success which promised to be a good deal more serious than they had bargained for .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 9]: It was not a dull excursion for me .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 10]: I managed to put in the time very well .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 23]: I made various acquaintanceships , and in my quality of stranger was able to ask as many questions as I wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 17]: A thing which naturally interested me , as a statesman , was the matter of wages .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 13]: I picked up what I could under that head during the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 53]: A man who has n't had much experience , and does n't think , is apt to measure a nation 's prosperity or lack of prosperity by the mere size of the prevailing wages ; if the wages be high , the nation is prosperous ; if low , it is n't .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 5]: Which is an error .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 43]: It is n't what sum you get , it 's how much you can buy with it , that 's the important thing ; and it 's that that tells whether your wages are high in fact or only high in name .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 19]: I could remember how it was in the time of our great civil war in the nineteenth century .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 31]: In the North a carpenter got three dollars a day , gold valuation ; in the South he got fifty -- payable in Confederate shinplasters worth a dollar a bushel .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 30]: In the North a suit of overalls cost three dollars -- a day 's wages ; in the South it cost seventy-five -- which was two days ' wages .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 6]: Other things were in proportion .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 32]: Consequently , wages were twice as high in the North as they were in the South , because the one wage had that much more purchasing power than the other had .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 80]: Yes , I made various acquaintances in the hamlet and a thing that gratified me a good deal was to find our new coins in circulation -- lots of milrays , lots of mills , lots of cents , a good many nickels , and some silver ; all this among the artisans and commonalty generally ; yes , and even some gold -- but that was at the bank , that is to say , the goldsmith 's .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 36]: I dropped in there while Marco , the son of Marco , was haggling with a shopkeeper over a quarter of a pound of salt , and asked for change for a twenty-dollar gold piece .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 226]: They furnished it -- that is , after they had chewed the piece , and rung it on the counter , and tried acid on it , and asked me where I got it , and who I was , and where I was from , and where I was going to , and when I expected to get there , and perhaps a couple of hundred more questions ; and when they got aground , I went right on and furnished them a lot of information voluntarily ; told them I owned a dog , and his name was Watch , and my first wife was a Free Will Baptist , and her grandfather was a Prohibitionist , and I used to know a man who had two thumbs on each hand and a wart on the inside of his upper lip , and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection , and so on , and so on , and so on , till even that hungry village questioner began to look satisfied , and also a shade put out ; but he had to respect a man of my financial strength , and so he did n't give me any lip , but I noticed he took it out of his underlings , which was a perfectly natural thing to do .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 60]: Yes , they changed my twenty , but I judged it strained the bank a little , which was a thing to be expected , for it was the same as walking into a paltry village store in the nineteenth century and requiring the boss of it to change a two thousand-dollar bill for you all of a sudden .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 58]: He could do it , maybe ; but at the same time he would wonder how a small farmer happened to be carrying so much money around in his pocket ; which was probably this goldsmith 's thought , too ; for he followed me to the door and stood there gazing after me with reverent admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 51]: Our new money was not only handsomely circulating , but its language was already glibly in use ; that is to say , people had dropped the names of the former moneys , and spoke of things as being worth so many dollars or cents or mills or milrays now .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 5]: It was very gratifying .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 8]: We were progressing , that was sure .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 22]: I got to know several master mechanics , but about the most interesting fellow among them was the blacksmith , Dowley .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 25]: He was a live man and a brisk talker , and had two journeymen and three apprentices , and was doing a raging business .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 17]: In fact , he was getting rich , hand over fist , and was vastly respected .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 13]: Marco was very proud of having such a man for a friend .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 41]: He had taken me there ostensibly to let me see the big establishment which bought so much of his charcoal , but really to let me see what easy and almost familiar terms he was on with this great man .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 26]: Dowley and I fraternized at once ; I had had just such picked men , splendid fellows , under me in the Colt Arms Factory .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 26]: I was bound to see more of him , so I invited him to come out to Marco 's Sunday , and dine with us .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 30]: Marco was appalled , and held his breath ; and when the grandee accepted , he was so grateful that he almost forgot to be astonished at the condescension .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 63]: Marco 's joy was exuberant -- but only for a moment ; then he grew thoughtful , then sad ; and when he heard me tell Dowley I should have Dickon , the boss mason , and Smug , the boss wheelwright , out there , too , the coal-dust on his face turned to chalk , and he lost his grip .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 15]: But I knew what was the matter with him ; it was the expense .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 15]: He saw ruin before him ; he judged that his financial days were numbered .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 36]: However , on our way to invite the others , I said : `` You must allow me to have these friends come ; and you must also allow me to pay the costs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 22]: His face cleared , and he said with spirit : `` But not all of it , not all of it .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 13]: Ye can not well bear a burden like to this alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 21]: I stopped him , and said : `` Now let 's understand each other on the spot , old friend .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 19]: I am only a farm bailiff , it is true ; but I am not poor , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 19]: I have been very fortunate this year -- you would be astonished to know how I have thriven .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 32]: I tell you the honest truth when I say I could squander away as many as a dozen feasts like this and never care _ that _ for the expense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 6]: and I snapped my fingers .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 34]: I could see myself rise a foot at a time in Marco 's estimation , and when I fetched out those last words I was become a very tower for style and altitude .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 13]: `` So you see , you must let me have my way .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 17]: You ca n't contribute a cent to this orgy , that 's _ settled _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 17]: `` It 's grand and good of you -- '' `` No , it is n't .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 109]: You 've opened your house to Jones and me in the most generous way ; Jones was remarking upon it to-day , just before you came back from the village ; for although he would n't be likely to say such a thing to you -- because Jones is n't a talker , and is diffident in society -- he has a good heart and a grateful , and knows how to appreciate it when he is well treated ; yes , you and your wife have been very hospitable toward us -- '' `` Ah , brother , 't is nothing -- _ such _ hospitality ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 48]: `` But it _ is _ something ; the best a man has , freely given , is always something , and is as good as a prince can do , and ranks right along beside it -- for even a prince can but do his best .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 22]: And so we 'll shop around and get up this layout now , and do n't you worry about the expense .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 12]: I 'm one of the worst spendthrifts that ever was born .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 28]: Why , do you know , sometimes in a single week I spend -- but never mind about that -- you 'd never believe it anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 62]: And so we went gadding along , dropping in here and there , pricing things , and gossiping with the shopkeepers about the riot , and now and then running across pathetic reminders of it , in the persons of shunned and tearful and houseless remnants of families whose homes had been taken from them and their parents butchered or hanged .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 62]: The raiment of Marco and his wife was of coarse tow-linen and linsey-woolsey respectively , and resembled township maps , it being made up pretty exclusively of patches which had been added , township by township , in the course of five or six years , until hardly a hand 's - breadth of the original garments was surviving and present .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 104]: Now I wanted to fit these people out with new suits , on account of that swell company , and I did n't know just how to get at it -- with delicacy , until at last it struck me that as I had already been liberal in inventing wordy gratitude for the king , it would be just the thing to back it up with evidence of a substantial sort ; so I said : `` And Marco , there 's another thing which you must permit -- out of kindness for Jones -- because you would n't want to offend him .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 83]: He was very anxious to testify his appreciation in some way , but he is so diffident he could n't venture it himself , and so he begged me to buy some little things and give them to you and Dame Phyllis and let him pay for them without your ever knowing they came from him -- you know how a delicate person feels about that sort of thing -- and so I said I would , and we would keep mum .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 23]: Well , his idea was , a new outfit of clothes for you both -- '' `` Oh , it is wastefulness !
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 12]: It may not be , brother , it may not be .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 16]: Consider the vastness of the sum -- '' `` Hang the vastness of the sum !
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 30]: Try to keep quiet for a moment , and see how it would seem ; a body ca n't get in a word edgeways , you talk so much .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 30]: You ought to cure that , Marco ; it is n't good form , you know , and it will grow on you if you do n't check it .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 38]: Yes , we 'll step in here now and price this man 's stuff -- and do n't forget to remember to not let on to Jones that you know he had anything to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 12]: You ca n't think how curiously sensitive and proud he is .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 26]: He 's a farmer -- pretty fairly well-to-do farmer -- and I 'm his bailiff ; _ but _ -- the imagination of that man !
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 49]: Why , sometimes when he forgets himself and gets to blowing off , you 'd think he was one of the swells of the earth ; and you might listen to him a hundred years and never take him for a farmer -- especially if he talked agriculture .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 88]: He _ thinks _ he 's a Sheol of a farmer ; thinks he 's old Grayback from Wayback ; but between you and me privately he do n't know as much about farming as he does about running a kingdom -- still , whatever he talks about , you want to drop your underjaw and listen , the same as if you had never heard such incredible wisdom in all your life before , and were afraid you might die before you got enough of it .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 6]: That will please Jones . ''
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 60]: It tickled Marco to the marrow to hear about such an odd character ; but it also prepared him for accidents ; and in my experience when you travel with a king who is letting on to be something else and ca n't remember it more than about half the time , you ca n't take too many precautions .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 35]: This was the best store we had come across yet ; it had everything in it , in small quantities , from anvils and drygoods all the way down to fish and pinchbeck jewelry .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 19]: I concluded I would bunch my whole invoice right here , and not go pricing around any more .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 27]: So I got rid of Marco , by sending him off to invite the mason and the wheelwright , which left the field free to me .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 29]: For I never care to do a thing in a quiet way ; it 's got to be theatrical or I do n't take any interest in it .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 44]: I showed up money enough , in a careless way , to corral the shopkeeper 's respect , and then I wrote down a list of the things I wanted , and handed it to him to see if he could read it .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 12]: He could , and was proud to show that he could .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 17]: He said he had been educated by a priest , and could both read and write .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 17]: He ran it through , and remarked with satisfaction that it was a pretty heavy bill .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 14]: Well , and so it was , for a little concern like that .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 17]: I was not only providing a swell dinner , but some odds and ends of extras .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 34]: I ordered that the things be carted out and delivered at the dwelling of Marco , the son of Marco , by Saturday evening , and send me the bill at dinner-time Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 19]: He said I could depend upon his promptness and exactitude , it was the rule of the house .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 24]: He also observed that he would throw in a couple of miller-guns for the Marcos gratis -- that everybody was using them now .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 10]: He had a mighty opinion of that clever device .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 24]: I said : `` And please fill them up to the middle mark , too ; and add that to the bill . ''
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 6]: He would , with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 11]: He filled them , and I took them with me .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 57]: I could n't venture to tell him that the miller-gun was a little invention of my own , and that I had officially ordered that every shopkeeper in the kingdom keep them on hand and sell them at government price -- which was the merest trifle , and the shopkeeper got that , not the government .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 6]: We furnished them for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 13]: The king had hardly missed us when we got back at nightfall .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 39]: He had early dropped again into his dream of a grand invasion of Gaul with the whole strength of his kingdom at his back , and the afternoon had slipped away without his ever coming to himself again .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 29]: CHAPTER XXXII DOWLEY 'S HUMILIATION Well , when that cargo arrived toward sunset , Saturday afternoon , I had my hands full to keep the Marcos from fainting .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 21]: They were sure Jones and I were ruined past help , and they blamed themselves as accessories to this bankruptcy .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 102]: You see , in addition to the dinner-materials , which called for a sufficiently round sum , I had bought a lot of extras for the future comfort of the family : for instance , a big lot of wheat , a delicacy as rare to the tables of their class as was ice-cream to a hermit 's ; also a sizeable deal dinner-table ; also two entire pounds of salt , which was another piece of extravagance in those people 's eyes ; also crockery , stools , the clothes , a small cask of beer , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 28]: I instructed the Marcos to keep quiet about this sumptuousness , so as to give me a chance to surprise the guests and show off a little .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 55]: Concerning the new clothes , the simple couple were like children ; they were up and down , all night , to see if it was n't nearly daylight , so that they could put them on , and they were into them at last as much as an hour before dawn was due .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 33]: Then their pleasure -- not to say delirium -- was so fresh and novel and inspiring that the sight of it paid me well for the interruptions which my sleep had suffered .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 12]: The king had slept just as usual -- like the dead .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 32]: The Marcos could not thank him for their clothes , that being forbidden ; but they tried every way they could think of to make him see how grateful they were .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 13]: Which all went for nothing : he did n't notice any change .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 34]: It turned out to be one of those rich and rare fall days which is just a June day toned down to a degree where it is heaven to be out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 22]: Toward noon the guests arrived , and we assembled under a great tree and were soon as sociable as old acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 29]: Even the king 's reserve melted a little , though it was some little trouble to him to adjust himself to the name of Jones along at first .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 39]: I had asked him to try to not forget that he was a farmer ; but I had also considered it prudent to ask him to let the thing stand at that , and not elaborate it any .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 44]: Because he was just the kind of person you could depend on to spoil a little thing like that if you did n't warn him , his tongue was so handy , and his spirit so willing , and his information so uncertain .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 45]: Dowley was in fine feather , and I early got him started , and then adroitly worked him around onto his own history for a text and himself for a hero , and then it was good to sit there and hear him hum .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 6]: Self-made man , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 6]: They know how to talk .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 32]: They do deserve more credit than any other breed of men , yes , that is true ; and they are among the very first to find it out , too .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 123]: He told how he had begun life an orphan lad without money and without friends able to help him ; how he had lived as the slaves of the meanest master lived ; how his day 's work was from sixteen to eighteen hours long , and yielded him only enough black bread to keep him in a half-fed condition ; how his faithful endeavors finally attracted the attention of a good blacksmith , who came near knocking him dead with kindness by suddenly offering , when he was totally unprepared , to take him as his bound apprentice for nine years and give him board and clothes and teach him the trade -- or `` mystery '' as Dowley called it .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 50]: That was his first great rise , his first gorgeous stroke of fortune ; and you saw that he could n't yet speak of it without a sort of eloquent wonder and delight that such a gilded promotion should have fallen to the lot of a common human being .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 31]: He got no new clothing during his apprenticeship , but on his graduation day his master tricked him out in spang-new tow-linens and made him feel unspeakably rich and fine .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 9]: `` I remember me of that day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 8]: the wheelwright sang out , with enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 6]: `` And I likewise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 4]: cried the mason .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 17]: `` I would not believe they were thine own ; in faith I could not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 5]: `` Nor other ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 7]: shouted Dowley , with sparkling eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 18]: `` I was like to lose my character , the neighbors wending I had mayhap been stealing .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 18]: It was a great day , a great day ; one forgetteth not days like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 48]: Yes , and his master was a fine man , and prosperous , and always had a great feast of meat twice in the year , and with it white bread , true wheaten bread ; in fact , lived like a lord , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 13]: And in time Dowley succeeded to the business and married the daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 16]: `` And now consider what is come to pass , '' said he , impressively .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 15]: `` Two times in every month there is fresh meat upon my table . ''
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 24]: He made a pause here , to let that fact sink home , then added -- `` and eight times salt meat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 15]: `` It is even true , '' said the wheelwright , with bated breath .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 20]: `` I know it of mine own knowledge , '' said the mason , in the same reverent fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 22]: `` On my table appeareth white bread every Sunday in the year , '' added the master smith , with solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 19]: `` I leave it to your own consciences , friends , if this is not also true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 12]: `` By my head , yes , '' cried the mason .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 15]: `` I can testify it -- and I do , '' said the wheelwright .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 16]: `` And as to furniture , ye shall say yourselves what mine equipment is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 39]: He waved his hand in fine gesture of granting frank and unhampered freedom of speech , and added : `` Speak as ye are moved ; speak as ye would speak ; an I were not here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 30]: `` Ye have five stools , and of the sweetest workmanship at that , albeit your family is but three , '' said the wheelwright , with deep respect .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 29]: `` And six wooden goblets , and six platters of wood and two of pewter to eat and drink from withal , '' said the mason , impressively .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 43]: `` And I say it as knowing God is my judge , and we tarry not here alway , but must answer at the last day for the things said in the body , be they false or be they sooth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 109]: `` Now ye know what manner of man I am , brother Jones , '' said the smith , with a fine and friendly condescension , `` and doubtless ye would look to find me a man jealous of his due of respect and but sparing of outgo to strangers till their rating and quality be assured , but trouble yourself not , as concerning that ; wit ye well ye shall find me a man that regardeth not these matters but is willing to receive any he as his fellow and equal that carrieth a right heart in his body , be his worldly estate howsoever modest .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 54]: And in token of it , here is my hand ; and I say with my own mouth we are equals -- equals '' -- and he smiled around on the company with the satisfaction of a god who is doing the handsome and gracious thing and is quite well aware of it .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 53]: The king took the hand with a poorly disguised reluctance , and let go of it as willingly as a lady lets go of a fish ; all of which had a good effect , for it was mistaken for an embarrassment natural to one who was being called upon by greatness .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 15]: The dame brought out the table now , and set it under the tree .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 19]: It caused a visible stir of surprise , it being brand new and a sumptuous article of deal .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 43]: But the surprise rose higher still when the dame , with a body oozing easy indifference at every pore , but eyes that gave it all away by absolutely flaming with vanity , slowly unfolded an actual simon-pure tablecloth and spread it .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 23]: That was a notch above even the blacksmith 's domestic grandeurs , and it hit him hard ; you could see it .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 13]: But Marco was in Paradise ; you could see that , too .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 11]: Then the dame brought two fine new stools -- whew !
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 15]: that was a sensation ; it was visible in the eyes of every guest .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 12]: Then she brought two more -- as calmly as she could .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 7]: Sensation again -- with awed murmurs .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 14]: Again she brought two -- walking on air , she was so proud .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 25]: The guests were petrified , and the mason muttered : `` There is that about earthly pomps which doth ever move to reverence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 48]: As the dame turned away , Marco could n't help slapping on the climax while the thing was hot ; so he said with what was meant for a languid composure but was a poor imitation of it : `` These suffice ; leave the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 6]: So there were more yet !
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 6]: It was a fine effect .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 10]: I could n't have played the hand better myself .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 58]: From this out , the madam piled up the surprises with a rush that fired the general astonishment up to a hundred and fifty in the shade , and at the same time paralyzed expression of it down to gasped `` Oh 's '' and `` Ah 's , '' and mute upliftings of hands and eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 54]: She fetched crockery -- new , and plenty of it ; new wooden goblets and other table furniture ; and beer , fish , chicken , a goose , eggs , roast beef , roast mutton , a ham , a small roast pig , and a wealth of genuine white wheaten bread .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 24]: Take it by and large , that spread laid everything far and away in the shade that ever that crowd had seen before .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 40]: And while they sat there just simply stupefied with wonder and awe , I sort of waved my hand as if by accident , and the storekeeper 's son emerged from space and said he had come to collect .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 12]: `` That 's all right , '' I said , indifferently .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 6]: `` What is the amount ?
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 6]: give us the items . ''
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 73]: Then he read off this bill , while those three amazed men listened , and serene waves of satisfaction rolled over my soul and alternate waves of terror and admiration surged over Marco 's : 2 pounds salt ... ... ... 200 8 dozen pints beer , in the wood ... 800 3 bushels wheat ... ... ... 2,700 2 pounds fish ... ... ... 100 3 hens ... ... ... . .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 8]: 400 1 goose ... ... ... . .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 24]: 400 3 dozen eggs ... ... ... 150 1 roast of beef ... ... ... 450 1 roast of mutton ... ... . .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 31]: 400 1 ham ... ... ... ... 800 1 sucking pig ... ... ... 500 2 crockery dinner sets ... ... 6,000 2 men 's suits and underwear ... . .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 20]: 2,800 1 stuff and 1 linsey-woolsey gown and underwear ... ... ... 1,600 8 wooden goblets ... ... . .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 20]: 800 Various table furniture ... ... 10,000 1 deal table ... ... ... 3,000 8 stools ... ... ... .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 12]: 4,000 2 miller guns , loaded ... ... 3,000 He ceased .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 8]: There was a pale and awful silence .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 5]: Not a limb stirred .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 9]: Not a nostril betrayed the passage of breath .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 6]: `` Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 12]: I asked , in a voice of the most perfect calmness .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 22]: `` All , fair sir , save that certain matters of light moment are placed together under a head hight sundries .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 44]: If it would like you , I will sepa -- '' `` It is of no consequence , '' I said , accompanying the words with a gesture of the most utter indifference ; `` give me the grand total , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 23]: The clerk leaned against the tree to stay himself , and said : `` Thirty-nine thousand one hundred and fifty milrays ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 38]: The wheelwright fell off his stool , the others grabbed the table to save themselves , and there was a deep and general ejaculation of : `` God be with us in the day of disaster ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 72]: The clerk hastened to say : `` My father chargeth me to say he can not honorably require you to pay it all at this time , and therefore only prayeth you -- '' I paid no more heed than if it were the idle breeze , but , with an air of indifference amounting almost to weariness , got out my money and tossed four dollars on to the table .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 9]: Ah , you should have seen them stare !
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 7]: The clerk was astonished and charmed .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 32]: He asked me to retain one of the dollars as security , until he could go to town and -- I interrupted : `` What , and fetch back nine cents ?
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 2]: Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 4]: Take the whole .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 5]: Keep the change . ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 20]: There was an amazed murmur to this effect : `` Verily this being is _ made _ of money !
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 12]: He throweth it away even as if it were dirt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 7]: The blacksmith was a crushed man .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 12]: The clerk took his money and reeled away drunk with fortune .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 91]: I said to Marco and his wife : `` Good folk , here is a little trifle for you '' -- handing the miller-guns as if it were a matter of no consequence , though each of them contained fifteen cents in solid cash ; and while the poor creatures went to pieces with astonishment and gratitude , I turned to the others and said as calmly as one would ask the time of day : `` Well , if we are all ready , I judge the dinner is .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 6]: Come , fall to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 15]: Ah , well , it was immense ; yes , it was a daisy .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 24]: I do n't know that I ever put a situation together better , or got happier spectacular effects out of the materials available .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 10]: The blacksmith -- well , he was simply mashed .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 2]: Land !
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 17]: I would n't have felt what that man was feeling , for anything in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 108]: Here he had been blowing and bragging about his grand meat-feast twice a year , and his fresh meat twice a month , and his salt meat twice a week , and his white bread every Sunday the year round -- all for a family of three ; the entire cost for the year not above 69.2.6 -LRB- sixty-nine cents , two mills and six milrays -RRB- , and all of a sudden here comes along a man who slashes out nearly four dollars on a single blow-out ; and not only that , but acts as if it made him tired to handle such small sums .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 30]: Yes , Dowley was a good deal wilted , and shrunk-up and collapsed ; he had the aspect of a bladder-balloon that 's been stepped on by a cow .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 33]: CHAPTER XXXIII SIXTH CENTURY POLITICAL ECONOMY However , I made a dead set at him , and before the first third of the dinner was reached , I had him happy again .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 14]: It was easy to do -- in a country of ranks and castes .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 38]: You see , in a country where they have ranks and castes , a man is n't ever a man , he is only part of a man , he ca n't ever get his full growth .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 27]: You prove your superiority over him in station , or rank , or fortune , and that 's the end of it -- he knuckles down .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 8]: You ca n't insult him after that .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 47]: No , I do n't mean quite that ; of course you _ can _ insult him , I only mean it 's difficult ; and so , unless you 've got a lot of useless time on your hands it does n't pay to try .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 34]: I had the smith 's reverence now , because I was apparently immensely prosperous and rich ; I could have had his adoration if I had had some little gimcrack title of nobility .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 39]: And not only his , but any commoner 's in the land , though he were the mightiest production of all the ages , in intellect , worth , and character , and I bankrupt in all three .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 16]: This was to remain so , as long as England should exist in the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 58]: With the spirit of prophecy upon me , I could look into the future and see her erect statues and monuments to her unspeakable Georges and other royal and noble clothes-horses , and leave unhonored the creators of this world -- after God -- Gutenburg , Watt , Arkwright , Whitney , Morse , Stephenson , Bell .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 36]: The king got his cargo aboard , and then , the talk not turning upon battle , conquest , or iron-clad duel , he dulled down to drowsiness and went off to take a nap .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 51]: Mrs. Marco cleared the table , placed the beer keg handy , and went away to eat her dinner of leavings in humble privacy , and the rest of us soon drifted into matters near and dear to the hearts of our sort -- business and wages , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 35]: At a first glance , things appeared to be exceeding prosperous in this little tributary kingdom -- whose lord was King Bagdemagus -- as compared with the state of things in my own region .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 32]: They had the `` protection '' system in full force here , whereas we were working along down toward free-trade , by easy stages , and were now about half way .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 17]: Before long , Dowley and I were doing all the talking , the others hungrily listening .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 62]: Dowley warmed to his work , snuffed an advantage in the air , and began to put questions which he considered pretty awkward ones for me , and they did have something of that look : `` In your country , brother , what is the wage of a master bailiff , master hind , carter , shepherd , swineherd ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 18]: `` Twenty-five milrays a day ; that is to say , a quarter of a cent . ''
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 8]: The smith 's face beamed with joy .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 14]: He said : `` With us they are allowed the double of it !
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 24]: And what may a mechanic get -- carpenter , dauber , mason , painter , blacksmith , wheelwright , and the like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 15]: `` On the average , fifty milrays ; half a cent a day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 3]: `` Ho-ho !
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 8]: With us they are allowed a hundred !
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 12]: With us any good mechanic is allowed a cent a day !
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 43]: I count out the tailor , but not the others -- they are all allowed a cent a day , and in driving times they get more -- yes , up to a hundred and ten and even fifteen milrays a day .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 13]: I 've paid a hundred and fifteen myself , within the week .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 11]: ` Rah for protection -- to Sheol with free-trade ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 11]: And his face shone upon the company like a sunburst .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 8]: But I did n't scare at all .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 41]: I rigged up my pile-driver , and allowed myself fifteen minutes to drive him into the earth -- drive him _ all _ in -- drive him in till not even the curve of his skull should show above ground .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 10]: Here is the way I started in on him .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 14]: I asked : `` What do you pay a pound for salt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 6]: `` A hundred milrays . ''
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 5]: `` We pay forty .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 15]: What do you pay for beef and mutton -- when you buy it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 12]: That was a neat hit ; it made the color come .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 19]: `` It varieth somewhat , but not much ; one may say seventy-five milrays the pound . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 6]: _ We _ pay thirty-three .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 8]: What do you pay for eggs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 7]: `` Fifty milrays the dozen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 5]: `` We pay twenty .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 8]: What do you pay for beer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 12]: `` It costeth us eight and one-half milrays the pint . ''
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 13]: `` We get it for four ; twenty-five bottles for a cent .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 8]: What do you pay for wheat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 12]: `` At the rate of nine hundred milrays the bushel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 6]: `` We pay four hundred .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 12]: What do you pay for a man 's tow-linen suit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 5]: `` Thirteen cents . ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 5]: `` We pay six .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 19]: What do you pay for a stuff gown for the wife of the laborer or the mechanic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 10]: `` We pay eight cents , four mills . ''
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 22]: `` Well , observe the difference : you pay eight cents and four mills , we pay only four cents . ''
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 9]: I prepared now to sock it to him .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 28]: I said : `` Look here , dear friend , _ what 's become of your high wages you were bragging so about a few minutes ago ?
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 44]: _ '' -- and I looked around on the company with placid satisfaction , for I had slipped up on him gradually and tied him hand and foot , you see , without his ever noticing that he was being tied at all .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 12]: `` What 's become of those noble high wages of yours ?
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 19]: -- I seem to have knocked the stuffing all out of them , it appears to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 16]: But if you will believe me , he merely looked surprised , that is all !
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 31]: he did n't grasp the situation at all , did n't know he had walked into a trap , did n't discover that he was _ in _ a trap .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 10]: I could have shot him , from sheer vexation .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 21]: With cloudy eye and a struggling intellect he fetched this out : `` Marry , I seem not to understand .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 26]: It is _ proved _ that our wages be double thine ; how then may it be that thou ` st knocked therefrom the stuffing ?
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 29]: -- an miscall not the wonderly word , this being the first time under grace and providence of God it hath been granted me to hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 38]: Well , I was stunned ; partly with this unlooked-for stupidity on his part , and partly because his fellows so manifestly sided with him and were of his mind -- if you might call it mind .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 17]: My position was simple enough , plain enough ; how could it ever be simplified more ?
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 20]: However , I must try : `` Why , look here , brother Dowley , do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 19]: Your wages are merely higher than ours in _ name _ , not in _ fact _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 4]: `` Hear him !
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 14]: They are the _ double _ -- ye have confessed it yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 11]: `` Yes-yes , I do n't deny that at all .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 40]: But that 's got nothing to do with it ; the _ amount _ of the wages in mere coins , with meaningless names attached to them to know them by , has got nothing to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 15]: The thing is , how much can you _ buy _ with your wages ?
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 6]: -- that 's the idea .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 48]: While it is true that with you a good mechanic is allowed about three dollars and a half a year , and with us only about a dollar and seventy-five -- '' `` There -- ye 're confessing it again , ye 're confessing it again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 14]: `` Confound it , I 've never denied it , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 6]: What I say is this .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 42]: With us _ half _ a dollar buys more than a _ dollar _ buys with you -- and THEREFORE it stands to reason and the commonest kind of common-sense , that our wages are _ higher _ than yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 19]: He looked dazed , and said , despairingly : `` Verily , I can not make it out .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 20]: Ye 've just said ours are the higher , and with the same breath ye take it back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 20]: `` Oh , great Scott , is n't it possible to get such a simple thing through your head ?
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 8]: Now look here -- let me illustrate .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 25]: We pay four cents for a woman 's stuff gown , you pay 8.4.0 , which is four mills more than _ double _ .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 14]: What do you allow a laboring woman who works on a farm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 7]: `` Two mills a day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 36]: `` Very good ; we allow but half as much ; we pay her only a tenth of a cent a day ; and -- '' `` Again ye 're conf -- '' `` Wait !
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 18]: Now , you see , the thing is very simple ; this time you 'll understand it .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 42]: For instance , it takes your woman 42 days to earn her gown , at 2 mills a day -- 7 weeks ' work ; but ours earns hers in forty days -- two days _ short _ of 7 weeks .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 33]: Your woman has a gown , and her whole seven weeks wages are gone ; ours has a gown , and two days ' wages left , to buy something else with .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 10]: There -- _ now _ you understand it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 23]: He looked -- well , he merely looked dubious , it 's the most I can say ; so did the others .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 9]: I waited -- to let the thing work .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 24]: Dowley spoke at last -- and betrayed the fact that he actually had n't gotten away from his rooted and grounded superstitions yet .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 31]: He said , with a trifle of hesitancy : `` But -- but -- ye can not fail to grant that two mills a day is better than one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 2]: Shucks !
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 12]: Well , of course , I hated to give it up .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 13]: So I chanced another flyer : `` Let us suppose a case .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 48]: Suppose one of your journeymen goes out and buys the following articles : `` 1 pound of salt ; 1 dozen eggs ; 1 dozen pints of beer ; 1 bushel of wheat ; 1 tow-linen suit ; 5 pounds of beef ; 5 pounds of mutton .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 9]: `` The lot will cost him 32 cents .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 17]: It takes him 32 working days to earn the money -- 5 weeks and 2 days .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 53]: Let him come to us and work 32 days at _ half _ the wages ; he can buy all those things for a shade under 14 1/2 cents ; they will cost him a shade under 29 days ' work , and he will have about half a week 's wages over .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 42]: Carry it through the year ; he would save nearly a week 's wages every two months , _ your _ man nothing ; thus saving five or six weeks ' wages in a year , your man not a cent .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 42]: _ Now _ I reckon you understand that ` high wages ' and ` low wages ' are phrases that do n't mean anything in the world until you find out which of them will _ buy _ the most ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 5]: It was a crusher .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 4]: But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 5]: it did n't crush .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 9]: No , I had to give it up .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 33]: What those people valued was _ high wages _ ; it did n't seem to be a matter of any consequence to them whether the high wages would buy anything or not .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 37]: They stood for `` protection , '' and swore by it , which was reasonable enough , because interested parties had gulled them into the notion that it was protection which had created their high wages .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 47]: I proved to them that in a quarter of a century their wages had advanced but 30 per cent. , while the cost of living had gone up 100 ; and that with us , in a shorter time , wages had advanced 40 per cent .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 10]: while the cost of living had gone steadily down .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 8]: But it did n't do any good .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 7]: Nothing could unseat their strange beliefs .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 11]: Well , I was smarting under a sense of defeat .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 8]: Undeserved defeat , but what of that ?
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 8]: That did n't soften the smart any .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 7]: And to think of the circumstances !
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 48]: the first statesman of the age , the capablest man , the best-informed man in the entire world , the loftiest uncrowned head that had moved through the clouds of any political firmament for centuries , sitting here apparently defeated in argument by an ignorant country blacksmith !
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 24]: And I could see that those others were sorry for me -- which made me blush till I could smell my whiskers scorching .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 33]: Put yourself in my place ; feel as mean as I did , as ashamed as I felt -- would n't _ you _ have struck below the belt to get even ?
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 11]: Yes , you would ; it is simply human nature .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 8]: Well , that is what I did .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 26]: I am not trying to justify it ; I 'm only saying that I was mad , and _ anybody _ would have done it .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 50]: Well , when I make up my mind to hit a man , I do n't plan out a love-tap ; no , that is n't my way ; as long as I 'm going to hit him at all , I 'm going to hit him a lifter .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 87]: And I do n't jump at him all of a sudden , and risk making a blundering half-way business of it ; no , I get away off yonder to one side , and work up on him gradually , so that he never suspects that I 'm going to hit him at all ; and by and by , all in a flash , he 's flat on his back , and he ca n't tell for the life of him how it all happened .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 10]: That is the way I went for brother Dowley .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 96]: I started to talking lazy and comfortable , as if I was just talking to pass the time ; and the oldest man in the world could n't have taken the bearings of my starting place and guessed where I was going to fetch up : `` Boys , there 's a good many curious things about law , and custom , and usage , and all that sort of thing , when you come to look at it ; yes , and about the drift and progress of human opinion and movement , too .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 21]: There are written laws -- they perish ; but there are also unwritten laws -- _ they _ are eternal .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 24]: Take the unwritten law of wages : it says they 've got to advance , little by little , straight through the centuries .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 6]: And notice how it works .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 27]: We know what wages are now , here and there and yonder ; we strike an average , and say that 's the wages of to-day .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 80]: We know what the wages were a hundred years ago , and what they were two hundred years ago ; that 's as far back as we can get , but it suffices to give us the law of progress , the measure and rate of the periodical augmentation ; and so , without a document to help us , we can come pretty close to determining what the wages were three and four and five hundred years ago .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 5]: Good , so far .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 5]: Do we stop there ?
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 16]: We stop looking backward ; we face around and apply the law to the future .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 34]: My friends , I can tell you what people 's wages are going to be at any date in the future you want to know , for hundreds and hundreds of years . ''
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 8]: `` What , goodman , what ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 37]: In seven hundred years wages will have risen to six times what they are now , here in your region , and farm hands will be allowed 3 cents a day , and mechanics 6 . ''
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 14]: `` I would ' t I might die now and live then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 15]: interrupted Smug , the wheelwright , with a fine avaricious glow in his eye .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 25]: `` And that is n't all ; they 'll get their board besides -- such as it is : it wo n't bloat them .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 43]: Two hundred and fifty years later -- pay attention now -- a mechanic 's wages will be -- mind you , this is law , not guesswork ; a mechanic 's wages will then be _ twenty _ cents a day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 34]: There was a general gasp of awed astonishment , Dickon the mason murmured , with raised eyes and hands : `` More than three weeks ' pay for one day 's work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 3]: `` Riches !
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 10]: -- of a truth , yes , riches ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 13]: muttered Marco , his breath coming quick and short , with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 59]: `` Wages will keep on rising , little by little , little by little , as steadily as a tree grows , and at the end of three hundred and forty years more there 'll be at least _ one _ country where the mechanic 's average wage will be _ two hundred _ cents a day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 6]: It knocked them absolutely dumb !
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 15]: Not a man of them could get his breath for upwards of two minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 16]: Then the coal-burner said prayerfully : `` Might I but live to see it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 10]: `` It is the income of an earl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 3]: said Smug .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 8]: `` An earl , say ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 32]: said Dowley ; `` ye could say more than that and speak no lie ; there 's no earl in the realm of Bagdemagus that hath an income like to that .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 7]: Income of an earl -- mf !
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 9]: it 's the income of an angel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 16]: `` Now , then , that is what is going to happen as regards wages .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 36]: In that remote day , that man will earn , with _ one _ week 's work , that bill of goods which it takes you upwards of _ fifty _ weeks to earn now .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 12]: Some other pretty surprising things are going to happen , too .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 33]: Brother Dowley , who is it that determines , every spring , what the particular wage of each kind of mechanic , laborer , and servant shall be for that year ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 18]: `` Sometimes the courts , sometimes the town council ; but most of all , the magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 18]: Ye may say , in general terms , it is the magistrate that fixes the wages . ''
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 24]: `` Does n't ask any of those poor devils to _ help _ him fix their wages for them , does he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 3]: `` Hm !
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 7]: That _ were _ an idea !
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 25]: The master that 's to pay him the money is the one that 's rightly concerned in that matter , ye will notice . ''
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 31]: `` Yes -- but I thought the other man might have some little trifle at stake in it , too ; and even his wife and children , poor creatures .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 14]: The masters are these : nobles , rich men , the prosperous generally .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 22]: These few , who do no work , determine what pay the vast hive shall have who _ do _ work .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 3]: You see ?
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 34]: They 're a ` combine ' -- a trade union , to coin a new phrase -- who band themselves together to force their lowly brother to take what they choose to give .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 45]: Thirteen hundred years hence -- so says the unwritten law -- the ` combine ' will be the other way , and then how these fine people 's posterity will fume and fret and grit their teeth over the insolent tyranny of trade unions !
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 4]: Yes , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 59]: the magistrate will tranquilly arrange the wages from now clear away down into the nineteenth century ; and then all of a sudden the wage-earner will consider that a couple of thousand years or so is enough of this one-sided sort of thing ; and he will rise up and take a hand in fixing his wages himself .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 18]: Ah , he will have a long and bitter account of wrong and humiliation to settle . ''
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 18]: `` Do ye believe -- '' `` That he actually will help to fix his own wages ?
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 4]: Yes , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 11]: And he will be strong and able , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 12]: `` Brave times , brave times , of a truth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 5]: sneered the prosperous smith .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 10]: `` Oh , -- and there 's another detail .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 33]: In that day , a master may hire a man for only just one day , or one week , or one month at a time , if he wants to . ''
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 5]: `` It 's true .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 32]: Moreover , a magistrate wo n't be able to force a man to work for a master a whole year on a stretch whether the man wants to or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 15]: `` Will there be _ no _ law or sense in that day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 7]: `` Both of them , Dowley .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 19]: In that day a man will be his own property , not the property of magistrate and master .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 18]: And he can leave town whenever he wants to , if the wages do n't suit him !
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 14]: -- and they ca n't put him in the pillory for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 8]: `` Perdition catch such an age ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 7]: shouted Dowley , in strong indignation .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 18]: `` An age of dogs , an age barren of reverence for superiors and respect for authority !
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 19]: The pillory -- '' `` Oh , wait , brother ; say no good word for that institution .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 10]: I think the pillory ought to be abolished . ''
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 6]: `` A most strange idea .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 9]: `` Well , I 'll tell you why .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 14]: Is a man ever put in the pillory for a capital crime ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 22]: `` Is it right to condemn a man to a slight punishment for a small offense and then kill him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 5]: There was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 7]: I had scored my first point !
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 13]: For the first time , the smith was n't up and ready .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 5]: The company noticed it .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 3]: Good effect .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 8]: `` You do n't answer , brother .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 27]: You were about to glorify the pillory a while ago , and shed some pity on a future age that is n't going to use it .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 9]: I think the pillory ought to be abolished .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 26]: What usually happens when a poor fellow is put in the pillory for some little offense that did n't amount to anything in the world ?
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 15]: The mob try to have some fun with him , do n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 28]: `` They begin by clodding him ; and they laugh themselves to pieces to see him try to dodge one clod and get hit with another ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 14]: `` Then they throw dead cats at him , do n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 73]: `` Well , then , suppose he has a few personal enemies in that mob and here and there a man or a woman with a secret grudge against him -- and suppose especially that he is unpopular in the community , for his pride , or his prosperity , or one thing or another -- stones and bricks take the place of clods and cats presently , do n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 9]: `` There is no doubt of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 14]: `` As a rule he is crippled for life , is n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 8]: -- jaws broken , teeth smashed out ?
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 11]: -- or legs mutilated , gangrened , presently cut off ?
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 12]: -- or an eye knocked out , maybe both eyes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 10]: `` It is true , God knoweth it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 25]: `` And if he is unpopular he can depend on _ dying _ , right there in the stocks , ca n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 5]: `` He surely can !
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 7]: One may not deny it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 41]: `` I take it none of _ you _ are unpopular -- by reason of pride or insolence , or conspicuous prosperity , or any of those things that excite envy and malice among the base scum of a village ?
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 20]: _ You _ would n't think it much of a risk to take a chance in the stocks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 5]: Dowley winced , visibly .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 6]: I judged he was hit .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 11]: But he did n't betray it by any spoken word .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 15]: As for the others , they spoke out plainly , and with strong feeling .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 39]: They said they had seen enough of the stocks to know what a man 's chance in them was , and they would never consent to enter them if they could compromise on a quick death by hanging .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 24]: `` Well , to change the subject -- for I think I 've established my point that the stocks ought to be abolished .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 10]: I think some of our laws are pretty unfair .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 47]: For instance , if I do a thing which ought to deliver me to the stocks , and you know I did it and yet keep still and do n't report me , _ you _ will get the stocks if anybody informs on you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 23]: `` Ah , but that would serve you but right , '' said Dowley , `` for you _ must _ inform .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 6]: So saith the law . ''
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 4]: The others coincided .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 16]: `` Well , all right , let it go , since you vote me down .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 11]: But there 's one thing which certainly is n't fair .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 16]: The magistrate fixes a mechanic 's wage at one cent a day , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 63]: The law says that if any master shall venture , even under utmost press of business , to pay anything _ over _ that cent a day , even for a single day , he shall be both fined and pilloried for it ; and whoever knows he did it and does n't inform , they also shall be fined and pilloried .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 54]: Now it seems to me unfair , Dowley , and a deadly peril to all of us , that because you thoughtlessly confessed , a while ago , that within a week you have paid a cent and fifteen mil -- '' Oh , I tell _ you _ it was a smasher !
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 15]: You ought to have seen them to go to pieces , the whole gang .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 40]: I had just slipped up on poor smiling and complacent Dowley so nice and easy and softly , that he never suspected anything was going to happen till the blow came crashing down and knocked him all to rags .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 4]: A fine effect .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 21]: In fact , as fine as any I ever produced , with so little time to work it up in .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 15]: But I saw in a moment that I had overdone the thing a little .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 18]: I was expecting to scare them , but I was n't expecting to scare them to death .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 8]: They were mighty near it , though .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 74]: You see they had been a whole lifetime learning to appreciate the pillory ; and to have that thing staring them in the face , and every one of them distinctly at the mercy of me , a stranger , if I chose to go and report -- well , it was awful , and they could n't seem to recover from the shock , they could n't seem to pull themselves together .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 8]: Pale , shaky , dumb , pitiful ?
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 13]: Why , they were n't any better than so many dead men .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 5]: It was very uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 38]: Of course , I thought they would appeal to me to keep mum , and then we would shake hands , and take a drink all round , and laugh it off , and there an end .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 49]: But no ; you see I was an unknown person , among a cruelly oppressed and suspicious people , a people always accustomed to having advantage taken of their helplessness , and never expecting just or kind treatment from any but their own families and very closest intimates .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 17]: Appeal to _ me _ to be gentle , to be fair , to be generous ?
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 13]: Of course , they wanted to , but they could n't dare .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 18]: CHAPTER XXXIV THE YANKEE AND THE KING SOLD AS SLAVES Well , what had I better do ?
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 7]: Nothing in a hurry , sure .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 31]: I must get up a diversion ; anything to employ me while I could think , and while these poor fellows could have a chance to come to life again .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 43]: There sat Marco , petrified in the act of trying to get the hang of his miller-gun -- turned to stone , just in the attitude he was in when my pile-driver fell , the toy still gripped in his unconscious fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 13]: So I took it from him and proposed to explain its mystery .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 2]: Mystery !
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 21]: a simple little thing like that ; and yet it was mysterious enough , for that race and that age .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 21]: I never saw such an awkward people , with machinery ; you see , they were totally unused to it .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 31]: The miller-gun was a little double-barreled tube of toughened glass , with a neat little trick of a spring to it , which upon pressure would let a shot escape .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 16]: But the shot would n't hurt anybody , it would only drop into your hand .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 20]: In the gun were two sizes -- wee mustard-seed shot , and another sort that were several times larger .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 4]: They were money .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 11]: The mustard-seed shot represented milrays , the larger ones mills .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 47]: So the gun was a purse ; and very handy , too ; you could pay out money in the dark with it , with accuracy ; and you could carry it in your mouth ; or in your vest pocket , if you had one .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 21]: I made them of several sizes -- one size so large that it would carry the equivalent of a dollar .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 43]: Using shot for money was a good thing for the government ; the metal cost nothing , and the money could n't be counterfeited , for I was the only person in the kingdom who knew how to manage a shot tower .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 13]: `` Paying the shot '' soon came to be a common phrase .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 31]: Yes , and I knew it would still be passing men 's lips , away down in the nineteenth century , yet none would suspect how and when it originated .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 19]: The king joined us , about this time , mightily refreshed by his nap , and feeling good .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 69]: Anything could make me nervous now , I was so uneasy -- for our lives were in danger ; and so it worried me to detect a complacent something in the king 's eye which seemed to indicate that he had been loading himself up for a performance of some kind or other ; confound it , why must he go and choose such a time as this ?
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 4]: I was right .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 28]: He began , straight off , in the most innocently artful , and transparent , and lubberly way , to lead up to the subject of agriculture .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 9]: The cold sweat broke out all over me .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 17]: I wanted to whisper in his ear , `` Man , we are in awful danger !
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 27]: every moment is worth a principality till we get back these men 's confidence ; _ do n't _ waste any of this golden time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 9]: But of course I could n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 4]: Whisper to him ?
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 9]: It would look as if we were conspiring .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 29]: So I had to sit there and look calm and pleasant while the king stood over that dynamite mine and mooned along about his damned onions and things .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 155]: At first the tumult of my own thoughts , summoned by the danger-signal and swarming to the rescue from every quarter of my skull , kept up such a hurrah and confusion and fifing and drumming that I could n't take in a word ; but presently when my mob of gathering plans began to crystallize and fall into position and form line of battle , a sort of order and quiet ensued and I caught the boom of the king 's batteries , as if out of remote distance : '' -- were not the best way , methinks , albeit it is not to be denied that authorities differ as concerning this point , some contending that the onion is but an unwholesome berry when stricken early from the tree -- '' The audience showed signs of life , and sought each other 's eyes in a surprised and troubled way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 52]: -- whileas others do yet maintain , with much show of reason , that this is not of necessity the case , instancing that plums and other like cereals do be always dug in the unripe state -- '' The audience exhibited distinct distress ; yes , and also fear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 70]: -- yet are they clearly wholesome , the more especially when one doth assuage the asperities of their nature by admixture of the tranquilizing juice of the wayward cabbage -- '' The wild light of terror began to glow in these men 's eyes , and one of them muttered , `` These be errors , every one -- God hath surely smitten the mind of this farmer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 12]: I was in miserable apprehension ; I sat upon thorns . ''
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 88]: -- and further instancing the known truth that in the case of animals , the young , which may be called the green fruit of the creature , is the better , all confessing that when a goat is ripe , his fur doth heat and sore engame his flesh , the which defect , taken in connection with his several rancid habits , and fulsome appetites , and godless attitudes of mind , and bilious quality of morals -- '' They rose and went for him !
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 17]: With a fierce shout , `` The one would betray us , the other is mad !
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 3]: Kill them !
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 4]: Kill them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 6]: they flung themselves upon us .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 10]: What joy flamed up in the king 's eye !
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 18]: He might be lame in agriculture , but this kind of thing was just in his line .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 13]: He had been fasting long , he was hungry for a fight .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 24]: He hit the blacksmith a crack under the jaw that lifted him clear off his feet and stretched him flat on his back .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 7]: `` St. George for Britain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 6]: and he downed the wheelwright .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 13]: The mason was big , but I laid him out like nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 68]: The three gathered themselves up and came again ; went down again ; came again ; and kept on repeating this , with native British pluck , until they were battered to jelly , reeling with exhaustion , and so blind that they could n't tell us from each other ; and yet they kept right on , hammering away with what might was left in them .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 40]: Hammering each other -- for we stepped aside and looked on while they rolled , and struggled , and gouged , and pounded , and bit , with the strict and wordless attention to business of so many bulldogs .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 36]: We looked on without apprehension , for they were fast getting past ability to go for help against us , and the arena was far enough from the public road to be safe from intrusion .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 22]: Well , while they were gradually playing out , it suddenly occurred to me to wonder what had become of Marco .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 11]: I looked around ; he was nowhere to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 7]: Oh , but this was ominous !
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 17]: I pulled the king 's sleeve , and we glided away and rushed for the hut .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 8]: No Marco there , no Phyllis there !
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 11]: They had gone to the road for help , sure .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 16]: I told the king to give his heels wings , and I would explain later .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 42]: We made good time across the open ground , and as we darted into the shelter of the wood I glanced back and saw a mob of excited peasants swarm into view , with Marco and his wife at their head .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 41]: They were making a world of noise , but that could n't hurt anybody ; the wood was dense , and as soon as we were well into its depths we would take to a tree and let them whistle .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 10]: Ah , but then came another sound -- dogs !
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 8]: Yes , that was quite another matter .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 11]: It magnified our contract -- we must find running water .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 21]: We tore along at a good gait , and soon left the sounds far behind and modified to a murmur .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 9]: We struck a stream and darted into it .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 36]: We waded swiftly down it , in the dim forest light , for as much as three hundred yards , and then came across an oak with a great bough sticking out over the water .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 40]: We climbed up on this bough , and began to work our way along it to the body of the tree ; now we began to hear those sounds more plainly ; so the mob had struck our trail .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 9]: For a while the sounds approached pretty fast .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 9]: And then for another while they did n't .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 32]: No doubt the dogs had found the place where we had entered the stream , and were now waltzing up and down the shores trying to pick up the trail again .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 23]: When we were snugly lodged in the tree and curtained with foliage , the king was satisfied , but I was doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 24]: I believed we could crawl along a branch and get into the next tree , and I judged it worth while to try .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 27]: We tried it , and made a success of it , though the king slipped , at the junction , and came near failing to connect .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 24]: We got comfortable lodgment and satisfactory concealment among the foliage , and then we had nothing to do but listen to the hunt .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 24]: Presently we heard it coming -- and coming on the jump , too ; yes , and down both sides of the stream .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 27]: Louder -- louder -- next minute it swelled swiftly up into a roar of shoutings , barkings , tramplings , and swept by like a cyclone .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 27]: `` I was afraid that the overhanging branch would suggest something to them , '' said I , `` but I do n't mind the disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 17]: Come , my liege , it were well that we make good use of our time .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 5]: We 've flanked them .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 7]: Dark is coming on , presently .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 36]: If we can cross the stream and get a good start , and borrow a couple of horses from somebody 's pasture to use for a few hours , we shall be safe enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 21]: We started down , and got nearly to the lowest limb , when we seemed to hear the hunt returning .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 5]: We stopped to listen .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 25]: `` Yes , '' said I , `` they 're baffled , they 've given it up , they 're on their way home .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 16]: We will climb back to our roost again , and let them go by . ''
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 5]: So we climbed back .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 18]: The king listened a moment and said : `` They still search -- I wit the sign .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 7]: We did best to abide . ''
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 4]: He was right .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 9]: He knew more about hunting than I did .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 11]: The noise approached steadily , but not with a rush .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 36]: The king said : `` They reason that we were advantaged by no parlous start of them , and being on foot are as yet no mighty way from where we took the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 22]: `` Yes , sire , that is about it , I am afraid , though I was hoping better things . ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 23]: The noise drew nearer and nearer , and soon the van was drifting under us , on both sides of the water .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 38]: A voice called a halt from the other bank , and said : `` An they were so minded , they could get to yon tree by this branch that overhangs , and yet not touch ground .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 12]: Ye will do well to send a man up it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 9]: `` Marry , that we will do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 19]: I was obliged to admire my cuteness in foreseeing this very thing and swapping trees to beat it .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 18]: But , do n't you know , there are some things that can beat smartness and foresight ?
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 5]: Awkwardness and stupidity can .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 89]: The best swordsman in the world does n't need to fear the second best swordsman in the world ; no , the person for him to be afraid of is some ignorant antagonist who has never had a sword in his hand before ; he does n't do the thing he ought to do , and so the expert is n't prepared for him ; he does the thing he ought not to do ; and often it catches the expert out and ends him on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 37]: Well , how could I , with all my gifts , make any valuable preparation against a near-sighted , cross-eyed , pudding-headed clown who would aim himself at the wrong tree and hit the right one ?
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 7]: And that is what he did .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 24]: He went for the wrong tree , which was , of course , the right one by mistake , and up he started .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 5]: Matters were serious now .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 8]: We remained still , and awaited developments .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 8]: The peasant toiled his difficult way up .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 41]: The king raised himself up and stood ; he made a leg ready , and when the comer 's head arrived in reach of it there was a dull thud , and down went the man floundering to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 27]: There was a wild outbreak of anger below , and the mob swarmed in from all around , and there we were treed , and prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 23]: Another man started up ; the bridging bough was detected , and a volunteer started up the tree that furnished the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 12]: The king ordered me to play Horatius and keep the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 35]: For a while the enemy came thick and fast ; but no matter , the head man of each procession always got a buffet that dislodged him as soon as he came in reach .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 11]: The king 's spirits rose , his joy was limitless .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 33]: He said that if nothing occurred to mar the prospect we should have a beautiful night , for on this line of tactics we could hold the tree against the whole country-side .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 24]: However , the mob soon came to that conclusion themselves ; wherefore they called off the assault and began to debate other plans .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 17]: They had no weapons , but there were plenty of stones , and stones might answer .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 5]: We had no objections .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 38]: A stone might possibly penetrate to us once in a while , but it was n't very likely ; we were well protected by boughs and foliage , and were not visible from any good aiming point .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 19]: If they would but waste half an hour in stone-throwing , the dark would come to our help .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 7]: We were feeling very well satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 7]: We could smile ; almost laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 18]: But we did n't ; which was just as well , for we should have been interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 24]: Before the stones had been raging through the leaves and bouncing from the boughs fifteen minutes , we began to notice a smell .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 16]: A couple of sniffs of it was enough of an explanation -- it was smoke !
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 7]: Our game was up at last .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 4]: We recognized that .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 10]: When smoke invites you , you have to come .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 39]: They raised their pile of dry brush and damp weeds higher and higher , and when they saw the thick cloud begin to roll up and smother the tree , they broke out in a storm of joy-clamors .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 19]: I got enough breath to say : `` Proceed , my liege ; after you is manners . ''
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 26]: The king gasped : `` Follow me down , and then back thyself against one side of the trunk , and leave me the other .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 5]: Then will we fight .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 14]: Let each pile his dead according to his own fashion and taste . ''
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 12]: Then he descended , barking and coughing , and I followed .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 27]: I struck the ground an instant after him ; we sprang to our appointed places , and began to give and take with all our might .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 19]: The powwow and racket were prodigious ; it was a tempest of riot and confusion and thick-falling blows .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 26]: Suddenly some horsemen tore into the midst of the crowd , and a voice shouted : `` Hold -- or ye are dead men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 5]: How good it sounded !
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 35]: The owner of the voice bore all the marks of a gentleman : picturesque and costly raiment , the aspect of command , a hard countenance , with complexion and features marred by dissipation .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 11]: The mob fell humbly back , like so many spaniels .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 23]: The gentleman inspected us critically , then said sharply to the peasants : `` What are ye doing to these people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 26]: `` They be madmen , worshipful sir , that have come wandering we know not whence , and -- '' `` Ye know not whence ?
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 9]: Do ye pretend ye know them not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 11]: `` Most honored sir , we speak but the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 27]: They are strangers and unknown to any in this region ; and they be the most violent and bloodthirsty madmen that ever -- '' `` Peace !
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 7]: Ye know not what ye say .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 5]: They are not mad .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 4]: Who are ye ?
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 5]: And whence are ye ?
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 3]: Explain . ''
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 21]: `` We are but peaceful strangers , sir , '' I said , `` and traveling upon our own concerns .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 11]: We are from a far country , and unacquainted here .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 22]: We have purposed no harm ; and yet but for your brave interference and protection these people would have killed us .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 20]: As you have divined , sir , we are not mad ; neither are we violent or bloodthirsty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 20]: The gentleman turned to his retinue and said calmly : `` Lash me these animals to their kennels ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 40]: The mob vanished in an instant ; and after them plunged the horsemen , laying about them with their whips and pitilessly riding down such as were witless enough to keep the road instead of taking to the bush .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 20]: The shrieks and supplications presently died away in the distance , and soon the horsemen began to straggle back .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 19]: Meantime the gentleman had been questioning us more closely , but had dug no particulars out of us .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 29]: We were lavish of recognition of the service he was doing us , but we revealed nothing more than that we were friendless strangers from a far country .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 26]: When the escort were all returned , the gentleman said to one of his servants : `` Bring the led-horses and mount these people . ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 7]: `` Yes , my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 11]: We were placed toward the rear , among the servants .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 29]: We traveled pretty fast , and finally drew rein some time after dark at a roadside inn some ten or twelve miles from the scene of our troubles .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 21]: My lord went immediately to his room , after ordering his supper , and we saw no more of him .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 13]: At dawn in the morning we breakfasted and made ready to start .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 81]: My lord 's chief attendant sauntered forward at that moment with indolent grace , and said : `` Ye have said ye should continue upon this road , which is our direction likewise ; wherefore my lord , the earl Grip , hath given commandment that ye retain the horses and ride , and that certain of us ride with ye a twenty mile to a fair town that hight Cambenet , whenso ye shall be out of peril . ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 14]: We could do nothing less than express our thanks and accept the offer .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 43]: We jogged along , six in the party , at a moderate and comfortable gait , and in conversation learned that my lord Grip was a very great personage in his own region , which lay a day 's journey beyond Cambenet .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 25]: We loitered to such a degree that it was near the middle of the forenoon when we entered the market square of the town .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 36]: We dismounted , and left our thanks once more for my lord , and then approached a crowd assembled in the center of the square , to see what might be the object of interest .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 12]: It was the remnant of that old peregrinating band of slaves !
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 14]: So they had been dragging their chains about , all this weary time .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 22]: That poor husband was gone , and also many others ; and some few purchases had been added to the gang .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 22]: The king was not interested , and wanted to move along , but I was absorbed , and full of pity .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 16]: I could not take my eyes away from these worn and wasted wrecks of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 21]: There they sat , grounded upon the ground , silent , uncomplaining , with bowed heads , a pathetic sight .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 31]: And by hideous contrast , a redundant orator was making a speech to another gathering not thirty steps away , in fulsome laudation of `` our glorious British liberties ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 4]: I was boiling .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 16]: I had forgotten I was a plebeian , I was remembering I was a man .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 14]: Cost what it might , I would mount that rostrum and -- Click !
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 8]: the king and I were handcuffed together !
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 17]: Our companions , those servants , had done it ; my lord Grip stood looking on .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 19]: The king burst out in a fury , and said : `` What meaneth this ill-mannered jest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 21]: My lord merely said to his head miscreant , coolly : `` Put up the slaves and sell them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 3]: _ Slaves !
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 13]: _ The word had a new sound -- and how unspeakably awful !
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 26]: The king lifted his manacles and brought them down with a deadly force ; but my lord was out of the way when they arrived .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 25]: A dozen of the rascal 's servants sprang forward , and in a moment we were helpless , with our hands bound behind us .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 37]: We so loudly and so earnestly proclaimed ourselves freemen , that we got the interested attention of that liberty-mouthing orator and his patriotic crowd , and they gathered about us and assumed a very determined attitude .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 33]: The orator said : `` If , indeed , ye are freemen , ye have nought to fear -- the God-given liberties of Britain are about ye for your shield and shelter !
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 4]: -LRB- Applause . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 5]: Ye shall soon see .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 6]: Bring forth your proofs . ''
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 5]: `` What proofs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 8]: `` Proof that ye are freemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 5]: Ah -- I remembered !
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 9]: I came to myself ; I said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 14]: But the king stormed out : `` Thou ` rt insane , man .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 25]: It were better , and more in reason , that this thief and scoundrel here prove that we are _ not _ freemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 25]: You see , he knew his own laws just as other people so often know the laws ; by words , not by effects .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 23]: They take a _ meaning _ , and get to be very vivid , when you come to apply them to yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 17]: All hands shook their heads and looked disappointed ; some turned away , no longer interested .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 35]: The orator said -- and this time in the tones of business , not of sentiment : `` An ye do not know your country 's laws , it were time ye learned them .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 12]: Ye are strangers to us ; ye will not deny that .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 18]: Ye may be freemen , we do not deny that ; but also ye may be slaves .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 27]: The law is clear : it doth not require the claimant to prove ye are slaves , it requireth you to prove ye are not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 51]: I said : `` Dear sir , give us only time to send to Astolat ; or give us only time to send to the Valley of Holiness -- '' `` Peace , good man , these are extraordinary requests , and you may not hope to have them granted .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 22]: It would cost much time , and would unwarrantably inconvenience your master -- '' '' _ Master _ , idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 4]: stormed the king .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 22]: `` I have no master , I myself am the m -- '' `` Silence , for God 's sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 12]: I got the words out in time to stop the king .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 24]: We were in trouble enough already ; it could not help us any to give these people the notion that we were lunatics .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 10]: There is no use in stringing out the details .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 11]: The earl put us up and sold us at auction .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 78]: This same infernal law had existed in our own South in my own time , more than thirteen hundred years later , and under it hundreds of freemen who could not prove that they were freemen had been sold into lifelong slavery without the circumstance making any particular impression upon me ; but the minute law and the auction block came into my personal experience , a thing which had been merely improper before became suddenly hellish .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 10]: Well , that 's the way we are made .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 11]: Yes , we were sold at auction , like swine .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 41]: In a big town and an active market we should have brought a good price ; but this place was utterly stagnant and so we sold at a figure which makes me ashamed , every time I think of it .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 29]: The King of England brought seven dollars , and his prime minister nine ; whereas the king was easily worth twelve dollars and I as easily worth fifteen .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 49]: But that is the way things always go ; if you force a sale on a dull market , I do n't care what the property is , you are going to make a poor business of it , and you can make up your mind to it .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 25]: If the earl had had wit enough to -- However , there is no occasion for my working my sympathies up on his account .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 17]: Let him go , for the present ; I took his number , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 25]: The slave-dealer bought us both , and hitched us onto that long chain of his , and we constituted the rear of his procession .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 82]: We took up our line of march and passed out of Cambenet at noon ; and it seemed to me unaccountably strange and odd that the King of England and his chief minister , marching manacled and fettered and yoked , in a slave convoy , could move by all manner of idle men and women , and under windows where sat the sweet and the lovely , and yet never attract a curious eye , never provoke a single remark .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 25]: Dear , dear , it only shows that there is nothing diviner about a king than there is about a tramp , after all .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 18]: He is just a cheap and hollow artificiality when you do n't know he is a king .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 19]: But reveal his quality , and dear me it takes your very breath away to look at him .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 7]: I reckon we are all fools .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 6]: Born so , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 12]: CHAPTER XXXV A PITIFUL INCIDENT It 's a world of surprises .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 8]: The king brooded ; this was natural .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 10]: What would he brood about , should you say ?
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 46]: Why , about the prodigious nature of his fall , of course -- from the loftiest place in the world to the lowest ; from the most illustrious station in the world to the obscurest ; from the grandest vocation among men to the basest .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 29]: No , I take my oath that the thing that graveled him most , to start with , was not this , but the price he had fetched !
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 11]: He could n't seem to get over that seven dollars .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 27]: Well , it stunned me so , when I first found it out , that I could n't believe it ; it did n't seem natural .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 29]: But as soon as my mental sight cleared and I got a right focus on it , I saw I was mistaken ; it _ was _ natural .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 54]: For this reason : a king is a mere artificiality , and so a king 's feelings , like the impulses of an automatic doll , are mere artificialities ; but as a man , he is a reality , and his feelings , as a man , are real , not phantoms .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 36]: It shames the average man to be valued below his own estimate of his worth , and the king certainly was n't anything more than an average man , if he was up that high .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 47]: Confound him , he wearied me with arguments to show that in anything like a fair market he would have fetched twenty-five dollars , sure -- a thing which was plainly nonsense , and full or the baldest conceit ; I was n't worth it myself .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 11]: But it was tender ground for me to argue on .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 15]: In fact , I had to simply shirk argument and do the diplomatic instead .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 63]: I had to throw conscience aside , and brazenly concede that he ought to have brought twenty-five dollars ; whereas I was quite well aware that in all the ages , the world had never seen a king that was worth half the money , and during the next thirteen centuries would n't see one that was worth the fourth of it .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 6]: Yes , he tired me .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 65]: If he began to talk about the crops ; or about the recent weather ; or about the condition of politics ; or about dogs , or cats , or morals , or theology -- no matter what -- I sighed , for I knew what was coming ; he was going to get out of it a palliation of that tiresome seven-dollar sale .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 44]: Wherever we halted where there was a crowd , he would give me a look which said plainly : `` if that thing could be tried over again now , with this kind of folk , you would see a different result . ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 38]: Well , when he was first sold , it secretly tickled me to see him go for seven dollars ; but before he was done with his sweating and worrying I wished he had fetched a hundred .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 55]: The thing never got a chance to die , for every day , at one place or another , possible purchasers looked us over , and , as often as any other way , their comment on the king was something like this : `` Here 's a two-dollar-and-a-half chump with a thirty-dollar style .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 7]: Pity but style was marketable . ''
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 11]: At last this sort of remark produced an evil result .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 26]: Our owner was a practical person and he perceived that this defect must be mended if he hoped to find a purchaser for the king .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 15]: So he went to work to take the style out of his sacred majesty .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 35]: I could have given the man some valuable advice , but I did n't ; you must n't volunteer advice to a slave-driver unless you want to damage the cause you are arguing for .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 54]: I had found it a sufficiently difficult job to reduce the king 's style to a peasant 's style , even when he was a willing and anxious pupil ; now then , to undertake to reduce the king 's style to a slave 's style -- and by force -- go to !
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 6]: it was a stately contract .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 16]: Never mind the details -- it will save me trouble to let you imagine them .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 47]: I will only remark that at the end of a week there was plenty of evidence that lash and club and fist had done their work well ; the king 's body was a sight to see -- and to weep over ; but his spirit ?
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 9]: -- why , it was n't even phased .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 43]: Even that dull clod of a slave-driver was able to see that there can be such a thing as a slave who will remain a man till he dies ; whose bones you can break , but whose manhood you ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 38]: This man found that from his first effort down to his latest , he could n't ever come within reach of the king , but the king was ready to plunge for him , and did it .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 18]: So he gave up at last , and left the king in possession of his style unimpaired .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 37]: The fact is , the king was a good deal more than a king , he was a man ; and when a man is a man , you ca n't knock it out of him .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 20]: We had a rough time for a month , tramping to and fro in the earth , and suffering .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 15]: And what Englishman was the most interested in the slavery question by that time ?
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 5]: His grace the king !
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 15]: Yes ; from being the most indifferent , he was become the most interested .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 15]: He was become the bitterest hater of the institution I had ever heard talk .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 37]: And so I ventured to ask once more a question which I had asked years before and had gotten such a sharp answer that I had not thought it prudent to meddle in the matter further .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 5]: Would he abolish slavery ?
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 61]: His answer was as sharp as before , but it was music this time ; I should n't ever wish to hear pleasanter , though the profanity was not good , being awkwardly put together , and with the crash-word almost in the middle instead of at the end , where , of course , it ought to have been .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 20]: I was ready and willing to get free now ; I had n't wanted to get free any sooner .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 9]: No , I can not quite say that .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 25]: I had wanted to , but I had not been willing to take desperate chances , and had always dissuaded the king from them .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 11]: But now -- ah , it was a new atmosphere !
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 14]: Liberty would be worth any cost that might be put upon it now .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 13]: I set about a plan , and was straightway charmed with it .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 18]: It would require time , yes , and patience , too , a great deal of both .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 30]: One could invent quicker ways , and fully as sure ones ; but none that would be as picturesque as this ; none that could be made so dramatic .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 12]: And so I was not going to give this one up .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 19]: It might delay us months , but no matter , I would carry it out or break something .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 8]: Now and then we had an adventure .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 20]: One night we were overtaken by a snow-storm while still a mile from the village we were making for .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 18]: Almost instantly we were shut up as in a fog , the driving snow was so thick .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 13]: You could n't see a thing , and we were soon lost .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 35]: The slave-driver lashed us desperately , for he saw ruin before him , but his lashings only made matters worse , for they drove us further from the road and from likelihood of succor .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 17]: So we had to stop at last and slump down in the snow where we were .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 10]: The storm continued until toward midnight , then ceased .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 25]: By this time two of our feebler men and three of our women were dead , and others past moving and threatened with death .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 7]: Our master was nearly beside himself .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 33]: He stirred up the living , and made us stand , jump , slap ourselves , to restore our circulation , and he helped as well as he could with his whip .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 5]: Now came a diversion .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 31]: We heard shrieks and yells , and soon a woman came running and crying ; and seeing our group , she flung herself into our midst and begged for protection .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 49]: A mob of people came tearing after her , some with torches , and they said she was a witch who had caused several cows to die by a strange disease , and practiced her arts by help of a devil in the form of a black cat .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 19]: This poor woman had been stoned until she hardly looked human , she was so battered and bloody .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 7]: The mob wanted to burn her .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 12]: Well , now , what do you suppose our master did ?
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 16]: When we closed around this poor creature to shelter her , he saw his chance .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 16]: He said , burn her here , or they should n't have her at all .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 3]: Imagine that !
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 4]: They were willing .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 77]: They fastened her to a post ; they brought wood and piled it about her ; they applied the torch while she shrieked and pleaded and strained her two young daughters to her breast ; and our brute , with a heart solely for business , lashed us into position about the stake and warmed us into life and commercial value by the same fire which took away the innocent life of that poor harmless mother .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 9]: That was the sort of master we had .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 7]: I took _ his _ number .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 35]: That snow-storm cost him nine of his flock ; and he was more brutal to us than ever , after that , for many days together , he was so enraged over his loss .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 6]: We had adventures all along .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 8]: One day we ran into a procession .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 5]: And such a procession !
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 19]: All the riffraff of the kingdom seemed to be comprehended in it ; and all drunk at that .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 96]: In the van was a cart with a coffin in it , and on the coffin sat a comely young girl of about eighteen suckling a baby , which she squeezed to her breast in a passion of love every little while , and every little while wiped from its face the tears which her eyes rained down upon it ; and always the foolish little thing smiled up at her , happy and content , kneading her breast with its dimpled fat hand , which she patted and fondled right over her breaking heart .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 44]: Men and women , boys and girls , trotted along beside or after the cart , hooting , shouting profane and ribald remarks , singing snatches of foul song , skipping , dancing -- a very holiday of hellions , a sickening sight .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 24]: We had struck a suburb of London , outside the walls , and this was a sample of one sort of London society .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 12]: Our master secured a good place for us near the gallows .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 31]: A priest was in attendance , and he helped the girl climb up , and said comforting words to her , and made the under-sheriff provide a stool for her .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 58]: Then he stood there by her on the gallows , and for a moment looked down upon the mass of upturned faces at his feet , then out over the solid pavement of heads that stretched away on every side occupying the vacancies far and near , and then began to tell the story of the case .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 21]: And there was pity in his voice -- how seldom a sound that was in that ignorant and savage land !
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 36]: I remember every detail of what he said , except the words he said it in ; and so I change it into my own words : `` Law is intended to mete out justice .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 4]: Sometimes it fails .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 6]: This can not be helped .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 34]: We can only grieve , and be resigned , and pray for the soul of him who falls unfairly by the arm of the law , and that his fellows may be few .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 15]: A law sends this poor young thing to death -- and it is right .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 34]: But another law had placed her where she must commit her crime or starve with her child -- and before God that law is responsible for both her crime and her ignominious death !
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 46]: `` A little while ago this young thing , this child of eighteen years , was as happy a wife and mother as any in England ; and her lips were blithe with song , which is the native speech of glad and innocent hearts .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 62]: Her young husband was as happy as she ; for he was doing his whole duty , he worked early and late at his handicraft , his bread was honest bread well and fairly earned , he was prospering , he was furnishing shelter and sustenance to his family , he was adding his mite to the wealth of the nation .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 19]: By consent of a treacherous law , instant destruction fell upon this holy home and swept it away !
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 13]: That young husband was waylaid and impressed , and sent to sea .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 7]: The wife knew nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 24]: She sought him everywhere , she moved the hardest hearts with the supplications of her tears , the broken eloquence of her despair .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 24]: Weeks dragged by , she watching , waiting , hoping , her mind going slowly to wreck under the burden of her misery .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 11]: Little by little all her small possessions went for food .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 16]: When she could no longer pay her rent , they turned her out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 47]: She begged , while she had strength ; when she was starving at last , and her milk failing , she stole a piece of linen cloth of the value of a fourth part of a cent , thinking to sell it and save her child .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 11]: But she was seen by the owner of the cloth .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 10]: She was put in jail and brought to trial .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 7]: The man testified to the facts .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 17]: A plea was made for her , and her sorrowful story was told in her behalf .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 59]: She spoke , too , by permission , and said she did steal the cloth , but that her mind was so disordered of late by trouble that when she was overborne with hunger all acts , criminal or other , swam meaningless through her brain and she knew nothing rightly , except that she was so hungry !
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 120]: For a moment all were touched , and there was disposition to deal mercifully with her , seeing that she was so young and friendless , and her case so piteous , and the law that robbed her of her support to blame as being the first and only cause of her transgression ; but the prosecuting officer replied that whereas these things were all true , and most pitiful as well , still there was much small theft in these days , and mistimed mercy here would be a danger to property -- oh , my God , is there no property in ruined homes , and orphaned babes , and broken hearts that British law holds precious !
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 8]: -- and so he must require sentence .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 60]: `` When the judge put on his black cap , the owner of the stolen linen rose trembling up , his lip quivering , his face as gray as ashes ; and when the awful words came , he cried out , ` Oh , poor child , poor child , I did not know it was death ! '
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 7]: and fell as a tree falls .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 23]: When they lifted him up his reason was gone ; before the sun was set , he had taken his own life .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 45]: A kindly man ; a man whose heart was right , at bottom ; add his murder to this that is to be now done here ; and charge them both where they belong -- to the rulers and the bitter laws of Britain .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 45]: The time is come , my child ; let me pray over thee -- not _ for _ thee , dear abused poor heart and innocent , but for them that be guilty of thy ruin and death , who need it more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 90]: After his prayer they put the noose around the young girl 's neck , and they had great trouble to adjust the knot under her ear , because she was devouring the baby all the time , wildly kissing it , and snatching it to her face and her breast , and drenching it with tears , and half moaning , half shrieking all the while , and the baby crowing , and laughing , and kicking its feet with delight over what it took for romp and play .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 12]: Even the hangman could n't stand it , but turned away .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 59]: When all was ready the priest gently pulled and tugged and forced the child out of the mother 's arms , and stepped quickly out of her reach ; but she clasped her hands , and made a wild spring toward him , with a shriek ; but the rope -- and the under-sheriff -- held her short .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 40]: Then she went on her knees and stretched out her hands and cried : `` One more kiss -- oh , my God , one more , one more , -- it is the dying that begs it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 11]: She got it ; she almost smothered the little thing .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 25]: And when they got it away again , she cried out : `` Oh , my child , my darling , it will die !
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 24]: It has no home , it has no father , no friend , no mother -- '' `` It has them all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 5]: said that good priest .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 13]: `` All these will I be to it till I die . ''
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 8]: You should have seen her face then !
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 2]: Gratitude ?
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 12]: Lord , what do you want with words to express that ?
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 13]: Words are only painted fire ; a look is the fire itself .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 23]: She gave that look , and carried it away to the treasury of heaven , where all things that are divine belong .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 19]: CHAPTER XXXVI AN ENCOUNTER IN THE DARK London -- to a slave -- was a sufficiently interesting place .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 14]: It was merely a great big village ; and mainly mud and thatch .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 9]: The streets were muddy , crooked , unpaved .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 22]: The populace was an ever flocking and drifting swarm of rags , and splendors , of nodding plumes and shining armor .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 14]: The king had a palace there ; he saw the outside of it .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 20]: It made him sigh ; yes , and swear a little , in a poor juvenile sixth century way .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 56]: We saw knights and grandees whom we knew , but they did n't know us in our rags and dirt and raw welts and bruises , and would n't have recognized us if we had hailed them , nor stopped to answer , either , it being unlawful to speak with slaves on a chain .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 18]: Sandy passed within ten yards of me on a mule -- hunting for me , I imagined .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 41]: But the thing which clean broke my heart was something which happened in front of our old barrack in a square , while we were enduring the spectacle of a man being boiled to death in oil for counterfeiting pennies .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 16]: It was the sight of a newsboy -- and I could n't get at him !
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 19]: Still , I had one comfort -- here was proof that Clarence was still alive and banging away .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 16]: I meant to be with him before long ; the thought was full of cheer .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 19]: I had one little glimpse of another thing , one day , which gave me a great uplift .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 10]: It was a wire stretching from housetop to housetop .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 6]: Telegraph or telephone , sure .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 13]: I did very much wish I had a little piece of it .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 17]: It was just what I needed , in order to carry out my project of escape .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 75]: My idea was to get loose some night , along with the king , then gag and bind our master , change clothes with him , batter him into the aspect of a stranger , hitch him to the slave-chain , assume possession of the property , march to Camelot , and -- But you get my idea ; you see what a stunning dramatic surprise I would wind up with at the palace .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 25]: It was all feasible , if I could only get hold of a slender piece of iron which I could shape into a lock-pick .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 19]: I could then undo the lumbering padlocks with which our chains were fastened , whenever I might choose .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 18]: But I never had any luck ; no such thing ever happened to fall in my way .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 8]: However , my chance came at last .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 26]: A gentleman who had come twice before to dicker for me , without result , or indeed any approach to a result , came again .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 46]: I was far from expecting ever to belong to him , for the price asked for me from the time I was first enslaved was exorbitant , and always provoked either anger or derision , yet my master stuck stubbornly to it -- twenty-two dollars .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 7]: He would n't bate a cent .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 34]: The king was greatly admired , because of his grand physique , but his kingly style was against him , and he was n't salable ; nobody wanted that kind of a slave .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 14]: I considered myself safe from parting from him because of my extravagant price .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 40]: No , I was not expecting to ever belong to this gentleman whom I have spoken of , but he had something which I expected would belong to me eventually , if he would but visit us often enough .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 25]: It was a steel thing with a long pin to it , with which his long cloth outside garment was fastened together in front .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 6]: There were three of them .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 53]: He had disappointed me twice , because he did not come quite close enough to me to make my project entirely safe ; but this time I succeeded ; I captured the lower clasp of the three , and when he missed it he thought he had lost it on the way .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 20]: I had a chance to be glad about a minute , then straightway a chance to be sad again .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 39]: For when the purchase was about to fail , as usual , the master suddenly spoke up and said what would be worded thus -- in modern English : `` I 'll tell you what I 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 10]: I 'm tired supporting these two for no good .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 18]: Give me twenty-two dollars for this one , and I 'll throw the other one in . ''
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 15]: The king could n't get his breath , he was in such a fury .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 18]: He began to choke and gag , and meantime the master and the gentleman moved away discussing .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 22]: `` An ye will keep the offer open -- '' '' 'T is open till the morrow at this hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 23]: `` Then I will answer you at that time , '' said the gentleman , and disappeared , the master following him .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 17]: I had a time of it to cool the king down , but I managed it .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 25]: I whispered in his ear , to this effect : `` Your grace _ will _ go for nothing , but after another fashion .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 12]: And so shall I. To-night we shall both be free . ''
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 5]: How is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 21]: `` With this thing which I have stolen , I will unlock these locks and cast off these chains to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 44]: When he comes about nine-thirty to inspect us for the night , we will seize him , gag him , batter him , and early in the morning we will march out of this town , proprietors of this caravan of slaves . ''
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 16]: That was as far as I went , but the king was charmed and satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 37]: That evening we waited patiently for our fellow-slaves to get to sleep and signify it by the usual sign , for you must not take many chances on those poor fellows if you can avoid it .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 9]: It is best to keep your own secrets .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 18]: No doubt they fidgeted only about as usual , but it did n't seem so to me .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 18]: It seemed to me that they were going to be forever getting down to their regular snoring .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 75]: As the time dragged on I got nervously afraid we should n't have enough of it left for our needs ; so I made several premature attempts , and merely delayed things by it ; for I could n't seem to touch a padlock , there in the dark , without starting a rattle out of it which interrupted somebody 's sleep and made him turn over and wake some more of the gang .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 18]: But finally I did get my last iron off , and was a free man once more .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 16]: I took a good breath of relief , and reached for the king 's irons .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 3]: Too late !
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 19]: in comes the master , with a light in one hand and his heavy walking-staff in the other .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 43]: I snuggled close among the wallow of snorers , to conceal as nearly as possible that I was naked of irons ; and I kept a sharp lookout and prepared to spring for my man the moment he should bend over me .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 6]: But he did n't approach .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 56]: He stopped , gazed absently toward our dusky mass a minute , evidently thinking about something else ; then set down his light , moved musingly toward the door , and before a body could imagine what he was going to do , he was out of the door and had closed it behind him .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 4]: `` Quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 4]: said the king .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 6]: `` Fetch him back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 20]: Of course , it was the thing to do , and I was up and out in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 20]: But , dear me , there were no lamps in those days , and it was a dark night .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 11]: But I glimpsed a dim figure a few steps away .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 21]: I darted for it , threw myself upon it , and then there was a state of things and lively !
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 15]: We fought and scuffled and struggled , and drew a crowd in no time .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 36]: They took an immense interest in the fight and encouraged us all they could , and , in fact , could n't have been pleasanter or more cordial if it had been their own fight .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 31]: Then a tremendous row broke out behind us , and as much as half of our audience left us , with a rush , to invest some sympathy in that .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 18]: Lanterns began to swing in all directions ; it was the watch gathering from far and near .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 19]: Presently a halberd fell across my back , as a reminder , and I knew what it meant .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 5]: I was in custody .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 5]: So was my adversary .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 15]: We were marched off toward prison , one on each side of the watchman .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 14]: Here was disaster , here was a fine scheme gone to sudden destruction !
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 86]: I tried to imagine what would happen when the master should discover that it was I who had been fighting him ; and what would happen if they jailed us together in the general apartment for brawlers and petty law-breakers , as was the custom ; and what might -- Just then my antagonist turned his face around in my direction , the freckled light from the watchman 's tin lantern fell on it , and , by George , he was the wrong man !
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 7]: CHAPTER XXXVII AN AWFUL PREDICAMENT Sleep ?
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 4]: It was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 27]: It would naturally have been impossible in that noisome cavern of a jail , with its mangy crowd of drunken , quarrelsome , and song-singing rapscallions .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 51]: But the thing that made sleep all the more a thing not to be dreamed of , was my racking impatience to get out of this place and find out the whole size of what might have happened yonder in the slave-quarters in consequence of that intolerable miscarriage of mine .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 14]: It was a long night , but the morning got around at last .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 11]: I made a full and frank explanation to the court .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 58]: I said I was a slave , the property of the great Earl Grip , who had arrived just after dark at the Tabard inn in the village on the other side of the water , and had stopped there over night , by compulsion , he being taken deadly sick with a strange and sudden disorder .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 116]: I had been ordered to cross to the city in all haste and bring the best physician ; I was doing my best ; naturally I was running with all my might ; the night was dark , I ran against this common person here , who seized me by the throat and began to pummel me , although I told him my errand , and implored him , for the sake of the great earl my master 's mortal peril -- The common person interrupted and said it was a lie ; and was going to explain how I rushed upon him and attacked him without a word -- `` Silence , sirrah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 4]: from the court .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 29]: `` Take him hence and give him a few stripes whereby to teach him how to treat the servant of a nobleman after a different fashion another time .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 3]: Go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 33]: Then the court begged my pardon , and hoped I would not fail to tell his lordship it was in no wise the court 's fault that this high-handed thing had happened .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 15]: I said I would make it all right , and so took my leave .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 28]: Took it just in time , too ; he was starting to ask me why I did n't fetch out these facts the moment I was arrested .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 49]: I said I would if I had thought of it -- which was true -- but that I was so battered by that man that all my wit was knocked out of me -- and so forth and so on , and got myself away , still mumbling .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 7]: I did n't wait for breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 7]: No grass grew under my feet .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 8]: I was soon at the slave quarters .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 5]: Empty -- everybody gone !
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 12]: That is , everybody except one body -- the slave-master 's .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 19]: It lay there all battered to pulp ; and all about were the evidences of a terrific fight .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 38]: There was a rude board coffin on a cart at the door , and workmen , assisted by the police , were thinning a road through the gaping crowd in order that they might bring it in .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 28]: I picked out a man humble enough in life to condescend to talk with one so shabby as I , and got his account of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 7]: `` There were sixteen slaves here .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 17]: They rose against their master in the night , and thou seest how it ended . ''
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 6]: How did it begin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 9]: `` There was no witness but the slaves .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 47]: They said the slave that was most valuable got free of his bonds and escaped in some strange way -- by magic arts 't was thought , by reason that he had no key , and the locks were neither broke nor in any wise injured .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 49]: When the master discovered his loss , he was mad with despair , and threw himself upon his people with his heavy stick , who resisted and brake his back and in other and divers ways did give him hurts that brought him swiftly to his end . ''
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 5]: `` This is dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 16]: It will go hard with the slaves , no doubt , upon the trial . ''
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 9]: `` Marry , the trial is over . ''
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 4]: `` Over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 16]: `` Would they be a week , think you -- and the matter so simple ?
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 15]: They were not the half of a quarter of an hour at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 24]: `` Why , I do n't see how they could determine which were the guilty ones in so short a time . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 5]: _ Which _ ones ?
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 10]: Indeed , they considered not particulars like to that .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 7]: They condemned them in a body .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 6]: Wit ye not the law ?
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 33]: -- which men say the Romans left behind them here when they went -- that if one slave killeth his master all the slaves of that man must die for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 3]: `` True .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 4]: I had forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 7]: And when will these die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 32]: `` Belike within a four and twenty hours ; albeit some say they will wait a pair of days more , if peradventure they may find the missing one meantime . ''
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 4]: The missing one !
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 6]: It made me feel uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 10]: `` Is it likely they will find him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 9]: `` Before the day is spent -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 5]: They seek him everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 37]: They stand at the gates of the town , with certain of the slaves who will discover him to them if he cometh , and none can pass out but he will be first examined . ''
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 13]: `` Might one see the place where the rest are confined ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 8]: `` The outside of it -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 15]: The inside of it -- but ye will not want to see that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 15]: I took the address of that prison for future reference and then sauntered off .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 50]: At the first second-hand clothing shop I came to , up a back street , I got a rough rig suitable for a common seaman who might be going on a cold voyage , and bound up my face with a liberal bandage , saying I had a toothache .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 6]: This concealed my worst bruises .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 5]: It was a transformation .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 8]: I no longer resembled my former self .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 17]: Then I struck out for that wire , found it and followed it to its den .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 24]: It was a little room over a butcher 's shop -- which meant that business was n't very brisk in the telegraphic line .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 11]: The young chap in charge was drowsing at his table .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 13]: I locked the door and put the vast key in my bosom .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 35]: This alarmed the young fellow , and he was going to make a noise ; but I said : `` Save your wind ; if you open your mouth you are dead , sure .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 4]: Tackle your instrument .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 4]: Lively , now !
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 4]: Call Camelot . ''
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 6]: `` This doth amaze me !
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 17]: How should such as you know aught of such matters as -- '' `` Call Camelot !
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 6]: I am a desperate man .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 17]: Call Camelot , or get away from the instrument and I will do it myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 6]: `` What -- you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 5]: `` Yes -- certainly .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 3]: Stop gabbling .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 5]: Call the palace . ''
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 5]: He made the call .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 9]: `` Now , then , call Clarence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 7]: `` Clarence _ who _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 6]: `` Never mind Clarence who .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 12]: Say you want Clarence ; you 'll get an answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 4]: He did so .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 15]: We waited five nerve-straining minutes -- ten minutes -- how long it did seem !
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 25]: -- and then came a click that was as familiar to me as a human voice ; for Clarence had been my own pupil .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 8]: `` Now , my lad , vacate !
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 26]: They would have known _ my _ touch , maybe , and so your call was surest ; but I 'm all right now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 17]: He vacated the place and cocked his ear to listen -- but it did n't win .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 5]: I used a cipher .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 30]: I did n't waste any time in sociabilities with Clarence , but squared away for business , straight-off -- thus : `` The king is here and in danger .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 9]: We were captured and brought here as slaves .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 24]: We should not be able to prove our identity -- and the fact is , I am not in a position to try .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 15]: Send a telegram for the palace here which will carry conviction with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 32]: His answer came straight back : `` They do n't know anything about the telegraph ; they have n't had any experience yet , the line to London is so new .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 5]: Better not venture that .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 5]: They might hang you .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 6]: Think up something else . ''
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 4]: Might hang us !
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 11]: Little he knew how closely he was crowding the facts .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 10]: I could n't think up anything for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 31]: Then an idea struck me , and I started it along : `` Send five hundred picked knights with Launcelot in the lead ; and send them on the jump .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 24]: Let them enter by the southwest gate , and look out for the man with a white cloth around his right arm . ''
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 15]: The answer was prompt : `` They shall start in half an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 38]: `` All right , Clarence ; now tell this lad here that I 'm a friend of yours and a dead-head ; and that he must be discreet and say nothing about this visit of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 13]: The instrument began to talk to the youth and I hurried away .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 5]: I fell to ciphering .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 10]: In half an hour it would be nine o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 12]: Knights and horses in heavy armor could n't travel very fast .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 84]: These would make the best time they could , and now that the ground was in good condition , and no snow or mud , they would probably make a seven-mile gait ; they would have to change horses a couple of times ; they would arrive about six , or a little after ; it would still be plenty light enough ; they would see the white cloth which I should tie around my right arm , and I would take command .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 14]: We would surround that prison and have the king out in no time .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 31]: It would be showy and picturesque enough , all things considered , though I would have preferred noonday , on account of the more theatrical aspect the thing would have .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 35]: Now , then , in order to increase the strings to my bow , I thought I would look up some of those people whom I had formerly recognized , and make myself known .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 13]: That would help us out of our scrape , without the knights .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 13]: But I must proceed cautiously , for it was a risky business .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 19]: I must get into sumptuous raiment , and it would n't do to run and jump into it .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 49]: No , I must work up to it by degrees , buying suit after suit of clothes , in shops wide apart , and getting a little finer article with each change , until I should finally reach silk and velvet , and be ready for my project .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 4]: So I started .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 8]: But the scheme fell through like scat !
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 21]: The first corner I turned , I came plump upon one of our slaves , snooping around with a watchman .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 20]: I coughed at the moment , and he gave me a sudden look that bit right into my marrow .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 11]: I judge he thought he had heard that cough before .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 25]: I turned immediately into a shop and worked along down the counter , pricing things and watching out of the corner of my eye .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 16]: Those people had stopped , and were talking together and looking in at the door .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 117]: I made up my mind to get out the back way , if there was a back way , and I asked the shopwoman if I could step out there and look for the escaped slave , who was believed to be in hiding back there somewhere , and said I was an officer in disguise , and my pard was yonder at the door with one of the murderers in charge , and would she be good enough to step there and tell him he need n't wait , but had better go at once to the further end of the back alley and be ready to head him off when I rousted him out .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 23]: She was blazing with eagerness to see one of those already celebrated murderers , and she started on the errand at once .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 29]: I slipped out the back way , locked the door behind me , put the key in my pocket and started off , chuckling to myself and comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 14]: Well , I had gone and spoiled it again , made another mistake .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 7]: A double one , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 38]: There were plenty of ways to get rid of that officer by some simple and plausible device , but no , I must pick out a picturesque one ; it is the crying defect of my character .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 54]: And then , I had ordered my procedure upon what the officer , being human , would _ naturally _ do ; whereas when you are least expecting it , a man will now and then go and do the very thing which it 's _ not _ natural for him to do .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 90]: The natural thing for the officer to do , in this case , was to follow straight on my heels ; he would find a stout oaken door , securely locked , between him and me ; before he could break it down , I should be far away and engaged in slipping into a succession of baffling disguises which would soon get me into a sort of raiment which was a surer protection from meddling law-dogs in Britain than any amount of mere innocence and purity of character .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 21]: But instead of doing the natural thing , the officer took me at my word , and followed my instructions .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 34]: And so , as I came trotting out of that cul de sac , full of satisfaction with my own cleverness , he turned the corner and I walked right into his handcuffs .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 27]: If I had known it was a cul de sac -- however , there is n't any excusing a blunder like that , let it go .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 8]: Charge it up to profit and loss .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 40]: Of course , I was indignant , and swore I had just come ashore from a long voyage , and all that sort of thing -- just to see , you know , if it would deceive that slave .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 5]: But it did n't .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 4]: He knew me .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 8]: Then I reproached him for betraying me .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 7]: He was more surprised than hurt .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 42]: He stretched his eyes wide , and said : `` What , wouldst have me let thee , of all men , escape and not hang with us , when thou ` rt the very _ cause _ of our hanging ?
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 4]: Go to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 15]: `` Go to '' was their way of saying `` I should smile ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 7]: or `` I like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 6]: Queer talkers , those people .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 23]: Well , there was a sort of bastard justice in his view of the case , and so I dropped the matter .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 17]: When you ca n't cure a disaster by argument , what is the use to argue ?
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 6]: It is n't my way .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 14]: So I only said : `` You 're not going to be hanged .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 6]: None of us are . ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 20]: Both men laughed , and the slave said : `` Ye have not ranked as a fool -- before .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 17]: You might better keep your reputation , seeing the strain would not be for long . ''
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 9]: `` It will stand it , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 20]: Before to-morrow we shall be out of prison , and free to go where we will , besides . ''
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 34]: The witty officer lifted at his left ear with his thumb , made a rasping noise in his throat , and said : `` Out of prison -- yes -- ye say true .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 24]: And free likewise to go where ye will , so ye wander not out of his grace the Devil 's sultry realm . ''
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 29]: I kept my temper , and said , indifferently : `` Now I suppose you really think we are going to hang within a day or two . ''
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 19]: `` I thought it not many minutes ago , for so the thing was decided and proclaimed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 15]: `` Ah , then you 've changed your mind , is that it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 4]: `` Even that .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 16]: I only _ thought _ , then ; I _ know _ , now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 31]: I felt sarcastical , so I said : `` Oh , sapient servant of the law , condescend to tell us , then , what you _ know _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 14]: `` That ye will all be hanged _ to-day _ , at mid-afternoon !
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 2]: Oho !
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 5]: that shot hit home !
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 5]: Lean upon me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 11]: The fact is I did need to lean upon somebody .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 8]: My knights could n't arrive in time .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 11]: They would be as much as three hours too late .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 19]: Nothing in the world could save the King of England ; nor me , which was more important .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 25]: More important , not merely to me , but to the nation -- the only nation on earth standing ready to blossom into civilization .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 4]: I was sick .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 12]: I said no more , there was n't anything to say .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 27]: I knew what the man meant ; that if the missing slave was found , the postponement would be revoked , the execution take place to-day .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 8]: Well , the missing slave was found .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 15]: CHAPTER XXXVIII SIR LAUNCELOT AND KNIGHTS TO THE RESCUE Nearing four in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 10]: The scene was just outside the walls of London .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 27]: A cool , comfortable , superb day , with a brilliant sun ; the kind of day to make one want to live , not die .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 20]: The multitude was prodigious and far-reaching ; and yet we fifteen poor devils had n't a friend in it .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 15]: There was something painful in that thought , look at it how you might .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 21]: There we sat , on our tall scaffold , the butt of the hate and mockery of all those enemies .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 8]: We were being made a holiday spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 26]: They had built a sort of grand stand for the nobility and gentry , and these were there in full force , with their ladies .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 8]: We recognized a good many of them .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 15]: The crowd got a brief and unexpected dash of diversion out of the king .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 55]: The moment we were freed of our bonds he sprang up , in his fantastic rags , with face bruised out of all recognition , and proclaimed himself Arthur , King of Britain , and denounced the awful penalties of treason upon every soul there present if hair of his sacred head were touched .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 16]: It startled and surprised him to hear them break into a vast roar of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 13]: It wounded his dignity , and he locked himself up in silence .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 32]: Then , although the crowd begged him to go on , and tried to provoke him to it by catcalls , jeers , and shouts of : `` Let him speak !
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 3]: The king !
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 3]: The king !
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 24]: his humble subjects hunger and thirst for words of wisdom out of the mouth of their master his Serene and Sacred Raggedness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 6]: But it went for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 17]: He put on all his majesty and sat under this rain of contempt and insult unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 8]: He certainly was great in his way .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 17]: Absently , I had taken off my white bandage and wound it about my right arm .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 11]: When the crowd noticed this , they began upon me .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 19]: They said : `` Doubtless this sailor-man is his minister -- observe his costly badge of office ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 42]: I let them go on until they got tired , and then I said : `` Yes , I am his minister , The Boss ; and to-morrow you will hear that from Camelot which -- '' I got no further .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 8]: They drowned me out with joyous derision .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 35]: But presently there was silence ; for the sheriffs of London , in their official robes , with their subordinates , began to make a stir which indicated that business was about to begin .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 26]: In the hush which followed , our crime was recited , the death warrant read , then everybody uncovered while a priest uttered a prayer .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 12]: Then a slave was blindfolded ; the hangman unslung his rope .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 51]: There lay the smooth road below us , we upon one side of it , the banked multitude wailing its other side -- a good clear road , and kept free by the police -- how good it would be to see my five hundred horsemen come tearing down it !
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 10]: But no , it was out of the possibilities .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 21]: I followed its receding thread out into the distance -- not a horseman on it , or sign of one .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 23]: There was a jerk , and the slave hung dangling ; dangling and hideously squirming , for his limbs were not tied .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 14]: A second rope was unslung , in a moment another slave was dangling .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 12]: In a minute a third slave was struggling in the air .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 4]: It was dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 18]: I turned away my head a moment , and when I turned back I missed the king !
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 5]: They were blindfolding him !
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 18]: I was paralyzed ; I could n't move , I was choking , my tongue was petrified .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 12]: They finished blindfolding him , they led him under the rope .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 9]: I could n't shake off that clinging impotence .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 42]: But when I saw them put the noose around his neck , then everything let go in me and I made a spring to the rescue -- and as I made it I shot one more glance abroad -- by George !
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 6]: here they came , a-tilting !
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 10]: -- five hundred mailed and belted knights on bicycles !
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 8]: The grandest sight that ever was seen .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 21]: Lord , how the plumes streamed , how the sun flamed and flashed from the endless procession of webby wheels !
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 40]: I waved my right arm as Launcelot swept in -- he recognized my rag -- I tore away noose and bandage , and shouted : `` On your knees , every rascal of you , and salute the king !
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 9]: Who fails shall sup in hell to-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 13]: I always use that high style when I 'm climaxing an effect .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 23]: Well , it was noble to see Launcelot and the boys swarm up onto that scaffold and heave sheriffs and such overboard .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 29]: And it was fine to see that astonished multitude go down on their knees and beg their lives of the king they had just been deriding and insulting .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 38]: And as he stood apart there , receiving this homage in rags , I thought to myself , well , really there is something peculiarly grand about the gait and bearing of a king , after all .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 5]: I was immensely satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 18]: Take the whole situation all around , it was one of the gaudiest effects I ever instigated .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 10]: And presently up comes Clarence , his own self !
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 20]: and winks , and says , very modernly : `` Good deal of a surprise , was n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 7]: I knew you 'd like it .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 23]: I 've had the boys practicing this long time , privately ; and just hungry for a chance to show off . ''
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 15]: CHAPTER XXXIX THE YANKEE 'S FIGHT WITH THE KNIGHTS Home again , at Camelot .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 23]: A morning or two later I found the paper , damp from the press , by my plate at the breakfast table .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 19]: I turned to the advertising columns , knowing I should find something of personal interest to me there .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 9]: It was this : DE PAR LE ROI .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 68]: Know that the great lord and illus - trious Kni8ht , SIR SAGRAMOR LE DESIROUS having condescended to meet the King 's Minister , Hank Mor - gan , the which is surnamed The Boss , for satisfgction of offence anciently given , these wilL engage in the lists by Camelot about the fourth hour of the morning of the sixteenth day of this next succeeding month .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 23]: The battle will be a l outrance , sith the said offence was of a deadly sort , admitting of no comPosition .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 51]: DE PAR LE ROI Clarence 's editorial reference to this affair was to this effect : It will be observed , by a gl7nce at our advertising columns , that the commu - nity is to be favored with a treat of un - usual interest in the tournament line .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 12]: The n ames of the artists are warrant of good enterTemment .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 42]: The box-office will be open at noon of the 13th ; ad - mission 3 cents , reserved seatsh 5 ; pro- ceeds to go to the hospital fund The royal pair and all the Court will be pres - ent .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 20]: With these exceptions , and the press and the clergy , the free list is strict - ly susPended .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 21]: Parties are hereby warn - ed against buying tickets of speculators ; they will not be good at the door .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 27]: Everybody knows and likes The Boss , everybody knows and likes Sir Sag. ; come , let us give the lads a good send - off .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 83]: ReMember , the proceeds go to a great and free charity , and one whose broad begevolence stretches out its help - ing hand , warm with the blood of a lov - ing heart , to all that suffer , regardless of race , creed , condition or color -- the only charity yet established in the earth which has no politico-religious stop - cock on its compassion , but says Here flows the stream , let ALL come and drink !
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 6]: Turn out , all hands !
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 13]: fetch along your dou3hnuts and your gum-drops and have a good time .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 28]: Pie for sale on the grounds , and rocks to crack it with ; and ciRcus-lemonade -- three drops of lime juice to a barrel of water .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 2]: N.B. .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 24]: This is the first tournament under the new law , whidh allow each combatant to use any weapon he may pre - fer .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 10]: You may want to make a note of that .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 19]: Up to the day set , there was no talk in all Britain of anything but this combat .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 16]: All other topics sank into insignificance and passed out of men 's thoughts and interest .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 59]: It was not because a tournament was a great matter , it was not because Sir Sagramor had found the Holy Grail , for he had not , but had failed ; it was not because the second -LRB- official -RRB- personage in the kingdom was one of the duellists ; no , all these features were commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 16]: Yet there was abundant reason for the extraordinary interest which this coming fight was creating .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 69]: It was born of the fact that all the nation knew that this was not to be a duel between mere men , so to speak , but a duel between two mighty magicians ; a duel not of muscle but of mind , not of human skill but of superhuman art and craft ; a final struggle for supremacy between the two master enchanters of the age .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 44]: It was realized that the most prodigious achievements of the most renowned knights could not be worthy of comparison with a spectacle like this ; they could be but child 's play , contrasted with this mysterious and awful battle of the gods .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 29]: Yes , all the world knew it was going to be in reality a duel between Merlin and me , a measuring of his magic powers against mine .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 61]: It was known that Merlin had been busy whole days and nights together , imbuing Sir Sagramor 's arms and armor with supernal powers of offense and defense , and that he had procured for him from the spirits of the air a fleecy veil which would render the wearer invisible to his antagonist while still visible to other men .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 24]: Against Sir Sagramor , so weaponed and protected , a thousand knights could accomplish nothing ; against him no known enchantments could prevail .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 17]: These facts were sure ; regarding them there was no doubt , no reason for doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 40]: There was but one question : might there be still other enchantments , _ unknown _ to Merlin , which could render Sir Sagramor 's veil transparent to me , and make his enchanted mail vulnerable to my weapons ?
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 12]: This was the one thing to be decided in the lists .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 9]: Until then the world must remain in suspense .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 31]: So the world thought there was a vast matter at stake here , and the world was right , but it was not the one they had in their minds .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 21]: No , a far vaster one was upon the cast of this die : _ the life of knight-errantry _ .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 30]: I was a champion , it was true , but not the champion of the frivolous black arts , I was the champion of hard unsentimental common-sense and reason .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 14]: I was entering the lists to either destroy knight-errantry or be its victim .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 28]: Vast as the show-grounds were , there were no vacant spaces in them outside of the lists , at ten o'clock on the morning of the 16th .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 79]: The mammoth grand-stand was clothed in flags , streamers , and rich tapestries , and packed with several acres of small-fry tributary kings , their suites , and the British aristocracy ; with our own royal gang in the chief place , and each and every individual a flashing prism of gaudy silks and velvets -- well , I never saw anything to begin with it but a fight between an Upper Mississippi sunset and the aurora borealis .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 37]: The huge camp of beflagged and gay-colored tents at one end of the lists , with a stiff-standing sentinel at every door and a shining shield hanging by him for challenge , was another fine sight .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 36]: You see , every knight was there who had any ambition or any caste feeling ; for my feeling toward their order was not much of a secret , and so here was their chance .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 28]: If I won my fight with Sir Sagramor , others would have the right to call me out as long as I might be willing to respond .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 20]: Down at our end there were but two tents ; one for me , and another for my servants .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 33]: At the appointed hour the king made a sign , and the heralds , in their tabards , appeared and made proclamation , naming the combatants and stating the cause of quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 20]: There was a pause , then a ringing bugle-blast , which was the signal for us to come forth .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 16]: All the multitude caught their breath , and an eager curiosity flashed into every face .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 64]: Out from his tent rode great Sir Sagramor , an imposing tower of iron , stately and rigid , his huge spear standing upright in its socket and grasped in his strong hand , his grand horse 's face and breast cased in steel , his body clothed in rich trappings that almost dragged the ground -- oh , a most noble picture .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 11]: A great shout went up , of welcome and admiration .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 6]: And then out I came .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 8]: But I did n't get any shout .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 34]: There was a wondering and eloquent silence for a moment , then a great wave of laughter began to sweep along that human sea , but a warning bugle-blast cut its career short .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 29]: I was in the simplest and comfortablest of gymnast costumes -- flesh-colored tights from neck to heel , with blue silk puffings about my loins , and bareheaded .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 26]: My horse was not above medium size , but he was alert , slender-limbed , muscled with watchsprings , and just a greyhound to go .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 25]: He was a beauty , glossy as silk , and naked as he was when he was born , except for bridle and ranger-saddle .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 25]: The iron tower and the gorgeous bedquilt came cumbrously but gracefully pirouetting down the lists , and we tripped lightly up to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 34]: We halted ; the tower saluted , I responded ; then we wheeled and rode side by side to the grand-stand and faced our king and queen , to whom we made obeisance .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 47]: The queen exclaimed : `` Alack , Sir Boss , wilt fight naked , and without lance or sword or -- '' But the king checked her and made her understand , with a polite phrase or two , that this was none of her business .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 21]: The bugles rang again ; and we separated and rode to the ends of the lists , and took position .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 98]: Now old Merlin stepped into view and cast a dainty web of gossamer threads over Sir Sagramor which turned him into Hamlet 's ghost ; the king made a sign , the bugles blew , Sir Sagramor laid his great lance in rest , and the next moment here he came thundering down the course with his veil flying out behind , and I went whistling through the air like an arrow to meet him -- cocking my ear the while , as if noting the invisible knight 's position and progress by hearing , not sight .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 32]: A chorus of encouraging shouts burst out for him , and one brave voice flung out a heartening word for me -- said : `` Go it , slim Jim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 21]: It was an even bet that Clarence had procured that favor for me -- and furnished the language , too .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 34]: When that formidable lance-point was within a yard and a half of my breast I twitched my horse aside without an effort , and the big knight swept by , scoring a blank .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 8]: I got plenty of applause that time .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 12]: We turned , braced up , and down we came again .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 13]: Another blank for the knight , a roar of applause for me .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 39]: This same thing was repeated once more ; and it fetched such a whirlwind of applause that Sir Sagramor lost his temper , and at once changed his tactics and set himself the task of chasing me down .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 55]: Why , he had n't any show in the world at that ; it was a game of tag , with all the advantage on my side ; I whirled out of his path with ease whenever I chose , and once I slapped him on the back as I went to the rear .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 48]: Finally I took the chase into my own hands ; and after that , turn , or twist , or do what he would , he was never able to get behind me again ; he found himself always in front at the end of his maneuver .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 15]: So he gave up that business and retired to his end of the lists .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 22]: His temper was clear gone now , and he forgot himself and flung an insult at me which disposed of mine .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 20]: I slipped my lasso from the horn of my saddle , and grasped the coil in my right hand .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 9]: This time you should have seen him come !
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 19]: -- it was a business trip , sure ; by his gait there was blood in his eye .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 84]: I was sitting my horse at ease , and swinging the great loop of my lasso in wide circles about my head ; the moment he was under way , I started for him ; when the space between us had narrowed to forty feet , I sent the snaky spirals of the rope a-cleaving through the air , then darted aside and faced about and brought my trained animal to a halt with all his feet braced under him for a surge .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 16]: The next moment the rope sprang taut and yanked Sir Sagramor out of the saddle !
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 9]: Great Scott , but there was a sensation !
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 11]: Unquestionably , the popular thing in this world is novelty .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 23]: These people had never seen anything of that cowboy business before , and it carried them clear off their feet with delight .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 14]: From all around and everywhere , the shout went up : `` Encore !
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 3]: encore ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 40]: I wondered where they got the word , but there was no time to cipher on philological matters , because the whole knight-errantry hive was just humming now , and my prospect for trade could n't have been better .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 36]: The moment my lasso was released and Sir Sagramor had been assisted to his tent , I hauled in the slack , took my station and began to swing my loop around my head again .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 34]: I was sure to have use for it as soon as they could elect a successor for Sir Sagramor , and that could n't take long where there were so many hungry candidates .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 13]: Indeed , they elected one straight off -- Sir Hervis de Revel .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 4]: _ Bzz _ !
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 37]: Here he came , like a house afire ; I dodged : he passed like a flash , with my horse-hair coils settling around his neck ; a second or so later , _ fst _ !
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 5]: his saddle was empty .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 15]: I got another encore ; and another , and another , and still another .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 24]: When I had snaked five men out , things began to look serious to the ironclads , and they stopped and consulted together .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 22]: As a result , they decided that it was time to waive etiquette and send their greatest and best against me .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 21]: To the astonishment of that little world , I lassoed Sir Lamorak de Galis , and after him Sir Galahad .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 38]: So you see there was simply nothing to be done now , but play their right bower -- bring out the superbest of the superb , the mightiest of the mighty , the great Sir Launcelot himself !
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 6]: A proud moment for me ?
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 5]: I should think so .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 99]: Yonder was Arthur , King of Britain ; yonder was Guenever ; yes , and whole tribes of little provincial kings and kinglets ; and in the tented camp yonder , renowned knights from many lands ; and likewise the selectest body known to chivalry , the Knights of the Table Round , the most illustrious in Christendom ; and biggest fact of all , the very sun of their shining system was yonder couching his lance , the focal point of forty thousand adoring eyes ; and all by myself , here was I laying for him .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 24]: Across my mind flitted the dear image of a certain hello-girl of West Hartford , and I wished she could see me now .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 72]: In that moment , down came the Invincible , with the rush of a whirlwind -- the courtly world rose to its feet and bent forward -- the fateful coils went circling through the air , and before you could wink I was towing Sir Launcelot across the field on his back , and kissing my hand to the storm of waving kerchiefs and the thunder-crash of applause that greeted me !
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 42]: Said I to myself , as I coiled my lariat and hung it on my saddle-horn , and sat there drunk with glory , `` The victory is perfect -- no other will venture against me -- knight-errantry is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 29]: Now imagine my astonishment -- and everybody else 's , too -- to hear the peculiar bugle-call which announces that another competitor is about to enter the lists !
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 14]: There was a mystery here ; I could n't account for this thing .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 20]: Next , I noticed Merlin gliding away from me ; and then I noticed that my lasso was gone !
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 17]: The old sleight-of-hand expert had stolen it , sure , and slipped it under his robe .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 5]: The bugle blew again .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 21]: I looked , and down came Sagramor riding again , with his dust brushed off and his veil nicely re-arranged .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 21]: I trotted up to meet him , and pretended to find him by the sound of his horse 's hoofs .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 21]: He said : `` Thou ` rt quick of ear , but it will not save thee from this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 10]: and he touched the hilt of his great sword .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 43]: `` An ye are not able to see it , because of the influence of the veil , know that it is no cumbrous lance , but a sword -- and I ween ye will not be able to avoid it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 12]: His visor was up ; there was death in his smile .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 14]: I should never be able to dodge his sword , that was plain .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 8]: Somebody was going to die this time .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 14]: If he got the drop on me , I could name the corpse .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 10]: We rode forward together , and saluted the royalties .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 7]: This time the king was disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 11]: He said : `` Where is thy strange weapon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 8]: `` It is stolen , sire . ''
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 7]: `` Hast another at hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 12]: `` No , sire , I brought only the one . ''
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 20]: Then Merlin mixed in : `` He brought but the one because there was but the one to bring .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 8]: There exists none other but that one .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 12]: It belongeth to the king of the Demons of the Sea .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 38]: This man is a pretender , and ignorant , else he had known that that weapon can be used in but eight bouts only , and then it vanisheth away to its home under the sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 11]: `` Then is he weaponless , '' said the king .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 13]: `` Sir Sagramore , ye will grant him leave to borrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 7]: `` And I will lend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 7]: said Sir Launcelot , limping up .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 24]: `` He is as brave a knight of his hands as any that be on live , and he shall have mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 24]: He put his hand on his sword to draw it , but Sir Sagramor said : `` Stay , it may not be .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 19]: He shall fight with his own weapons ; it was his privilege to choose them and bring them .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 12]: If he has erred , on his head be it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 4]: `` Knight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 4]: said the king .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 13]: `` Thou ` rt overwrought with passion ; it disorders thy mind .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 7]: Wouldst kill a naked man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 18]: `` An he do it , he shall answer it to me , '' said Sir Launcelot .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 12]: `` I will answer it to any he that desireth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 5]: retorted Sir Sagramor hotly .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 26]: Merlin broke in , rubbing his hands and smiling his lowdownest smile of malicious gratification : '' 'T is well said , right well said !
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 18]: And 't is enough of parleying , let my lord the king deliver the battle signal . ''
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 6]: The king had to yield .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 15]: The bugle made proclamation , and we turned apart and rode to our stations .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 21]: There we stood , a hundred yards apart , facing each other , rigid and motionless , like horsed statues .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 23]: And so we remained , in a soundless hush , as much as a full minute , everybody gazing , nobody stirring .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 15]: It seemed as if the king could not take heart to give the signal .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 38]: But at last he lifted his hand , the clear note of the bugle followed , Sir Sagramor 's long blade described a flashing curve in the air , and it was superb to see him come .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 4]: I sat still .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 4]: On he came .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 5]: I did not move .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 15]: People got so excited that they shouted to me : `` Fly , fly !
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 3]: Save thyself !
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 5]: This is murther ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 55]: I never budged so much as an inch till that thundering apparition had got within fifteen paces of me ; then I snatched a dragoon revolver out of my holster , there was a flash and a roar , and the revolver was back in the holster before anybody could tell what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 17]: Here was a riderless horse plunging by , and yonder lay Sir Sagramor , stone dead .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 39]: The people that ran to him were stricken dumb to find that the life was actually gone out of the man and no reason for it visible , no hurt upon his body , nothing like a wound .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 48]: There was a hole through the breast of his chain-mail , but they attached no importance to a little thing like that ; and as a bullet wound there produces but little blood , none came in sight because of the clothing and swaddlings under the armor .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 17]: The body was dragged over to let the king and the swells look down upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 7]: They were stupefied with astonishment naturally .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 10]: I was requested to come and explain the miracle .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 52]: But I remained in my tracks , like a statue , and said : `` If it is a command , I will come , but my lord the king knows that I am where the laws of combat require me to remain while any desire to come against me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 3]: I waited .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 3]: Nobody challenged .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 35]: Then I said : `` If there are any who doubt that this field is well and fairly won , I do not wait for them to challenge me , I challenge them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 18]: `` It is a gallant offer , '' said the king , `` and well beseems you .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 7]: Whom will you name first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 9]: `` I name none , I challenge all !
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 24]: Here I stand , and dare the chivalry of England to come against me -- not by individuals , but in mass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 6]: shouted a score of knights .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 7]: `` You have heard the challenge .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 16]: Take it , or I proclaim you recreant knights and vanquished , every one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 9]: It was a `` bluff '' you know .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 46]: At such a time it is sound judgment to put on a bold face and play your hand for a hundred times what it is worth ; forty-nine times out of fifty nobody dares to `` call , '' and you rake in the chips .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 11]: But just this once -- well , things looked squally !
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 32]: In just no time , five hundred knights were scrambling into their saddles , and before you could wink a widely scattering drove were under way and clattering down upon me .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 16]: I snatched both revolvers from the holsters and began to measure distances and calculate chances .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 2]: Bang !
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 4]: One saddle empty .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 2]: Bang !
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 3]: another one .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 9]: Bang -- bang , and I bagged two .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 15]: Well , it was nip and tuck with us , and I knew it .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 20]: If I spent the eleventh shot without convincing these people , the twelfth man would kill me , sure .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 31]: And so I never did feel so happy as I did when my ninth downed its man and I detected the wavering in the crowd which is premonitory of panic .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 11]: An instant lost now could knock out my last chance .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 7]: But I did n't lose it .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 26]: I raised both revolvers and pointed them -- the halted host stood their ground just about one good square moment , then broke and fled .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 5]: The day was mine .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 6]: Knight-errantry was a doomed institution .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 7]: The march of civilization was begun .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 5]: How did I feel ?
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 8]: Ah , you never could imagine it .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 4]: And Brer Merlin ?
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 6]: His stock was flat again .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 23]: Somehow , every time the magic of fol-de-rol tried conclusions with the magic of science , the magic of fol-de-rol got left .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 25]: CHAPTER XL THREE YEARS LATER When I broke the back of knight-errantry that time , I no longer felt obliged to work in secret .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 29]: So , the very next day I exposed my hidden schools , my mines , and my vast system of clandestine factories and workshops to an astonished world .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 17]: That is to say , I exposed the nineteenth century to the inspection of the sixth .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 15]: Well , it is always a good plan to follow up an advantage promptly .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 27]: The knights were temporarily down , but if I would keep them so I must just simply paralyze them -- nothing short of that would answer .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 35]: You see , I was `` bluffing '' that last time in the field ; it would be natural for them to work around to that conclusion , if I gave them a chance .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 13]: So I must not give them time ; and I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 35]: I renewed my challenge , engraved it on brass , posted it up where any priest could read it to them , and also kept it standing in the advertising columns of the paper .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 12]: I not only renewed it , but added to its proportions .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 30]: I said , name the day , and I would take fifty assistants and stand up _ against the massed chivalry of the whole earth and destroy it _ .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 7]: I was not bluffing this time .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 13]: I meant what I said ; I could do what I promised .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 13]: There was n't any way to misunderstand the language of that challenge .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 23]: Even the dullest of the chivalry perceived that this was a plain case of `` put up , or shut up . ''
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 8]: They were wise and did the latter .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 14]: In all the next three years they gave me no trouble worth mentioning .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 6]: Consider the three years sped .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 6]: Now look around on England .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 10]: A happy and prosperous country , and strangely altered .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 14]: Schools everywhere , and several colleges ; a number of pretty good newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 33]: Even authorship was taking a start ; Sir Dinadan the Humorist was first in the field , with a volume of gray-headed jokes which I had been familiar with during thirteen centuries .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 27]: If he had left out that old rancid one about the lecturer I would n't have said anything ; but I could n't stand that one .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 9]: I suppressed the book and hanged the author .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 19]: Slavery was dead and gone ; all men were equal before the law ; taxation had been equalized .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 34]: The telegraph , the telephone , the phonograph , the typewriter , the sewing-machine , and all the thousand willing and handy servants of steam and electricity were working their way into favor .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 37]: We had a steamboat or two on the Thames , we had steam warships , and the beginnings of a steam commercial marine ; I was getting ready to send out an expedition to discover America .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 22]: We were building several lines of railway , and our line from Camelot to London was already finished and in operation .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 20]: I was shrewd enough to make all offices connected with the passenger service places of high and distinguished honor .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 21]: My idea was to attract the chivalry and nobility , and make them useful and keep them out of mischief .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 14]: The plan worked very well , the competition for the places was hot .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 25]: The conductor of the 4.33 express was a duke ; there was n't a passenger conductor on the line below the degree of earl .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 49]: They were good men , every one , but they had two defects which I could n't cure , and so had to wink at : they would n't lay aside their armor , and they would `` knock down '' fare -- I mean rob the company .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 17]: There was hardly a knight in all the land who was n't in some useful employment .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 41]: They were going from end to end of the country in all manner of useful missionary capacities ; their penchant for wandering , and their experience in it , made them altogether the most effective spreaders of civilization we had .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 65]: They went clothed in steel and equipped with sword and lance and battle-axe , and if they could n't persuade a person to try a sewing-machine on the installment plan , or a melodeon , or a barbed-wire fence , or a prohibition journal , or any of the other thousand and one things they canvassed for , they removed him and passed on .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 5]: I was very happy .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 10]: Things were working steadily toward a secretly longed-for point .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 19]: You see , I had two schemes in my head which were the vastest of all my projects .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 96]: The one was to overthrow the Catholic Church and set up the Protestant faith on its ruins -- not as an Established Church , but a go-as-you-please one ; and the other project was to get a decree issued by and by , commanding that upon Arthur 's death unlimited suffrage should be introduced , and given to men and women alike -- at any rate to all men , wise or unwise , and to all mothers who at middle age should be found to know nearly as much as their sons at twenty-one .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 72]: Arthur was good for thirty years yet , he being about my own age -- that is to say , forty -- and I believed that in that time I could easily have the active part of the population of that day ready and eager for an event which should be the first of its kind in the history of the world -- a rounded and complete governmental revolution without bloodshed .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 7]: The result to be a republic .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 34]: Well , I may as well confess , though I do feel ashamed when I think of it : I was beginning to have a base hankering to be its first president myself .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 17]: Yes , there was more or less human nature in me ; I found that out .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 15]: Clarence was with me as concerned the revolution , but in a modified way .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 28]: His idea was a republic , without privileged orders , but with a hereditary royal family at the head of it instead of an elective chief magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 31]: He believed that no nation that had ever known the joy of worshiping a royal family could ever be robbed of it and not fade away and die of melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 7]: I urged that kings were dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 7]: He said , then have cats .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 14]: He was sure that a royal family of cats would answer every purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 112]: They would be as useful as any other royal family , they would know as much , they would have the same virtues and the same treacheries , the same disposition to get up shindies with other royal cats , they would be laughably vain and absurd and never know it , they would be wholly inexpensive ; finally , they would have as sound a divine right as any other royal house , and `` Tom VII , or Tom XI , or Tom XIV by the grace of God King , '' would sound as well as it would when applied to the ordinary royal tomcat with tights on .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 60]: `` And as a rule , '' said he , in his neat modern English , `` the character of these cats would be considerably above the character of the average king , and this would be an immense moral advantage to the nation , for the reason that a nation always models its morals after its monarch 's .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 78]: The worship of royalty being founded in unreason , these graceful and harmless cats would easily become as sacred as any other royalties , and indeed more so , because it would presently be noticed that they hanged nobody , beheaded nobody , imprisoned nobody , inflicted no cruelties or injustices of any sort , and so must be worthy of a deeper love and reverence than the customary human king , and would certainly get it .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 74]: The eyes of the whole harried world would soon be fixed upon this humane and gentle system , and royal butchers would presently begin to disappear ; their subjects would fill the vacancies with catlings from our own royal house ; we should become a factory ; we should supply the thrones of the world ; within forty years all Europe would be governed by cats , and we should furnish the cats .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 19]: The reign of universal peace would begin then , to end no more forever ... Me-e-e-yow-ow-ow-ow -- fzt !
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 4]: -- wow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 33]: Hang him , I supposed he was in earnest , and was beginning to be persuaded by him , until he exploded that cat-howl and startled me almost out of my clothes .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 8]: But he never could be in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 8]: He did n't know what it was .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 32]: He had pictured a distinct and perfectly rational and feasible improvement upon constitutional monarchy , but he was too feather-headed to know it , or care anything about it , either .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 38]: I was going to give him a scolding , but Sandy came flying in at that moment , wild with terror , and so choked with sobs that for a minute she could not get her voice .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 26]: I ran and took her in my arms , and lavished caresses upon her and said , beseechingly : `` Speak , darling , speak !
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 19]: Her head fell limp upon my bosom , and she gasped , almost inaudibly : `` HELLO-CENTRAL ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 4]: `` Quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 15]: I shouted to Clarence ; `` telephone the king 's homeopath to come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 29]: In two minutes I was kneeling by the child 's crib , and Sandy was dispatching servants here , there , and everywhere , all over the palace .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 13]: I took in the situation almost at a glance -- membranous croup !
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 12]: I bent down and whispered : `` Wake up , sweetheart !
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 3]: Hello-Central . ''
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 17]: She opened her soft eyes languidly , and made out to say : `` Papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 5]: That was a comfort .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 7]: She was far from dead yet .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 32]: I sent for preparations of sulphur , I rousted out the croup-kettle myself ; for I do n't sit down and wait for doctors when Sandy or the child is sick .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 14]: I knew how to nurse both of them , and had had experience .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 42]: This little chap had lived in my arms a good part of its small life , and often I could soothe away its troubles and get it to laugh through the tear-dews on its eye-lashes when even its mother could n't .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 66]: Sir Launcelot , in his richest armor , came striding along the great hall now on his way to the stock-board ; he was president of the stock-board , and occupied the Siege Perilous , which he had bought of Sir Galahad ; for the stock-board consisted of the Knights of the Round Table , and they used the Round Table for business purposes now .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 24]: Seats at it were worth -- well , you would never believe the figure , so it is no use to state it .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 36]: Sir Launcelot was a bear , and he had put up a corner in one of the new lines , and was just getting ready to squeeze the shorts to-day ; but what of that ?
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 64]: He was the same old Launcelot , and when he glanced in as he was passing the door and found out that his pet was sick , that was enough for him ; bulls and bears might fight it out their own way for all him , he would come right in here and stand by little Hello-Central for all he was worth .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 7]: And that was what he did .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 30]: He shied his helmet into the corner , and in half a minute he had a new wick in the alcohol lamp and was firing up on the croup-kettle .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 18]: By this time Sandy had built a blanket canopy over the crib , and everything was ready .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 44]: Sir Launcelot got up steam , he and I loaded up the kettle with unslaked lime and carbolic acid , with a touch of lactic acid added thereto , then filled the thing up with water and inserted the steam-spout under the canopy .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 20]: Everything was ship-shape now , and we sat down on either side of the crib to stand our watch .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 62]: Sandy was so grateful and so comforted that she charged a couple of church-wardens with willow-bark and sumach-tobacco for us , and told us to smoke as much as we pleased , it could n't get under the canopy , and she was used to smoke , being the first lady in the land who had ever seen a cloud blown .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 33]: Well , there could n't be a more contented or comfortable sight than Sir Launcelot in his noble armor sitting in gracious serenity at the end of a yard of snowy church-warden .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 22]: He was a beautiful man , a lovely man , and was just intended to make a wife and children happy .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 24]: But , of course Guenever -- however , it 's no use to cry over what 's done and ca n't be helped .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 80]: Well , he stood watch-and-watch with me , right straight through , for three days and nights , till the child was out of danger ; then he took her up in his great arms and kissed her , with his plumes falling about her golden head , then laid her softly in Sandy 's lap again and took his stately way down the vast hall , between the ranks of admiring men-at-arms and menials , and so disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 17]: And no instinct warned me that I should never look upon him again in this world !
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 10]: Lord , what a world of heart-break it is .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 22]: The doctors said we must take the child away , if we would coax her back to health and strength again .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 6]: And she must have sea-air .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 53]: So we took a man-of-war , and a suite of two hundred and sixty persons , and went cruising about , and after a fortnight of this we stepped ashore on the French coast , and the doctors thought it would be a good idea to make something of a stay there .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 18]: The little king of that region offered us his hospitalities , and we were glad to accept .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 47]: If he had had as many conveniences as he lacked , we should have been plenty comfortable enough ; even as it was , we made out very well , in his queer old castle , by the help of comforts and luxuries from the ship .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 19]: At the end of a month I sent the vessel home for fresh supplies , and for news .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 10]: We expected her back in three or four days .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 22]: She would bring me , along with other news , the result of a certain experiment which I had been starting .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 54]: It was a project of mine to replace the tournament with something which might furnish an escape for the extra steam of the chivalry , keep those bucks entertained and out of mischief , and at the same time preserve the best thing in them , which was their hardy spirit of emulation .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 27]: I had had a choice band of them in private training for some time , and the date was now arriving for their first public effort .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 5]: This experiment was baseball .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 31]: In order to give the thing vogue from the start , and place it out of the reach of criticism , I chose my nines by rank , not capacity .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 15]: There was n't a knight in either team who was n't a sceptered sovereign .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 17]: As for material of this sort , there was a glut of it always around Arthur .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 15]: You could n't throw a brick in any direction and not cripple a king .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 24]: Of course , I could n't get these people to leave off their armor ; they would n't do that when they bathed .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 27]: They consented to differentiate the armor so that a body could tell one team from the other , but that was the most they would do .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 22]: So , one of the teams wore chain-mail ulsters , and the other wore plate-armor made of my new Bessemer steel .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 14]: Their practice in the field was the most fantastic thing I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 42]: Being ball-proof , they never skipped out of the way , but stood still and took the result ; when a Bessemer was at the bat and a ball hit him , it would bound a hundred and fifty yards sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 28]: And when a man was running , and threw himself on his stomach to slide to his base , it was like an iron-clad coming into port .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 20]: At first I appointed men of no rank to act as umpires , but I had to discontinue that .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 11]: These people were no easier to please than other nines .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 29]: The umpire 's first decision was usually his last ; they broke him in two with a bat , and his friends toted him home on a shutter .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 18]: When it was noticed that no umpire ever survived a game , umpiring got to be unpopular .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 19]: So I was obliged to appoint somebody whose rank and lofty position under the government would protect him .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 13]: Here are the names of the nines : BESSEMERS ULSTERS KING ARTHUR .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 3]: EMPEROR LUCIUS .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 5]: KING LOT OF LOTHIAN .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 3]: KING LOGRIS .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 4]: KING OF NORTHGALIS .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 5]: KING MARHALT OF IRELAND .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 3]: KING MARSIL .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 3]: KING MORGANORE .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 5]: KING OF LITTLE BRITAIN .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 5]: KING MARK OF CORNWALL .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 3]: KING LABOR .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 5]: KING NENTRES OF GARLOT .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 5]: KING PELLAM OF LISTENGESE .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 5]: KING MELIODAS OF LIONES .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 3]: KING BAGDEMAGUS .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 5]: KING OF THE LAKE .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 5]: KING TOLLEME LA FEINTES .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 5]: THE SOWDAN OF SYRIA .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 4]: Umpire -- CLARENCE .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 25]: The first public game would certainly draw fifty thousand people ; and for solid fun would be worth going around the world to see .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 25]: Everything would be favorable ; it was balmy and beautiful spring weather now , and Nature was all tailored out in her new clothes .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 40]: CHAPTER XLI THE INTERDICT However , my attention was suddenly snatched from such matters ; our child began to lose ground again , and we had to go to sitting up with her , her case became so serious .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 25]: We could n't bear to allow anybody to help in this service , so we two stood watch-and-watch , day in and day out .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 22]: Ah , Sandy , what a right heart she had , how simple , and genuine , and good she was !
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 43]: She was a flawless wife and mother ; and yet I had married her for no other particular reasons , except that by the customs of chivalry she was my property until some knight should win her from me in the field .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 37]: She had hunted Britain over for me ; had found me at the hanging-bout outside of London , and had straightway resumed her old place at my side in the placidest way and as of right .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 22]: I was a New Englander , and in my opinion this sort of partnership would compromise her , sooner or later .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 17]: She could n't see how , but I cut argument short and we had a wedding .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 19]: Now I did n't know I was drawing a prize , yet that was what I did draw .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 20]: Within the twelvemonth I became her worshiper ; and ours was the dearest and perfectest comradeship that ever was .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 13]: People talk about beautiful friendships between two persons of the same sex .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 31]: What is the best of that sort , as compared with the friendship of man and wife , where the best impulses and highest ideals of both are the same ?
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 20]: There is no place for comparison between the two friendships ; the one is earthly , the other divine .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 35]: In my dreams , along at first , I still wandered thirteen centuries away , and my unsatisfied spirit went calling and harking all up and down the unreplying vacancies of a vanished world .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 16]: Many a time Sandy heard that imploring cry come from my lips in my sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 27]: With a grand magnanimity she saddled that cry of mine upon our child , conceiving it to be the name of some lost darling of mine .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 70]: It touched me to tears , and it also nearly knocked me off my feet , too , when she smiled up in my face for an earned reward , and played her quaint and pretty surprise upon me : `` The name of one who was dear to thee is here preserved , here made holy , and the music of it will abide alway in our ears .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 18]: Now thou ` lt kiss me , as knowing the name I have given the child . ''
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 11]: But I did n't know it , all the same .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 52]: I had n't an idea in the world ; but it would have been cruel to confess it and spoil her pretty game ; so I never let on , but said : `` Yes , I know , sweetheart -- how dear and good it is of you , too !
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 27]: But I want to hear these lips of yours , which are also mine , utter it first -- then its music will be perfect . ''
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 12]: Pleased to the marrow , she murmured : `` HELLO-CENTRAL ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 35]: I did n't laugh -- I am always thankful for that -- but the strain ruptured every cartilage in me , and for weeks afterward I could hear my bones clack when I walked .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 7]: She never found out her mistake .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 61]: The first time she heard that form of salute used at the telephone she was surprised , and not pleased ; but I told her I had given order for it : that henceforth and forever the telephone must always be invoked with that reverent formality , in perpetual honor and remembrance of my lost friend and her small namesake .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 5]: This was not true .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 4]: But it answered .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 30]: Well , during two weeks and a half we watched by the crib , and in our deep solicitude we were unconscious of any world outside of that sick-room .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 18]: Then our reward came : the center of the universe turned the corner and began to mend .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 2]: Grateful ?
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 6]: It is n't the term .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 10]: There _ is n't _ any term for it .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 43]: You know that yourself , if you 've watched your child through the Valley of the Shadow and seen it come back to life and sweep night out of the earth with one all-illuminating smile that you could cover with your hand .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 12]: Why , we were back in this world in one instant !
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 30]: Then we looked the same startled thought into each other 's eyes at the same moment ; more than two weeks gone , and that ship not back yet !
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 12]: In another minute I appeared in the presence of my train .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 16]: They had been steeped in troubled bodings all this time -- their faces showed it .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 16]: I called an escort and we galloped five miles to a hilltop overlooking the sea .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 21]: Where was my great commerce that so lately had made these glistening expanses populous and beautiful with its white-winged flocks ?
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 5]: Vanished , every one !
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 30]: Not a sail , from verge to verge , not a smoke-bank -- just a dead and empty solitude , in place of all that brisk and breezy life .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 12]: I went swiftly back , saying not a word to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 7]: I told Sandy this ghastly news .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 11]: We could imagine no explanation that would begin to explain .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 6]: Had there been an invasion ?
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 3]: an earthquake ?
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 3]: a pestilence ?
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 9]: Had the nation been swept out of existence ?
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 5]: But guessing was profitless .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 7]: I must go -- at once .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 23]: I borrowed the king 's navy -- a `` ship '' no bigger than a steam launch -- and was soon ready .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 11]: The parting -- ah , yes , that was hard .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 19]: As I was devouring the child with last kisses , it brisked up and jabbered out its vocabulary !
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 19]: -- the first time in more than two weeks , and it made fools of us for joy .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 6]: The darling mispronunciations of childhood !
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 36]: -- dear me , there 's no music that can touch it ; and how one grieves when it wastes away and dissolves into correctness , knowing it will never visit his bereaved ear again .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 18]: Well , how good it was to be able to carry that gracious memory away with me !
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 18]: I approached England the next morning , with the wide highway of salt water all to myself .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 28]: There were ships in the harbor , at Dover , but they were naked as to sails , and there was no sign of life about them .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 36]: It was Sunday ; yet at Canterbury the streets were empty ; strangest of all , there was not even a priest in sight , and no stroke of a bell fell upon my ear .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 7]: The mournfulness of death was everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 6]: I could n't understand it .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 86]: At last , in the further edge of that town I saw a small funeral procession -- just a family and a few friends following a coffin -- no priest ; a funeral without bell , book , or candle ; there was a church there close at hand , but they passed it by weeping , and did not enter it ; I glanced up at the belfry , and there hung the bell , shrouded in black , and its tongue tied back .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 4]: Now I knew !
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 11]: Now I understood the stupendous calamity that had overtaken England .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 2]: Invasion ?
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 7]: Invasion is a triviality to it .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 5]: It was the INTERDICT !
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 13]: I asked no questions ; I did n't need to ask any .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 22]: The Church had struck ; the thing for me to do was to get into a disguise , and go warily .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 41]: One of my servants gave me a suit of clothes , and when we were safe beyond the town I put them on , and from that time I traveled alone ; I could not risk the embarrassment of company .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 4]: A miserable journey .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 5]: A desolate silence everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 5]: Even in London itself .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 44]: Traffic had ceased ; men did not talk or laugh , or go in groups , or even in couples ; they moved aimlessly about , each man by himself , with his head down , and woe and terror at his heart .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 6]: The Tower showed recent war-scars .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 7]: Verily , much had been happening .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 12]: Of course , I meant to take the train for Camelot .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 2]: Train !
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 11]: Why , the station was as vacant as a cavern .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 4]: I moved on .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 14]: The journey to Camelot was a repetition of what I had already seen .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 13]: The Monday and the Tuesday differed in no way from the Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 7]: I arrived far in the night .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 101]: From being the best electric-lighted town in the kingdom and the most like a recumbent sun of anything you ever saw , it was become simply a blot -- a blot upon darkness -- that is to say , it was darker and solider than the rest of the darkness , and so you could see it a little better ; it made me feel as if maybe it was symbolical -- a sort of sign that the Church was going to _ keep _ the upper hand now , and snuff out all my beautiful civilization just like that .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 10]: I found no life stirring in the somber streets .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 9]: I groped my way with a heavy heart .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 16]: The vast castle loomed black upon the hilltop , not a spark visible about it .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 38]: The drawbridge was down , the great gate stood wide , I entered without challenge , my own heels making the only sound I heard -- and it was sepulchral enough , in those huge vacant courts .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 4]: CHAPTER XLII WAR !
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 40]: I found Clarence alone in his quarters , drowned in melancholy ; and in place of the electric light , he had reinstituted the ancient rag-lamp , and sat there in a grisly twilight with all curtains drawn tight .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 29]: He sprang up and rushed for me eagerly , saying : `` Oh , it 's worth a billion milrays to look upon a live person again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 15]: He knew me as easily as if I had n't been disguised at all .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 10]: Which frightened me ; one may easily believe that .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 18]: `` Quick , now , tell me the meaning of this fearful disaster , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 8]: `` How did it come about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 28]: `` Well , if there had n't been any Queen Guenever , it would n't have come so early ; but it would have come , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 26]: It would have come on your own account by and by ; by luck , it happened to come on the queen 's . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 8]: _ And _ Sir Launcelot 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 5]: `` Just so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 7]: `` Give me the details . ''
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 45]: `` I reckon you will grant that during some years there has been only one pair of eyes in these kingdoms that has not been looking steadily askance at the queen and Sir Launcelot -- '' `` Yes , King Arthur 's . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 32]: -- and only one heart that was without suspicion -- '' `` Yes -- the king 's ; a heart that is n't capable of thinking evil of a friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 33]: `` Well , the king might have gone on , still happy and unsuspecting , to the end of his days , but for one of your modern improvements -- the stock-board .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 30]: When you left , three miles of the London , Canterbury and Dover were ready for the rails , and also ready and ripe for manipulation in the stock-market .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 9]: It was wildcat , and everybody knew it .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 9]: The stock was for sale at a give-away .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 51]: What does Sir Launcelot do , but -- '' `` Yes , I know ; he quietly picked up nearly all of it for a song ; then he bought about twice as much more , deliverable upon call ; and he was about to call when I left . ''
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 8]: `` Very well , he did call .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 6]: The boys could n't deliver .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 16]: Oh , he had them -- and he just settled his grip and squeezed them .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 27]: They were laughing in their sleeves over their smartness in selling stock to him at 15 and 16 and along there that was n't worth 10 .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 28]: Well , when they had laughed long enough on that side of their mouths , they rested-up that side by shifting the laugh to the other side .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 12]: That was when they compromised with the Invincible at 283 ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 5]: `` Good land ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 18]: `` He skinned them alive , and they deserved it -- anyway , the whole kingdom rejoiced .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 17]: Well , among the flayed were Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred , nephews to the king .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 6]: End of the first act .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 24]: Act second , scene first , an apartment in Carlisle castle , where the court had gone for a few days ' hunting .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 12]: Persons present , the whole tribe of the king 's nephews .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 17]: Mordred and Agravaine propose to call the guileless Arthur 's attention to Guenever and Sir Launcelot .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 17]: Sir Gawaine , Sir Gareth , and Sir Gaheris will have nothing to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 17]: A dispute ensues , with loud talk ; in the midst of it enter the king .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 10]: Mordred and Agravaine spring their devastating tale upon him .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 4]: _ Tableau _ .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 20]: A trap is laid for Launcelot , by the king 's command , and Sir Launcelot walks into it .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 53]: He made it sufficiently uncomfortable for the ambushed witnesses -- to wit , Mordred , Agravaine , and twelve knights of lesser rank , for he killed every one of them but Mordred ; but of course that could n't straighten matters between Launcelot and the king , and did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 15]: `` Oh , dear , only one thing could result -- I see that .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 22]: War , and the knights of the realm divided into a king 's party and a Sir Launcelot 's party . ''
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 10]: `` Yes -- that was the way of it .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 16]: The king sent the queen to the stake , proposing to purify her with fire .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 68]: Launcelot and his knights rescued her , and in doing it slew certain good old friends of yours and mine -- in fact , some of the best we ever had ; to wit , Sir Belias le Orgulous , Sir Segwarides , Sir Griflet le Fils de Dieu , Sir Brandiles , Sir Aglovale -- '' `` Oh , you tear out my heartstrings . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 29]: -- wait , I 'm not done yet -- Sir Tor , Sir Gauter , Sir Gillimer -- '' `` The very best man in my subordinate nine .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 9]: What a handy right-fielder he was ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 24]: -- Sir Reynold 's three brothers , Sir Damus , Sir Priamus , Sir Kay the Stranger -- '' `` My peerless short-stop !
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 11]: I 've seen him catch a daisy-cutter in his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 10]: Come , I ca n't stand this ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 24]: -- Sir Driant , Sir Lambegus , Sir Herminde , Sir Pertilope , Sir Perimones , and -- whom do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 3]: `` Rush !
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 4]: Go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 11]: `` Sir Gaheris , and Sir Gareth -- both ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 5]: `` Oh , incredible !
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 8]: Their love for Launcelot was indestructible . ''
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 8]: `` Well , it was an accident .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 20]: They were simply onlookers ; they were unarmed , and were merely there to witness the queen 's punishment .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 24]: Sir Launcelot smote down whoever came in the way of his blind fury , and he killed these without noticing who they were .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 22]: Here is an instantaneous photograph one of our boys got of the battle ; it 's for sale on every news-stand .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 23]: There -- the figures nearest the queen are Sir Launcelot with his sword up , and Sir Gareth gasping his latest breath .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 15]: You can catch the agony in the queen 's face through the curling smoke .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 7]: It 's a rattling battle-picture . ''
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 6]: `` Indeed , it is .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 14]: We must take good care of it ; its historical value is incalculable .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 4]: Go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 16]: `` Well , the rest of the tale is just war , pure and simple .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 20]: Launcelot retreated to his town and castle of Joyous Gard , and gathered there a great following of knights .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 37]: The king , with a great host , went there , and there was desperate fighting during several days , and , as a result , all the plain around was paved with corpses and cast-iron .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 22]: Then the Church patched up a peace between Arthur and Launcelot and the queen and everybody -- everybody but Sir Gawaine .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 20]: He was bitter about the slaying of his brothers , Gareth and Gaheris , and would not be appeased .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 20]: He notified Launcelot to get him thence , and make swift preparation , and look to be soon attacked .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 29]: So Launcelot sailed to his Duchy of Guienne with his following , and Gawaine soon followed with an army , and he beguiled Arthur to go with him .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 25]: Arthur left the kingdom in Sir Mordred 's hands until you should return -- '' `` Ah -- a king 's customary wisdom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 14]: Sir Mordred set himself at once to work to make his kingship permanent .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 25]: He was going to marry Guenever , as a first move ; but she fled and shut herself up in the Tower of London .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 15]: Mordred attacked ; the Bishop of Canterbury dropped down on him with the Interdict .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 19]: The king returned ; Mordred fought him at Dover , at Canterbury , and again at Barham Down .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 10]: Then there was talk of peace and a composition .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 20]: Terms , Mordred to have Cornwall and Kent during Arthur 's life , and the whole kingdom afterward . ''
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 7]: `` Well , upon my word !
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 17]: My dream of a republic to _ be _ a dream , and so remain . ''
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 7]: The two armies lay near Salisbury .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 50]: Gawaine -- Gawaine 's head is at Dover Castle , he fell in the fight there -- Gawaine appeared to Arthur in a dream , at least his ghost did , and warned him to refrain from conflict for a month , let the delay cost what it might .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 8]: But battle was precipitated by an accident .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 27]: Arthur had given order that if a sword was raised during the consultation over the proposed treaty with Mordred , sound the trumpet and fall on !
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 8]: for he had no confidence in Mordred .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 12]: Mordred had given a similar order to _ his _ people .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 32]: Well , by and by an adder bit a knight 's heel ; the knight forgot all about the order , and made a slash at the adder with his sword .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 15]: Inside of half a minute those two prodigious hosts came together with a crash !
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 6]: They butchered away all day .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 20]: Then the king -- however , we have started something fresh since you left -- our paper has . ''
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 3]: `` No ?
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 5]: What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 5]: `` War correspondence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 8]: `` Why , that 's good . ''
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 26]: `` Yes , the paper was booming right along , for the Interdict made no impression , got no grip , while the war lasted .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 8]: I had war correspondents with both armies .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 68]: I will finish that battle by reading you what one of the boys says : ` Then the king looked about him , and then was he ware of all his host and of all his good knights were left no more on live but two knights , that was Sir Lucan de Butlere , and his brother Sir Bedivere : and they were full sore wounded .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 15]: Jesu mercy , said the king , where are all my noble knights becomen ?
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 10]: Alas that ever I should see this doleful day .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 13]: For now , said Arthur , I am come to mine end .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 21]: But would to God that I wist where were that traitor Sir Mordred , that hath caused all this mischief .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 20]: Then was King Arthur ware where Sir Mordred leaned upon his sword among a great heap of dead men .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 26]: Now give me my spear , said Arthur unto Sir Lucan , for yonder I have espied the traitor that all this woe hath wrought .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 32]: Sir , let him be , said Sir Lucan , for he is unhappy ; and if ye pass this unhappy day , ye shall be right well revenged upon him .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 34]: Good lord , remember ye of your night 's dream , and what the spirit of Sir Gawaine told you this night , yet God of his great goodness hath preserved you hitherto .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 15]: Therefore , for God 's sake , my lord , leave off by this .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 27]: For blessed be God ye have won the field : for here we be three on live , and with Sir Mordred is none on live .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 15]: And if ye leave off now , this wicked day of destiny is past .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 37]: Tide me death , betide me life , saith the king , now I see him yonder alone , he shall never escape mine hands , for at a better avail shall I never have him .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 9]: God speed you well , said Sir Bedivere .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 27]: Then the king gat his spear in both his hands , and ran toward Sir Mordred crying , Traitor , now is thy death day come .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 20]: And when Sir Mordred heard Sir Arthur , he ran until him with his sword drawn in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 25]: And then King Arthur smote Sir Mordred under the shield , with a foin of his spear throughout the body more than a fathom .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 34]: And when Sir Mordred felt that he had his death 's wound , he thrust himself , with the might that he had , up to the butt of King Arthur 's spear .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 45]: And right so he smote his father Arthur with his sword holden in both his hands , on the side of the head , that the sword pierced the helmet and the brain-pan , and therewithal Sir Mordred fell stark dead to the earth .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 39]: And the noble Arthur fell in a swoon to the earth , and there he swooned oft-times -- ' '' `` That is a good piece of war correspondence , Clarence ; you are a first-rate newspaper man .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 8]: Well -- is the king all right ?
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 6]: Did he get well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 6]: `` Poor soul , no .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 5]: He is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 20]: I was utterly stunned ; it had not seemed to me that any wound could be mortal to him .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 8]: `` And the queen , Clarence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 10]: `` She is a nun , in Almesbury . ''
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 4]: `` What changes !
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 7]: and in such a short while .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 4]: It is inconceivable .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 7]: What next , I wonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 9]: `` I can tell you what next . ''
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 10]: `` Stake our lives and stand by them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 9]: `` What do you mean by that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 7]: `` The Church is master now .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 18]: The Interdict included you with Mordred ; it is not to be removed while you remain alive .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 5]: The clans are gathering .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 28]: The Church has gathered all the knights that are left alive , and as soon as you are discovered we shall have business on our hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 3]: `` Stuff !
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 26]: With our deadly scientific war-material ; with our hosts of trained -- '' `` Save your breath -- we have n't sixty faithful left ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 6]: `` What are you saying ?
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 31]: Our schools , our colleges , our vast workshops , our -- '' `` When those knights come , those establishments will empty themselves and go over to the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 14]: Did you think you had educated the superstition out of those people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 8]: `` I certainly did think it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 10]: `` Well , then , you may unthink it .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 10]: They stood every strain easily -- until the Interdict .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 17]: Since then , they merely put on a bold outside -- at heart they are quaking .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 18]: Make up your mind to it -- when the armies come , the mask will fall . ''
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 6]: `` It 's hard news .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 4]: We are lost .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 10]: They will turn our own science against us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 7]: `` No they wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 14]: `` Because I and a handful of the faithful have blocked that game .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 16]: I 'll tell you what I 've done , and what moved me to it .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 10]: Smart as you are , the Church was smarter .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 17]: It was the Church that sent you cruising -- through her servants , the doctors . ''
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 4]: `` Clarence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 6]: `` It is the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 4]: I know it .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 22]: Every officer of your ship was the Church 's picked servant , and so was every man of the crew . ''
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 6]: `` Oh , come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 9]: `` It is just as I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 17]: I did not find out these things at once , but I found them out finally .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 38]: Did you send me verbal information , by the commander of the ship , to the effect that upon his return to you , with supplies , you were going to leave Cadiz -- '' `` Cadiz !
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 11]: I have n't been at Cadiz at all ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 19]: -- going to leave Cadiz and cruise in distant seas indefinitely , for the health of your family ?
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 8]: Did you send me that word ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 5]: `` Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 10]: I would have written , would n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 3]: `` Naturally .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 6]: I was troubled and suspicious .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 14]: When the commander sailed again I managed to ship a spy with him .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 10]: I have never heard of vessel or spy since .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 11]: I gave myself two weeks to hear from you in .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 10]: Then I resolved to send a ship to Cadiz .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 10]: There was a reason why I did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 6]: `` What was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 9]: `` Our navy had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared !
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 37]: Also , as suddenly and as mysteriously , the railway and telegraph and telephone service ceased , the men all deserted , poles were cut down , the Church laid a ban upon the electric light !
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 12]: I had to be up and doing -- and straight off .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 47]: Your life was safe -- nobody in these kingdoms but Merlin would venture to touch such a magician as you without ten thousand men at his back -- I had nothing to think of but how to put preparations in the best trim against your coming .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 16]: I felt safe myself -- nobody would be anxious to touch a pet of yours .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 7]: So this is what I did .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 36]: From our various works I selected all the men -- boys I mean -- whose faithfulness under whatsoever pressure I could swear to , and I called them together secretly and gave them their instructions .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 19]: There are fifty-two of them ; none younger than fourteen , and none above seventeen years old . ''
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 8]: `` Why did you select boys ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 17]: `` Because all the others were born in an atmosphere of superstition and reared in it .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 8]: It is in their blood and bones .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 25]: We imagined we had educated it out of them ; they thought so , too ; the Interdict woke them up like a thunderclap !
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 15]: It revealed them to themselves , and it revealed them to me , too .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 6]: With boys it was different .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 33]: Such as have been under our training from seven to ten years have had no acquaintance with the Church 's terrors , and it was among these that I found my fifty-two .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 50]: As a next move , I paid a private visit to that old cave of Merlin 's -- not the small one -- the big one -- '' `` Yes , the one where we secretly established our first great electric plant when I was projecting a miracle . ''
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 4]: `` Just so .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 24]: And as that miracle had n't become necessary then , I thought it might be a good idea to utilize the plant now .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 20]: I 've provisioned the cave for a siege -- '' `` A good idea , a first-rate idea . ''
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 5]: `` I think so .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 18]: I placed four of my boys there as a guard -- inside , and out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 25]: Nobody was to be hurt -- while outside ; but any attempt to enter -- well , we said just let anybody try it !
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 74]: Then I went out into the hills and uncovered and cut the secret wires which connected your bedroom with the wires that go to the dynamite deposits under all our vast factories , mills , workshops , magazines , etc. , and about midnight I and my boys turned out and connected that wire with the cave , and nobody but you and I suspects where the other end of it goes to .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 22]: We laid it under ground , of course , and it was all finished in a couple of hours or so .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 20]: We sha 'n' t have to leave our fortress now when we want to blow up our civilization . ''
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 22]: `` It was the right move -- and the natural one ; military necessity , in the changed condition of things .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 9]: Well , what changes _ have _ come !
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 21]: We expected to be besieged in the palace some time or other , but -- however , go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 10]: `` Next , we built a wire fence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 5]: `` Wire fence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 15]: You dropped the hint of it yourself , two or three years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 31]: `` Oh , I remember -- the time the Church tried her strength against us the first time , and presently thought it wise to wait for a hopefuler season .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 10]: Well , how have you arranged the fence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 42]: `` I start twelve immensely strong wires -- naked , not insulated -- from a big dynamo in the cave -- dynamo with no brushes except a positive and a negative one -- '' `` Yes , that 's right . ''
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 52]: `` The wires go out from the cave and fence in a circle of level ground a hundred yards in diameter ; they make twelve independent fences , ten feet apart -- that is to say , twelve circles within circles -- and their ends come into the cave again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 7]: `` Right ; go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 26]: `` The fences are fastened to heavy oaken posts only three feet apart , and these posts are sunk five feet in the ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 8]: `` That is good and strong . ''
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 10]: The wires have no ground-connection outside of the cave .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 38]: They go out from the positive brush of the dynamo ; there is a ground-connection through the negative brush ; the other ends of the wire return to the cave , and each is grounded independently . ''
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 11]: `` No , no , that wo n't do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 12]: `` It 's too expensive -- uses up force for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 14]: You do n't want any ground-connection except the one through the negative brush .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 24]: The other end of every wire must be brought back into the cave and fastened independently , and _ without _ any ground-connection .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 10]: Now , then , observe the economy of it .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 58]: A cavalry charge hurls itself against the fence ; you are using no power , you are spending no money , for there is only one ground-connection till those horses come against the wire ; the moment they touch it they form a connection with the negative brush _ through the ground _ , and drop dead .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 5]: Do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 40]: -- you are using no energy until it is needed ; your lightning is there , and ready , like the load in a gun ; but it is n't costing you a cent till you touch it off .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 13]: Oh , yes , the single ground-connection -- '' `` Of course !
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 9]: I do n't know how I overlooked that .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 30]: It 's not only cheaper , but it 's more effectual than the other way , for if wires break or get tangled , no harm is done . ''
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 18]: `` No , especially if we have a tell-tale in the cave and disconnect the broken wire .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 5]: Well , go on .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 4]: The gatlings ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 7]: `` Yes -- that 's arranged .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 33]: In the center of the inner circle , on a spacious platform six feet high , I 've grouped a battery of thirteen gatling guns , and provided plenty of ammunition . ''
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 5]: `` That 's it .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 20]: They command every approach , and when the Church 's knights arrive , there 's going to be music .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 23]: The brow of the precipice over the cave -- '' `` I 've got a wire fence there , and a gatling .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 11]: They wo n't drop any rocks down on us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 10]: `` Well , and the glass-cylinder dynamite torpedoes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 6]: `` That 's attended to .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 10]: It 's the prettiest garden that was ever planted .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 33]: It 's a belt forty feet wide , and goes around the outer fence -- distance between it and the fence one hundred yards -- kind of neutral ground that space is .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 18]: There is n't a single square yard of that whole belt but is equipped with a torpedo .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 19]: We laid them on the surface of the ground , and sprinkled a layer of sand over them .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 25]: It 's an innocent looking garden , but you let a man start in to hoe it once , and you 'll see . ''
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 7]: `` You tested the torpedoes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 15]: `` Well , I was going to , but -- '' `` But what ?
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 16]: Why , it 's an immense oversight not to apply a -- '' `` Test ?
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 29]: Yes , I know ; but they 're all right ; I laid a few in the public road beyond our lines and they 've been tested . ''
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 8]: `` Oh , that alters the case .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 5]: Who did it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 6]: `` A Church committee . ''
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 5]: `` How kind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 9]: They came to command us to make submission .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 19]: You see they did n't really come to test the torpedoes ; that was merely an incident . ''
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 9]: `` Did the committee make a report ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 7]: `` Yes , they made one .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 9]: You could have heard it a mile . ''
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 4]: `` Unanimous ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 8]: `` That was the nature of it .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 24]: After that I put up some signs , for the protection of future committees , and we have had no intruders since . ''
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 17]: `` Clarence , you 've done a world of work , and done it perfectly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 18]: `` We had plenty of time for it ; there was n't any occasion for hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 7]: We sat silent awhile , thinking .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 27]: Then my mind was made up , and I said : `` Yes , everything is ready ; everything is shipshape , no detail is wanting .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 8]: I know what to do now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 11]: `` So do I ; sit down and wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 7]: `` No , _ sir _ !
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 8]: rise up and _ strike _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 7]: `` Do you mean it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 5]: `` Yes , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 15]: The _ de_fensive is n't in my line , and the _ of_fensive is .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 19]: That is , when I hold a fair hand -- two-thirds as good a hand as the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 17]: Oh , yes , we 'll rise up and strike ; that 's our game . ''
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 9]: `` A hundred to one you are right .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 8]: When does the performance begin ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 3]: _ Now !
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 8]: _ We 'll proclaim the Republic . ''
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 14]: `` Well , that _ will _ precipitate things , sure enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 11]: `` It will make them buzz , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 29]: England will be a hornets ' nest before noon to-morrow , if the Church 's hand has n't lost its cunning -- and we know it has n't .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 19]: Now you write and I 'll dictate thus : `` PROCLAMATION -- `` BE IT KNOWN UNTO ALL .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 35]: Whereas the king having died and left no heir , it becomes my duty to continue the executive authority vested in me , until a government shall have been created and set in motion .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 10]: The monarchy has lapsed , it no longer exists .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 19]: By consequence , all political power has reverted to its original source , the people of the nation .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 49]: With the monarchy , its several adjuncts died also ; wherefore there is no longer a nobility , no longer a privileged class , no longer an Established Church ; all men are become exactly equal ; they are upon one common level , and religion is free .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 22]: _ A Republic is hereby proclaimed _ , as being the natural estate of a nation when other authority has ceased .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 28]: It is the duty of the British people to meet together immediately , and by their votes elect representatives and deliver into their hands the government . ''
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 16]: I signed it `` The Boss , '' and dated it from Merlin 's Cave .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 21]: Clarence said -- `` Why , that tells where we are , and invites them to call right away . ''
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 6]: `` That is the idea .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 15]: We _ strike _ -- by the Proclamation -- then it 's their innings .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 46]: Now have the thing set up and printed and posted , right off ; that is , give the order ; then , if you 've got a couple of bicycles handy at the foot of the hill , ho for Merlin 's Cave ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 9]: `` I shall be ready in ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 18]: What a cyclone there is going to be to-morrow when this piece of paper gets to work !
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 26]: ... It 's a pleasant old palace , this is ; I wonder if we shall ever again -- but never mind about that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 29]: CHAPTER XLIII THE BATTLE OF THE SAND BELT In Merlin 's Cave -- Clarence and I and fifty-two fresh , bright , well-educated , clean-minded young British boys .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 56]: At dawn I sent an order to the factories and to all our great works to stop operations and remove all life to a safe distance , as everything was going to be blown up by secret mines , '' _ and no telling at what moment -- therefore , vacate at once _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 12]: These people knew me , and had confidence in my word .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 23]: They would clear out without waiting to part their hair , and I could take my own time about dating the explosion .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 21]: You could n't hire one of them to go back during the century , if the explosion was still impending .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 7]: We had a week of waiting .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 15]: It was not dull for me , because I was writing all the time .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 31]: During the first three days , I finished turning my old diary into this narrative form ; it only required a chapter or so to bring it down to date .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 15]: The rest of the week I took up in writing letters to my wife .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 52]: It was always my habit to write to Sandy every day , whenever we were separate , and now I kept up the habit for love of it , and of her , though I could n't do anything with the letters , of course , after I had written them .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 52]: But it put in the time , you see , and was almost like talking ; it was almost as if I was saying , `` Sandy , if you and Hello-Central were here in the cave , instead of only your photographs , what good times we could have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 110]: And then , you know , I could imagine the baby goo-gooing something out in reply , with its fists in its mouth and itself stretched across its mother 's lap on its back , and she a-laughing and admiring and worshipping , and now and then tickling under the baby 's chin to set it cackling , and then maybe throwing in a word of answer to me herself -- and so on and so on -- well , do n't you know , I could sit there in the cave with my pen , and keep it up , that way , by the hour with them .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 12]: Why , it was almost like having us all together again .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 14]: I had spies out every night , of course , to get news .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 10]: Every report made things look more and more impressive .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 39]: The hosts were gathering , gathering ; down all the roads and paths of England the knights were riding , and priests rode with them , to hearten these original Crusaders , this being the Church 's war .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 18]: All the nobilities , big and little , were on their way , and all the gentry .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 7]: This was all as was expected .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 39]: We should thin out this sort of folk to such a degree that the people would have nothing to do but just step to the front with their republic and -- Ah , what a donkey I was !
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 44]: Toward the end of the week I began to get this large and disenchanting fact through my head : that the mass of the nation had swung their caps and shouted for the republic for about one day , and there an end !
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 24]: The Church , the nobles , and the gentry then turned one grand , all-disapproving frown upon them and shriveled them into sheep !
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 37]: From that moment the sheep had begun to gather to the fold -- that is to say , the camps -- and offer their valueless lives and their valuable wool to the `` righteous cause . ''
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 39]: Why , even the very men who had lately been slaves were in the `` righteous cause , '' and glorifying it , praying for it , sentimentally slabbering over it , just like all the other commoners .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 12]: Imagine such human muck as this ; conceive of this folly !
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 12]: Yes , it was now `` Death to the Republic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 7]: everywhere -- not a dissenting voice .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 7]: All England was marching against us !
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 11]: Truly , this was more than I had bargained for .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 50]: I watched my fifty-two boys narrowly ; watched their faces , their walk , their unconscious attitudes : for all these are a language -- a language given us purposely that it may betray us in times of emergency , when we have secrets which we want to keep .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 27]: I knew that that thought would keep saying itself over and over again in their minds and hearts , _ All England is marching against us !
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 53]: _ and ever more strenuously imploring attention with each repetition , ever more sharply realizing itself to their imaginations , until even in their sleep they would find no rest from it , but hear the vague and flitting creatures of the dreams say , _ All England _ -- ALL ENGLAND !
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 8]: -- _ is marching against you _ !
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 43]: I knew all this would happen ; I knew that ultimately the pressure would become so great that it would compel utterance ; therefore , I must be ready with an answer at that time -- an answer well chosen and tranquilizing .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 4]: I was right .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 4]: The time came .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 5]: They HAD to speak .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 20]: Poor lads , it was pitiful to see , they were so pale , so worn , so troubled .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 17]: At first their spokesman could hardly find voice or words ; but he presently got both .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 34]: This is what he said -- and he put it in the neat modern English taught him in my schools : `` We have tried to forget what we are -- English boys !
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 23]: We have tried to put reason before sentiment , duty before love ; our minds approve , but our hearts reproach us .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 67]: While apparently it was only the nobility , only the gentry , only the twenty-five or thirty thousand knights left alive out of the late wars , we were of one mind , and undisturbed by any troubling doubt ; each and every one of these fifty-two lads who stand here before you , said , ` They have chosen -- it is their affair . '
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 3]: But think !
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 15]: -- the matter is altered -- _ All England is marching against us _ !
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 6]: Oh , sir , consider !
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 3]: -- reflect !
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 33]: -- these people are our people , they are bone of our bone , flesh of our flesh , we love them -- do not ask us to destroy our nation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 20]: Well , it shows the value of looking ahead , and being ready for a thing when it happens .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 18]: If I had n't foreseen this thing and been fixed , that boy would have had me !
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 9]: -- I could n't have said a word .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 5]: But I was fixed .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 29]: I said : `` My boys , your hearts are in the right place , you have thought the worthy thought , you have done the worthy thing .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 19]: You are English boys , you will remain English boys , and you will keep that name unsmirched .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 13]: Give yourselves no further concern , let your minds be at peace .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 17]: Consider this : while all England is marching against us , who is in the van ?
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 15]: Who , by the commonest rules of war , will march in the front ?
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 4]: Answer me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 9]: `` The mounted host of mailed knights . ''
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 3]: `` True .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 6]: They are thirty thousand strong .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 6]: Acres deep they will march .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 15]: Now , observe : none but _ they _ will ever strike the sand-belt !
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 7]: Then there will be an episode !
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 18]: Immediately after , the civilian multitude in the rear will retire , to meet business engagements elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 25]: None but nobles and gentry are knights , and _ none but these _ will remain to dance to our music after that episode .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 17]: It is absolutely true that we shall have to fight nobody but these thirty thousand knights .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 11]: Now speak , and it shall be as you decide .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 12]: Shall we avoid the battle , retire from the field ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 11]: `` NO !!! '' The shout was unanimous and hearty .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 17]: `` Are you -- are you -- well , afraid of these thirty thousand knights ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 23]: That joke brought out a good laugh , the boys ' troubles vanished away , and they went gaily to their posts .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 8]: Ah , they were a darling fifty-two !
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 7]: As pretty as girls , too .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 8]: I was ready for the enemy now .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 15]: Let the approaching big day come along -- it would find us on deck .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 7]: The big day arrived on time .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 35]: At dawn the sentry on watch in the corral came into the cave and reported a moving black mass under the horizon , and a faint sound which he thought to be military music .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 12]: Breakfast was just ready ; we sat down and ate it .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 29]: This over , I made the boys a little speech , and then sent out a detail to man the battery , with Clarence in command of it .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 38]: The sun rose presently and sent its unobstructed splendors over the land , and we saw a prodigious host moving slowly toward us , with the steady drift and aligned front of a wave of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 25]: Nearer and nearer it came , and more and more sublimely imposing became its aspect ; yes , all England was there , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 24]: Soon we could see the innumerable banners fluttering , and then the sun struck the sea of armor and set it all aflash .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 18]: Yes , it was a fine sight ; I had n't ever seen anything to beat it .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 8]: At last we could make out details .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 20]: All the front ranks , no telling how many acres deep , were horsemen -- plumed knights in armor .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 27]: Suddenly we heard the blare of trumpets ; the slow walk burst into a gallop , and then -- well , it was wonderful to see !
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 52]: Down swept that vast horse-shoe wave -- it approached the sand-belt -- my breath stood still ; nearer , nearer -- the strip of green turf beyond the yellow belt grew narrow -- narrower still -- became a mere ribbon in front of the horses -- then disappeared under their hoofs .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 3]: Great Scott !
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 48]: Why , the whole front of that host shot into the sky with a thunder-crash , and became a whirling tempest of rags and fragments ; and along the ground lay a thick wall of smoke that hid what was left of the multitude from our sight .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 11]: Time for the second step in the plan of campaign !
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 16]: I touched a button , and shook the bones of England loose from her spine !
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 18]: In that explosion all our noble civilization-factories went up in the air and disappeared from the earth .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 10]: It was a pity , but it was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 15]: We could not afford to let the enemy turn our own weapons against us .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 12]: Now ensued one of the dullest quarter-hours I had ever endured .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 24]: We waited in a silent solitude enclosed by our circles of wire , and by a circle of heavy smoke outside of these .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 18]: We could n't see over the wall of smoke , and we could n't see through it .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 30]: But at last it began to shred away lazily , and by the end of another quarter-hour the land was clear and our curiosity was enabled to satisfy itself .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 7]: No living creature was in sight !
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 12]: We now perceived that additions had been made to our defenses .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 32]: The dynamite had dug a ditch more than a hundred feet wide , all around us , and cast up an embankment some twenty-five feet high on both borders of it .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 10]: As to destruction of life , it was amazing .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 7]: Moreover , it was beyond estimate .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 33]: Of course , we could not _ count _ the dead , because they did not exist as individuals , but merely as homogeneous protoplasm , with alloys of iron and buttons .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 51]: No life was in sight , but necessarily there must have been some wounded in the rear ranks , who were carried off the field under cover of the wall of smoke ; there would be sickness among the others -- there always is , after an episode like that .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 34]: But there would be no reinforcements ; this was the last stand of the chivalry of England ; it was all that was left of the order , after the recent annihilating wars .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 31]: So I felt quite safe in believing that the utmost force that could for the future be brought against us would be but small ; that is , of knights .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 27]: I therefore issued a congratulatory proclamation to my army in these words : SOLDIERS , CHAMPIONS OF HUMAN LIBERTY AND EQUALITY : Your General congratulates you !
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 20]: In the pride of his strength and the vanity of his renown , an arrogant enemy came against you .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 4]: You were ready .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 11]: The conflict was brief ; on your side , glorious .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 17]: This mighty victory , having been achieved utterly without loss , stands without example in history .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 28]: So long as the planets shall continue to move in their orbits , the BATTLE OF THE SAND-BELT will not perish out of the memories of men .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 3]: THE BOSS .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 16]: I read it well , and the applause I got was very gratifying to me .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 25]: I then wound up with these remarks : `` The war with the English nation , as a nation , is at an end .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 11]: The nation has retired from the field and the war .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 13]: Before it can be persuaded to return , war will have ceased .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 13]: This campaign is the only one that is going to be fought .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 10]: It will be brief -- the briefest in history .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 19]: Also the most destructive to life , considered from the standpoint of proportion of casualties to numbers engaged .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 15]: We are done with the nation ; henceforth we deal only with the knights .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 13]: English knights can be killed , but they can not be conquered .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 7]: We know what is before us .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 20]: While one of these men remains alive , our task is not finished , the war is not ended .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 7]: We will kill them all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 8]: -LSB- Loud and long continued applause . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 33]: I picketed the great embankments thrown up around our lines by the dynamite explosion -- merely a lookout of a couple of boys to announce the enemy when he should appear again .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 58]: Next , I sent an engineer and forty men to a point just beyond our lines on the south , to turn a mountain brook that was there , and bring it within our lines and under our command , arranging it in such a way that I could make instant use of it in an emergency .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 22]: The forty men were divided into two shifts of twenty each , and were to relieve each other every two hours .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 8]: In ten hours the work was accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 11]: It was nightfall now , and I withdrew my pickets .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 21]: The one who had had the northern outlook reported a camp in sight , but visible with the glass only .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 35]: He also reported that a few knights had been feeling their way toward us , and had driven some cattle across our lines , but that the knights themselves had not come very near .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 8]: That was what I had been expecting .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 25]: They were feeling us , you see ; they wanted to know if we were going to play that red terror on them again .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 10]: They would grow bolder in the night , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 33]: I believed I knew what project they would attempt , because it was plainly the thing I would attempt myself if I were in their places and as ignorant as they were .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 6]: I mentioned it to Clarence .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 23]: `` I think you are right , '' said he ; `` it is the obvious thing for them to try . ''
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 19]: `` Well , then , '' I said , `` if they do it they are doomed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 4]: `` Certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 13]: `` They wo n't have the slightest show in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 8]: `` Of course they wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 7]: `` It 's dreadful , Clarence .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 7]: It seems an awful pity . ''
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 23]: The thing disturbed me so that I could n't get any peace of mind for thinking of it and worrying over it .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 35]: So , at last , to quiet my conscience , I framed this message to the knights : TO THE HONORABLE THE COMMANDER OF THE INSURGENT CHIVALRY OF ENGLAND : YOU fight in vain .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 14]: We know your strength -- if one may call it by that name .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 19]: We know that at the utmost you can not bring against us above five and twenty thousand knights .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 10]: Therefore , you have no chance -- none whatever .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 14]: Reflect : we are well equipped , well fortified , we number 54 .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 3]: Fifty-four what ?
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 2]: Men ?
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 41]: No , MINDS -- the capablest in the world ; a force against which mere animal might may no more hope to prevail than may the idle waves of the sea hope to prevail against the granite barriers of England .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 3]: Be advised .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 19]: We offer you your lives ; for the sake of your families , do not reject the gift .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 29]: We offer you this chance , and it is the last : throw down your arms ; surrender unconditionally to the Republic , and all will be forgiven .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 6]: -LRB- Signed -RRB- THE BOSS .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 19]: I read it to Clarence , and said I proposed to send it by a flag of truce .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 29]: He laughed the sarcastic laugh he was born with , and said : `` Somehow it seems impossible for you to ever fully realize what these nobilities are .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 10]: Now let us save a little time and trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 9]: Consider me the commander of the knights yonder .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 27]: Now , then , you are the flag of truce ; approach and deliver me your message , and I will give you your answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 5]: I humored the idea .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 22]: I came forward under an imaginary guard of the enemy 's soldiers , produced my paper , and read it through .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 50]: For answer , Clarence struck the paper out of my hand , pursed up a scornful lip and said with lofty disdain : `` Dismember me this animal , and return him in a basket to the base-born knave who sent him ; other answer have I none ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 9]: How empty is theory in presence of fact !
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 10]: And this was just fact , and nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 16]: It was the thing that would have happened , there was no getting around that .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 14]: I tore up the paper and granted my mistimed sentimentalities a permanent rest .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 5]: Then , to business .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 54]: I tested the electric signals from the gatling platform to the cave , and made sure that they were all right ; I tested and retested those which commanded the fences -- these were signals whereby I could break and renew the electric current in each fence independently of the others at will .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 45]: I placed the brook-connection under the guard and authority of three of my best boys , who would alternate in two-hour watches all night and promptly obey my signal , if I should have occasion to give it -- three revolver-shots in quick succession .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 35]: Sentry-duty was discarded for the night , and the corral left empty of life ; I ordered that quiet be maintained in the cave , and the electric lights turned down to a glimmer .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 37]: As soon as it was good and dark , I shut off the current from all the fences , and then groped my way out to the embankment bordering our side of the great dynamite ditch .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 19]: I crept to the top of it and lay there on the slant of the muck to watch .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 9]: But it was too dark to see anything .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 8]: As for sounds , there were none .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 5]: The stillness was deathlike .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 60]: True , there were the usual night-sounds of the country -- the whir of night-birds , the buzzing of insects , the barking of distant dogs , the mellow lowing of far-off kine -- but these did n't seem to break the stillness , they only intensified it , and added a grewsome melancholy to it into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 42]: I presently gave up looking , the night shut down so black , but I kept my ears strained to catch the least suspicious sound , for I judged I had only to wait , and I should n't be disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 10]: However , I had to wait a long time .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 17]: At last I caught what you may call in distinct glimpses of sound dulled metallic sound .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 26]: I pricked up my ears , then , and held my breath , for this was the sort of thing I had been waiting for .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 12]: This sound thickened , and approached -- from toward the north .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 24]: Presently , I heard it at my own level -- the ridge-top of the opposite embankment , a hundred feet or more away .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 18]: Then I seemed to see a row of black dots appear along that ridge -- human heads ?
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 28]: I could n't tell ; it might n't be anything at all ; you ca n't depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 8]: However , the question was soon settled .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 11]: I heard that metallic noise descending into the great ditch .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 29]: It augmented fast , it spread all along , and it unmistakably furnished me this fact : an armed host was taking up its quarters in the ditch .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 13]: Yes , these people were arranging a little surprise party for us .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 10]: We could expect entertainment about dawn , possibly earlier .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 15]: I groped my way back to the corral now ; I had seen enough .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 18]: I went to the platform and signaled to turn the current on to the two inner fences .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 19]: Then I went into the cave , and found everything satisfactory there -- nobody awake but the working-watch .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 30]: I woke Clarence and told him the great ditch was filling up with men , and that I believed all the knights were coming for us in a body .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 40]: It was my notion that as soon as dawn approached we could expect the ditch 's ambuscaded thousands to swarm up over the embankment and make an assault , and be followed immediately by the rest of their army .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 22]: Clarence said : `` They will be wanting to send a scout or two in the dark to make preliminary observations .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 17]: Why not take the lightning off the outer fences , and give them a chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 9]: `` I 've already done it , Clarence .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 10]: Did you ever know me to be inhospitable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 9]: `` No , you are a good heart .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 13]: I want to go and -- '' `` Be a reception committee ?
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 7]: I will go , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 14]: We crossed the corral and lay down together between the two inside fences .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 30]: Even the dim light of the cave had disordered our eyesight somewhat , but the focus straightway began to regulate itself and soon it was adjusted for present circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 21]: We had had to feel our way before , but we could make out to see the fence posts now .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 20]: We started a whispered conversation , but suddenly Clarence broke off and said : `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 6]: `` What is what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 6]: `` That thing yonder . ''
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 7]: `` What thing -- where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 24]: `` There beyond you a little piece -- dark something -- a dull shape of some kind -- against the second fence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 6]: I gazed and he gazed .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 13]: I said : `` Could it be a man , Clarence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 7]: `` No , I think not .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 18]: If you notice , it looks a lit -- why , it _ is _ a man !
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 7]: -- leaning on the fence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 14]: `` I certainly believe it is ; let us go and see . ''
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 19]: We crept along on our hands and knees until we were pretty close , and then looked up .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 38]: Yes , it was a man -- a dim great figure in armor , standing erect , with both hands on the upper wire -- and , of course , there was a smell of burning flesh .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 15]: Poor fellow , dead as a door-nail , and never knew what hurt him .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 25]: He stood there like a statue -- no motion about him , except that his plumes swished about a little in the night wind .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 31]: We rose up and looked in through the bars of his visor , but could n't make out whether we knew him or not -- features too dim and shadowed .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 17]: We heard muffled sounds approaching , and we sank down to the ground where we were .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 18]: We made out another knight vaguely ; he was coming very stealthily , and feeling his way .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 32]: He was near enough now for us to see him put out a hand , find an upper wire , then bend and step under it and over the lower one .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 16]: Now he arrived at the first knight -- and started slightly when he discovered him .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 60]: He stood a moment -- no doubt wondering why the other one did n't move on ; then he said , in a low voice , `` Why dreamest thou here , good Sir Mar -- '' then he laid his hand on the corpse 's shoulder -- and just uttered a little soft moan and sunk down dead .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 18]: Killed by a dead man , you see -- killed by a dead friend , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 7]: There was something awful about it .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 24]: These early birds came scattering along after each other , about one every five minutes in our vicinity , during half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 34]: They brought no armor of offense but their swords ; as a rule , they carried the sword ready in the hand , and put it forward and found the wires with it .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 53]: We would now and then see a blue spark when the knight that caused it was so far away as to be invisible to us ; but we knew what had happened , all the same ; poor fellow , he had touched a charged wire with his sword and been electrocuted .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 46]: We had brief intervals of grim stillness , interrupted with piteous regularity by the clash made by the falling of an iron-clad ; and this sort of thing was going on , right along , and was very creepy there in the dark and lonesomeness .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 11]: We concluded to make a tour between the inner fences .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 52]: We elected to walk upright , for convenience 's sake ; we argued that if discerned , we should be taken for friends rather than enemies , and in any case we should be out of reach of swords , and these gentry did not seem to have any spears along .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 8]: Well , it was a curious trip .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 38]: Everywhere dead men were lying outside the second fence -- not plainly visible , but still visible ; and we counted fifteen of those pathetic statues -- dead knights standing with their hands on the upper wire .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 23]: One thing seemed to be sufficiently demonstrated : our current was so tremendous that it killed before the victim could cry out .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 19]: Pretty soon we detected a muffled and heavy sound , and next moment we guessed what it was .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 8]: It was a surprise in force coming !
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 24]: I whispered Clarence to go and wake the army , and notify it to wait in silence in the cave for further orders .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 26]: He was soon back , and we stood by the inner fence and watched the silent lightning do its awful work upon that swarming host .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 26]: One could make out but little of detail ; but he could note that a black mass was piling itself up beyond the second fence .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 7]: That swelling bulk was dead men !
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 25]: Our camp was enclosed with a solid wall of the dead -- a bulwark , a breastwork , of corpses , you may say .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 76]: One terrible thing about this thing was the absence of human voices ; there were no cheers , no war cries ; being intent upon a surprise , these men moved as noiselessly as they could ; and always when the front rank was near enough to their goal to make it proper for them to begin to get a shout ready , of course they struck the fatal line and went down without testifying .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 27]: I sent a current through the third fence now ; and almost immediately through the fourth and fifth , so quickly were the gaps filled up .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 22]: I believed the time was come now for my climax ; I believed that that whole army was in our trap .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 10]: Anyway , it was high time to find out .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 18]: So I touched a button and set fifty electric suns aflame on the top of our precipice .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 6]: Land , what a sight !
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 10]: We were enclosed in three walls of dead men !
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 23]: All the other fences were pretty nearly filled with the living , who were stealthily working their way forward through the wires .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 38]: The sudden glare paralyzed this host , petrified them , you may say , with astonishment ; there was just one instant for me to utilize their immobility in , and I did n't lose the chance .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 75]: You see , in another instant they would have recovered their faculties , then they 'd have burst into a cheer and made a rush , and my wires would have gone down before it ; but that lost instant lost them their opportunity forever ; while even that slight fragment of time was still unspent , I shot the current through all the fences and struck the whole host dead in their tracks !
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 12]: _ There _ was a groan you could _ hear _ !
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 9]: It voiced the death-pang of eleven thousand men .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 10]: It swelled out on the night with awful pathos .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 30]: A glance showed that the rest of the enemy -- perhaps ten thousand strong -- were between us and the encircling ditch , and pressing forward to the assault .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 7]: Consequently we had them _ all !
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 7]: _ and had them past help .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 9]: Time for the last act of the tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 18]: I fired the three appointed revolver shots -- which meant : `` Turn on the water ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 33]: There was a sudden rush and roar , and in a minute the mountain brook was raging through the big ditch and creating a river a hundred feet wide and twenty-five deep .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 8]: `` Stand to your guns , men !
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 4]: Open fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 13]: The thirteen gatlings began to vomit death into the fated ten thousand .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 33]: They halted , they stood their ground a moment against that withering deluge of fire , then they broke , faced about and swept toward the ditch like chaff before a gale .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 29]: A full fourth part of their force never reached the top of the lofty embankment ; the three-fourths reached it and plunged over -- to death by drowning .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 28]: Within ten short minutes after we had opened fire , armed resistance was totally annihilated , the campaign was ended , we fifty-four were masters of England .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 8]: Twenty-five thousand men lay dead around us .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 6]: But how treacherous is fortune !
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 29]: In a little while -- say an hour -- happened a thing , by my own fault , which -- but I have no heart to write that .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 6]: Let the record end here .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 16]: CHAPTER XLIV A POSTSCRIPT BY CLARENCE I , Clarence , must write it for him .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 18]: He proposed that we two go out and see if any help could be accorded the wounded .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 7]: I was strenuous against the project .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 32]: I said that if there were many , we could do but little for them ; and it would not be wise for us to trust ourselves among them , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 44]: But he could seldom be turned from a purpose once formed ; so we shut off the electric current from the fences , took an escort along , climbed over the enclosing ramparts of dead knights , and moved out upon the field .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 18]: The first wounded mall who appealed for help was sitting with his back against a dead comrade .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 19]: When The Boss bent over him and spoke to him , the man recognized him and stabbed him .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 16]: That knight was Sir Meliagraunce , as I found out by tearing off his helmet .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 9]: He will not ask for help any more .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 24]: We carried The Boss to the cave and gave his wound , which was not very serious , the best care we could .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 17]: In this service we had the help of Merlin , though we did not know it .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 17]: He was disguised as a woman , and appeared to be a simple old peasant goodwife .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 52]: In this disguise , with brown-stained face and smooth shaven , he had appeared a few days after The Boss was hurt and offered to cook for us , saying her people had gone off to join certain new camps which the enemy were forming , and that she was starving .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 19]: The Boss had been getting along very well , and had amused himself with finishing up his record .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 14]: We were glad to have this woman , for we were short handed .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 16]: We were in a trap , you see -- a trap of our own making .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 28]: If we stayed where we were , our dead would kill us ; if we moved out of our defenses , we should no longer be invincible .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 10]: We had conquered ; in turn we were conquered .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 10]: The Boss recognized this ; we all recognized it .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 55]: If we could go to one of those new camps and patch up some kind of terms with the enemy -- yes , but The Boss could not go , and neither could I , for I was among the first that were made sick by the poisonous air bred by those dead thousands .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 9]: Others were taken down , and still others .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 5]: To-morrow -- _ To-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 5]: _ It is here .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 6]: And with it the end .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 29]: About midnight I awoke , and saw that hag making curious passes in the air about The Boss 's head and face , and wondered what it meant .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 14]: Everybody but the dynamo-watch lay steeped in sleep ; there was no sound .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 15]: The woman ceased from her mysterious foolery , and started tip-toeing toward the door .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 7]: I called out : `` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 7]: What have you been doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 21]: She halted , and said with an accent of malicious satisfaction : `` Ye were conquerors ; ye are conquered !
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 8]: These others are perishing -- you also .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 16]: Ye shall all die in this place -- every one -- except _ him _ .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 10]: He sleepeth now -- and shall sleep thirteen centuries .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 5]: I am Merlin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 28]: Then such a delirium of silly laughter overtook him that he reeled about like a drunken man , and presently fetched up against one of our wires .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 13]: His mouth is spread open yet ; apparently he is still laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 16]: I suppose the face will retain that petrified laugh until the corpse turns to dust .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 11]: The Boss has never stirred -- sleeps like a stone .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 46]: If he does not wake to-day we shall understand what kind of a sleep it is , and his body will then be borne to a place in one of the remote recesses of the cave where none will ever find it to desecrate it .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 57]: As for the rest of us -- well , it is agreed that if any one of us ever escapes alive from this place , he will write the fact here , and loyally hide this Manuscript with The Boss , our dear good chief , whose property it is , be he alive or dead .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 10]: THE END OF THE MANUSCRIPT FINAL P.S. BY M.T. .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 11]: The dawn was come when I laid the Manuscript aside .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 24]: The rain had almost ceased , the world was gray and sad , the exhausted storm was sighing and sobbing itself to rest .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 19]: I went to the stranger 's room , and listened at his door , which was slightly ajar .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 11]: I could hear his voice , and so I knocked .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 12]: There was no answer , but I still heard the voice .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 4]: I peeped in .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 35]: The man lay on his back in bed , talking brokenly but with spirit , and punctuating with his arms , which he thrashed about , restlessly , as sick people do in delirium .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 9]: I slipped in softly and bent over him .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 7]: His mutterings and ejaculations went on .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 12]: I spoke -- merely a word , to call his attention .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 39]: His glassy eyes and his ashy face were alight in an instant with pleasure , gratitude , gladness , welcome : `` Oh , Sandy , you are come at last -- how I have longed for you !
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 19]: Sit by me -- do not leave me -- never leave me again , Sandy , never again .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 5]: Where is your hand ?
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 43]: -- give it me , dear , let me hold it -- there -- now all is well , all is peace , and I am happy again -- _ we _ are happy again , is n't it so , Sandy ?
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 62]: You are so dim , so vague , you are but a mist , a cloud , but you are _ here _ , and that is blessedness sufficient ; and I have your hand ; do n't take it away -- it is for only a little while , I shall not require it long ... Was that the child ?
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 3]: ... Hello-Central !
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 6]: ... she does n't answer .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 4]: Asleep , perhaps ?
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 26]: Bring her when she wakes , and let me touch her hands , her face , her hair , and tell her good-bye ... Sandy !
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 6]: Yes , you are there .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 19]: I lost myself a moment , and I thought you were gone ... Have I been sick long ?
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 11]: It must be so ; it seems months to me .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 4]: And such dreams !
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 8]: such strange and awful dreams , Sandy !
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 19]: Dreams that were as real as reality -- delirium , of course , but _ so _ real !
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 57]: Why , I thought the king was dead , I thought you were in Gaul and could n't get home , I thought there was a revolution ; in the fantastic frenzy of these dreams , I thought that Clarence and I and a handful of my cadets fought and exterminated the whole chivalry of England !
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 8]: But even that was not the strangest .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 28]: I seemed to be a creature out of a remote unborn age , centuries hence , and even _ that _ was as real as the rest !
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 50]: Yes , I seemed to have flown back out of that age into this of ours , and then forward to it again , and was set down , a stranger and forlorn in that strange England , with an abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me and you !
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 9]: between me and my home and my friends !
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 19]: between me and all that is dear to me , all that could make life worth the living !
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 13]: It was awful -- awfuler than you can ever imagine , Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 61]: Ah , watch by me , Sandy -- stay by me every moment -- _ do n't _ let me go out of my mind again ; death is nothing , let it come , but not with those dreams , not with the torture of those hideous dreams -- I can not endure _ that _ again ... Sandy ?
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 25]: ... '' He lay muttering incoherently some little time ; then for a time he lay silent , and apparently sinking away toward death .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 51]: Presently his fingers began to pick busily at the coverlet , and by that sign I knew that his end was at hand with the first suggestion of the death-rattle in his throat he started up slightly , and seemed to listen : then he said : `` A bugle ?
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 6]: ... It is the king !
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 5]: The drawbridge , there !
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 4]: Man the battlements !
