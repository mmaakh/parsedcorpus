Parsing [sent. 1 len. 7]: Olla Podrida , by Captain Marryat .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 15]: Captain Frederick Marryat was born July 10 1792 , and died August 8 1848 .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 16]: He retired from the British navy in 1828 in order to devote himself to writing .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 31]: In the following 20 years he wrote 26 books , many of which are among the very best of English literature , and some of which are still in print .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 14]: Marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his stories .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 24]: He says somewhere that when he sat down for the day 's work , he never knew what he was going to write .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 7]: He certainly was a literary genius .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 19]: `` Olla Podrida '' was published in 1840 , the fifteenth book to flow from Marryat 's pen .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 27]: It consists of short stories , articles , his Diary on the Continent , -LRB- as opposed to his Diary in America -RRB- , short plays .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 19]: Except for `` The Modern Town House '' there is very little of great importance in the book .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 7]: OLLA PODRIDA , BY CAPTAIN MARRYAT .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 3]: CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 5]: April 3 , 1835 .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 171]: Reader , did you ever feel in that peculiarly distressing state of mind in which one oppressing idea displaces or colours every other , absorbing , intermingling with , empoisoning , and , like the filth of the harpy , turning every thing into disgust -- when a certain incubus rides upon the brain , as the Old Man of the Mountain did upon the shoulders of Sinbad , burdening , irritating , and rendering existence a misery -- when , looking around , you see but one object perched everywhere and grinning at you -- when even what you put into your mouth tastes of but that one something , and the fancied taste is so unpleasant as almost to prevent deglutition -- when every sound which vibrates in your ear appears to strike the same discordant note , and all and every thing will remind you of the one only thing which you would fain forget ; -- have you ever felt any thing like this , reader ?
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 33]: If you have not , then thank God , by way of grace , before you out with your knife and fork and begin to cut up the contents of these pages .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 30]: I have been and am now suffering under one of these varieties of `` Phobias , '' and my disease is a Politicophobia , I will describe the symptoms .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 82]: I am now in the metropolis of England , and when I walk out every common house appears to me to be the House of Commons -- every lordly mansion the House of Lords -- every man I meet , instead of being a member of society , is transferred by imagination into a member of the senate -- every chimney-sweep into a bishop , and a Bavarian girl , with her `` Py a proom , '' into an ex-chancellor .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 63]: If I return home , the ring at the bell reminds me of a Peel -- as I mount the stairs I think of the `` Lobby '' -- I throw myself on the sofa , and the cushion is transformed into a woolsack -- if a solitary visitor calls in , I imagine a public meeting , and call out chair !
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 2]: chair !
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 25]: -- and I as often address my wife as Mr Speaker , as I do with the usual appellative of `` my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 82]: This incubus , like the Catholic anathema , pursues me everywhere -- at breakfast , the dry toast reminds me of the toasts at public dinners -- tea , of the East India charter -- sugar , of the West India question -- the loaf , of agricultural distress -- and , as every one knows that London eggs are a lottery , according as they prove bad or good , so am I reminded of a Whig or Tory measure .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 29]: When the newspaper is brought in , I walk round and round it as a dog will do round the spot he is about to lie down upon .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 51]: I would fain not touch it ; but at last , like a fascinated bird who falls per force into the reptile 's mouth , so do I plunge into its columns , read it with desperation , and when the poison has circulated , throw it away in despair .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 44]: If I am reminded to say grace at dinner , I commence `` My Lords , and gentlemen ; '' and when I seek my bed , as I light my taper , I move `` that the House do now adjourn . ''
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 22]: The tradesmen 's bills are swelled by my disease into the budget , and the checks upon my banker into supplies .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 13]: Even my children laugh and wonder at the answers which they receive .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 31]: Yesterday one brought me her book of animals , and pointing to a boa constrictor , asked its name , and I told her it was an _ O'Connell _ .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 36]: I am told that I mentioned the names of half the members of the Upper and Lower House , and at the time really believed that I was calling the beasts by their right names .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 9]: Such are the effects of my unfortunate disease .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 10]: Abroad I feel it even worse than at home .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 14]: Society is unhinged , and every one is afraid to offer an opinion .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 36]: If I dine out , I find that no one will speak first -- he knows not whether he accosts a friend or foe , or whether he may not be pledging his bitter enemy .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 72]: Every man looks at his neighbour 's countenance to discover if he is Whig or Tory : they appear to be examining one another like the dogs who meet in the street , and it is impossible to conjecture whether the mutual scenting will be followed up by a growl or a wag of the tail ; however , one remark will soon discover the political sentiments of the whole party .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 57]: Should they all agree , they are so busy in abuse that they rail at their adversaries with their mouths full -- should they disagree , they dispute so vehemently that they forget that they were invited to dinner , and the dishes are removed untasted , and the duties of the Amphytryon become a sinecure .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 42]: Go to an evening party or a ball and it is even worse , for young ladies talk politics , prefer discussion to flirtation , and will rather win a partner over to their political opinions than by their personal charms .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 57]: If you , as a Tory , happen to stand up in a cotillion with a pretty Whig , she taps you with her fan that she may tap your politics ; if you agree , it is '' _ En avant deux _ , '' if not , a '' _ chassez croisee _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 35]: Every thing goes wrong -- she may _ set _ to you indeed , but hers is the set of defiance , and she shakes her _ wig _ against your _ Tory _ .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 30]: To _ turn your partner _ is impossible , and the only part of the figure which is executed _ con amore _ is _ dos a dos _ .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 31]: The dance is over , and the lady 's looks at once tell you that you may save your `` oaths , '' while she `` takes her seat . ''
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 23]: I have tried change of scene -- posted to watering places ; but the deep , deep sea will not drown politics .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 15]: Even the ocean in its roaring and commotion reminded me of a political union .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 16]: I have buried myself in the country , but it has been all in vain .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 35]: I can not look at the cattle peacefully grazing without thinking of O'Connell 's tail , Stanley 's tail , and a short-docked pony reminded me of the boasted little tail of Colonel Peel .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 32]: The farm-yard , with its noisy occupants , what was it but the reality so well imitated by the members of the Lower House , who would drown argument in discord ?
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 15]: I thought I was in the lobby at the close of a long debate .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 57]: Every tenth field , every tenth furrow , -LRB- and I could not help counting , -RRB- every tenth animal , and every tenth step , reminded me of the Irish tithes ; and when I saw a hawk swoop over a chicken , I thought of the Appropriation Bill -- so I left the country .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 16]: I have tried every thing -- I have been every where , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 18]: In the country there was no relaxation -- in society no pleasure -- at home no relief .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 19]: England was disjointed , never to be united until it was dismembered -- and there was no repose .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 35]: I had my choice , either to go abroad , or to go mad ; and , upon mature deliberation , I decided upon the former , as the lesser evil of the two .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 21]: So I gave -- I sold -- I discharged -- I paid -- I packed up , and I planned .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 14]: The last was the only portion of my multifarious duties not satisfactorily arranged .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 37]: I looked at the maps , plied my compasses that I might compass my wishes , measured distances that I might decide upon my measures -- planned , looked over the maps -- and planned again .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 83]: Well , as I said in my last chapter , I planned -- and planned -- but I might as well conjugate it , as many others assisted -- it was I planned , thou plannedst , he planned , we planned , ye planned , and they planned -- and what annoyed me was , that I could not help considering that `` the whole house was in a committee , '' and without being able `` to report progress . ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 44]: At first it was _ decided upon _ that we should proceed up the Rhine , and not leave off paddling until we had arrived at Manheim , at which town I fancied that I should at least be out of political distance .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 35]: We read all about Manheim , found out that it was a regular-built town , with a certain number of inhabitants -- with promenades , gardens , and a fine view of the Rhine .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 10]: `` So you 're going abroad -- where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 37]: Manheim , was the reply , and all the world knew that we were bound to Manheim ; and every one had something to say , or something that they had heard said , about Manheim .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 50]: `` Very nice place -- Duchess Dowager Stephanie -- very cheap -- gay in winter -- masters excellent '' -- were the variety of changes rung , and all was settled ; but at last one unlucky observation raised a doubt -- another increased -- a third confirmed it .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 29]: `` A very dull place -- German cookery bad for children -- steam-boats from Rotterdam very bad , and often obliged to pass two nights on deck . ''
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 51]: A very influential member of the committee took alarm about the children being two nights on deck , and it was at last decided that to go up to Manheim by steam-boat at 4 pounds , 9 shillings a-head , and children at half-price was not to be thought of .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 41]: `` I wonder you do n't go to Bruges , '' observed a committee man ; `` nice quiet place -- excellent masters -- every thing so cheap -- I once bought eighty large peaches there for two francs . ''
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 18]: And all the children clapped their little hands , and cried out for Bruges and cheap peaches .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 27]: It was further submitted that it was convenient -- you might go the whole of the way by water -- and Bruges was immediately under consideration .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 50]: `` If you go to Bruges , you will find it very dull , '' observed another ; `` but you 'll meet Mrs Trollope there -- now Brussels is very little farther , and is a delightful place ; '' and Brussels was also referred to the committee .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 18]: `` You wo n't like Brussels -- there is such a mixture , and house-rent is dear .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 21]: Now I should recommend Spa for the summer -- it is a most beautiful spot -- and excellent company . ''
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 8]: And Spa was added to the list .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 43]: Then after a day or two came an Anti-Teutonic , who railed against Germany -- and Germans -- German towns , German travelling , and German _ French _ , which was detestable -- German cookery , which was nothing but grease .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 39]: `` You may imagine , '' said he , `` and so have many more , that Germany is more pleasant and less expensive than France ; but they have been disappointed , and so will you be .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 27]: Now , for a quiet place , I should recommend Saint Omer -- only thirty miles from Calais -- so convenient -- and very pretty . ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 21]: Saint Omer -- humph -- very quiet and retired -- and no politics -- and Saint Omer was occasionally canvassed .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 5]: `` Saint Omer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 15]: said another who called the next day , `` you 'll die of ennui .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 22]: Go to Boulogne -- it is delightful -- you may be there as retired or as gay as you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 23]: Boulogne to be taken into consideration many inquiries made and all very satisfactory -- good sands and excellent jackasses for the children .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 26]: `` My dear friend , Boulogne is something like the King 's Bench -- at least most of the people only go there in preference .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 11]: Every body will suppose that you 've _ levanted _ .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 8]: Pray do n't go to Boulogne . ''
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 51]: `` Why do n't you go by Southampton to Havre -- there you 'll have quiet and amusement -- beautiful country about Honfleur -- scenery up the Seine splendid ; and then you can go up to Rouen by water , if you intend to go on to Paris . ''
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 8]: Havre and Honfleur submitted to the committee .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 85]: But then came Dieppe , and Brest , and the environs of Paris , Versailles , Saint Germain , Passy , and other recommendations , in which every one particular place was proved incontestably to be more particularly suited to us than any other , and the committee sat for three weeks , at the end of which , upon examining the matured opinions of the last seven days , I found them to have fluctuated as follows : -- Monday morning , Manheim .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 4]: Evening , Spa .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 5]: Tuesday morning , Bruges .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 3]: Evening Brussels .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 6]: Wednesday morning , Saint Omer .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 4]: Evening , Boulogne .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 5]: Thursday morning , Havre .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 3]: Evening Honfleur .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 5]: Friday morning , Dieppe .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 4]: Evening , Passy .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 5]: Saturday morning , Versailles .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 5]: Evening , Saint Germain .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 5]: Sunday morning , Spa .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 4]: Evening , Brussels .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 63]: The fact was , that there was a trifling difference of opinion in the committee -- the great object appeared to be , and the great difficulty at the same time , to find a place which would suit all parties , that is to say , a place where there were no politics , plenty of gaiety , and cheap peaches .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 14]: Paddle , paddle -- splash , splash -- bump , thump , bump .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 14]: What a leveller is sea-sickness -- almost as great a radical as death .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 11]: All grades , all respect , all consideration are lost .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 50]: The master may summon John to his assistance , but John will see his master hanged before he 'll go to him ; he has taken possession of his master 's great coat , and he intends to keep _ it -- he _ do n't care for warning .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 76]: The nurses no longer look after the infant or the children , they may tumble overboard -- even the fond yearnings of the mother at last yield to the overwhelming sensation , and it it were not for the mercenary or kind-hearted assistance of those who have become habituated to the motion of a vessel , there is no saying how tragical might be the commencement of many a party of pleasure to the Continent .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 35]: `` O lauk , Mary , do just hold this child , '' says the upper nurse to her assistant ; `` I do feel such a _ sinking _ in my stomach . ''
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 16]: `` Car n't indeed , nurse , I 've such a _ rising _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 20]: Away hurried both the women at once to the side of the vessel , leaning over and groaning heavily .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 23]: As for the children , they would soon have been past caring for , had it not been for my protecting arms .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 24]: Decorum and modesty , next to maternal tenderness , the strongest feelings in woman , fall before the dire prostratiou of this malady .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 51]: A young lady will recline unwittingly in the arms of a perfect stranger , and the bride of three months , deserted by her husband , will offer no resistance to the uncouth seaman , who , in his kindness , would loosen the laces that confine her heaving bosom .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 47]: As for politeness , even the _ ancien regime _ of the noblesse of France put it in their pockets as if there were a general chaos -- self is the only feeling ; not but that I have seen occasional traits of good-will towards others .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 70]: I once witnessed a young lady smelling to a bottle of Eau de Cologne , as if her existence depended upon it , who handed it over to another , whose state was even more pitiable , and I was reminded of Sir Philip Sidney and the cup of water , as he lay wounded on the field of battle , `` Thy necessity is greater than mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 23]: And if I might have judged from her trembling lips and pallid countenance , it was almost an equal act of heroism .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 58]: Paddle , paddle , splash , splash , bump , thump , bump -- one would really imagine that the passengers were so many pumps , all worked at once with the vessel by the same hundred horse power , for there were an hundred of them about me , each as sick as a horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 62]: _ Sic omnes _ , '' thought I. I have long passed the ordeal , and even steam , and smoke , and washing basins , and all the various discordant and revolting noises _ from those _ who suffer , have no effect upon my nervous system -- still was I doomed to torment , and was very sick indeed .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 26]: For some time I had been watched by the evil eyes of one , whom the Yankees would designate , as _ almighty ugly _ .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 40]: He was a thin , spare man , whose accost I could well have spared , for he had the look of a demon , and , as I soon found , was possessed with the demon of politics .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 18]: Imagine what I must have suffered when I found out that he was a button-holder to boot .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 23]: Observing that I was the only one who was in a state to listen , he seized upon me as his victim .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 85]: I , who had fled from politics with as much horror as others have done from the cholera -- I , who had encountered all the miseries of steam navigation , and all the steam and effluvia of close cabins , to find myself condemned with others `` alike to groan -- '' what with King Leopold , and William of Nassau , and the Belgian share of the debt , and the French and Antwerp , and his pertinacious holding of my button .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 32]: `` Shall I knock him down , '' thought I ; `` he insists upon laying his hands upon me , why should I not lay my hands upon him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 71]: But on second consideration , that would not have been polite ; so I made other attempts to get rid of him , but in vain ; I turned the subject to far countries -- the rascal had been everywhere ; at one moment he would be at Vienna , and discuss the German confederation -- at another in South America , canvassing the merits of Bolivar and Saint Martin .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 26]: There was no stopping him ; his tongue was like the paddle of a steam-boat , and almost threw as much spray in my face .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 39]: At last I threw off my coat , which he continued to hold in his hand by the third button , and threw myself into one of the cribs appropriated to passengers , wishing him a good night .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 36]: He put my coat down in the crib beneath , and as he could no longer hold the button , he laid hold of the side of the crib , and continued his incessant clack .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 53]: At last I turned my back to him , and made no answer , upon which he made a retreat , and when I awoke the next morning , I found that he was too ill to spout politics , although as he progressed , he spouted what was quite as bad .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 35]: Par parenthese , he was a great liar , and as he drew a long bow when he was able to talk , so did he prove a long shot when he was sea-sick .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 90]: Confound the fellow , I think I see him now -- there he stood , a tall , gaunt misery , about the height of a workhouse pump , and the basin was on the floor of the cabin , nearly three feet from his two feet ; without condescending to stoop , or to sit down , or to lift up the basin , so as to lessen the distance , he poured forth a parabola , `` quod nunc describere '' had just as well be omitted .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 40]: I shall therefore dismiss this persecuting demon , by stating , that he called himself a baron , the truth of which I doubted much ; that he was employed by crowned heads , which I doubted still more .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 40]: On one point , however , I had little doubt , although he did not enter upon the subject , -LRB- and his tongue to a great degree confirmed it -RRB- that he was a _ chevalier d'industrie _ .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 39]: `` I am rid of him , thank God , '' exclaimed I , as I went on deck to breathe a little fresh air , having lighted my cigar in the steward 's berth as I ascended .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 38]: The first objects which attracted my attention , were a young gentleman and lady , the former standing by the latter , who was sitting in a pensive position , with her elbow leaning on the gunnel .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 10]: She was in deep mourning , and closely veiled .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 13]: `` And how does the beautiful Maria find herself this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 18]: said the young gentleman , leaning over her with his hand on the rail to support himself .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 4]: The beautiful Maria !
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 14]: How was it possible not to be attracted by such a distinguishing appellation ?
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 4]: The beautiful Maria !
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 50]: I thought of Sterne 's Maria , and the little dog with a string , and I trimmed my ear like a windsail in the tropics to catch the soft responding , and most assuredly , to my expectant imagination , melodious vibration of the air which would succeed .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 7]: At last there was a reply .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 7]: _ tol , lol _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 9]: And that in anything but a melodious voice .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 5]: tol , lol ! ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 4]: What a bathos !
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 42]: The beautiful Maria , whom in my imagination I had clothed with all the attributes of sentiment and delicacy , whom I had conjured up as a beau ideal of perfection , replies in a hoarse voice with , `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 5]: tol , lol ! ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 32]: Down she went , like the English funds in a panic -- down she went to the zero of a Doll Tearsheet , and down I went again into the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 8]: Surely this is a world of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 45]: Perhaps I was wrong -- she might have been very beautiful , with the voice of a peacock ; she might also have the plumage -- but no , that is impossible -- she must , from her sex , have been a peahen .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 14]: At all events , if not very beautiful , she was very sick .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 10]: I left the beautiful Maria screeching over the gunnel .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 26]: If the young gentleman were to repeat the same question now , thought I , the beautiful Maria will hardly answer , '' _ Oh !
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 6]: tol , lol _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 13]: It was very cold on deck , blowing fresh from the East .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 28]: I never heard any one give a satisfactory reason why a west wind should be warm , and an east wind cold in latitude 50 degrees N .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 19]: It is not so in the tropics when the east wind follows the rarefaction occasioned by the sun .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 26]: Yet , does not Byron say : -- '' 'T is the land of the east , 't is the clime of the sun . ''
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 10]: Certainly our east winds are not at all poetical .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 33]: `` Very cold , sir , '' said I , addressing a round-faced gentleman in a white great coat , who rested his chin and his two hands upon a thick cane .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 10]: `` You are fortunate in not being sea-sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 11]: `` I beg your pardon , I am not fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 17]: I am worse than sea-sick , for I want to be sea-sick and I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 16]: I do believe that everything is changed now-a-days , since that confounded Reform Bill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 18]: Politics again , thought I ; what the devil has sea-sickness to do with the Reform Bill ?
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 11]: Mercy on me , when shall I be at peace ?
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 16]: `` There certainly has been some change , '' observed I. `` Change , sir !
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 5]: yes , everything changed .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 37]: England of 1835 is no more like merry England of olden time , than I am like Louis the Fourteenth -- ruined , sir -- every class suffering , sir -- badly ruled , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 7]: `` Things are much cheaper . ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 4]: `` Much cheaper !
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 22]: Yes , sir ; but what 's the good of things being cheap when nobody has any money to purchase with ?
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 8]: They might just as well be dear .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 12]: It 's a melancholy discovery , sir , this steam . ''
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 18]: `` Melancholy just now to those who are on board , and suffering , I grant . ''
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 5]: `` Pooh , nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 18]: melancholy to those on shore , sir ; the engines work while man looks on and starves .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 45]: Country ruined , sir -- people miserable -- thrown out of employment , while foreigners reap the benefit ; we sell them our manufactures at a cheaper rate ; we clothe them well , sir , at the expense of our own suffering population .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 7]: But is this all , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 7]: _ Oh , no _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 18]: And here the gentleman dropped his chin again upon his hands , and looked very woeful indeed .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 8]: After a few seconds , he resumed .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 11]: `` We are dismembered , sir -- ruined by faction .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 29]: Society is disintegrated by political animosities ; thousands have retreated from the scene of violence and excitement , to find peace and repose in a foreign land . ''
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 5]: I nodded an assent .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 43]: `` Ay , sir , and thousands will follow , withdrawing from the country its resources , circulating millions which enrich other nations , and avoiding their own share of the national burdens , which fall still heavier upon those who remain .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 7]: But is that all , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 7]: _ Oh , no _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 8]: This second `` oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 21]: was pronounced in a more lugubrious note : he shook his head , and after a pause , he recommenced .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 20]: `` England is no longer priest-ridden , sir ; but she is worse , she is _ law-ridden _ .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 16]: Litigation and law expenses have , like locusts , devoured up the produce of industry .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 26]: No man is safe without a lawyer at his elbow , making over to him a part of his annual income to secure the remainder .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 6]: And then there 's Brougham .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 8]: But , sir , is that all ?
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 7]: _ Oh , no _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 7]: Another pause , and he continued .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 40]: `` I never grumble -- I hate grumblers ; I never talk of politics -- I hate politics ; but , sir , is it not the case , that madmen and fools have united to ruin the country ?
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 50]: Is it not true , sir , that unable to rise by their talents , and urged by a wicked ambition , they have summoned main force , and the power of numbers to their assistance , and have raised a spirit which they can not put down again ?
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 38]: Is it not true , sir , that treason walks barefaced through the land , pointing to general destruction -- to a violation of all rights , to anarchy , confusion , and the shedding of blood ?
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 10]: is not reason borne down by faction , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 8]: but , sir , is that all ?
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 7]: _ Oh , no _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 8]: This last `` oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 32]: was more melancholy than the preceding , but I considered that my companion must have nearly exhausted his budget of miseries , and was curious to ascertain what would come next .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 10]: `` What , is there more , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 5]: inquired I , innocently .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 5]: `` More , sir .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 7]: Yes , sir , plenty more .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 43]: I ask you whether even the seasons have not changed in our unhappy country ; have we not summer with unusual , unexampled heat , and winters without cold ; when shall we ever see the mercury down below sixty degrees again ?
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 4]: never , sir .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 11]: What is summer but a season of alarm and dread ?
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 25]: Does not the cholera come in as regularly as green peas -- terrifying us to death , whether we die of it or not ?
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 22]: Of what advantage are the fruits of the earth so bountifully bestowed -- have they not all been converted into poisons ?
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 10]: Who dares to drink a light summer wine now ?
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 38]: Are not all vegetables abjured , peaches thrown to the pigs , and strawberries ventured upon only by little boys who sweep the streets , with the broom in one hand and the pottle in the other ?
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 11]: Are not melons rank poison , and cucumbers sudden death ?
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 12]: And in the winter , sir , are we better off ?
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 49]: Instead of the wholesome frosts of olden days , purifying the air and the soil , and bracing up our nerves , what have we but the influenza , which lasts us for four months , and the spasmodic cough which fills up the remainder of the year ?
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 103]: I am no grumbler , sir , I hate and abhor anything like complaining , but this I will say , that the world has been turned upside down -- that everything has gone wrong -- that peace has come to us unattended by plenty -- that every body is miserable ; and that vaccination and steam , which have been lauded as blessings , have proved the greatest of all possible curses , and that there is no chance of a return to our former prosperity , unless we can set fire to our coal mines , and re-introduce the small-pox .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 41]: But , sir , the will of Heaven be done , I shall say no more ; I do n't wish to make other people unhappy ; but pray do n't think , sir , I 've told you all .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 7]: _ Oh , no _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 9]: At this last `` oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 14]: my companion laid his face down upon his knuckles , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 15]: I once more sought the deck , and preferred to encounter the east wind .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 42]: `` Blow , blow , thou wintry wind , thou art not so unkind , '' soliloquised I , as I looked over the bows , and perceived that we were close to the pile entrance of the harbour of Ostend .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 53]: Ten minutes afterwards there was a cessation of paddle , paddle , thump , thump , the stern-fast was thrown on the quay , there was a rush on board of commissionnaires , with their reiterated cries accompanied with cards thrust into your hands , `` Hotel des Bains , Monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 7]: `` Hotel Waterloo , Monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 5]: `` Hotel Bellevue . ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 7]: `` Hotel Bedford , Monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 61]: `` Hotel d'Angleterre , '' _ ad infinitum _ -- and then there was the pouring out of the Noah 's Ark , with their countenances wearing a most paradoxical appearance , for they evidently showed that they had had , quite enough of water , and , at the same time , that they required a great deal more .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 53]: I looked at my children , as they were hoisted up from the ladies ' cabin , one after another ; and upon examination I decided that , with their smudged faces , the Hotel des _ Bains _ would be the most appropriate to their condition ; so there we went .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 7]: Ostend , April 18 , 1835 .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 88]: I was confoundedly taken in by a rascal of a commissionnaire , and aware how the feelings of travellers are affected by the weather or the treatment they receive at any place they may pass through , I shall display the heroism of saying nothing about the place , except that I believe Ostend to be the most rascally hole in the world , and the sooner the traveller is out of it so much the better will it be for his purse and for his temper .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 3]: April 19 .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 18]: It has been assumed as an axiom that every one in this world is fond of power .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 46]: During our passage in the track-schuyt I had an evidence to the contrary , for as we glided noiselessly and almost imperceptibly along , a lady told me that she infinitely preferred the three-horse power of the schuyt to the hundred-horse power of the steam-packet .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 15]: We arrived at Bruges , escaping all the horrors and difficulties of steam navigation .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 38]: House rent at Bruges is cheap , because one half of the houses are empty -- at least that was the cause assigned to me , although I will not vouch for its being the true one .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 27]: The reader may remember that this was the site of cheap peaches , but none met our sight , the trees not being yet in blossom .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 35]: I ought to observe , for the satisfaction of the Foreign Bible Society , that at the hotel at Bruges I saw a book of their exportation lying on the chimney-piece in excellent preservation .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 3]: April 21 .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 79]: As to what passed on our canal voyage to Ghent , I can only say that every thing passed us -- for the roads were very heavy , the horses very lazy , and the boys still lazier -- they rode their horses listlessly , sitting on them sideways , as I have seen lads in the country swinging on a gate -- whereby the _ gait _ of the track-schuyt could not be styled a swinging pace .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 13]: We did arrive at last , and thus ended our water carriage .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 74]: At Ghent we went to the Hotel Royal , from out of the windows of which I had a fine view of the belfry , surmounted by the Brazen Dragon brought from Constantinople ; and as I conjured up times past , and I thought how the belfry was built and how the dragon got there , I found myself at last wandering in the Apocrypha of `` Bel and the Dragon . ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 17]: We went to see the picture by Van Eck , in the cathedral of Saint Bovin .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 49]: The reader will probably wish to know who was Saint Bovin -- so did I -- and I asked the question of the sacristan : the reader shall have the benefit of the answer , `` Saint Bovin , monsieur , il etait un _ saint _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 36]: That picture of Van Eck 's is worth a van full of most of the pictures we see : it was Van Eck who invented , and was indeed the father of painting in oil .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 6]: It is a wonderful production .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 19]: Mrs Trollope says that people run through Belgium as if it were a mere railroad to other countries .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 61]: That is very true -- we did the same -- for who would stop at Ostend to be swindled , or at Bruges to look at empty houses , or at Ghent , which is nothing but a Flanders Birmingham , when Brussels and King Leopold , and the anticipation of something more agreeable , were only thirty miles off .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 19]: Not one day was our departure postponed ; with post-horses and postilions we posted post haste to Brussels .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 3]: April 22 .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 11]: The Queen of Belgium `` a fait un enfant . ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 63]: On the Continent it is always the wife who is considered as the faiseuse ; the husband is supposed , and very often with justice to have had nothing to do in the matter -- it certainly does appear to be optional on the part of the ladies , for they limit their family to their exact wishes or means of support .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 19]: How different is it in England , where children will be born whether it is convenient or not !
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 4]: O Miss Martineau !
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 15]: you may talk about the `` preventive check , '' but where is it ?
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 13]: In England it would be as valuable as the philosopher 's stone .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 48]: I think that the good people of Paris would do well , as they appear just now to have left religion in abeyance , to take up the manners and customs of the empire of the Nahirs , a Mahratta nation , which I once read about .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 18]: In that country , as in heaven , there is no marrying , nor giving in marriage .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 51]: All are free , and all inheritance is through the children of the sister ; for although it is impossible to know who may be the father of any of the children , they are very certain that the sister 's children must have the blood on the maternal side .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 42]: What a good arrangement this would be for the Parisians -- how many _ peches a mortels _ would they get rid of -- such as adultery , fornication , etcetera , -- by passing one simple law of the land .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 49]: By-the-by , what an admirable idea for reforming a nation -- they say that laws , now-a-days , are made to prevent crime : but if laws were enacted by which crime should no longer be considered as crime , what a deal of trouble might be saved .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 47]: The theatre is closed owing to the want of funds ; the want of funds is owing to the want of honesty on the part of the manager having run away with the strong box , which was decidedly the very best box in the theatre .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 3]: April 26 .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 49]: I went to see a species of Franconi , or Astley 's : there is little variety in these performances , as there are only a certain quantity of feats , which can be performed either by the horses or the riders , nevertheless we had some novelty .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 85]: We had the very best feminine rider I ever saw ; she was a perfect female Centaur , looking part and parcel of the animal upon which she stood ; and then we had a regularly Dutch-built lady , who amused us with a tumble off her horse , coming down on the loose saw-dust , in a sitting posture , and making a hole in it as large as if a covey of partridges had been husking in it for the whole day .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 67]: An American black -LRB- there always is a black fellow in these companies , for , as Cooper says , they learn to ride well in America by stealing their masters ' horses -RRB- rode furiously well and sprained his ankle -- the attempt of a man in extreme pain to smile is very horrible -- yet he did grin as he bowed and limped away .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 117]: After that we had a performer , who had little chance of spraining her ankle : it was a Miss Betsey , a female of good proportions , who was , however , not a little sulky that evening , and very often refused to perform her task , and as for forcing the combined will of a female and an elephant to boot , there was no man rash enough to attempt it , so she did as little as she pleased , and it pleased her to do very little ; one feat , however , was novel , she took a musket in her mouth , and fired it off with her trunk .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 55]: When I was in India I was very partial to these animals ; there was a most splendid elephant , which had been captured by the expedition sent to Martaban ; he stood four or five feet higher than elephants usually do , and was a great favourite of his master , the rajah .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 18]: When this animal was captured there was great difficulty in getting him on board of the transport .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 62]: A raft was made , and he was very unwillingly persuaded to trust his huge carcass upon it ; he was then towed off with about thirty of the natives on the raft , attending him ; the largest purchases and blocks were procured to hoist him in , the mainyards doubly secured , and the fall brought to the capstern .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 59]: The elephant had been properly slung , the capstern was manned , and his huge bulk was lifted in the air , but he had not risen a foot before the ropes gave way , and down he came again on the raft with a heavy surge , a novelty which he did not appear to approve of .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 63]: A new fall was rove , and they again manned the capstern ; this time the tackle held , and up went the gentleman in the air ; but he had not forgotten the previous accident , and upon what ground it is impossible to say , he ascribed his treatment to the natives , who were assisting him on the raft .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 30]: As he slowly mounted in the air , he looked about him very wroth , his eyes and his trunk being the only portions of his frame at liberty .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 104]: These he turned about in every direction as he ascended -- at last , as he passed by the main channels , he perceived the half of a maintop-sail yard , which had been carried away in the slings , lying on the goose-necks ; it was a weapon that suited him admirably ; he seized hold of it , and whirling it once round with his trunk , directed the piece of wood with such good aim , that he swept about twenty of the natives off the raft , to take their chance with a strong tide and plenty of alligators .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 42]: It was the self-possession of the animal which I admired so much , swinging in the air in so unusual a position for an elephant , he was as collected as if he had been roaming in his own wild forests .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 45]: He arrived and was disembarked at Rangoon , and it was an amusement to me , whenever I could find time to watch this animal , and two others much smaller in size who were with him ; but he was my particular pet .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 18]: Perhaps the reader will like to have the diary of an elephant when not on active service .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 22]: At what time animals get up who never lie down without being ordered , it is not very easy to say .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 42]: The elephants are stalled at the foot of some large tree , which shelters them during the day from the extreme heat of the sun ; they stand under this tree , to which they are chained by their hind legs .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 90]: Early in the morning the keeper makes his appearance from his hovel , and throws the respective keys down to the elephants , who immediately unlock the padlocks of the chains , cast themselves loose , and in the politest manner return the keys to the keeper ; they then march off with him to the nearest forest , and on their arrival commence breaking down the branches of the trees , selecting those which are most agreeable to their palates , and arranging them in two enormous faggots .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 67]: When they have collected as much as they think they require , they make withies and bind up their two faggots , and then twist another to connect the two , so as to hang them over their backs down on each side , and having thus made their provision , they return home ; the keeper may or may not be present during this performance .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 17]: All depends upon whether the elephants are well trained , and have been long in servitude .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 46]: Upon their return , the elephants pass the chains again round their legs , lock the padlock , and present the key as before ; they then amuse themselves with their repast , eating all the leaves and tender shoots , and rejecting the others .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 71]: Now when an elephant has had enough to eat , he generally selects a long bough , and pulling off all the lateral branches , leaves a bush at the end forming a sort of whisk to keep off the flies and mosquitoes ; for although the hide of the elephant is very thick , still it is broken into crannies and cracks , into which the vermin insert themselves .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 94]: Sometimes they have the following ingenious method of defending themselves against these tormentors -- they put the end of their trunk down in the dust , draw up as large a quantity as they can , and turning their trunks over their heads , pour it out over their skin , powdering and filling up the interstices , after which they take the long branch I have before mentioned , and amuse themselves by flapping it right and left , and in all directions about their bodies , wherever the insects may settle .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 23]: And now for an instance of self-denial , which I have often witnessed on the part of my friend the large elephant .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 38]: I have observed him very busy , flapping right and flapping left , evidently much annoyed by the persecution of the mosquitoes ; by-the-by , no one can have an idea how hard the tiger-mosquito can bite .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 102]: I will , however , give an instance of it , for the truth of which I can not positively vouch ; but I remember that once , when it rained torrents , and we were on a boating expedition , a marine who , to keep his charge dry , had his fore-finger inserted in the barrel of his musket , pulled it out in a great hurry , exclaiming to his comrade , `` May I be shot , Bill , if one of them beggars ha 'n' t bit me right through the barrel of my musket . ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 11]: This _ par parenthese _ , and now to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 75]: As I said before , the elephant showed , by constant flagellation of his person , that he was much annoyed by his persecutors , and just at that time , the keeper brought a little naked black thing , as round as a ball , which in India I believe they call a child , laid it down before the animal with two words in Hindostanee -- '' _ Watch it _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 8]: and then walked away into the town .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 68]: The elephant immediately broke off the larger part of the bough , so as to make a smaller and more convenient whisk , and directed his whole attention to the child , gently fanning the little lump of Indian ink , and driving away every mosquito which came near it ; this he continued for upwards of two hours regardless of himself , until the keeper returned .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 12]: It was really a beautiful sight , and causing much reflection .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 63]: Here was a monster , whose bulk exceeded that of the infant by at least two thousand times , acknowledging that the image of his Maker , even in its lowest degree of perfection , was divine ; silently proving the truth of the sacred announcement , that God had `` given to man dominion over the beasts of the field . ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 32]: And here , too , was a brute animal setting an example of devotion and self-denial , which but few Christians , none indeed but a mother , could have practised .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 23]: Would Fowell Buxton , surrounded by a host of mosquitoes , have done as much for a fellow-creature , white or black ?
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 42]: not he ; he would have flapped his own thighs , his own ears , his own face , and his own every thing , and have left his neighbours to take care of themselves ; nor would I blame him .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 35]: As I am on the subject , I may as well inform my readers how and in which way this elephant and I parted company , for it was equally characteristic of the animal .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 19]: The army was ordered to march , and the elephants were called into requisition to carry the tents .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 101]: The quarter-master general , the man with four eyes , as the natives called him , because he wore spectacles , superintended the loading of the animals -- tent upon tent was heaped upon my friend , who said nothing , till at last he found that they were overdoing the thing , and then he roared out his complaints , which the keeper explained ; but there was still one more tent to be carried , and , therefore , as one more or less could make no difference , it was ordered to be put upon his back .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 11]: The elephant said no more , but he turned sulky .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 19]: Enough was as good as a feast with him , and he considered this treatment as no joke .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 98]: Now it so happened that at the time the main street , and the only street of the town , which was at least half a mile long , was crowded to suffocation with tattoos , or little ponies , and small oxen , every one of them loaded with a couple of cases of claret , or brandy , or something else , slung on each side of them , attended by coolies , who , with their hooting , and pushing , and beating , and screaming , created a very bustling and lively scene .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 214]: When the last tent was put on the elephant he was like a mountain with canvass on each side of him , bulging out to a width equal to his own ; there was just room for him to pass through the two rows of houses on each side of the street , and not ten inches to spare ; he was ordered by the keeper to go on -- he obeyed the order certainly , but in what way -- he threw his trunk up in the air , screamed a loud shriek of indignation , and set off at a trot , which was about equal in speed to a horse 's gallop , right down the street , mowing down before him every pony , bullock , and coolie that barred his passage ; the confusion was indescribable , all the little animals were with their legs in the air , claret and brandy poured in rivulets down the streets , coolies screamed as they threw themselves into the doors and windows ; and at one fell swoop the angry gentle man demolished the major part of the comforts of the officers , who were little aware how much they were to sacrifice for the sake of an extra tent .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 35]: With my eyes I followed my friend in his reckless career , until he was enveloped and hid from my view in a cloud of dust , and that was my farewell of him .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 28]: I turned round , and observed close to me the quarter-master general , looking with all his _ four eyes _ at the effects of his inhumanity .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 15]: But I have wandered some twenty thousand miles from Brussels , and must return .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 5]: Brussels , May 5 .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 58]: His Belgian Majesty , the Belgian ministers , Belgian ambassadors , Belgian authorities , and all the Belgian nobility and gentry , all the English who reside in Brussels for economy and quiet , and all the exiles and propaganda who reside here to kick up a row , have all left Brussels by the Porte d'Anvers .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 22]: And all the Belgians who live at Brussels have shut up their shops , and gone out by the Porte d'Anvers .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 20]: And the whole populace , men , women , and children , have gone out of the Porte d'Anvers .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 18]: And all the infants have also gone , because the mothers could not leave them at home .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 46]: And the generals , and their staffs , and the officers , and all the troops , and all the artillery , have also left Brussels , and gone out at the Porte d'Anvers , to keep the said populace quiet and in good order .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 21]: So that there is no one left at Brussels , and Brussels must for one day take care of itself .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 27]: And now you of course wish to know why they have all left Brussels , and further , why they have gone through the Porte d'Anvers .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 145]: Because there is this day the commemoration of the inauguration of the _ Chemin de Fer _ , which has just been completed from Brussels to Malines , and which is on this day to be opened , that is to say , that three steam tugs , whose names are the Stephenson , the Arrow , and the Elephant , are to drag to Malines and back again in the presence of his majesty , all his majesty 's ministers , all the ambassadors who choose to go , all the heads of the departments , and every body else who can produce a satisfactory yellow ticket , which will warrant their getting into one of the thirty-three omnibuses , diligences , or cars , which are attached to the said three steam-tugs , the Arrow , the Stephenson , and the Elephant .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 22]: I shall go and see it -- I will not remain at Brussels by myself , the `` last man . ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 3]: May 6 .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 18]: It was a brilliant affair , and went off well , because the trains went on well .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 36]: We were tugged through twelve miles of the most fertile pasture in the universe , the whole line of road so crowded with spectators , as to make evident the extreme populousness of the country .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 43]: For the first mile it was one mass of people -- and a Belgian crowd has a very agreeable effect , from the prevailing colours being blue and white , which are very refreshing , and contrast pleasantly with the green background .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 66]: Every man had his blouse , and every woman her cap and straw bonnet ; but if the Belgians look well _ en masse _ , I can not say that they do so in detail : the men we do not expect much from , but the women are certainly the plainest race in the whole world -- I will not except the Africans .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 86]: In some of our men-of-war it was formerly the custom to have an old knife , which was passed from one to the other , as the men joined the ship , being handed to the ugliest man they could find ; he held the knife until another came , more unfortunate in physiognomy than himself , when it was immediately made over to the last , who was obliged in his turn to retain it until he could discover some one even more unprepossessing .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 50]: Following up this principle with the women of Belgium , and comparing them with other European states , they are most unequivocally entitled to hold the knife , and unless they improve by crossing the breed , I am afraid they will have it in their possession for centuries .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 26]: We arrived safe at Malines , and I was infinitely amused at the variety of astonishment in the five hundred thousand faces which we passed .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 48]: In one rich meadow I beheld a crowd of Roman Catholic priests , who looked at the trains in such a manner as if they thought that they were `` heretical and damnable , '' and that the Chemin de Fer was nothing but the Chemin d'Enfer .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 32]: At Malines we all got out , walked to a stone pillar , where a speech was made to the sound of martial music , and we all got in again .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 39]: And then to show the power of his engines , Mr Stephenson attached all the cars , omnibuses , and diligences together , and directed the Elephant to take us back without assistance from the other two engines .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 19]: So the Elephant took us all in tow , and away we went at a very fair pace .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 52]: It must have been a very beautiful sight to those who were looking on the whole train in one line , covered with red cloth and garlands of roses with white canopies over head , and decorated with about three hundred Belgian flags , of yellow , red , and black .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 134]: However , the huge animal who dragged this weight of eighty tons became thirsty at Ville Vorde , and cast us off -- it took him half an hour to drink -- that is to say , to take in water , and then he set off again , and we arrived safely at Brussels , much to the delight of those who were in the cars and also of his majesty , and all his ministers , and all his authorities , and all the mercantile classes , who consider that the millennium is come , but very much to the disappointment of the lower classes , who have formed the idea that the _ Chemin de Fer _ will take away their bread , and who therefore longed for a blow-up .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 30]: And Mr Stephenson having succeeded in bringing back in safety his decorated cars , has been _ decore _ himself , and is now a Chevalier de l'Ordre Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 24]: Would not the _ Iron _ order of the Belgian patriots have been more appropriate as a _ Chemin de Fer _ decoration ?
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 125]: It is impossible to contemplate any steam-engine , without feeling wonder and admiration at the ingenuity of man ; but this feeling is raised to a degree of awe when you look at a locomotive engine -- there is such enormous power compressed into so small a space -- I never can divest myself of the idea that it is possessed of _ vitality _ -- that it is a living as well as a moving being -- and that idea , joined with its immense power , conjures up in my mind that it is some spitting , fizzing , terrific demon , who , if he could escape control , would be ready and happy to drag us by thousands to destruction .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 18]: And will this powerful invention prove to mankind a _ blessing _ or a _ curse _ ?
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 28]: -- like the fire which Prometheus stole from heaven to vivify his statue , may it not be followed by the evils of Pandora 's fatal casket ?
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 21]: The lower classes of Belgium have formed an idea that the introduction of steam is to take away their bread .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 18]: Let us examine whether there is not in this idea a degree of instinctive and prophetic truth .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 30]: The axiom of our political economists is , that the grand object to be sought and obtained is to produce the greatest possible results by the smallest possible means .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 43]: The axiom , as an axiom by itself , is good ; but the axiom to be opposed to it is , that the well-being and happiness of any state depends upon obtaining full employment for the whole industry of the people .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 7]: The population of Belgium is enormous .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 13]: In England we calculate about eighteen hundred souls to the square league .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 15]: In Belgium it amounts to three thousand eight hundred souls to the square league .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 114]: Now it would be impossible for Belgium to support this population , were it not , in the first place , for her extensive manufactories , -LRB- for upon the cotton manufactories alone , in which steam is as yet but partially introduced , two hundred and fifty thousand souls depend for their existence , -RRB- and in the second place , from the subdivision of the land in small portions , arising from the laws of inheritance , which bar the right of primogeniture ; the consequence of which is , that the major part of Belgium is cultivated by spade husbandry , and is in the very highest state of fertility .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 32]: Nevertheless , the proportion of those who receive relief in Belgium from public institutions and private charities of all descriptions amounts even at present to _ one in eight persons _ .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 33]: Now , allowing that the steam-engine should be generally introduced into this country , the consequence must be , that machinery will supply the place , and do the work of man .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 7]: And what may be the result ?
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 17]: that thousands will be thrown out of employment , and must be supported by the nation .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 38]: When the population is so dense that there is not room for the labour of its present inhabitants , it is clear that the introduction of machinery can have but one effect -- that of increasing pauperism .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 19]: Are not , then , the Belgians right in thinking that it will deprive them of their bread ?
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 52]: That machinery has already had that effect to a certain degree in England can not be denied ; and not only our manufacturing , but our agricultural population , have been distressed from an adherence to the same principle , of obtaining the greatest possible results from the smallest possible means .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 16]: The subdivision of land will do more to relieve the agricultural distress than anything else .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 34]: At present large farms are preferred both by landlord and tenant , because a large farm can be cultivated with a fewer number of men and horses ; but how does this act ?
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 17]: It throws a certain quantity of labourers out of employ , who are supported in idleness .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 27]: Is the sum gained by farmers by employing fewer men on large farms more than their proportion of the poor 's rates paid for unproductive industry ?
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 44]: That it may be more to the farmers is possible , as they shift a great part of the onus upon others ; but to the nation it certainly is not -- for the man who does not work must still be fed .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 11]: May we not then consider the following propositions as correct ?
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 33]: That , producing the greatest possible results from the least possible means , is an axiom which can only hold good when it does not interfere with the industry of the people .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 24]: That , as long as the whole population are employed , such powers become a benefit , and a source of extra wealth .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 44]: But that , in proportion as it throws the population out of employment , so much the more does it prove an injury , and must finally lead to a state of things which must end in riot , anarchy , and confusion .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 16]: _ Quod est demonstrandum _ -- I hope it will not be in our time .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 2]: Antwerp .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 73]: Every one has heard of the cathedral at Antwerp and the fine pictures by Rubens -- every one has heard of the siege of Antwerp and General Chasse , and how the French marched an army of non-intervention down to the citadel , and took it from the Dutch -- and every one has heard how Lord Palmerston protocol-ed while Marshal Gerard bombard-ed -- and how it was all bombard and bombast .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 42]: The name of Lord Palmerston reminds me that conversing after dinner with some Belgians , the topic introduced was the great dearth of diplomatic talent in a country like England , where talent was in every other department so extremely prominent .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 18]: It was not the first time that this subject had been canvassed in my presence by foreigners .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 30]: Naturally envious of our general superiority , it is with them a favourite point of attack ; and they are right , as it certainly is our weakest point .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 49]: They can not disparage our army , or our navy , or our constitution ; but they can our climate , which is not our fault , but our misfortune ; and our diplomacy , which is our fault , and has too often proved our misfortune also .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 55]: It certainly is the fact , that our diplomatic corps are very inferior , and this can arise but from one cause ; the emoluments which have been attached to it having rendered admission into it an advantage eagerly sought by the higher classes as a provision for the junior branches of their families .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 83]: Of course , this provision has been granted to those to whom government have felt most indebted for support , without the least regard to the important point as to whether those who were admitted were qualified or not ; so that the mere providing for a younger son of an adherent to the government may have proved in the end to have cost the country millions from the incompetence of the party when placed in a situation requiring tact and discrimination .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 33]: This evil is increased by the system of filling up the vacant appointments according to seniority -- the exploded and absurd custom of `` each second being heir unto the first . ''
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 57]: Should any man have proved , upon an emergency , that he was possessed of the highest talent for diplomacy , it will avail him nothing -- he never , under the present system , will be employed -- he can not be admitted into the corps without having entered as a private secretary or attache .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 33]: It would be monstrous , unheard _ of _ ; and the very idea would throw Lord Aberdeen on the one side , or Lord Palmerston on the other , into convulsions .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 16]: Is it therefore to be wondered at our being so deficient in our diplomatic corps ?
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 27]: Surely if any point more than another requires revision and reform , it is this ; and the nation has a right to insist upon it .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 37]: It may be asked , what are the most peculiar qualities necessary in a diplomatist , taking it for granted that he has talents , education , and a thorough knowledge of the routine of business ?
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 80]: The only term which we can give to this ` desideratum is ' presence of mind -- not the presence of mind required in danger , but that presence of _ mind _ which enables him , when a proposition is made , at once to seize all its bearings , the direction to which it tends , and the ultimate object -LRB- for that will always be concealed at first -RRB- which the proposer may have in view .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 26]: Diplomatists , when they enter the field , are much in the situation of two parties , one defending and the other attacking a stronghold .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 52]: Admissions are highly dangerous , as they enable the adversary to throw up his first parallels ; and too often , when you imagine that the enemy is not one jot advanced , you find that he has worked through a covered way , and , you are summoned to surrender .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 55]: It is strange that , at the very time that they assert that it would be impossible to employ those as diplomatists who have not been regularly trained to the service , officers in the army , and captains in the navy are continually so employed , and often under circumstances of vital importance .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 37]: Now it would be supposed that the latter of all people they must be the most unfit ; as , generally speaking , they are sent to sea , _ as unfit for anything else _ .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 18]: But it appears that once commanding a frigate , they are supposed to be fit for everything .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 36]: A vessel is ordered for `` particular service , '' why so called I know not , except that there may be an elision , and it means `` particularly _ disagreeable _ service . ''
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 59]: The captain is directed by the Admiralty to consider himself under the orders of the Foreign Office , and he receives a huge pile of documents , numbered , scheduled , and red-taped -LRB- as Bulwer says in his pamphlet -RRB- , the contents of which he is informed are to serve as a guide for his proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 30]: He reads them over with all their verbiage and technicalities , sighs for Cobbett 's pure Saxon , and when he has finished , feels not a little puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 29]: Document Number 4 contradicting document Number 12 , and document Number 1 opposed to Number 66 ; that is , as _ he _ reads and understands English .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 37]: Determined to understand them if possible , he takes a dose of protocol every morning , until he has nearly learnt them by heart , and then acts to the best of his knowledge and belief .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 36]: And it is undeniable that , with very few exceptions , the navy have invariably given satisfaction to the Foreign Office when they have been so employed , and often under circumstances of peculiar difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 32]: I have heard , from the best authority , that military men have also been equally successful , although they have not so often been called into `` particular service . ''
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 45]: By the bye , particular service is all done at the same price as general service in his Majesty 's navy , which is rather unfair , as we are obliged to find our own red tape , pens , ink , and stationery .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 64]: As I was walking on the glacis with a friend , he pointed out to me at a window an enormous fat man smoking his pipe , and told me that he had been in the Dutch service under William of Orange ; but not being a very good hand at a forced march , he had been reduced with others to half-pay .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 49]: He had not been many months in retirement when he went to the palace , and requested an audience of his Majesty , and , when admitted , stated that he had come to request that his Majesty would be pleased to put him again upon full pay .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 41]: His Majesty raised many objections , and stated his inability to comply with his request ; upon which the corpulent officer exclaimed , embracing with his arms as far as he could , his enormous paunch , `` My God !
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 22]: your Majesty , how can you imagine that I can fill this big belly of mine with only my half-pay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 29]: This _ argumentum ad ventrem _ so tickled King William , that he was put on _ full pay unattached _ , and has continued so ever since .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 21]: The first instance I ever heard of a _ man _ successfully pleading as ladies do at the Old Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 19]: It is hard for a wanderer from childhood like me , to find out anything new or interesting .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 16]: I have travelled too much and have seen too much -- I seldom now admire .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 32]: I draw comparisons , and the comparison drawn between the object before my eyes , and that in my mind 's eye , is unfortunately usually in favour of the latter .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 59]: He who hath visited so many climes , mingled with so many nations , attempted so many languages , and who has hardly anything left but the North Pole or the crater of Vesuvius to choose between ; if he still longs for something new , may well cavil at the pleasures of memory as a mere song .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 21]: In proportion as the memory is retentive , so is decreased one of the greatest charms of existence -- novelty .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 21]: To him who hath seen much , there is little left but comparison , and are not comparisons universally odious ?
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 41]: Not that I complain , for I have a resource -- I can fly to imagination -- quit this every-day world , and in the region of fiction create new scenes and changes , and people these with new beings .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 23]: Moreover , there is still endless variety , endless amusement , and food for study and contemplation , in our own species .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 22]: In all countries still the same , yet ever varying : -- `` The proper study of mankind is man . ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 20]: From which , I presume , we are to infer that it is time thrown away to study woman .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 55]: At the same party in which the conversation was raised relative to diplomacy , a person with whom I was , until that day , wholly unacquainted , was sitting by me , and as it happened , the name of one with whom I had long been on terms of intimacy was mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 7]: `` Do you know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 10]: said my neighbour , with a very peculiar expression .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 18]: I replied that I had occasionally met him , for I thought there was something coming forward .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 18]: `` Well , all I can say is , that he is rather a strange person . ''
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 10]: replied I ; `` how do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 16]: `` Why , they say , that he is of a very uncertain temper . ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 16]: continued I , with the same look of inquiry , as if demanding more information .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 11]: `` Yes , yes , rather a dangerous man . ''
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 7]: `` Do you know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 6]: inquired I , in return .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 22]: `` Yes ; that is to say -- not very intimately -- the fact is , that I have avoided it .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 20]: I grant that he is a very clever man -- but I hear that he quarrels with everybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 7]: `` Who told you so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 4]: replied I. Oh !
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 12]: he was not authorised to give the name of the person .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 18]: `` Then , '' replied I , `` allow me to say that you have been misinformed .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 46]: I have been on intimate terms with that person for nearly twenty years , during which he never quarrelled with me or any one that I know of ; although , I grant , he is not over civil to those whom he may despise .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 29]: The only part of your communication which is correct is , that he is a very clever man , and our government are of the same opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 17]: My neighbour was discomfited , and said no more , and I joined the general conversation .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 86]: What may have been his cause of dislike I know not -- but I have frequently remarked , that if a man has made himself enemies either from neglect of that sophistry and humbug , so necessary to enable him to roll down the stream of time with his fellows without attrition , if they can find no point in his character to assail , their last resort is , to assert that he is an uncertain tempered man , and not to be trusted .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 23]: This is the last , and although not the most empoisoned , still the surest shaft in the whole quiver of calumny .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 22]: It does not exactly injure the character , but it induces others to avoid the acquaintance of the party so misrepresented .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 50]: It is rather singular , and perhaps I may have been fortunate , but in more than half-a-dozen instances I have found the very parties to whom this character has been given , although high-minded and high-spirited , the very antithesis to the character which has been assigned them .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 24]: That some do deserve the character is undoubted -- but there is no species of calumny to be received with such peculiar caution .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 26]: It may be right to be on your guard , but it never should be the ground for a positive avoidance of the party accused .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 58]: Indeed , in some degree , it argues in his favour , for it is clear that the whole charge they can bring against his character is an infirmity to which we are all more or less subjected ; and he who looks for perfection in his acquaintance or his friends , will inevitably meet with disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 2]: Brussels .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 7]: I have lost all my memoranda !
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 8]: I can not find them any where .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 34]: Well -- children are a great blessing when they are kept in the nursery -- but they certainly do interfere a little with a papa who has the misfortune to be an author .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 33]: I little thought , when my youngest girl brought me up a whole string of paper dolls , hanging together by the arms , that they had been cut off my memoranda .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 61]: But so it was ; and when I had satisfactorily established the fact , and insisted upon an inquisition to recover my invaluables , I found that they had had an auto-da-fe , and that the whole string of dolls , which contained on their petticoats my whole string of bewitching ideas , had been burnt like so many witches .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 15]: But as the man said in the packet -- `` Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 4]: Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 59]: -- they come rushing in like a torrent , bounding , skipping , laughing , and screaming , till I fancied myself like another Orpheus , about to be torn to pieces by Bacchanals -LRB- they are all girls -RRB- , and I laid down my pen , for they drive all my ideas out of my head .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 22]: May your shadows never grow less , mes enfans , but I wish you would not make such a cursed row .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 11]: The author and the author of existence do not amalgamate .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 5]: That 's a fact .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 75]: Their joyous countenances are answered by a look of despair -- their boiling-water heat drives my thermometer down to zero -- their confounded merriment gives me a confounded headache -- their animal spirits drive me to vegetable spirits -- their cup of bliss running over makes me also require a bumper -- brandy restores the equilibrium , and I contrive to get rid of them and my headache about one and the same time .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 66]: Talking about brandy -- one morning at two o'clock , about the witching time that ghosts do glide about in churchyards , as I was thinking whether it would not be better to go to bed instead of writing nonsense , in which opinion most of my readers may coincide with me , in stalked three young men who were considerably the worse for potation .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 63]: There is a great deal of character in inebriety -- at the same time that no estimate of character can be made from its effects ; for we often find the most quiet men when sober to be the most choleric in their cups -- but still there is character , and much that is curious in witnessing its variety of effects .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 104]: Now these young men were each drunk in a very different war -- the first , in a way quite novel ; for although he could preserve his equilibrium , and stare immensely , he had lost the power of speech ; you saw his lips move , but no articulation or sound succeeded -- the second was laughing drunk ; everything that was said , either by himself or by any one else , was magnified into a pun or a _ bon mot _ -- the third , with whom I had no previous acquaintance , was _ politely _ drunk .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 29]: I presume the idea of intruding himself upon a stranger , at such an unseasonable hour , had produced that effect -- but let me describe the scene .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 7]: `` Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 9]: we come to you -- ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 2]: capital .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 13]: We want some brandy and water ; and , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 19]: we know you always keep a stock , '' said the second , seating himself in an armchair .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 38]: The first also took a chair , moved his lips for a few seconds , and then sat bolt upright , staring at the two candles ; how many he counted I can not pretend to say .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 57]: `` Really , '' said Number Three , `` we are -- I 'm afraid -- taking a great liberty -- a very great liberty ; but -- an apology is certainly due -- if you will allow me to offer an apology for my two friends -- will you allow me to introduce them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 17]: `` Many thanks , but I have the pleasure of knowing _ them _ already . ''
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 15]: `` I really beg your pardon -- it was quite unintentional on my part .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 7]: I trust you are not offended ?
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 8]: Will you allow me to introduce myself ?
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 10]: I am Captain C -- , of the -- .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 23]: Will you permit me to present my card , and to say how happy I shall be to make your acquaintance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 20]: So saying , the third gentleman presented me with his card , and returned the card-case into his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 4]: `` Capital ! ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 4]: cried Number Two .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 7]: `` Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 11]: what an excellent joke , ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 6]: Now for the brandy-and-water . ''
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 54]: This was soon produced , and although Number One had lost all articulation , he had still the power of deglutition ; he filled his glass , sat up more erect , stared at the candles , and drank his grog ; the other did the same , when Number Three again spoke .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 25]: `` My dear Sir , I hope you will excuse the liberty , but my name is Captain C -- , of the -- .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 25]: Will you allow me the honour of presenting my card , and of saying how proud I shall be to make your acquaintance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 17]: So saying , he presented me another card , which I put aside with the first .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 7]: `` Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 10]: what a good joke , to find you up .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 13]: I said we should get brandy-and-water here ; was n't that capital ?
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 10]: -- ha , ha , ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 68]: I could not exactly see the joke of being kept up for perhaps two more hours , but I begged they would refill their glasses , as the sitting would be sooner ended one way or the other -- either by the bottle being empty , or their falling under the table -- I did not care which -- when I was again addressed by Number Three .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 26]: `` I really beg your pardon , but -- I 'm afraid I have been very remiss -- will you allow me to introduce myself ?
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 10]: I am Captain C -- , of the -- .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 26]: Here is my card , and I can not say how happy I shall be if I may have the honour of your acquaintance . ''
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 12]: I bowed a third time , and received a third card .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 10]: `` By heavens , I 've finished my tumbler !
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 5]: Ai n't that capital ?
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 10]: famous fun ; -- and so has Alfred . ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 18]: `` Famous fun , indeed , '' thought I , as the contents of the bottle disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 22]: `` And Alfred is going to help himself again ; well , that is capital , ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 7]: -- ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 10]: -- ha , ha , ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 44]: Alfred , who was Number One , moved his lips , but like the frozen horn of Munchausen , sounds would not come out ; he did , however , follow up the joke , by refilling his tumbler for the third time .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 38]: `` Upon my honour , I 've been very rude , I ought to apologise , '' said Number Three , again drawing out his card-case ; `` but will you allow me to offer my card ?
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 22]: I am Captain C -- , of the -- , and I shall be most happy to make your acquaintance . ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 10]: I bowed again , and received the fourth card .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 46]: Thus were the changes rung by numbers , one , two , and three , until I was tired out , two bottles more drank out , and I had received fifteen cards from my very polite friend , whom I had never seen before .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 9]: At four o'clock they all rose to depart .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 28]: `` Upon my soul , I do believe I 'm drunk , '' said Number Two ; `` capital joke -- ha , ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 32]: Number One continued dumb , brandy had not thawed him ; but he stared very hard at me , as much as to say , I would speak if I could .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 19]: Number Three put into my hand the sixteenth card , and made a rash attempt at a bow .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 19]: Having seen them fairly outside my door , I bolted it , saying with Shakespeare -- `` O !
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 17]: that a man Should put an enemy in his mouth To steal away his brains ! ''
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 22]: I have been this morning to visit an establishment founded by two brothers , of the name of Van der Maelen .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 26]: It comprehends natural history , botany , geography , and statistics , and they have , moreover , a lithographic press for maps and plates .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 11]: It is a very curious , and very spirited undertaking .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 24]: As yet , the whole has been effected by their own means , which are extensive , and without any assistance from government .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 12]: How few people in this world employ their money so usefully !
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 32]: This establishment is but yet in its infancy , and the collections are not very valuable , although rapidly increasing , from the interest felt by every one in its welfare .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 48]: Of all collections of natural history , the fossil department is , to me , the most interesting ; there is room for speculation and reflection , till the mind is lost in its own wanderings , which I consider one of the greatest delights of existence .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 59]: We are indebted to the vast , comprehensive mind , and indefatigable labour of Cuvier , for the gleams of light which have lately burst upon us , and which have rendered what was before mere speculative supposition now a source of interesting and anxious investigation , attended with results that are as satisfactory as they are undeniable .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 57]: That there was a period when the surface of the earth was almost entirely covered with water -- a state between chaos and order , when man was not yet created -LRB- for that then the world had not yet been rendered by the Almighty a fit receptacle for man -RRB- , appears to be undoubted .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 34]: Yet the principle of life had been thrown forth by the Almighty hand , and monsters had been endowed with vitality , and with attributes necessary for their existence upon an intermediate world .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 47]: These were the many varieties of the Ichthyosauri and the Plesiosauri , of whose remains we have now such abundant specimens -- all animals of the lizard species ; some supposed to have been supplied with wings , like the flying fish of the present day .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 54]: But imagine an animal of the lizard species , one hundred and twenty feet long -- imagine such a monster -- the existence of which is now proved beyond a cavil , by the remains , deeply imbedded in the hard blue lias rocks , and which remains are now in our possession .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 9]: What a terrific monster it must have been !
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 31]: We look with horror at an alligator of twenty or thirty feet , but imagine an animal of that species extending his huge bulk to one hundred and twenty feet .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 53]: Were they all destroyed when the waters were separated from the hand , or did they gradually become extinct when the earth was no longer a suitable habitation for them , and no longer congenial to those properties with which they had been endowed when ordered into existence by the Almighty power ?
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 67]: The description of the Behemoth , by Job , has long been a puzzle to the learned ; we have no animal of the present time winch will answer to it , but in many points , this description will answer to what may be supposed would be the appearance , the muscular power , and the habits of this huge denizen of a former world .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 11]: `` His force is in the navel of his belly .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 8]: He moveth his tail like a cedar .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 9]: His bones are as strong pieces of brass .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 8]: His bones are like bars of iron .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 15]: He lieth under the shady trees in the covert of the reeds and fens .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 9]: The shady trees cover him with their shadow .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 10]: The willows of the brook compass him about . ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 61]: It may be a matter of deep surmise , whether all animals were created as we now find them , that is , whether the first creation was final -- or how far the unerring hand has permitted a change to take place in the forms and properties of animals , so as to adapt them to their peculiar situations .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 42]: I would say , whether the Almighty may not have allowed the principle of vitality and life to assume , at various epochs , the form and attributes most congenial to the situation , either by new formation or by change .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 22]: May not the monster of former worlds have dwindled down to the alligator of this -- the leviathan to the whale ?
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 16]: Let us examine whether we have any proofs in existing creation to support this supposition .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 118]: We all know that the hair of the goat and sheep in the torrid zones will be changed into wool when they are taken to the colder climes , and that the reverse will also take place -- we know that the hare and weazel tribes , whose security is increased from their colour so nearly approaching to that of the earth in temperate latitudes , have the same protection afforded to them when they are found in the regions of snow , by their changing to white -- and we know that the _ rete mucosum _ of the African enables him to bear the exposure to a tropical sun , which would destroy an European .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 11]: But this is not sufficient , we must examine further .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 71]: Sir Humphry Davy has given us a very interesting account of a small animal found in the pools of water in the caves in Carniola ; this animal is called the _ Proteus Anguinus _ or Syren : it is a species of eel with two feet -- a variety only to be found in these caves -- it lives in darkness , and exposure to the light destroys it .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 75]: Now , here is an animal which we must either suppose to have been created at the universal creation -- and that is to suppose that these caves and pools of water have also existed from the time of the creation -- or that the principle of vitality has been permitted , at a later date , to take that form and those attributes congenial to its situation : it is a curious problem .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 206]: Again , it is well known that in the continent of New Holland there are animals who have a property peculiar to that continent alone -- that of a pouch or false stomach , to contain their young after their birth ; it has been surmised that at one time the major part of that continent was under water , and that this pouch was supplied to them for the safety of their young ; nor is this conjecture without strong grounds ; if only the kangaroo and opossum tribes , which are animals peculiarly indigenous to that continent , were supplied with this peculiar formation , the conjecture would fall to the ground , as it might fairly be said that this property was only another proof of the endless variety in creation ; but the most remarkable fact is , that not only the kangaroo and opossum , animals indigenous and peculiar to that portion of the globe , but that very variety of squirrel , rat , and mouse , which in every other respect are of the same species as those found in the other continents , are all of them provided with this peculiar false pouch to contain their young .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 19]: Why , therefore , should all these have been supplied with it , if not for a cause ?
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 40]: And the question now arises , whether at the first creation they had that pouch , or were permitted so far to change their formation , when the pouch became necessary for the preservation and continuation of these species ?
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 40]: That these changes are the changes of centuries , I grant , and therefore are not likely to be observed by man , whose records or whose knowledge are not permitted to be handed down beyond a certain extent .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 44]: Knowledge is not happiness ; and when the accumulation has arrived to that height so as to render it dangerous , it is swept away by the all-wise and benevolent Creator , and we are permitted to begin again _ de novo _ .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 19]: After all , what we term posterity is but a drop of water in the ocean of Time .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 2]: Brussels .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 91]: There are few people in Brussels , indeed in Belgium , who do not complain of the revolution ; all that goes wrong is at once ascribed to this cause -- indeed I was rather staggered by one gentleman , at Ghent , telling me very gravely that they had had no fat oxen since the revolution ; but this he explained by stating that the oxen were fattened from the refuse of several manufactories , all of which had been broken up , the proprietors having quitted for Holland .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 40]: The revolution has certainly been , up to the present time , injurious to both countries , but it is easy to foretell that eventually Belgium will flourish , and Holland , in all probability , be the sufferer .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 45]: The expenses of the latter even now are greater than her revenue , and when the railroads of Belgium have been completed , as proposed , to Vienna , the revenue of Holland will be proportionably decreased from her loss of the carrying trade .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 45]: It may be urged that Holland can also have her railroads -- but she can not : so large a proportion of her population find their support at present on the canals , that a railroad would be productive of the most injurious effects .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 36]: It is true that she can lower her rates of carriage , but the merchant will save ten days of transport by the railroads , and this rapidity of communication will always obtain the preference .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 57]: But whatever may be the future prospects of Belgium , it is certain that , from the heavy expenses attending the support of so large an army , the retirement into Holland of most of the influential and wealthy commercial men , and the defection of almost all the nobility , at present she is suffering .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 32]: Brussels , her capital , has perhaps been most injured , and is no longer the gay and lively town which it was under the dynasty of King William of Nassau .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 99]: When the two countries were united , it was the custom of the Dutch court to divide the year between Brussels and the Hague ; and as there was not only the establishment of the King , but also those of Princes William and Frederick -LRB- in fact three courts -RRB- , as well as all the nobility of Holland and Belgium , there was an overflow of wealth , of company , and of amusement , which rendered Brussels one of the most delightful winter residences on the Continent : but this has now all passed away .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 32]: The court of Leopold , in consequence of the radical party having the entire sway , is but a shadow , as nearly all the Belgian nobility have retired from it .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 54]: The few who reside in town will not visit at the palace , and live in seclusion , receiving no company , and spending no money ; the majority , however , have either removed from Brussels to their country seats , or have left the kingdom to spend their revenue amongst foreigners .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 29]: At present there are but few English here , it being no longer the scene of gaiety , and there are other reasons which gradually decrease the number .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 13]: The fact is , that Brussels is not a very cheap residence .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 37]: The duties on every thing are now enormous , and the shop-keepers prey upon the English as much as they can , having avowedly two prices , one for them and the other for the Belgians .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 30]: There are very few amusements , and the people , since the revolution , are rude and bearish , imagining that by incivility they prove their liberty and independence .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 20]: The other towns of Belgium are very dull and very cheap -- Brussels is very dull and very dear .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 37]: In another point , Brussels presents a contradiction to all the other capitals of Europe , in which you generally find the most polished manners , and the greatest beauty in the female sex , concentrated .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 68]: At Brussels it is directly the reverse -- the men are uncivil and the women plain : whereas in the Belgian provinces you will meet with civility and respect , and at Antwerp , Ostend , and most other provincial towns , fall in with many fine countenances , reminding you of the Spanish blood which has been for centuries mingled with that of the Low Provinces .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 39]: Nevertheless there are many advantages in Brussels : the communication with England is so rapid , and its situation so central , that it may be considered as the point from which travellers diverge on their various routes .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 52]: About the end of May the arrivals and departures from Brussels are constant ; this stream continues to pour through the city for three months , after which , as the Belgians do not mix with the foreign residents , the latter are left entirely to their own resources for amusement .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 21]: But the greatest objection to Brussels is , that the English have brought with them the _ English feeling _ .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 47]: I hardly know how else to term it , but it certainly is a feeling peculiarly English , which has taken deep root within this last half century , and which has already produced much evil , and may eventually be productive of more serious results .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 28]: I refer to the system of spending more money than you can afford , to enable you to hold a certain position in the scale of society .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 27]: For these last forty years , during which immense fortunes have been made in England , there has been a continued struggle of wealth against rank .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 63]: _ Parvenus _ , as the aristocracy have been pleased to call them , have started up in every direction , vying with , and even eclipsing the nobility in lavish expenditure -- in some instances , driving the aristocracy to spend more money than they could afford , and thereby impoverishing them ; in others , forcing admittance into their circles .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 31]: Wealth and public opinion have latterly gained the ascendency , and the aristocracy are now more looked up to on account of their large possessions than of their high birth .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 39]: Now this has been nothing more than a demand for greater liberty and more extended rights on the part of the commoners of England , in proportion as they found themselves a more important body in the state .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 68]: It has not been a case of Magna Charta , but it is still analogous ; for they have demanded that the barrier raised between them and the aristocracy should be thrown down , as soon as they possessed all the advantages , with the exception of that nominal rank , the title too often conferred without discrimination on the one hand or claims on the other .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 78]: As soon as a partial breach had been made in this barrier , -- every one rushed for admittance , displaying wealth as their ticket of admission , and the consequence has been , that wealth has now become the passport into society ; but another consequence has also ensued , which is , that to obtain entrance , almost everybody has been living and keeping up an appearance which has not been warranted by their means .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 64]: Many have exceeded their incomes , and then sunk down into poverty ; others have , perhaps , only lived up to their incomes ; but in so doing , have disappointed those who , induced by the appearance of so much wealth , have married into the family and discovered that they have obtained wives with expensive ideas , and no money .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 27]: But there have been other reasons which have induced some to live beyond their means -- they have done it in the pure spirit of gambling .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 63]: In England , credit , next to money , is of most value , and according to their supposed wealth , so did the parties obtain credit ; an expenditure beyond their means was , therefore , with commercial men , nothing more than a speculation , which very often succeeded , and eventually procured to the parties the means of expenditure .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 88]: It is well known that the income tax , in many cases , was paid double ; commercial men preferring to give in their income at twice its real value , and pay the tax to that amount , that they might be supposed to possess more than they really had ; indeed , as it was imagined that a man would evade so heavy an impost as much as possible , he was generally considered to be worth even more than what he himself had stated .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 41]: It is from these causes that has arisen what I have called the English feeling , for display beyond the means , and which has made our countrymen look down upon those who can not compete with them in expense .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 117]: Let a married couple be ever so well connected -- let them have talent , and every other advantage , it will avail them nothing , if they have not money , sufficient at least to keep a carriage , and not shock the mistress of a house by the sound of the rattling steps of a hackney-coach at her door ; besides which , in our commercial country , the principle of barter , of _ quid pro quo _ , is extended even to dinner and evening parties -- and the reason is obvious -- when people live to the full extent , or even beyond their incomes , a little management is required .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 78]: A dinner-party is so arranged , that the dinners received from others are returned to them , and they can not afford to ask a couple who can not give them a dinner in return , as they would fill up the places of others to whom a dinner is due , and who , if not asked then , must be at another time ; and an extra dinner is an extra expense to be avoided .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 53]: The English therefore , who have only moderate incomes , have the choice , either to live beyond their means , and leave their children unprovided for , or of being shut out from that society , to which every other is but the adventitious claim of wealth , they are entitled .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 51]: The consequence has been that since the peace thousands and thousands have settled on the Continent , that they may make more display with a small income , and thousands more , with a much better feeling , to avoid expense , and lay by a provision for their children .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 68]: Of course all these remarks are made with reservation , but with reservation , it may be said , that in England we have , or soon shall have , only two classes left , the extreme rich and the extreme poor , for the intermediate classes are gradually retiring to the continent , emigrating to Canada and America , or sinking down into the second class .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 25]: This is a most dangerous state of society , and , if carried to the extreme , has always proved ruinous to the state .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 51]: Although the immense extent of the Roman empire may be asserted as the ultimate cause of its downfall , still that downfall was most certainly accelerated by the rottenness at the core , the system of patrons and clients having thrown all the wealth into the hands of a few .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 11]: Are we not rapidly advancing to this state in England ?
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 33]: The landholders are almost at the mercy of the fundholders , who , in fifty years ' time , will probably have possession of the land as well as of the money .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 80]: And should there be no check put to this disintegration of society , then must come what the radicals are now so anxious to obtain , the equitable adjustment -- and in that case it is a problem how far that may not be really _ equitable _ ; for society may , by degrees , arrive to a state so anomalous as to warrant that the few should be sacrificed for the benefit of the community at large .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 5]: Brussels , May 22 .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 30]: Among the _ lions _ of Brussels , a dog was pointed out to me , as he lay on the pavement in front of the House of Assembly .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 25]: It was a miserable looking cur ; but he had a tale extra attached to him , which had magnified him into a lion .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 54]: It was said that he belonged to a Dutch soldier , who was killed in the revolution , at the spot where the dog then lay , and that ever since -LRB- a period of four years -RRB- the animal had taken up his quarters there , and invariably lain upon that spot .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 36]: Whether my informant lied , and the dog did not , I can not pretend to say ; but if the story be true , it was a most remarkable specimen of fidelity and ugliness .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 49]: And he was a sensible dog , moreover ; instead of dying of grief and hunger , as some foolish dogs have done , he has always dedicated an hour every evening to cater for his support , and then returns to pass the night on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 43]: I went up to him , and when within two yards he thought proper to show his teeth , and snarl most dog-matically ; I may therefore , in addition to his other qualities , state that he is an ill-natured dog .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 58]: How far the report was correct , I can not vouch ; but I watched him three or four days , and always found him at his post ; and after such strict investigation , had I asserted ten years instead of four , I have a prescriptive right , as a traveller , to be believed .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 26]: It is singular that it is only in England that you can find dogs , properly so called ; abroad they have nothing but curs .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 29]: I do not know anything more puzzling than the genealogy of the animals you meet with under the denomination of dogs in most of the capitals of Europe .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 48]: It would appear as if the vice of promiscuous and unrestricted intercourse had been copied from their masters ; and I have been almost tempted to take up the opinion , that you may judge of the morality of a capital from the degeneracy of the dogs .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 19]: I have often , at Paris , attempted to make out a descent ; but found it impossible .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 31]: Even the late Sir G Naylor , with all the herald 's office , stimulated by double fees , could not manage to decipher escutcheons obliterated by so many crosses .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 35]: I am very partial to dogs ; and one of my amusements , when travelling , is to watch their meetings with each other ; they appear to me to do everything but speak .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 39]: Indeed , a constant observer will distinguish in dogs many of the passions , virtues , and rices of men ; and it is generally the case , that those of the purest race have the nobler qualifications .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 37]: You will find in them devotion , courage , generosity , good temper , sagacity , and forbearance ; but these virtues , with little alloy , are only to be found in the pure breeds .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 26]: A cur is quite a lottery : he is a most heterogeneous compound of virtue and vice ; and sometimes the amalgamation is truly ludicrous .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 30]: Notwithstanding which , a little scrutiny of his countenance and his peculiar movements will soon enable you to form a very fair estimate of his general character and disposition .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 31]: One of the most remarkable qualities in dogs is the fidelity of their attachments ; and the more so , as their attachments are very often without any warrantable cause .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 38]: For no reason that can be assigned , they will take a partiality to people or animals , which becomes a feeling so dominant , that their existence appears to depend upon its not being interfered with .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 17]: I had an instance of this kind , and the _ parties _ are all living .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 23]: I put up , for an hour or two , at a livery stables in town , a pair of young ponies .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 37]: On my taking them out again , the phaeton was followed by a large coach-dog , about two years old , a fine grown animal , but not well marked , and in very poor condition .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 28]: He followed us into the country ; but having my establishment of dogs -LRB- taxes taken into consideration -RRB- , I ordered him to be shut out .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 44]: He would not leave the iron gates ; and when they were opened , in he bolted , and hastening to the stables , found out the ponies , and was not to be dislodged from under the manger without a determined resistance .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 76]: This alternate bolting in and bolting out continued for many days ; finding that I could not get rid of him , I sent him away forty miles in the country ; but he returned the next day , expressing the most extravagant joy at the sight of the ponies , who , strange to say , were equally pleased , allowing him to put his paws upon them , and bark in their faces .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 76]: But although the ponies were partial to the dog , I was not ; and aware that a voyage is a great specific for curing improper attachments , I sent the dog down the river in a barge , requesting the men to land him where they were bound , on the other side of the Medway ; but in three days the dog again made his appearance , the picture of famine and misery .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 21]: Even the coachman 's heart was melted , and the rights and privileges of his favourite snow-white terrier were forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 58]: It was therefore agreed , in a cabinet council held in the harness room , that we must make the best of it ; and , as the dog would not leave the ponies , the best thing we could do , was to put a little flesh on his bones , and make him look respectable .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 21]: We therefore victualled him that day , and put him on our books with the purser 's name of Pompey .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 22]: Now this dog proved , that sudden as was his attachment to the ponies , it was of the strongest quality .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 11]: He never would and never has since left these animals .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 42]: If turned out in the fields , he remains out with them , night as well as day , taking up his station as near as possible half way between the two , and only coming home to get his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 22]: No stranger can enter their stables with impunity ; for he is very powerful , and on such occasions very savage .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 53]: A year or two after his domiciliation , I sold the ponies , and the parties who purchased were equally anxious at first to get rid of the dog ; but their attempts , like mine , were unavailing , and , like me , they at last became reconciled to him .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 20]: On my return from abroad , I re-purchased them , and Pompey of course was included in the purchase .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 26]: We are none of us perfect -- and Pompey had one vice ; but the cause of the vice almost changed it into a virtue .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 33]: He had not a correct feeling relative to _ meum _ and _ tuum _ , but still he did not altogether steal for himself , but for his friends as well .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 41]: Many have witnessed the fact of the dog stealing a loaf , or part of one , taking it into the stables , and dividing it into three portions , one for each pony , and the other for himself .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 41]: I recollect his once walking off with a round of beef , weighing seventeen or eighteen pounds , and taking it to the ponies in the field -- they smelt at it , but declined joining him in his repast .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 43]: By-the-bye , to prove that lost things will turn up some day or another , there was a silver skewer in the beef , which was not recovered until two years afterwards , when it was turned up by the second ploughing .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 42]: One day , as the ponies were in the field where I was watching some men at work , I heard them narrating to a stranger the wonderful feats of this dog , for I have related but a small portion .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 34]: The dog was lying by the ponies as usual , when the servants ' dinner-bell rang , and off went Pompey immediately at a hard gallop to the house to get his food .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 38]: `` Well , dang it , but he is a queer dog , '' observed the man , `` for now he 's running as fast as he can , to _ answer the bell _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 3]: May 23 .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 47]: With all the faults of the Roman church , it certainly appears to me that its professors extend towards those who are in the bosom of their own church a greater share than most other sects , of the true spirit of every religion -- charity .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 31]: The people of the Low Countries are the most bigoted Catholics at present existing , and in no one country is there so much private as well as public charity .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 12]: It is , however , to private charity that I refer .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 23]: In England there is certainly much to be offered in extenuation , as charity is extorted by law to the utmost farthing .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 43]: The baneful effects of the former poor laws have been to break the links which bound together the upper and lower classes , produced by protection and good will in the former , and in the latter , by respect and gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 50]: Charity by act of parliament has dissolved the social compact -- the rich man grumbles when he pays down the forced contribution -- while the poor man walks into the vestry with an insolent demeanour , and claims relief , not as a favour , but as a right .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 102]: The poor laws have in themselves the essence of revolution , for if you once establish the right of the poor man to any portion of the property of the rich , you admit a precedent so far dangerous , that the poor may eventually decide for themselves what portion it may be that they may be pleased to take ; and this becomes the more dangerous , as it must be remembered , that the effect of the poor laws is _ repulsion _ between the two classes , from the one giving unwillingly , and the other receiving unthankfully .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 40]: How the new Poor Law Bill will work remains to be proved ; but this is certain , that much individual suffering must take place , before it works out the great end which it is intended to obtain .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 46]: That the Roman Catholic laity are more charitable is not a matter of surprise , as they are not subjected to forced contributions : but it appears to me that the Catholic clergy are much more careful and kind to their flocks than our own .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 77]: Now , indeed , can it be otherwise , when even now , although so much reform in the Church has been effected , so many of our clergymen are pluralists and non-residents , expending the major part of the church revenue out of the parish , leaving to the curate , who performs the duty , a stipend which renders it impossible for him to exercise that part of his Christian duty to any extent ?
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 21]: -- for charity _ begins _ at home , and his means will not allow him to proceed much farther .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 83]: That serious evils have arisen from the celibacy of the Roman clergy is true , for priests are but men , and are liable to temptation ; but it is equally certain that when a Roman Catholic clergyman is a pure and pious man , he has nothing to distract his attention from the purposes of his high calling ; and not only his whole attention is devoted to his flock , but his existence , if necessary , is voluntarily endangered .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 52]: At the period of the cholera , there were many remarkable instances of this devotion to death on the part of the Roman priesthood , and as many , I am forced to say , of the Protestant clergy flying from the epidemic , and leaving their flocks without a shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 4]: And why so ?
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 26]: because the Protestant clergymen had wives and families depending upon them for support , and whose means of existence would terminate with their own lives .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 20]: It was very natural that they should prefer the welfare of their own families to that of their parishioners .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 27]: But in other cases not so extreme , the encumbrance of a family to a clergyman in England is very often in opposition to his duty .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 17]: To eke out a scanty remuneration , he sets up a school or takes in pupils .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 43]: Now if the duties of a clergyman consisted in merely reading the services on a Sunday , and christening , burying , and marrying , he might well do so ; but the real duties of a clergyman are much more important .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 41]: His duty is to watch over the lives and conduct of his parishioners , to exhort , persuade , and threaten , if necessary ; to be ever among his flock , watching them as a shepherd does his sheep .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 15]: And how can he possibly do this , if he takes charge of pupils ?
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 12]: -- he must either neglect his pupils or neglect his parish .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 8]: He can not do justice to both .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 51]: As Saint Paul says to the bishops , `` Although it is better to marry than burn , still it is better to be even as I am , '' unencumbered with wife and family , and with no ties to distract my attention from my sacred and important calling .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 51]: But the _ public _ charitable institutions abroad are much better conducted than those of England , where almost every thing of the kind is made a job , and a source of patronage for pretending pious people , who work their way into these establishments for their own advantage .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 39]: It is incredible the number of poor people who are effectually relieved on the Continent in the course of the year , at an expense which would not meet the weekly disbursements of a large parish in England .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 11]: But then , how much more judicious is the system !
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 100]: I know for a fact , that in the county where I reside , and in which the hard-working labourer , earning his twelve shillings a week , is quite satisfied if he can find sufficient _ bread _ for his family , -LRB- not tasting meat , perhaps , ten times during the whole year , -RRB- that those who were idlers , supported by charity , were supplied with meat three or four times a week ; nay , even the felons and prisoners in the county gaol were better fed than was the industrious working man .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 10]: And this is what in England is called charity .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 8]: It is base injustice to the meritorious .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 30]: But many of the charitable institutions in England , from mal-administration , and pseudo-philanthropy , have become very little better than establishments holding out premiums for idleness and hypocrisy .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 27]: Among the institutions founded by Roman Catholics and particularly deserving of imitation , that of the Soeurs de la Charite appears to be the most valuable .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 24]: It is an institution which , like mercy , is twice blessed -- it blesses those who give , and those who receive .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 33]: Those who give , because many hundreds of females , who would otherwise be thrown upon the world , thus find an asylum , and become useful and valuable members to society .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 47]: They take no vows -- they only conform to the rules of the sisterhood during the time that they remain in it , and if they have an opportunity , by marriage or otherwise , of establishing themselves , they are at free liberty to depart .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 42]: How many young women , now forced into a wretched , wicked life , would gladly incorporate themselves into such a society in England ; how many , if such a society existed , would be prevented from falling into error !
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 34]: It is well known , that to support a large community , the expenses are trifling compared to what they are when you have the same number of isolated individuals to provide for .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 53]: A company of two or three hundred of these sisters living together , performing among themselves the various household duties , washing , etcetera , and merely requiring their food , would not incur the same expense in house rent , firing , and provisions , as thirty or forty isolated individuals .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 56]: Soldiers in barracks are even well fed , housed , and clothed , at a much less expense than it costs the solitary labourer to eat his _ dry bread _ in his own cottage ; and the expenses of such communities , if once established , would very soon be paid by their receipts .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 27]: It would be a double charity , charity to those who would willingly embrace the life , and charity to those who might require their assistance .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 16]: It is well known how difficult it is to obtain a sick nurse in London .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 28]: It is an avocation seldom embraced by people , until they are advanced in years , and all feeling has been dried up by suffering or disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 18]: Those who undertake the task are only actuated by gain , and you can expect but eye-service .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 22]: Not being very numerous , and constantly in demand , they are overworked , and require stimulants in their long watchings .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 13]: In fact , they drink and dose -- dose and drink again .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 19]: But how different would it be if the establishments , which I have referred to , were formed !
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 42]: those who are wealthy would send for one of the sisters when required , and if the illness were tedious , her services could be replaced by another , so that over-fatigue might not destroy watchfulness and attention to the patient .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 18]: You would at once feel that you had those in your house in whom you could confide .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 40]: If your means enabled you , you would send a sum to the funds of the charity in return for the service performed , and your liberality would enable them to succour those who could only repay by blessings .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 42]: A very small subscription would set afloat such a charity , as the funds would so rapidly come in ; and if under the surveillance of the medical men who attended the hospitals , it would soon become effective and valuable .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 46]: I trust if this should meet the eye of any real philanthropist who has time to give , which is more valuable than money , that he will turn it over in his mind : -- the founder would be a benefactor to his country .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 3]: May 25 .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 84]: `` A man can not die more than once , '' is an old apothegm , and it would appear bold to dispute it ; but still there are lives within lives , such as political lives , literary lives , etcetera , and there is also such a thing as being dead in the eye of the law ; so that it is evident that a man can die twice , that is , once professionally or legally , and once naturally .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 31]: I presume , like all other scribblers , I must meet my literary death , that is , when I have written myself down , or have written myself out .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 46]: I have no objection , for I am very weary of my literary existence , although authors are not so in general ; on the contrary , they can perceive in themselves no sign of decay when it is apparent to every body around them .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 36]: Literary decay is analogous to the last stage of a consumption , in which you believe you are not going to die , and plan for the future as if you were in perfect health .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 12]: And yet to this complexion must all authors come at last .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 35]: There is not a more beautiful , or more true portrait of human nature , than the scene between the Archbishop of Grenada and Gil Blas , in the admirable novel of Le Sage .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 37]: Often and often has it been brought to my recollection since I have taken up the pen , and often have I said to myself , `` Is this homily as good as the last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 13]: -LRB- perhaps homily is not exactly the right term my writings . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 25]: The great art in this world , not only in writing , but in everything else , is to know when to leave off .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 11]: The mind as well as the body must wear out .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 23]: At first it is a virgin soil , but we can not renew its exhausted vigour after it has borne successive crops .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 14]: We all know this , and yet we are all archbishops of Grenada .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 64]: Even the immortal Walter Scott might have benefited by the honesty of Gil Blas , and have burnt his latter homilies ; but had he had such an unsophisticated adviser , would he not , in all probability , have put him out by the shoulders , wishing him , like the venerable hierarch , `` a little more taste and judgment . ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 26]: Since I have been this time abroad , I have made a discovery for which all prose writers ought to feel much indebted to me .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 92]: Poets can invoke Apollo , the Muses , the seasons , and all sorts and varieties of gods and goddesses , naked or clothed , besides virtues and vices , and if none of them suit , they may make their own graven image , and fall down before it ; but we prose writers have hitherto had no such advantage , no protecting deity to appeal to in our trouble , as we bite our pens , or to call upon to deliver us from a congestion of the brain .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 54]: Now being aware that there were upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand canonised saints on the Roman calendar , I resolved to run through the catalogue , to ascertain -- if there was one who took prose authors under his protection , and to my delight , I stumbled upon our man .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 22]: By-the-bye , Tom Moore must have known this , and he has behaved very ill in keeping him all to himself .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 6]: But I must introduce him .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 14]: It is the most holy , and the most blessed , Saint Brandon .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 16]: Holy Saint Brandon inspire me , and guide my pen while I record thy legend !
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 36]: In the first place , let me observe that our patron saint was an Irishman , and none the worse for that , as Ireland has had as good saints as any in the calendar .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 33]: And it is now clear that he does protect us prosaic writers , by the number of reporters and gentlemen of the press which have been sent over from the sister kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 4]: But to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 34]: Saint Brandon , it appears , was a reading man , and amused himself with voyages and travels ; but Saint Brandon was an unbeliever , and thought that travellers told strange things .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 28]: He took up the Zoology of Pliny , and pursued his accounts of `` Antres vast , and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders . ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 24]: He read until his patience was exhausted , and , in a fit of anger , he threw the manuscript into the flames .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 31]: Now this was a heavy sin , for a man 's book is the bantling of his brain , and , to say the least , it was a literary-infanticide .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 66]: That very night an angel appeared to him , and as a penance for his foul crime -LRB- in the enormity of which every author will agree with the angel -RRB- , he was enjoined to _ make the book over again _ , no easy task in those days , when manuscripts were rare , and the art of book-making had not been invented .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 91]: The sinner , in obedience to the heavenly mission , goes to work ; he charters a vessel , lays in provisions for a seven years ' voyage , and with a crew of seven monks , he makes sail , and after going round the world seven times , during which the world went round the sun seven times , he completed his task in seven volumes folio , which he never published , but carried his manuscript away with him to prove that he had performed his penance .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 44]: For this miraculous voyage -- and certainly with such a ship 's company , it was a miracle -- he was canonised , and is now the patron saint of all prose authors , particularly those whose works are measured by the foot-rule .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 41]: And now that I have made known to my fraternity that we also have a saint , all they have to do is to call upon him six or seven times , when their brains are at sixes and sevens .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 36]: I opine that holy Saint Brandon made a very _ hazard-ous _ voyage , for it is quite clear that , in the whole arrangement , it was -- _ seven 's the main _ .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 6]: En route , May 26 .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 46]: Passed Waterloo -- was informed that two days before the Marquis of Anglesey had arrived there , and stayed a short time to visit the cemetery of his leg ; a regular family visit of course , as all the _ members _ were present .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 3]: May 27 .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 4]: Slept at Namur .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 15]: The French are certainly superior to us in the art of rendering things agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 26]: Now , even in the furnishing of a common apartment , there is always something to relieve the eye , if not to interest you .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 31]: I recollect when I was last in London , in furnished apartments , that as I lay awake in the morning , my eye caught the pattern of the paper .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 22]: It was a shepherdess with her dog in repose , badly executed , and repeated without variation over the whole apartment .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 47]: Of course I had nothing to do but to calculate how many shepherdesses and dogs there were in the room , which , by counting the numbers in length and breadth , squaring the results , and deducting for door and windows , was soon accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 20]: But how different was the effect produced by the paper of the room in which I slept last night !
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 38]: It was the history of Dunois , the celebrated bastard of France , who prays in his youth that he may prove the bravest of the brave , and be rewarded with the fairest of the fair .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 41]: This was not the true history , perhaps , of Dunois ; but I am drawing the comparison between the associations and reminiscences conjured up by this decoration in opposition to the dull and tasteless recapitulation of the English manufacture .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 90]: From the latter I could not extract a bare idea , except that shepherdesses are , as a race , extinct , and that Lord Althorp had taken the tax off shepherds ' dogs , by way of a bonus , to relieve a distressed capital of some hundred millions , to which the agricultural interest had very properly replied , `` Thank you for nothing , my Lord ; '' but from the sight of the French paper what a host of recollections started up at the moment !
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 33]: The mind flew back to history , and was revelling in all the romance of chivalry , from King Arthur and his Knights , to the Field of the Cloth of Gold .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 65]: `` Yet , after all , '' thought I , at the end of a long reverie , `` divest chivalry , so called , of its imposing effect , examine well into its nature and the manners of the times , and it must be acknowledged that the modern warfare has a much greater claim than the ancient to the title of chivalry .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 58]: In former times men were cased in armour of proof , and , before the discovery of gunpowder , had little to fear in a _ melee _ , except from those who , like themselves , were equally well armed and equally protected , and even then only from flesh wounds , which were seldom mortal .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 29]: The lower classes , who served as common soldiers , were at the mercy of the mounted spearsmen , and could seldom make any impression upon their defences .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 48]: In those days , as in the present , he who could command most gold carried the day , for the gold procured the steel harness , and a _ plump _ of spears brought into the field was more than equal to a thousand common men .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 22]: He who had the best tempered armour was the most secure , and that was it be only procured by gold .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 28]: He who could mount and case in iron the largest number of his followers was the most powerful , and , generally speaking , the most lawless .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 22]: Divest chivalry of its splendour , which threw a halo round it , and it was brutal , and almost cowardly .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 31]: Single combats did certainly prove courage ; but even in them , skill , and more than skill , personal strength , or the best horse , decided the victory .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 57]: In fact , although not the origin , it was the upholder of the feudal system , in which might was right ; and we may add , that the invention of gunpowder , which placed every man upon a level , if not the cause of , certainly much assisted to break up the system .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 121]: How much more of the true spirit of chivalry is required in the warfare of the present day , in which every man must stand for hours to be shot at like a target , witnessing the mowing down of his comrades , and silently filling up the intervals in the ranks made by their deaths , exposed to the same leaden messengers ; a system of warfare in which every individual is a part of a grand _ whole _ , acting upon one concerted and extended plan , and forced a hundred times to exhibit the passive and more perfect bravery of constancy , for once that he may forget his danger in the ardour of the charge !
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 13]: When shall we learn to call things by their right names ? ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 5]: Liege , May 28 .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 16]: Our landlord is a most loyal man , but there is a reason for it .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 14]: Leopold took up his quarters at this hotel in his way to Spa .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 33]: In every room we have upon every article of _ fayence _ -- `` Leopold , with the Genius of Belgium crowning him with laurels , while Truth is looking on . ''
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 15]: Every plate , every dish , is impressed with this proof print of loyalty .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 20]: But this is not all , as the man said in the packet , `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 25]: All the wash-hand basins , jugs , and every other article required in a bed-chamber , have the same loyal pattern at the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 57]: Now it appeared to me , when I went to bed , that loyalty might be carried too far ; and what may have been intended as respect , may be the cause of his Majesty being treated with the greatest disrespect ; and not only his sacred Majesty , but the glorious Belgian constitution also .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 71]: As for poor Truth , she is indeed said to sojourn at the bottom of a well ; but in this instance , it would , perhaps , be as well that she should not be insulted -- I am wrong , she always is , and always will be , insulted , when she appears in the purlieus of a court , or in the presence of a king .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 11]: After all , mine is a strange sort of Diary .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 33]: It is not a diary of events , but of thoughts and reminiscences , which are thrown up and caught as they float to the surface in the whirlpool of my brain .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 3]: No wonder !
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 21]: -- events are but as gleanings compared to the harvest of many years , although so negligently gathered into store .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 20]: I have been puzzling myself these last two hours to find out what a man 's brain is like .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 34]: It is like a kaleidoscope , thought I ; it contains various ideas of peculiar colours , and as you shift them round and past , you have a new pattern every moment .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 33]: But no , it was not like a kaleidoscope , for the patterns of a kaleidoscope are regular , and there is very little regularity in my brain , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 56]: It is like a pawnbroker 's shop , thought I , full of heterogeneous pledges ; and if you would take anything out , experience stands at the counter , and makes you pay her compound interest , while many articles of value are lost for ever , because memory can not produce the duplicate .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 19]: And then I compared it to almost every thing , but none of my comparisons would hold good .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 20]: After all , thought I , I have been only playing at `` What are my thoughts like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 28]: which is a childish game ; and how can I possibly find out what my brain is like , when my brain do n't choose to tell ?
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 36]: So I rose , and opening the window , lighted my cigar , and smoked myself into a reverie , as I watched the smoke ascending from the chimneys of the good town of Liege .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 21]: And this is the city which travellers pass through , describing it as a mere manufacturing town , thought I .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 37]: A city which has , in its time , produced a greater moral influence upon society than any other in existence -- a city that has led the van in the cause of religion and liberty .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 11]: Liege presents a curious anomaly among the states of Europe .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 27]: It is the only town and province , with the exception of Rome , which has been , for centuries , ruled by the clerical power .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 67]: But be it recollected , that at the very period that Christianity was offering up her martyrs at the blood-stained arena of the Coliseum , it was from Liege -LRB- or rather Tongres , for Liege was not then built -RRB- that she was spreading wide her tenets , unpersecuted and unrestrained , for she was too far removed from idolatry and imposture to be regarded .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 12]: The province of Liege was the cradle of the Christian faith .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 34]: From the earliest records there were bishops at Tongres ; and it was about five hundred years after Christ , that Saint Monulphe , the reigning bishop , founded the city of Liege .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 21]: From that time until the French Revolution , this town and these fertile provinces had always remained under clerical authority .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 92]: Although these prince-bishops proved that , upon necessity , they could change the crosier for the coat of mail , still , as by endowments and benefactions they increased their revenues , so did they , by the mildness of their sway , induce thousands to settle in their territory ; and to increase their population -LRB- which was to increase their wealth -RRB- , they first granted to their citizens those privileges and liberties , which have , upon their precedent , been obtained by force or prayers by others .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 51]: The very boast of the English of the present day , that _ every man _ 's _ house is his castle _ , was the sacred grant of one of the bishops to the citizens at Liege , long before the feudal system had been abolished in our island .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 52]: I may also observe , for it is to be gained from the chronicles of this province , that the time at which it may be said that the primitive Christian church first fell into error , appears to have been about one thousand years after the death of our Saviour .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 56]: And as I thought of all this , and a great deal more , and smoked my cigar , I felt a great deal of respect for the good old city of Liege ; and then I wandered back to the country I had passed through the day before , excelling in all lovely scenery .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 27]: I had seen it before , but it was many years ago ; and it may be seen many times without the least degree of satiety .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 36]: I do not know any scenery which raises up such pleasurable sensations as that of the Valley of Meuse , taking it the whole way from Namur to Liege , and from Liege to Spa .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 17]: It is not so magnificent as the Rhine , to which it bears a miniature resemblance .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 60]: It is not of that description creating a strong excitement , almost invariably succeeded by depression ; but it is of that unchanging and ever-pleasing , joyous description , that you are delighted without being fatigued , and have stimulus sufficient to keep you constantly in silent admiration without demanding so much from the senses as to weary them .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 46]: If I could have divested myself from the knowledge that I was in motion , and have fancied that the scene was moving past , I could have imagined myself seated at one of our large theatres , watching one of Stanfield 's splendid panoramas .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 102]: But the lighted end of my cigar at last approximated so near to my nose , that I was burnt out of my reverie ; I took the last save -- all whiffs , tried to hit an old woman 's cap with the end of it , as I tossed it into the street , and retreated to the diurnal labour of shaving -- of all human miseries , certainly , the `` unkindest cut of all '' -- especially when the maids have borrowed your razor , during your absence , to pare down the apex of their corns .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 2]: Liege .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 25]: I have been reading the `` Salmonia '' of Sir Humphry Davy : what a pity it is that he did not write more !
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 10]: there are so many curious points started in it .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 46]: I like that description of book , which , after reading a while , you drop it on your knee , and are led into a train of thought which may last an hour , before you look for the page where you left off .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 16]: There are two cases argued in this work , which led me into a meditation .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 31]: The one is , a comparison between reason and instinct , and the other , as to the degree of pain inflicted upon fish by taking them with the hook .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 121]: Now it appeared to me , in the first question , what has been advanced is by no means conclusive , and although it is the custom to offer a penny for your thoughts , I shall give mine for nothing , which is perhaps as much as they are worth , -LRB- I say that , to prevent others from making the sarcastic remark -RRB- , and in the second question , I think I can assist the cause of the lovers of the _ gentle _ art of angling -- why _ gentle _ , I know not , unless it be that anglers bait with _ gentles _ , and are mostly _ gentle _ - men .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 26]: But before I attempt to prove that angling is not a cruel sport , I must first get rid of `` reason and instinct . ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 71]: Of reason most undoubtedly a philanthropist would reply , `` Be it so ; '' nevertheless , I will argue the point , and if I do not succeed , I have only to hedge back upon Solomon , and inquire , `` If man was born to misery as the sparks fly upwards , why are not the inferior classes of creation to have their share of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 19]: I do not think that any one can trace out the line of demarcation between reason and instinct .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 30]: Instinct in many points in wonderful , especially among insects , but where it is wonderful , it is a blind obedience , and inherited from generation to generation .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 66]: We observe , as in the case of the bees , that they obey the truest laws of mathematics , and from these laws they never have deviated from their creation , and that all animals , as far as their self-defence or their sustenance is concerned , show a wonderful blind obedience to an unerring power , and a sagacity almost superior to reason .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 40]: But wonderful as this is , it is still but instinct , as the progenitors of the race were equally guided by it , and it is handed down without any improvement , or any decay in its power .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 63]: Now if it could be asserted that the instinct of animals was only thus inherited from race to race , and could `` go no farther , '' the line of demarcation between reason and instinct would at once be manifest , as instinct would be blindly following certain fixed laws , while reason would ever be assisted by memory and invention .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 40]: But we have not this boasted advantage on the side of reason , for animals have both memory and invention , and , moreover , if they have not speech , they have equal means of communicating their ideas .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 71]: That this memory and invention can not be so much exercised as our own , may be true , but it is exercised to an extent equal to their wants , and they look no further ; that is to say , that if any want not prepared for , or anything should take place interfering with their habits and economy , instinct will enable them to meet the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 14]: There is nothing more wonderful than the application of mechanical power by ants .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 21]: No engineer could calculate with greater nicety , and no set of men work together with such combination of force .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 33]: After they have made ineffectual attempts to remove a heavy body , you will observe them to meet together , consult among themselves , and commence an entire new plan of operations .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 13]: Bees , also , are always prepared to meet any new difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 77]: If the _ sphinx atropos _ , or death 's head moth , forces its way into the hive , the bees are well known , after having killed it with their stings , to embalm the dead body with wax -- their reason for this is , that the body was too large for them to remove through the passage by which it entered , and they would avoid the unpleasant smell of the carcass .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 93]: It may be argued , that instinct had always imparted to them this knowledge ; but if so , they must have had a fresh accession of instinct after they had been domiciled with men : for it is well known that the hole in the tree , in which the wild bees form their cells , is invariably too small to admit any animal larger than themselves , and the bodies of such sized animals they could remove with as much ease as they do the bodies of their own dead .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 25]: I could cite a hundred instances , which would prove that animals have invention independent of the instinct handed down from generation to generation .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 22]: I will , however , content myself with one instance of superior invention in the elephant , which occurred at Ceylon .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 45]: Parties were employed felling timber in the forests of Candia , and this timber , after having been squared , was dragged to the depot by a large party of elephants , who , with their keepers , were sent there for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 30]: This work was so tedious , that a large truck was made , capable of receiving a very heavy load of timber , which might be transported at once .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 16]: This truck was dragged out by the elephants , and it was to be loaded .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 41]: I should here observe , that when elephants work in a body , there is always one who , as if by common consent , takes the lead , and directs the others , who never refuse to obey him .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 55]: The keepers of the elephants , and the natives , gave their orders , and the elephants obeyed ; but the timber was so large , and the truck so high on its wheels , that the elephants could not put the timber in the truck according to the directions given by the men .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 30]: After several attempts , the natives gave up the point , and retiring to the side of the road as usual , squatted down , and held a consultation .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 60]: In the meantime , the elephant who took the lead summoned the others , made them drag two of the squared pieces to the side of the truck , laid them at right angles with it , lifting one end of each on the truck , and leaving the other on the ground , thus forming the inclined plane .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 45]: The timber was then brought by the elephants , without any interference on the part of the keepers or natives , who remained looking on , was pushed by the elephants with their foreheads up the inclined plane , and the truck was loaded .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 37]: Here then is an instance in which the inventive instinct of the animal -- if that term may be used -- was superior to the humbler reasoning powers of the men who had charge of them .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 17]: That animals have the powers of memory as well as man , admits of no dispute .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 54]: In elephants , horses , and dogs , we have hourly instances of it : but it descends much lower down -- the piping bullfinch , who has been taught to whistle two or three waltzes in perfect concord , must have a good memory , or he would soon forget his notes .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 59]: To detail instances of memory would therefore be superfluous ; but , as it does occur to me while I write , I must give an amusing instance how the memory of a good thrashing overcame the ruling passion of a monkey , which is gluttony , the first and only instance that I ever saw it conquered .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 36]: I had on board a ship which I commanded , a very large Cape baboon , who was a pet of mine , and also a little boy , who was a son of mine .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 22]: When the baboon sat down on his hams , he was about as tall as the boy was when he walked .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 24]: The boy having tolerable appetite , received about noon a considerable slice of bread and butter , to keep him quiet till dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 80]: I was on one of the carronades , busy with the sun 's lower limb , bringing it in contact with the horizon , when the boy 's lower limbs brought him in contact with the baboon , who having , as well as the boy , a strong predilection for bread and butter , and a stronger arm to take it withal , thought proper to help himself to that to which the boy had been already helped .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 27]: In short , he snatched the bread and butter , and made short work of it , for it was in his pouch in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 65]: Upon which the boy set up a yell , which attracted my notice to this violation of the articles of war , to which the baboon was equally amenable as any other person in the ship ; for it is expressly stated in the preamble of every separate article , `` All who are _ in _ , or _ belonging _ to . ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 33]: Whereupon I jumped off the carronade , and by way of assisting his digestion , I served out to the baboon monkey 's allowance , which is , more kicks than halfpence .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 46]: The master reported that the heavens intimated that it was twelve o'clock ; and with all the humility of a captain of a man-of-war , I ordered him to `` make it so ; '' whereupon it was made , and so passed that day .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 61]: I do not remember how many days it was afterwards that I was on the carronade as usual , about the same time , and all parties were precisely in the same situations , -- the master by my side , the baboon under the booms , and the boy walking out of the cabin with his bread and butter .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 33]: As before , he again passed the baboon , who again snatched the bread and butter from the boy , who again set up a squall , which again attracted my attention .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 55]: Looked round , and the baboon caught my eye , which told him plainly that he 'd soon catch what was not `` at all _ my eye _ ; '' and he proved that he actually thought so , for he actually put the bread and butter back into the boy 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 31]: It was the only instance of which I ever knew or heard of a monkey being capable of self-denial when his stomach was concerned , and I record it accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 57]: -LRB- Par parenthese :-RRB- it is well known that monkeys will take the small-pox , measles , and I believe the scarlet fever ; but this poor fellow , when the ship 's company were dying of the cholera , took that disease , went through all its gradations , and died apparently in great agony .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 51]: As , then , invention and memory are both common to instinct as well as to reason , where is the line of demarcation to be drawn ; especially as in the case of the elephants I have mentioned , superior instinct will invent when inferior reason is at fault ?
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 74]: It would appear , if the two qualities must be associated , that , at all events , there are two varieties of instinct : blind instinct , which is superior to reason , so far that it never errs , as it is God who guides ; and inventive instinct , which enables the superior animals to provide for unexpected difficulties , or to meet those which memory has impressed upon them .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 19]: But if we examine ourselves , the difficulty becomes even greater -- we have decidedly two separate qualities .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 25]: We are instinctive as well as reasonable beings ; and what is inventive instinct but a species of reason , if not reason itself ?
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 49]: But although I say that it is hardly possible to draw the line of demarcation , I do not mean to say that they are one and the same thing ; for instinct and reason , if we are to judge by ourselves , are in direct opposition .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 54]: Self-preservation is instinctive ; all the pleasures of sense , all that people are too apt to consider as happiness in this world ; I may say , all that we are told is wrong , all that our reason tells us we are not to indulge in , is _ instinct _ .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 40]: Such are the advantages of being reasonable beings in _ this world _ ; undoubtedly , we have a right to claim for ourselves , and deny to the rest of the creation , the enjoyments of the next .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 14]: Byron says : -- `` Man being reasonable , must get drunk . ''
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 28]: That is to say , being reasonable , and finding his reason a reason for being unhappy , he gets rid of his reason whenever he can .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 7]: So do the most intellectual animals .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 14]: The elephant and the monkey enjoy their bottle as much as we do .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 29]: I should have been more inclined to agree with Byron , if he had said : -- Man being reasonable , must _ go to the devil _ .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 42]: For what are poor reasonable creatures to do , when instinct leads them to the `` old gentleman ; '' and reason , let her tug as hard as she pleases , is not sufficiently powerful to overcome the adverse force .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 17]: After all , I do n't think that I have come to a very satisfactory conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 35]: Like a puppy running round after his own tail , I am just where I was when I set out ; but , like the puppy , I have been amused for the time .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 11]: I only hope the reader will have been so too .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 30]: And now , my brethren , I proceed to the second part of my discourse , which is , to defend anglers and fly-fishers from the charge of cruelty .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 48]: It is very true that Shakespeare says , `` The poor beetle that we tread on , in mortal sufferance , feels a pang as great as when a giant dies ; '' and it is equally true that it is as false as it is poetical .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 17]: There is a scale throughout nature , and that scale has been divided by unerring justice .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 62]: Man is at the summit of this scale , being more fearfully and wonderfully made , more perfect than any other of the creation , more perfect in his form , more perfect in his intellect ; he is finer strung in his nerves , acuter in his sympathies ; he has more susceptibility to pleasure , more susceptibility to pain .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 22]: He has pleasures denied to , and he has pains not shared with him by , the rest of the creation .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 9]: He enjoys most , and he suffers most .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 80]: From man , the scale of creation descends , and in its descent , as animals are less and less perfect , so is meted out equal but smaller proportions of pleasure and pain , until we arrive to the Mollusca and Zoophyte , beings existing certainly , but existing without pleasure and without pain -- existing only to fill up the endless variety , and add the links to the chain of nature necessary to render it complete .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 16]: The question which naturally will be put is , `` how do you know this ?
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 8]: it is assertion but not proof . ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 9]: But arguments are always commenced in this way .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 17]: The assertion is the _ quid _ , the _ est demonstrandum _ always comes afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 12]: I handle my nose , flourish my handkerchief , and proceed .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 8]: Man is the most perfect of creation .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 16]: What part of his body , if separated from the rest , can he renew ?
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 10]: No part , except the hair and the nail .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 6]: Reproduction can go no further .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 33]: With the higher classes of animals , also , there is no reproduction : but even at this slight descent upon the scale , we may already point out a great difference .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 62]: Although there is no reproduction , still there are decided proofs of inferiority ; for instance , a hare or rabbit caught in a trap , will struggle till they escape , with the loss of a leg ; a fox , which is carnivorous , will do more ; he will _ gnaw _ off his own leg to escape .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 6]: Do they die in consequence ?
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 17]: no , they live and do well ; but could a man live under such circumstances ?
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 2]: impossible .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 15]: If you do n't believe me , gnaw your own leg off and try .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 31]: And yet the conformation of the Mammalia is not very dissimilar from our own ; but man is the more perfect creature , and therefore has not the same resources .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 19]: I have hitherto referred only to the _ limbs _ of animals ; I will now go further .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 11]: I had a beautiful little monkey on board my ship .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 34]: By accident it was crushed , and received such injury that the backbone was divided at the loins , and the vertebra of the upper part protruded an inch outside of its skin .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 27]: Such an accident in a man would have produced immediate death ; but the monkey did not die ; its lower limbs were of course paralysed .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 24]: The vertebra which protruded gradually rotted off , and in six weeks the animal was crawling about the decks with its fore feet .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 18]: It was , however , such a pitiable object , that I ordered it to be drowned .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 42]: Now , if we descend lower down in the scale until we come to the reptiles and insects , we shall find not only that the loss of limbs is not attended with death , but that the members are reproduced .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 22]: Let any one take a spider by its legs , it will leave them in your hands that it may escape .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 22]: Confine the animal under a glass , and in a few weeks it will have all its members perfect as before .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 9]: Lizards are still more peculiar in their reproduction .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 62]: I was at Madeira for many months , and often caught the lizards which played about the walls and roofs of the out-houses ; and if ever I caught a lizard by the tail , he would make a spring , and leave his tail in my hand , which seemed to snap off as easily as would a small carrot .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 22]: Now the tail of the lizard is longer than its body , and a continuation of the vertebrae of the back .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 26]: I soon found out that lizards did not die from this extensive loss , but , on the contrary , that their tails grew again .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 26]: Even the first week afterwards , a little end began to show itself , and in about two months the animal had reproduced the whole .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 28]: What I am about to say now will probably be considered by some as incredible ; they are , however , at full liberty to disbelieve it .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 68]: One day I was looking out of the window with the late Tom Sheridan , who lived in the same house , and we observed on the roof of the out-house a lizard with two tails , but neither of them full grown ; and we argued that , at the time the animal lost his tail , he must have suffered some division of the stump .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 32]: Being at that time a naturalist , i.e. very cruel ; I immediately caught a lizard , pulled off his tail , notched the vertebra , and turned him loose again .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 24]: Our conjectures were right ; the animal in two or three weeks had two tails growing out like the one we had seen .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 23]: I repeated this experiment several times , and it always appeared to succeed ; and all the two-tailed lizards were called mine .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 32]: Now this power of reproduction increases as you descend the scale ; as an instance , take the polypus , which is as near as possible at the bottom of it .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 26]: If you cut a polypus into twenty pieces , without any regard to division , in a short time you will have twenty perfect polypi .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 28]: Now the deductions I would draw from these remarks are -- That the most perfect animals are least capable of reproduction , and most sensible of pain .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 19]: That as the scale of nature descends , animals become less perfect , and more capable of reproduction .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 15]: Ergo -- they can not possibly feel the same pain as the more perfect .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 46]: Now with respect to fish , they are very inferior in the scale of creation , being , with the exception of the cetaceous tribe , which class with the Mammalia , all cold-blooded animals , and much less perfect than reptiles or many insects .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 37]: The nervous system is the real seat of all pain ; and the more perfect the animal , the more complicated is that system : with cold-blooded animals , the nervous organisation is next to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 42]: Most fish , if they disengage themselves from the hook , will take the bait again ; and if they do not , it is not on account of the pain , but because their instinct tells them there is danger .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 33]: Moreover , it is very true , as Sir H. Davy observes , that fish are not killed by the hook , but by the hooks closing their mouths and producing suffocation .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 38]: How , indeed , would it otherwise be possible to land a salmon of thirty pounds weight , in all its strength and vigour , with a piece of gut not thicker than three or four hairs ?
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 38]: Upon the same grounds that I argue that fish feel very little comparative pain , so do I that the worm , which is so low in the scale of creation , does not suffer as supposed .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 29]: Its writhings and twistings on the hook are efforts to escape natural to the form of the animal , and can be considered as little or nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 29]: At the same time I acknowledge and , indeed , prove , by my own arguments , that it is very cruel to _ bob for whale _ .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 52]: To suppose there are no gradations of feeling as well as of perfection in the animal kingdom , would not only be arguing against all analogy , but against the justice and mercy of the Almighty , who does not allow a sparrow to fall to the earth without his knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 79]: He gave all living things for our use and our sustenance ; he gave us intellect to enable us to capture them : to suppose , therefore , at the same time , that he endowed them with so fine a nervous organisation as to make them undergo severe tortures previous to death , is supposing what is contrary to that goodness and mercy which , as shown towards us , we are ready to acknowledge and adore .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 16]: I can not finish this subject without making a remark upon creation and its perfectibility .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 27]: All _ respectable _ animals , from man down to a certain point in the scale , have their lice or parasites to feed upon them .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 45]: Some wit , to exemplify this preying upon one another , wrote the following : -- `` Great fleas have little fleas , And less fleas to bite them , These fleas have lesser fleas , And so -- _ ad infinitum _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 9]: This , however , is not strictly true .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 8]: Parasites attach themselves only to the great .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 6]: Upon those they can fatten .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 22]: Having your blood sucked , is therefore , a great proof of high heraldry and perfectibility in the scale of creation .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 27]: If animals were endowed with speech and pride like man , we might imagine one creature boasting to another , as a proof of his importance .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 12]: `` And I , too , also have my louse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 5]: Liege , May 30th .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 7]: What strange meetings take place sometimes !
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 35]: I recollect once , when I was sitting at a _ table d'hote _ , at Zurich , being accosted by a lady next to me , and being accused of having forgotten her .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 19]: I looked with all my eyes , but could not discover that I had ever seen her before .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 38]: At last , after allowing me to puzzle for some time , she said : `` Sir , you and I met at dinner four years ago , at Mr K -- 's house in Demerara . ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 66]: It was very true ; but who would have thought of running his memory over to South America , to a cursed alluvial deposite , hatching monthly broods of alligators , and surrounded by naked slaves , whilst out of the window before him his eye rested upon the snow-covered mountains of Switzerland , and he breathed the pure air of William Tell and liberty .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 23]: This morning I fell in with an acquaintance whom had not seen for years , and him also I did not recollect .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 62]: I am very unfortunate in that respect , and I am afraid that I have very often given offence without intending it ; but so imperfect is my memory of faces , that I have danced with a lady in the evening , and the next day have not known her , because she was in a bonnet and morning dress .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 41]: Sometimes the shifts I am put to are quite ludicrous , asking all manner of questions , and answering those put to me at random , to find out some clue as to who my very intimate friend may be .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 27]: They ought not to be angry at my forgetting their names , for sometimes , for a few minutes , I have actually forgotten my own .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 29]: It does , however , only require one clue to be given me , and then all of a sudden I recollect every thing connected with the party .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 29]: I remember one day as I was passing Whitehall , somebody came up , wrung my hand with apparent delight , and professed himself delighted to see me .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 27]: I could do no other than say the same , but who he was , and where I had seen him before , was a mystery .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 21]: `` I am married since we parted , '' said he , `` and have a fine little boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 8]: I congratulated him with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 17]: `` You must come and see me , and I will introduce you to Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 28]: `` Nothing would give me more pleasure ; '' but if he had only called his wife Mrs So-and-so , I should have a _ clue _ .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 17]: `` Let me see , '' said I , `` where was it we parted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 7]: `` Do n't you recollect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 12]: said he , `` At the Cape of Good Hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 25]: But I was still mystified , and after putting several leading questions , I found myself quite as much in the dark as ever .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 16]: At last I asked him for his card , that I might call upon him .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 8]: He had not one in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 28]: I pulled out my tablets , and he took out the pencil , and wrote down his address ; but that was of no use to me .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 31]: `` Stop , my good fellow , I have so many addresses down there , that I shall be making some mistake ; put your name down above it . ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 40]: He did so , and when I saw the name every thing came fast like a torrent into my recollection ; we _ had been _ very intimate , and he was fully justified in showing so much warmth .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 30]: I could then talk to him about old scenes , and old acquaintances ; so I took his arm , and went forthwith to be introduced to his Mary .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 31]: The knowledge of this unfortunate failing makes me peculiarly careful not to avoid a person who appears to know me ; and one day a very absurd scene took place .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 31]: I was standing on some door steps close to the Admiralty , waiting for a friend , and there was another gentleman standing close to me , on the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 41]: A third party came up , extending his hand , and I immediately took it , and shook it warmly , -- although who my friend was , I was , as usual , very much puzzled to find out .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 41]: Now it so happened that the hand which I had taken was extended to the gentleman standing by me , and not to me ; and the party whose hand I was squeezing looked me in the face and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 20]: I did the same , and he then gave his hand to the right party , and walked off .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 14]: As , however , we had said , `` How d'ye do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 21]: we had the politeness to say , `` Good-by ; '' both taking off our hats on the broad grin .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 40]: I _ was _ observing , that I here met with a person whom I could not recollect , and , as usual , I continued to talk with him , trusting to my good fortune for the clue .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 7]: At last it was given me .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 14]: `` Do you recollect the little doctor and his wife at Bangalore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 8]: I did , and immediately recollected him .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 40]: As the story of the doctor and his wife has often made me laugh , and as I consider it one of the best specimens of _ tit for tat _ , I will narrate it to my readers .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 17]: I have since been told that it is not new -- I must tell it nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 34]: A certain little army surgeon , who was stationed at Bangalore , had selected a very pretty little girl out of an invoice of young ladies , who had been freighted-out on speculation .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 37]: She was very fond of gaiety and amusement , and , after her marriage , appeared to be much fonder of passing away the night at a ball than in the arms of her little doctor .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 16]: Nevertheless , although she kept late hours , in every respect she was very correct .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 38]: The doctor , who was a quiet , sober man , and careful of his health , preferred going to bed early , and rising before the sun , to inhale the cool breeze of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 25]: And as the lady seldom came home till past midnight , he was not very well pleased at being disturbed by her late hours .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 34]: At last , his patience was wearied out , and he told her plainly , that if she staid out later than twelve o'clock , he was resolved not to give her admittance .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 50]: At this , his young wife , who , like all pretty women , imagined that he never would presume to do any such thing , laughed heartily , and from the next ball to which she was invited , did not return till half-past two in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 41]: As soon as she arrived , the palanquin-bearers knocked for admittance ; but the doctor , true to his word , put his head out of the window , and very ungallantly told his wife she might remain all night .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 18]: The lady coaxed , entreated , expostulated , and threatened ; but it was all in vain .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 39]: At last she screamed , and appeared to be frantic , declaring that if not immediately admitted , she would throw herself into the well , which was in the compound , not fifty yards from the bungalow .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 23]: The doctor begged that she would do so , if that gave her any pleasure , and then retired from the window .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 45]: His wife ordered the bearers to take her on her palanquin to the well ; she got out , and gave her directions , and then slipped away up to the bungalow , and stationed herself close to the door , against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 50]: The bearers , in obedience to her directions , commenced crying out , as if expostulating with their mistress , and then detaching a large and heavy stone , two of them plunged it into the water ; after which , they all set up a howl of lamentation .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 28]: Now the little doctor , notwithstanding all his firmness and _ nonchalance _ , was not quite at ease when he heard his wife express her determination .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 17]: He knew her to be _ very entetee _ , and he remained on the watch .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 15]: He heard the heavy plunge , followed up by the shrieks of the palanquin-bearers .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 14]: `` Good God , '' cried he , `` is it possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 17]: and he darted out in his shirt to where they were all standing by the well .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 34]: As soon as he had passed , his wife hastened in-doors , locked , and made all fast , and shortly afterwards appeared at the window from which her husband had addressed her .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 13]: The doctor discovered the _ ruse _ when it was too late .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 21]: It was now his turn to expostulate ; but how could he `` hope for mercy , rendering none ? ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 7]: The lady was laconic and decided .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 16]: `` At least , then , throw me my clothes , '' said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 26]: `` Not even your slippers , to protect you from the scorpions and centipedes , '' replied the lady , shutting the `` jalousie . ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 39]: At day-light , when the officers were riding their Arabians , they discovered the poor little doctor pacing the verandah up and down in the chill of the morning , with nothing but his shirt to protect him .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 36]: Thus were the tables turned , but whether this _ ruse _ of the well ended well , -- whether the lady reformed , or the doctor conformed , -- I have never since heard .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 5]: Liege , June 2 .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 16]: The academy or college established at Liege in 1817 is very creditable to the Liegeois .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 33]: Much has been done in fifteen years : the philosophical apparatus , collections of minerals and natural history , are all excellent for instruction , although the minerals are not very valuable .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 34]: The fossils found in the Ardennes are very interesting , and ought to be a mine of wealth to the Liegeois , as by exchanging them they might soon have a valuable collection .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 63]: It is a pity that the various museums of Europe do not print catalogues , not of their own collections only , but also of the duplicates which they can part with , so that they may be circulated , not only among the national collections , but also among private cabinets ; by so doing they would all become more perfect .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 29]: It is currently reported that more duplicates have been allowed to perish in the cellars of the British Museum than would have furnished all the cabinets in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 39]: It may be replied , that other cabinets had nothing to offer in exchange ; but that is only a surmise : and even if they had not , they should have been presented to other institutions abroad .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 18]: Science ought not to be confined to country or people : it should be considered as universal .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 9]: To the college is annexed a botanical garden .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 11]: There is nothing I dislike more than a botanical garden .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 28]: I acknowledge the advantages , perhaps the necessity , of such institutions ; but they always appear to me as if there was disarrangement instead of arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 16]: What may be called order and classification seems to me to be disorder and confusion .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 32]: It may be very well to class plants and trees for study , but certainly their families , although joined by man , were never intended to be united by God .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 29]: Such a mixture in one partition , of trees , and shrubs , and creeping plants , all of which you are gravely told are of one family .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 10]: I never will believe it : it is unnatural .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 49]: I can see order and arrangement when I look at the majestic forest-trees throwing about their wild branches , and defying the winds of heaven , while they afford shelter to the shrubs beneath , which in their turn protect and shelter the violets that perfume all around .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 23]: This is beautiful and natural -- it is harmony ; but in a botanical garden every thing is out of its place .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 34]: The Scripture says , `` Those whom God hath joined let no man put asunder ; '' may we not add , Those whom God hath sundered let no man presume to join .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 111]: I felt as I looked at the botanical garden as if it were presumptuous and almost wicked , and as it was on the banks of the Meuse , I sat down on the wall and recovered myself by looking at the flowing river , and thinking about utility and futility , `` and all that sort of thing and everything else in the world , '' as poor Matthews used to say , -- and there I sat for an hour , until my thoughts revolved on the propriety of going back and eating my dinner , -- as Mrs Trollope used to do when she was in Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 22]: As I was walking about in the evening , I perceived a dirty little alley illuminated with chandeliers and wax candles .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 19]: There must be a ball , thought I , or some gaiety going on : let us inquire .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 73]: `` No , sir , '' replied a man to whom I put the question , `` it 's not a ball , -- it is a Monsieur who has presented to an image of the Virgin Mary which is up that court , a petticoat , which , they say , is worth one thousand five hundred francs , and this lighting-up is in honour of her putting it on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 23]: The race of fools is not extinct , thought I. I wonder whether , like King Ferdinand , he worked it himself .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 11]: Belgium is certainly at this present the stronghold of superstition .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 3]: June 3 .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 13]: Went to Harquet 's manufactory of arms , and was much amused .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 20]: They export all over the world , and the varieties they make up for the different markets are astonishing .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 30]: They were then very busy completing an order for several thousand muskets for the Belgian troops , which load at the breech and fire off without locks or priming .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 17]: They showed me a fowling-piece on the same principle , which they fired off under water .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 10]: But the low prices of the arms astonished me .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 38]: There were a large quantity of very long fowling-pieces with the _ maker 's _ name at _ Constantinople _ , for the Turkish gentlemen , at thirty francs each : a common musket was fourteen francs .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 28]: I perceived in a corner a large number of muskets , of infamous workmanship , and with locks resembling those awkward attempts made two hundred years back .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 7]: I asked what they were for .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 29]: They were for the South American market , and made to order , for the people there would use no others : any improvement was eschewed by them .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 34]: I presume they had borrowed one of the Spanish muskets brought over by Pizarro as a model , but , at all events , they were very cheap , only eight francs each .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 12]: God help us , how cheaply men can be killed now-a-days !
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 30]: It is very seldom that you now meet with a name beginning with an X , but one caught my eye as I was walking through the streets here .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 7]: _ Urban Xhenemont , negociant _ .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 39]: I perceive there are still some to be found in Greece ; the only one I know of in England is that of Sir Morris Ximenes , who , I presume , claims descent from the celebrated cardinal .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 32]: The mention of that name reminds me of the songs of the improvisatore , Theodore Hook , and his address in finding a rhyme for such an awkward name as Ximenes .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 7]: Few possess the talent of improvising .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 30]: In Italy it is more common , because the Italian language admits the rhyme with so much facility ; but a good improvisatore is rare even in that country .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 28]: There was a Dutchman who was a very good improvisatore , a poor fellow who went about to amuse companies with his singing and this peculiar talent .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 69]: One day a gentleman dropped a gold Guillaume into a glass of Burgundy , and told him if he would make a good impromptu , he should have both the wine and the gold : without hesitation he took up the glass , and suiting the action to the word , sang as follows : -- `` Twee Goden in een Glas , Wat zal ik van maken ?
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 16]: K ' steek Plutus in myn tas , K slaak Bacchus in myn Kaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 13]: Which may be rendered into French as follows : -- `` Quoi !
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 9]: deux dieux dans un verre , Eh bien !
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 6]: que vais-j ` en faire ?
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 7]: J'empocherai Plutus , J'avalerai Bacchus . ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 34]: The gentleman , who gave me this translation , also furnished me with a copy of extempore French verses , given by a gentleman of Maestricht , who was celebrated as an improvisatore .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 6]: They certainly are very superior .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 29]: He was at a large party , and agreed to improvise upon any theme given him by five of those present in the way of _ Souvenir _ .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 12]: The first person requested the souvenir of _ early youth _ .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 4]: `` Vous souvient-il ?
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 13]: Amis de ma jeunesse , Des beaux momens de nos fougueux exploits ?
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 17]: Quand la raison sous le joug de l'ivresse , Essaye en vain de soutenir ses droits .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 37]: Ce tems n'est plus , cet age de folie , Ou tout en nous est presse de jouir : Mes bons amis , du printemps de la vie Gardons toujours le joyeux _ souvenir _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 29]: The next party requested a souvenir of the conscription , many of them , as well as the poet , having been forced into the army of France .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 4]: `` Vous souvient-il ?
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 32]: que plus tard , sous les armes Plusieurs donons , designes par le sort , Loin des parents ; versant d'ameres larmes , Allaient trouver ou la gloire ou la mort .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 32]: Ces jours de deuil par milliers dans l'histoire Ne viendront plus , sur nous s ` appesantir Amis , volons an temple de Memoire Effacons-en le sanglant _ souvenir _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 13]: The third party requested a souvenir of his `` first love . ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 4]: `` Vous sonvient-il ?
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 30]: de cet enfant de Guide Fripon ruse , volage et seducteur ; Qui par les yeux d'une beaute timide , D'un trait de feu veut nous frapper au coeur .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 31]: Du sentimens que sa fleche fit naitre , Et que la mort peut seul aneantir , Eternissons le ravissant bien-etre , En conservant un si beau _ souvenir _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 13]: The fourth proposed as a theme , the morning of his marriage .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 4]: `` Vous souvient-il ?
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 23]: du jour ou l'hymenee Vint nous dicter ses eternelles loix , En attachant a notre destinee L'objet sacre de notre premier choix .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 30]: Solennite qui par des voeux nous lie , De saints devoirs chargeant notre avenir , Solennite que le vulgaire oublie Nous te gardons en pieux _ souvenir _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 13]: The last party desired him to wind up with _ friendship _ .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 14]: `` Quel souvenir puis-je chanter encore , Apres celui ne dans la volupte ?
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 16]: Il en est un que le tems corrobore , C'est le premier elan de l'amitie .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 2]: Eh !
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 34]: qui de nous n ' a pas dans sa jeunesse , Livre son coeur a ses charmes puissants , Sainte Amitie , jusqu'a dans la vieillesse , Console-nous des ravages du tems . ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 22]: I should imagine that after the gentleman had finished all this , he must have been pretty well out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 17]: About four miles from Liege is the celebrated manufactory of Seraing , belonging to Messrs. Cockerell .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 22]: It is beautifully situated on the banks of the Meuse , and was formerly the summer palace of the Prince Archbishop .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 67]: But it is not only here that you observe these symptoms of the times -- all over France you will perceive the same , and the major portion of the manufactories have the arms of princes or nobles emblazoned over the facade , while the interiors , which once were the abode of refinement and luxury , are now tenanted by artisans and appropriated to utility .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 30]: The utilitarian system was , however , more fully exemplified before the Belgian revolution , for William of Nassau was , in fact , a partner of Mr Cockerell .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 44]: Mr Cockerell , the father , who is now dead , came over from England before the peace , bringing with him either the machinery for spinning cotton , or the knowledge necessary for its construction , so jealously guarded by our manufacturers .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 11]: He established himself at Liege , and soon gained patrons .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 16]: The firm has now three or four manufactories at Liege besides the one at Seraing .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 32]: Large as was the bishop 's palace , it has been increased to about three times its original size : it reminds me more of Portsmouth yard than any other place .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 16]: The number of workmen employed in this manufactory alone is between fourteen and fifteen hundred .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 26]: They make every variety of steam engines , and not only supply this country , but Prussia , Austria , France , and even Russia .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 25]: People talk of Mr Cockerell having done much mischief to his country by furnishing foreigners with the machinery which enabled us to undersell them .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 32]: I doubt it very much : I consider that the sooner other countries are enabled to compete with us to a certain extent , the better it will be for England .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 19]: At present we are in an unhealthy state , and chiefly arising from the unlimited use of machinery .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 21]: Let us lose that advantage , and , if not richer , at all events we shall be much happier .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 20]: We are now suffering under a plethora of capital at the same time that we are oppressed with debt .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 31]: As for Mr Cockerell , it may be very well to cry out about patriotism , but the question is , would not every other man have done the same ?
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 14]: Had he not a right to bring his talents to the best market ?
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 30]: and before he is accused of having had no regard for his country , it may first be fairly asked , what regard had his country shown for him ?
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 5]: Spa , June 10 .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 11]: Here we are , and for a time at rest .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 2]: Rest !
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 25]: no , the wheels of the carriage may rest , even the body for a time may rest , but the mind will not .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 10]: We carry our restlessness with us wherever we go .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 73]: Like a steam-engine , the mind works , and works , and works , sometimes , indeed , with less rapidity of motion ; but still it goes on , goes on in its ever-continued labour ; waking or sleeping , no repose ; until the body , which is the mechanical part of the engine , is worn out by constant friction , or the steam of the mind is exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 15]: And people tell you , and believe that there is rest in the grave .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 5]: How can that be ?
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 11]: The soul is immortal and can not exist without consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 27]: If not conscious , it does not exist ; and if conscious , it must work on , even beyond the grave , and for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 18]: To assert that there is rest in the grave , is denying the immortality of the soul .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 14]: And what a contemptible , base slave the body is to the soul !
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 36]: I was going to say that he could not call his soul his own ; but that would be a Catachresis , and I hate and abominate every thing which begins with _ cat _ .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 93]: It is singular that they are all unpleasant , or unlucky , or unsafe ; for instance -- + = = = = = = = = = = = = = + = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = + Ý Ýremind you of Ý + ------------- + ----------------------------------------- + ÝCat-acombs Ýdeath , funerals , and mummies .

Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 24]: Five o'clock in the morning , -- the sun has not yet appeared above the hills , but the mist is rising gradually .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 63]: The bell of the church in front of my window is tolling ; -- it ceases ; and the pealing of the organ , with the chanting of the priests , comes distinct and clear upon my ear , as the notes of the bugle over the still water , from some dashing frigate in the Sound , beating off at sunset .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 10]: How solemn and how beautiful is this early prayer !
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 27]: The sun is rising , the mists of the night are rolling off , and the voices and music resound at the same time to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 17]: The church is full , and many remain outside , uncovered , and kneeling in humility .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 53]: But who comes here , thought I , as a man in a shabby coat walked to within a few yards of the church door , and laid down his burden , consisting of a drum , a fiddle , a roll of canvass , a chair , and a long pole .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 24]: This is a curious stock in trade , methinks ; how in the name of all the saints do you gain your livelihood ?
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 5]: This was soon ascertained .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 35]: A minute before the mass was over , he fixed his pole upright in the ground , hung his canvass on it , and unrolled it , displaying a picture divided in six compartments .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 48]: He then hung his fiddle to his button , took his drum , and putting his chair close to his pole , stood upon it , giving a long , but not loud roll of his drum , which he repeated at intervals , to attract attention .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 49]: He had taken his station with judgment ; and as the people came out of church , he had soon a crowd about him , when he commenced with crossing himself , and then continued to explain the legend which was attached to his pictures on the canvass .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 18]: I could not hear all , but still I could understand enough to fill up the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 44]: It was the wonderful cure performed by a certain saint ; and as he told the story , he pointed to the different compartments with his fiddlestick , for he had laid aside his drum as soon as he had collected an audience .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 32]: Now and then he crossed himself devoutly , and at last informed the crowd around him that he had the very prayer , and the very remedy which had been prescribed .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 31]: He then played his fiddle , singing the prayer in a solemn chaunt ; and then he pulled out of his pocket a packet of little books and little boxes .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 35]: They are only one halfpenny each ; and all that is necessary is , that they should touch the figure of the saint on the canvass , to be imbued with the necessary virtue .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 29]: He sells them rapidly ; each time that he puts them to the canvass crossing himself , and insisting that the party who purchases shall do the same .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 48]: He takes his fiddle again , and sings the history of the saint , pointing with his fiddlestick to the compartments of the picture as he goes on ; and now he pulls out more little books and more boxes ; and how fast they purchase them !
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 26]: The stock in trade in his own possession is certainly of little value ; but he possesses a fruitful mine in the superstition of others .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 4]: Ah , well !
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 17]: Are not those inside the church setting him the example of mixing up religion with quackery ?
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 84]: Spa is beautifully situated , between abrupt hills covered with verdure ; the walks cut in these hills are very beautiful , and much pains have been taken to render the place agreeable ; -- no wonder , when we recollect how many crowned heads have visited the place : but the sun of Spa has set , probably never to rise again ; for whatever may be the property of its waters , to be frequented , a watering-place must be fashionable .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 8]: There are many causes for its desertion .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 10]: One is , the effects of the Belgian revolution .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 61]: During the time that Belgium was attached to the Netherlands , the king , with the prince and princess of Orange , came here almost every year , bringing with them , of course , a great number of the nobility ; but now the nobility have deserted the court ; and when Leopold came here , no one followed .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 11]: He was disgusted , and remained but a few days .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 63]: The Prussians used also to resort very much to Spa ; but the king of Prussia finding that so many young men were ruined at the gaming-tables , and so much distress occasioned by it , with a most fatherly despotism , has refused all the officers permission to visit Spa , and has forbidden the medical men to recommend the waters .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 105]: The Russians also flocked in great numbers to Spa ; but the emperor , although very indifferent about their losing their money , is very particular about his subjects gaining revolutionary opinions ; and Spa being in a revolutionary country , has been condemned : they may just as well ask to go to Siberia , for that would probably be their route ; and lastly , there is one more cause which , these two last seasons , has had a powerful effect , neither more nor less than a certain book , called the '' _ Bubbles of the Brunnen _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 42]: I say for the last two seasons , for its influence will not extend to a third , as hundreds and hundreds who have gone to the Baths with the intention of passing this season , have already returned in disgust .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 5]: A word upon this .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 44]: When Sir George Head published his `` Bubbles , '' he set people almost as mad as they were during the great `` Bubble Mania ; '' and like all the mining and other associations , they have proved but bubbles at last .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 59]: It is said that one hundred and thirty-five thousand passports were taken out last year to go up the Rhine , by people who wished to see the pigs go through their daily manoeuvres , to an unearthly solo on the horn , and to witness the decapitation of the Seltzer-water bottles , which were condemned as traitors .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 35]: Now , so large an influx of people to these German watering-places could have but one effect ; that of a glorious harvest to the innkeepers , and those who had lodgings to let .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 34]: The prices , at these places , have now become so enormous , that three florins have been asked for a single bed , and everything else has risen in the same proportion .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 54]: The reaction has now begun to take place , and every day and every hour we have carriages returning through Liege , and other towns , from these watering-places , the occupants holding up their hands , quite forgetting the pigs and bottles , and only exclaiming against extortion , and everything German .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 30]: They have paid too dear for their whistle , as Franklin used to say ; the bubble has burst , and they look with regret at their empty purses .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 14]: And yet , all that Head said in his amusing book was true .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 21]: He rambled through a verdant and unfrequented lane , and described what he felt as he stopped to pick blackberries .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 39]: An immense multitude have followed him , the green lane has been beaten down into a high road , and , as for blackberries , they are only to be procured at the price of peaches in May .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 16]: And now let us reflect whether the bubble will not also burst with the Germans .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 17]: Formerly they were contented with moderate profits , and received their visitors with humility and thankfulness .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 41]: Now , that they have suddenly made large profits , they have become independent and unceremonious ; and , like most people , because they have reaped a golden harvest for two years , they anticipate that it will continue .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 53]: The value of property at these places has risen , speculations have been entered into on a large scale , provisions and the necessaries of life have become dear ; new houses are building against time , and the proprietors smoke their pipes with becoming gravity , calculating upon their future gains .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 39]: But the company will fall off more and more each succeeding year , although the speculations will continue ; for people always find a good reason for a bad season , and anticipate a better one the next .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 58]: At last , they will find that they are again deserted , and property will sink in value to nothing ; the reaction will have fully taken place , prices will fall even lower than they were at first ; honesty and civility will be reassumed , although , probably , the principal will have been lost .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 16]: Thus will the bubble burst with them , as it has already with deserted Spa .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 22]: But when all idle people shall have visited all the bubbling fountains of Germany , where are they to go next ?
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 29]: There are some very nice springs in Iceland not yet patronised ; but although the springs there are hot , the Springs , vernally speaking , are cold .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 48]: I can inform travellers where they will find out something new , and I advise them to proceed to the boiling springs at Saint Michael 's , one of the Western isles , and which are better worth seeing than all the springs that Germany can produce .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 10]: I will act as _ guide de voyage _ .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 60]: When you land at Saint Michael 's , you will find yourself in one of the dirtiest towns in the world , and will put up at one of the worst hotels ; however , you will have to pay just as dear as if lodged at the Clarendon , and fed at the _ Rocher de Cancale _ .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 10]: The town contains many inhabitants , but more pigs .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 10]: German pigs are not to be compared to them .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 65]: You must then hire donkeys and ascend to the mountains , and after a hot ride , you will arrive at a small valley in the centre of the mountains , which was once the crater of a volcano , but is now used by nature as a kettle , in which she keeps hot water perpetually boiling for those who may require it .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 40]: There you will behold the waters bubbling and boiling in all directions , throwing up huge white columns of smoke , brought out in strong relief by the darker sides of the mountains which rear their heads around you .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 44]: The ground you tread upon trembles as you walk ; you feel that it is only a thin crust , and that in a moment you may sink into the vast cauldron below , and have a hot bath without paying for it .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 56]: Continue along the valley , and you will find lakes of still , deadly-cold water , with hot springs at their verge , throwing the smoke over their surface , while they pour in their boiling water as if they would fain raise the temperature ; depositing sulphur in cakes and crystals in their course .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 68]: And in another spot there is a dark , unfathomable hole , called the Devil 's Mouth : you approach it , and you hear low moanings and rumblings , as if nature had the stomach-ache ; and then you will have a sudden explosion , and a noise like thunder , and a shower of mud will be thrown out to a distance of several yards .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 43]: Wait again ; you will again hear the moans and rumblings , and in about three minutes the explosion and the discharge will again take place ; and thus has this eternal diarrhoea continued ever since the memory or tradition of man .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 61]: Yet , upon this apparently insecure and dangerous spot have been erected houses and baths , and it is resorted to by the fashionables of Saint Michael 's , who wish , by its properties , to get rid of certain cutaneous disorders : for the whole air is loaded with sulphurous vapour , as the eternal pot keeps boiling .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 111]: Observe the advantages of this place : -- you may have a bath as hot as you please , as cold as you please , or you may have a mud _ douche _ , if you have that buffalo propensity ; and then you will have to rough it , which is so delightful ; you will find little or nothing to eat , and plenty of bedfellows in all their varieties , a burning sun , and a dense atmosphere , and you will be very delighted to get back again , which , after all , is the _ summum bonum _ to be obtained by travel .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 39]: Not very far from this valley of hot water there is another valley , containing four small lakes , and in those lakes are found the most beautiful gold and silver fish , perhaps , in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 20]: How they came there , Heaven only knows ; but I mention this because there is a curious coincidence .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 16]: These lakes are known by the name of the Quadre Cidade , or four cities .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 50]: Now , if my readers will recollect , in the `` Arabian Nights , '' there is a story of a valley with four lakes , which were once four cities , and that in these lakes were fish of various beautiful colours , who were once the inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 76]: If I recollect right , when the fish were caught and put into the frying-pan , they jumped up and made a speech ; -LRB- so would fish now-a-days , if they were not mute ;-RRB- and the story is told by a prince , whose lower extremities are turned into black marble , very convenient , certainly , if he dined out every day , as he had only his upper toilet to complete .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 60]: This coincidence appeared to me to be very curious , and had I had time and opportunity I certainly should have fried four of these unfortunate fish , to ascertain whether they were of the real breed spoken of in the Arabian Tales , of the authenticity of which no one , I presume , will venture to doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 5]: Spa , July 15 .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 14]: What a curious history might be afforded by Spa and its gaming tables !
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 74]: When Spa was in its glory , when crowned heads met and dukes were forced to remain in their carriages for want of accommodation , when it was the focus of all that was _ recherche _ and brilliant , for Spa was so before the French revolution , the gaming tables were a source of immense profit ; and to whom do you imagine that a great portion of the profits belonged ?
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 27]: -- to no less a person than the most sacred and puissant prince , the Bishop of Liege , who derived a great revenue from them .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 37]: But it would appear as if there was a judgment upon this anomalous secular property , for these gaming-tables were the cause of the Prince Bishop losing all , and being driven out of his territories .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 27]: There were two gaming establishments at Spa , the Redoubt in the town , and the Vauxhall about a quarter of a mile outside of it .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 32]: The Redoubt is a fine building , with splendid ball-rooms and a theatre , but you must go _ through the gaming-rooms _ to enter either the ball-room or the theatre .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 34]: The Vauxhall has no theatre , but the rooms are even more spacious ; but when Spa was at its zenith , even these two immense edifices were barely sufficient for the company .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 48]: Both these establishments were under the same proprietors , and it so happened that the English nobility , who were always a very strong party here , were displeased with the conduct of the lessees , and immediately raised funds for the building of a second Vauxhall .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 53]: The bishop ordered the building to be discontinued , but , as by the privileges granted by former bishops , this was a violation of the rights of the Liegeois , his order was disregarded , and the Vauxhall now known by the name of _ the Vauxhall _ , was finished .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 35]: When finished , the bishop would not permit it to be opened , but his commands being disregarded , he came down with two hundred soldiers and two pieces of cannon and took possession .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 19]: This created a revolution , and the bishop was ultimately obliged to fly his territory and seek assistance .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 48]: The Prussians marched an army into the city , and there was apparent submission , but as soon as they quitted , the insurrection again took place , and the bishop was forced again to solicit aid from the Austrians , for Prussia would no longer interfere .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 40]: Metternich , who was so fond of legitimacy that he considered the gaming-tables a legitimate source of revenue to the apostle , marched in an Austrian army , and hundreds were slaughtered that the bishop might obtain his rights .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 55]: Such was the state of affairs when the French revolution broke out and convulsed Europe , and the province of Liege was among the very first to receive with open arms the _ bonnet rouge _ and to join themselves with France , and thus did the bishop lose his beautiful province for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 14]: As far as Liege was concerned , the French revolution proved a blessing .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 32]: It certainly was a disgraceful finale to an ecclesiastical power , which , as I have before mentioned , had formerly led the van in the march of Christianity and liberty .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 89]: But it appears that the clergy are fated to have an interest in these gaming-tables , the stipend of the English resident clergyman being , even now , paid out of their profits ; for when Belgium was made over to the Netherlands , King William assumed his right to the bishop 's former share of the profits of the tables , and of course brought as many people down here as he could to _ lose their money _ , as he pocketed his _ thirds _ .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 33]: Since the revolution , Leopold is in King William 's shoes , but there are little or no profits , as Spa is deserted and the expenses of the establishments are great .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 29]: Perhaps there is no spot of ground in Europe -- I will not except Paris -- where so much money has been lost by gaming as at Spa .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 18]: I was walking with a friend who pointed out to me a small pavilion in a garden .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 33]: `` There , '' says he , `` the Prince of Orange , who played very deeply , lost to a Spanish gentleman those very jewels that were pretended to be stolen .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 17]: It was well got up in the papers , but that is the real truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 77]: How far it may be the truth or not , I can not pretend to say , and only know that in Spa you can not pick your teeth without all the world knowing it , and that this is fully believed at Spa to be the real truth of the disappearance of the splendid jewels of the princess , which have since been redeemed from the Spanish gentleman , who now resides at the Hague .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 43]: Gaming has always been held up in abhorrence as a vice ; but it is rather a passion strongly implanted by nature , and abhorrent from the dreadful effects produced by its overpowering influence , than a vice _ per se _ .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 18]: Life itself is a lottery , and the best part of our life is passed in gambling .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 20]: It is difficult to draw the line between gambling and speculation , for every speculation is a gambling transaction .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 7]: Is not the merchant a gambler ?
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 12]: in fact , is not every venture an act of gambling ?
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 15]: As for the Stock Exchange , it is the very worst species of gambling .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 52]: All we can say is , that gambling may be legitimate or otherwise ; that is , there are species of gambling which may enrich the individual if he is fortunate , but whether it enriches him or not , at all events it is beneficial to the community at large .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 43]: A merchant speculates -- he sends out manufactures of every description : he fails , and is ruined : but the artisans have procured employment for their industry , and , although the merchant fails , the community at large has benefited .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 13]: This is legitimate gambling ; but do people in business stop there ?
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 37]: No : they will agree to deliver so many thousands of casks of tallow or tons of hemp at such and such a time and at a certain price , whatever the price may then be .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 55]: They can not complete their engagement , and they are ruined ; but in this instance , which is simply termed speculation , we have quite as much gambling as if the money were at once laid down on the table , and the chances decided in an hour instead of so many months .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 32]: But there is this difference , that this party does not injure his character by such a transaction , whereas , if he lost his money at the gaming-table he would .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 29]: The English are , with the exception of the Americans , the most gambling nation under heaven ; naturally so , because they are the greatest mercantile nation .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 18]: The spirit of gambling is innate , and when directed into the proper channel it becomes enterprise .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 47]: It is doubtless a great moral error on the part of a government to encourage vice with the view of increasing the revenue , but , at the same time , there is no tax so well laid on as that which is imposed on vice .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 33]: Again , there are certain propensities in man which can not be overcome , and which , if attempted to be wholly eradicated by legal enactments , would occasion more evil still .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 43]: All that a judicious government can or should attempt to effect is , to restrain them within proper bounds , to regulate them , and as much as possible to keep them out of sight , that the virus may not extend .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 48]: It is well known , that certain houses are licensed by the magistrates , because , it being impossible to eradicate the vice , they can do no more than to separate it , that it may not be communicated to the healthier part of the community .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 39]: Now upon this principle , which is the true principle of sound legislation , I have often thought that it was a great error in our legislature when they consented to put down the public lotteries in England .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 32]: I am convinced that they were beneficial , acting as safety-valves to the gambling spirit of the nation , and that their prohibition has been productive of much crime and misery .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 21]: The spirit of gambling can not be eradicated ; it ought , therefore , to be kept within due bounds .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 36]: There was one great advantage in the English lottery ; it was drawn but once a year , and those who purchased the tickets were content to remain quiet until their success was made known .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 40]: The chances , although very distant , of so high a prize , satisfied the spirit of gambling ; if they lost , they purchased again , and waited patiently for another year , trusting to be more fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 17]: Now , although they gambled , they did not acquire the _ habit _ of gaming .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 12]: What has been the consequence since the lotteries have been abolished ?
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 57]: that there are hells of every description established throughout the metropolis , from those which admit the stake of a shilling , to Crockford 's splendid Pandemonium ; and those who were formerly content with a lottery ticket , now pass their evenings away from their families , and ruin themselves in a very short time .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 7]: The lottery never ruined any one .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 39]: The sum staked might be large for the circumstances of the parties , but it was a yearly stake , and did not interfere with the industry , the profits , or the domestic happiness of the year .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 27]: One half the tradesmen who now appear in the `` Gazette , '' have been ruined by frequenting the low hells with which the metropolis abounds .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 17]: From the above considerations , I do not think it was advisable to abolish the lotteries .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 32]: The next question is one upon which I hesitate to offer an opinion ; but it is worthy of consideration how far it may be advisable to license and tax gaming-houses .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 21]: Were it possible to put them down altogether , the question need not be discussed ; but it is impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 25]: Has any magistrate ventured to interfere with Crockford 's , where it is well known that the highest gaming is carried on every night ?
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 16]: Are you not permitted to walk through the club at any hour of the day ?
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 14]: Do they not have the tables exposed to the view of every one ?
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 27]: Yet who has interfered , although you find that the smaller hells are constantly broken in upon , and the parties had up to the police-office ?
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 8]: Are not the laws made for all ?
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 21]: Is that an offence in the eyes of government in a poor man which is not one in the rich ?
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 10]: Yet this is the case : and why so ?
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 14]: Because the rich will game , and the government can not prevent them .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 16]: Has not a man a right to do as he pleases with his own money ?
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 47]: You legalise the worst of gambling on the Stock Exchange , for a man can there risk what he can not pay : you can not control the gaming of the race-course , and yet you would prevent a man from gambling after his own fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 18]: You wink at the higher classes ruining themselves , and you will not permit the middle classes .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 76]: Now the consequence of not having licensed tables is , that you have no control over them , and the public , who will play , are the dupes of rascals who cheat in every way : whereas , if a certain number were licensed and controlled , those who play would have a better chance , and the licensed tables taxed by government would take care to put down all others who were not .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 64]: We must legislate for society as it is , not as it ought to be ; and , as on other points , we have found it necessary to submit to the lesser evil of the two , it is a question whether in this also we might not do better by keeping within due bounds that which it is impossible to prevent .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 10]: I was amused with an anecdote told me to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 13]: An Englishman and a Frenchman arrived at Spa in the same diligence .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 22]: They both took up their quarters at the same hotel , but from that moment appeared to have no further intimacy .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 8]: `` Do you see that fellow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 22]: would the Englishman say , pointing at the Frenchman , `` I know him , and he 's a confounded rogue .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 10]: I recommend you to be shy of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 6]: `` Voyez-vous cet Anglais ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 9]: said the Frenchman as the Englishman passed by .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 11]: `` Gardez-vous en bien ; c'est un coquin superieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 69]: Thus did they continue to warn the company of each other , until the close of the season , when one fine day they both went off together in the diligence , leaving all their debts unpaid , and their trunks and portmanteaus for the benefit of the landlord of the hotel , who , on opening them , found them to contain nothing but stones and rubbish .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 21]: This was a new species of holy alliance , but the _ ruse _ was by no means ill advised .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 27]: When you hear a man constantly proclaiming the roguery of another , you are too apt to give him credit for honesty in his own person .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 29]: Thus , with those whom each party associated and dealt with , they obtained a credit for honesty , which enabled them to succeed in their roguish endeavours .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 2]: Ostend .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 29]: From Spa to Liege , from Liege to Brussels , from Brussels to Ostend , how detestable it is to go over the same ground again and again !
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 11]: only to be imposed upon and cheated again and again .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 13]: What a weary world this is , and what a rascally one !
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 14]: How delightful a little honesty would be , by way of a change !
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 28]: Of all the rascality spread like butter on bread over the surface of the globe , certainly the butter lies thicker on the confines of each territory .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 14]: There is a concentration of dishonesty at the ports of embarkation and debarkation .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 18]: Take London when you land from a steam-boat , or Dover , or Calais , or Ostend .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 11]: It is nothing but a system of extortion or over-reaching .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 4]: And why so ?
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 29]: because in the hurry , the confusion , the sickness , and the ignorance of what is right , everything that is wrong can be practised with impunity .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 41]: These preyers upon mankind at the confines , remind you of the sharks in India , who always ply _ in the surf _ , where their motions can not be seen , and the unwary are invariably their prey .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 64]: I have knocked three down already , and one would imagine they would hasten for redress ; but they will not , for that would take hours , and during these hours they will lose the opportunity of making their harvest , so they get up again , and pocket the affront , that they may not lose time in filling their pockets .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 22]: Talking about roguery , there was a curious incident occurred some time back , in which a rascal was completely outwitted .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 26]: A bachelor gentleman , who was a very superior draftsman and caricaturist , was laid up in his apartments with the gout in both feet .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 28]: He could not move , but sat in an easy chair , and was wheeled by his servant in and out of his chamber to his sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 20]: Now a certain well-known vagabond ascertained the fact , and watched until the servant was sent upon a message .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 21]: The servant came out of the front door , but left the area door open , communicating with the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 29]: Down went the vagabond , entered the kitchen , and walked up stairs , where , as he anticipated , he found the gentleman quite alone and helpless .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 32]: `` I am sorry , sir , to see you in this situation , '' said the rogue ; `` you can not move , and your servant is out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 4]: The gentleman stared .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 18]: `` It is excessively careless of you to leave yourself so exposed , for behold the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 48]: I take the liberty of removing this watch and these seals off the table , and putting them into my own pocket ; and , as I perceive your keys are here , I shall now open these drawers , and see what suits my purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 24]: pray help yourself , I beg , '' replied the gentleman , who was aware that he could do nothing to prevent him .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 47]: The rogue did so accordingly ; he found the plate in the sideboard drawer , and many other articles which suited him , and in about ten minutes , having made up his bundle , he made the gentleman a very low bow , and decamped .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 56]: But the gentleman had the use of his hands , and had not been idle ; he had taken an exact likeness of the thief with his pencil , and on his servant returning soon after , he despatched him immediately to Bow Street with the drawing , and an account of what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 31]: The likeness was so good , that the man was immediately identified by the runners , and was captured before he had time to dispose of a single article purloined .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 36]: He was brought to the gentleman in two hours afterwards , identified , the property found on him sworn to , and , in six weeks , he was on his passage to Botany Bay .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 4]: London , November .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 9]: We have the signs of the times here .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 19]: I peep through the fog and see quite enough to satisfy me that the prosperity is but partial .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 12]: Money in plenty , but lying in heaps -- not circulated .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 17]: Every one hugs his bag , and is waiting to see what the event may be .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 31]: Retrenchment is written up as evident as the prophetic words of fire upon the walls of Belshazzar 's palace -- _ To let -- to let -- to let _ .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 21]: Leave London in any direction , and you find the same mystical characters every one hundred yards of the road .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 25]: This beautiful villa , this cottage ornee , this capital house with pleasure-grounds , this mansion and park -- all -- all to let .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 23]: It is said that there are upwards of seven thousand of these country seats to let within twelve miles of the metropolis .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 41]: Again , look at the arms of the carriages which still roll through the streets , and you will perceive that if not with a coronet or supporters , nine out of ten have the widow 's _ lozenge _ .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 4]: And why so ?
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 26]: because they belong to the widows of those who died in the times of plenty , and who left them large jointures upon their estates .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 36]: They , of course , can still support and even better support , the expense ; but the estates now yield but sufficient to pay the jointure , and the incumbent swallows up the whole .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 10]: And where are the real owners of the properties ?
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 44]: At Paris , at Naples , at Brussels , if they can afford to be in a Capital -- if not , dispersed over Belgium , Switzerland , and Italy -- retrenching in other countries , or living more comfortably upon their incomes .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 45]: How many millions , for it does amount to millions , are now spent on the continent , enriching the people of other countries , and in all probability laying up for those countries the sinews for another war to be directed against England !
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 35]: How much of wretchedness and starvation has been suffered in our own country within these few years , which , if our people had not been living abroad , might never have been felt !
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 8]: Where are the elite of our aristocracy ?
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 22]: Where are our country gentlemen who used to keep open house at their estates , disseminating their wealth and producing happiness ?
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 39]: All driven abroad -- society disjointed -- no leader of fashion to set the example , by luxurious entertainments , of disseminating that wealth which ultimately finds its way into the greasy pocket of the labourer or mechanic .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 7]: Shops opened late and closed early .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 12]: Gin palaces , like hell , ever open to a customer .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 15]: The pulse of London hardly beats -- it is perceptible , but no more .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 13]: Nothing is active but the press , and the pressure from without .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 28]: But who would remain ten days in London in the month of November , when he can go away , without he had serious thoughts of suicide ?
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 28]: Candles at high noon , yellow fogs , and torches in mid-day , do not suit me , so I 'm off again to a purer atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 5]: Spa , June 30 .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 34]: Yesterday I fell in with two old friends , who , from a mere `` truant disposition , '' joined perhaps with a little good will towards me , came over to Spa .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 22]: As soon as their arrival had been announced , I went to them , and at their request joined their dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 34]: After our first greetings , B -- , who not only appears , but really is , a man of fashion , in the best sense of the term , wanted his snuff-box .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 24]: It was in his bed-room , and his bed-room was locked by the servant , who had taken the key and gone out .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 20]: The consequence was , that B -- had to wait some time , and until the man came back .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 87]: I have always had a great aversion to a valet when constantly moving about on the Continent , as a single man ; and , although I do not now , as I used to do when a midshipman , brush my own clothes and black my own shoes , yet I like independence , in every thing , and infinitely prefer doing anything myself , to being waited upon ; for , generally speaking , it is the master who waits and not the man .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 30]: `` I wonder you bother yourself with such a travelling appendage , B -- , '' observed I , giving him a pinch of snuff to quiet his impatience .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 10]: `` I have never lately travelled with one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 15]: `` My dear fellow -- the comfort of it -- you have no idea .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 11]: It would be impossible to get on without one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 13]: `` Quite impossible , '' observed W -- , my other acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 22]: `` I have been brought up in a school in which the word impossible has been erased from the language . ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 9]: `` Well , but the comfort of it .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 21]: When you arrive , dirty and dusty , your portmanteau opened , all your articles of dress laid out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 32]: `` I can do all that myself sooner than he can ; and , as I must wait till it be done , I may as well do it myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 29]: `` Yes , so you may , but then the security ; every thing locked up , which , in a strange hotel , is so necessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 18]: I lock my own room , and know where to find the key when I come in .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 17]: `` Very likely ; but still it is impossible to travel comfortably without a valet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 9]: `` Quite impossible , '' rejoined W -- .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 15]: `` Be it so , '' replied I ; `` we differ in opinion .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 28]: All I can say is , that necessary as a valet is when stationary , he is a nuisance when you travel _ en garcon _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 41]: The conversation dropped , and we sat down to dinner ; the time passed away , as it always does , when old friends , who respect and like each other , meet , after an absence of some months .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 21]: After dinner we smoked cigars ; and , as the evening advanced , there were none left on the table .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 42]: B -- rang the bell for his servant to procure others ; the servant had gone out and was no where to be found , and for _ security _ had locked the bed-room door and taken the key with him .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 12]: So we drank our claret , and waited for his return .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 12]: `` Thinks I to myself '' -- but I said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 22]: At last , we waited till past twelve o'clock ; but the gentleman 's gentleman was no where to be found .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 17]: B -- was angry with the man , W -- had thrown himself on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 38]: He wished to go to bed after a long day 's travel ; but his key was also , for security , in the valet 's pocket , who had been searched for every where without success .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 34]: B -- begged me not to remain out of politeness ; but I did remain not out of politeness , but of '' _ malice _ , '' as the French term it .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 23]: `` I had too much pleasure in their company to think of leaving them ; '' and we continued to sip brandy-and-water .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 28]: At last , three o'clock came , B -- was out of all patience , W -- snoring on the sofa , and I , quite delighted .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 16]: The sun should have poured his beams upon us before I would have gone away .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 17]: The bell was rung , but in vain , for the waiters would wait no longer .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 27]: It was proposed to send for a menuisier to pick the lock ; but how was one to be found at three o'clock in the morning ?
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 17]: At last the valet , drunk and reeling in his morning jacket , entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 7]: `` The keys the keys ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 6]: demanded B -- in wrath .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 5]: `` The key ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 9]: roared W -- , who had woke up .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 19]: `` I have them , '' replied the valet , with a most knowing leer , facetiously smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 13]: `` I have them -- all safe -- all right , gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 26]: Here they are , '' continued the man , pulling them out , and presenting them as if he had done a very clever thing .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 9]: `` Here they are , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 19]: The man was too tipsy to be expostulated with , and the gentlemen took their keys in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 19]: `` And now , '' said I , `` gentlemen , I wish you a very good night .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 23]: You have fully established the extreme _ comfort _ of a travelling valet , and the impossibility of doing without one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 43]: It was a glorious victory , although to get _ out _ of the house I had to open a window and leap from it , and to get _ into _ my own house at that hour was even more difficult .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 10]: I have been reading Jesse 's `` Gleanings . ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 5]: Is he quite correct ?
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 5]: I have my doubts .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 18]: In one point I certainly do not agree with him , in his favourite opinion of cats .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 55]: I do , however , know an instance of misplaced affection in a cat , which , although it does not add to the moral character of the race , is extremely curious for more reasons than one , and as it happened in my own family , I can vouch for its authenticity .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 19]: A little black spaniel had five puppies , which were considered too many for her to bring up .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 49]: As , however , the breed was much in request , her mistress was unwilling that any of them should be destroyed , and she asked the cook whether she thought it would be possible to bring a portion of them up by hand before the kitchen fire .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 28]: In reply , the cook observed that the cat had that day kittened , and that , perhaps , the puppies might be substituted for her progeny .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 17]: The experiment was made , two of the kittens were removed , and two puppies substituted .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 29]: The cat made no objections , took to them kindly , and gradually all the kittens were taken away , and the cat nursed the two puppies only .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 69]: Now , the first curious fact was , that the two puppies nursed by the cat were , in a fortnight , as active , forward , and playful , as kittens would have been : they had the use of their legs , barked , and gambolled about ; while the other three , nursed by the mother , were whining and rolling about like fat slugs .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 35]: The cat gave them her tail to play with , and they were always in motion ; they very soon ate meat , and long before the others they were fit to be removed .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 11]: This was done , and the cat became very inconsolable .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 28]: She prowled about the house , and on the second day of tribulation fell in with the little spaniel , who was nursing the other three puppies .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 5]: `` O ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 19]: says Puss , putting up her back , `` it is you who have stolen my children . ''
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 22]: `` No , '' replied the Spaniel , with a snarl , `` they are my own flesh and blood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 30]: `` That wo n't do , '' said the cat , `` I 'll take my oath before any justice of peace that you have my two puppies . ''
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 45]: Thereupon issue was joined , that is to say , there was a desperate combat , which ended in the defeat of the spaniel , and the cat walking proudly off with one of the puppies , which she took to her own bed .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 20]: Having deposited this one , she returned , fought again , gained another victory , and redeemed another puppy .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 22]: Now it is very singular that she should have only taken two , the exact number she had been deprived of .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 16]: Does this not prove to a certain extent the power of calculating numbers in animals ?
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 39]: and does not the precocity of the two puppies brought up by the cat , infer there is some grounds for the supposition that with the milk is imbued much of the nature and disposition of the mother ?
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 39]: A few experiments made on these points would be interesting , and we should have a new science , that of _ lacteology _ , to add to craniology , in our nurture and rearing of the species .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 11]: This reminds me of a singular fact , little known .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 36]: The Burmahs , who are disciples of Gaudma , equally with the inhabitants of Pegu and Syriam , whose country they have conquered , worship the White Elephant , who is considered as a god .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 17]: There have been but three white elephants since the foundation of the Burmah dynasty by Alompraa .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 26]: The first one is dead , and I have one of his teeth carved with figures , which was consecrated to the great Dagon Pagoda .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 36]: The second now _ reigns _ -- he is attended by hundreds , wears a howdah , or cloth , studded with precious stones ; which is said to be worth a million of money .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 17]: He also wears his bangles or armlets on each leg , and fares sumptuously every day .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 22]: White elephants are very scarce ; the colour is occasioned by a disease in the animal , a species of leprosy .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 31]: Any elephant hunter in these countries , who is fortunate enough to capture a white elephant , is immediately created a noble , and advanced to high honour and wealth .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 38]: The third white elephant , of which I am about to speak particularly , and who may be considered as the heir apparent , was taken a few months previous to our declaring war against the Burmahs .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 18]: He was very young ; his mother had been killed , and he yet required partial nourishment .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 59]: He was brought to Rangoon , established in one of the best houses in the place , and an edict was sent forth from the capital , ordering that twenty-four of the most healthy young married women should be dedicated to his wants , and if they fell off in powers of nourishment , be replaced by others .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 16]: This was considered an honour -- for were they not nursing a _ God _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 59]: Major Canning , the political agent , who went to see this curious spectacle , described it to me as follows : `` The animal was not above three feet and a few inches high , its colour was a dirty grey , rather than white ; it was very healthy , playful , and in good spirits .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 41]: When I went into the room , which was very spacious , and built of teak-wood , the twenty-four nurses were sitting or lying on mats about the room , some playing at draughts and other games , others working .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 23]: The elephant walking about , looking at them , and what they were doing , as if he understood all about it .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 35]: After a short time , the little deity felt hungry , and , with his trunk he pushed some of the women , but to annoy him they would not yield to his solicitations .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 36]: When he became angry , and was too rough for them , they submitted , and he put his trunk round their waists in the most affectionate manner , while he was supplying himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 36]: I did not see the animal myself , as immediately that they heard of our arrival at the mouth of the river , they despatched him under a strong guard to a place of security .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 23]: But I should like to ascertain hereafter , whether his nurture made him a more reasonable being than are elephants in general .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 11]: How one 's thoughts fly away over time and space !
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 21]: What a rush of incidents crowd into my memory , merely from having mentioned this circumstance of the white elephant .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 43]: I did once intend to have written a narrative of what passed during our sojourn in that country , for I saw more of the inhabitants than most people ; but others have forestalled me , and it is now too late .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 31]: Nevertheless , it will perhaps amuse the reader , if , without entering into the military details , I mention a few of the operations and scenes which then occurred .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 16]: It shall be so then , and we will discourse a little about the Burmahs .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 16]: An Armenian merchant who resided there told me a story one day which was curious .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 22]: The King of Pegu was possessed of the most splendid ruby in the world , both as to size and colour .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 13]: This was well known ; it was the boast of the nation .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 44]: When the Burmahs subdued the kingdom of Pegu , the old king with all his family were taken prisoners , vast treasure was also captured , but the great ruby was not to be found , notwithstanding the torture and beheading of thousands .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 37]: With the usual barbarity of these countries , the old king , a miserable paralytic little man , was stripped naked and confined in an iron cage , which I saw when I was at Rangoon .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 26]: In this confinement he lived for ten or twelve years , every festival day being brought out and exposed to the derision of the populace .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 22]: At last he died , and his body was thrown out to be devoured by the dogs and birds of prey .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 58]: One of the soldiers who assisted to drag the body out of the cage , turned it over with his foot , and perceived that his right hand grasped a hump of _ damma _ , -LRB- a sort of pitch , -RRB- which curiosity induced the Burmah to force out with the point of his spear .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 49]: This had been observed before , but the Burmahs , who are very superstitions and carry about them all sorts of charms , imagined it to be a charm for his paralysis or palsy with which he was afflicted , and therefore had allowed him to retain it .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 67]: But when the Burmah took it up , the weight of it convinced him that it was not all damma : he examined it , and found that it was the great ruby of the Pegu kingdom which had been lost , and which the old man had for so many years , in a state of nudity and incarceration , held in his left hand .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 75]: I asked one of the Burmah chiefs whether this ruby now in the possession of the King of Ava was so fine as represented : his answer was in truly Eastern hyperbole -- `` Dip it in the Irrawaddy , '' said he , -LRB- that is , an enormous river seven hundred miles long and in many parts several miles broad , -RRB- `` and the whole water will turn to blood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 36]: I have said that the Burmahs are very superstitious : they have a great variety of charms which they wear about their persons , but there is one custom of theirs which is very singular .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 37]: They polish rubies ; that is , without cutting them in _ facettes _ , but merely the stone , whatever its primitive shape , is rubbed down on every side until it is perfectly smooth .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 35]: They then make an incision in the flesh , generally the arm or leg , put in the ruby and allow the skin to heal over it , so that the stone remains there .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 66]: Soldiers and sailors in search of plunder will find out any thing , and this practice of the Burmahs was soon discovered ; and after the assault and carrying of a stockade , you would see the men passing their hands over the bodies , and immediately they felt a rising in the limb , out with their knives and cut in for the rubies .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 23]: Indeed , the plunder was more considerable than might be imagined , for every Burmah carried all his wealth about his person .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 12]: Another singular custom arising from their superstition prevails among this people .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 46]: The king has a corps denominated _ Invulnerables _ , whose ranks are filled up in this manner : -- when a criminal is condemned to death for certain offences , such as robbery , he is permitted to challenge as an _ invulnerable _ .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 20]: This is proved by his standing at a certain distance from several men who fire at him with ball .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 19]: Should he not be wounded or killed , he is pronounced an invulnerable and enrolled in the corps .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 27]: In every stockade we attacked , there were always one or two of these men , and they really appeared to believe in their own powers .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 37]: They generally stood above the timbers of the stockade , dancing and capering as the boats advanced , and continued their extravagance amidst a shower of bullets , exposing their persons in a most undaunted manner .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 113]: There was one fellow who , dressed in a short red jacket , and nothing else except the cloth round his loins , who was well known to our men ; they called him _ Happy Jack _ , from the capers which he used to cut , and somehow or another it was his good fortune never to be hit , at least , not that we know of , for taking stockade after stockade , at every fresh attack there was Happy Jack to be seen capering and shouting as usual , and never ceasing to expose himself until the troops had landed and were about to scale the fortress .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 24]: It was quite amusing to hear the men shout out with laughter , `` By heavens , there 's Happy Jack again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 18]: I hope he is alive at this moment ; at all events , he deserves to be .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 2]: Spa .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 88]: Yes , now Spa is agreeable : we have no _ redoubte _ open with fools losing their money , no English _ passants _ looking after amusement , no valetudinarians drinking the _ poupon _ , no Spa boxes crowding every window : we are now as a Spa should be , a _ coterie _ of houses in a ravine , surrounded by the mountains of the Ardennes , crowding and shoving up together in mutual protection against the deep snow and the forest wolves .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 53]: There is something new in this : most of the houses are shut up ; the shop-windows are all bare ; the snow is two feet deep in the streets ; the mountains on every side are white ; the icicles hang upon the leafless boughs , and the rivulets are enchained .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 132]: All is one drear blank ; and except the two-horse diligence which heaves slowly in sight three or four hours past its time , and the post , -LRB- which is now delivered at nine o'clock instead of noon -RRB- ; there is no such thing as an arrival : the boys slide upon their little sledges down the hills ; the cattle are driven home ; the church clock strikes ; and unless we are enlivened by the crowd assembled round the countryman , who appears with the carcass of a wolf which he has been fortunate enough to kill , we are all quiet , monotony and peace : in fact , Spa , now that it is a desert , has become to me , at least agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 25]: They say , this hard winter promises plenty of wolves ; if so , I recommend those who are fond of excitement come here .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 20]: Indeed , it will be profitable , for if they are active huntsmen , they can pay their expenses .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 35]: A dead horse costs little , and in Spa , as they give very little to the horses to eat in summer , and nothing at all in the winter , they die fast .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 27]: You have only to drag the carcass to an outhouse at a little distance from the town , and with your rifle watch during the night .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 35]: The wolves will come down to prey upon the carrion , and it is hard if you do not kill your couple during the night , and then you are rewarded by the commune .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 39]: I do not know what the price is now , but when the King of Holland was in possession of Belgium it was one hundred francs for a male , and three hundred francs for a female wolf .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 34]: Now a brace a night , four hundred francs , or sixteen pounds , is not a bad night 's earning : in Spa it would keep a half-pay officer for three months .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 38]: There is a curious story here , proving the sagacity of a wolf which came down an hour before dusk into the town , and made off with a child of two years old in her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 10]: The cry was raised , and the pursuit immediate .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 33]: After following her track for many miles , she gained upon them , it became quite dark , and the people returned homewards , melancholy at the fate of the poor child .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 38]: When they were about half way back , they heard the wail of an infant , and , guided by it , they arrived at a thick bush , where they found the child alive and unhurt .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 32]: The wolf , finding that her pursuers gained upon her , had deposited the child there , intending to return and make a meal of it upon a more favourable opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 22]: We have had nothing to excite us within these last few days but the death and burial of an old curate .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 17]: He died in all the odour of sanctity three days ago , and was buried yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 19]: He was not loved or even liked , for he wanted that greatest of all gifts -- charity .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 61]: His situation was worth , with offerings , six thousand francs a year , -- a large sum in this country : but he did not give to the poor ; he exacted from them , and they religiously obeyed him , no one killing a pig or anything else without a present of part of it to the curate .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 19]: When the old man was told that he could not live , the ruling passion still governed him .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 31]: He sent for a person to dispose of for him the sundry pieces of pork which he had gathered as presents , then took the extreme unction , and died .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 45]: His will is not known , but he is supposed to be very rich , and whether he leaves his wealth to some nephews , or to support a hospital here which is at present without funds , is a question of some interest .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 15]: He was buried in great parade and procession , followed by hundreds holding candles .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 24]: He was dressed in his best , and every one said that he never looked so clean or so well in his life .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 36]: He was carried on an open _ brancard _ , with his canonical hat on his head , the snow fell fast and settled on his face and clothes , but he felt it not .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 19]: The funeral was as cold as his charity , the thermometer being exactly 130 below the freezing point .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 26]: Except the procession of the dead curate and of a dead wolf , we have had nothing to interest us for the last ten days .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 9]: But I promised to talk about the Burmahs .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 84]: There have been two or three accounts of the military movements , but there has been no inquiry or examination into the character of the people , which , in my opinion , is of more importance than is generally supposed ; for although the East India Company may imagine that they have done with the Burmahs , it is my conviction that the Burmahs have not done with them , and even I may live to witness the truth of my assertion .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 29]: It certainly is a point of some interest to ascertain from whence the Burmah nation originally came : that they are not aborigines , I think most certain .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 31]: They are surrounded by the Cochin Chinese , the Chinese , and the Hindoos , all races of inferior stature and effeminate in person , with little or no beard .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 36]: Now the Burmahs are a very powerful race , very muscular in their limbs , possessing great strength and energy : generally speaking , I should say , that they are rather taller than Europeans .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 38]: They have the high cheek bones of the Tatar , but not the small eyes ; they have strong hair and beards , and certainly would remind you of a cross between the Jew and the Tatar .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 62]: This is singular ; and it gave the idea to some of those who are fond of indulging in theory , that they might be the remnants of that portion of the Jews who , when permitted to leave Babylon , instead of going east with the others , bent their course to the westward and were never spoken of afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 43]: But the only props they had to this argument were the appearance of the people , the weight in silver being called the _ tekel _ or shekel , and the great pagoda having the name of the _ Dagon _ pagoda .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 31]: At least I heard of no more to support the argument but those three , which can hardly be sufficient , although the coincidence of the two words is singular .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 49]: The Burmahs are semi-barbarous : but this term must be used in the most favourable light ; because , surrounded on every side by people who are wedded to their own customs , the Burmahs have a liberality and a desire to improve , which is very remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 73]: I never met with any Burmah , not even a lad , who could not read and write ; they allow any form of religion to be made use of , and churches of any description to be built by foreigners , but they do not like missionaries making converts of their own people ; for as the king is the head of the religion , conversion is a breach of allegiance .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 18]: One of the missionaries had an audience with the king , and demanded permission to make proselytes .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 25]: The king replied that the missionary might convert as many as he pleased , but that he would cut all their heads off afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 22]: The missionary had not much trouble , when this answer was made known , in counting the heads of his proselytes .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 28]: In their own religion , which is Budhism , the Burmahs appear to be very relax ; it is too absurd for the energy of their minds .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 32]: Those who enter the priesthood wear a yellow dress ; but if a priest at any time feels disposed to quit his profession , he is at liberty so to do .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 24]: All he has to do is to throw off his yellow garment ; but at the same time he can never resume it .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 15]: The Burmahs are superstitious about charms , but are not superstitious on religious points .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 55]: In fact , there is very little religion among them , and had we , at the close of the war , instead of demanding a crore of rupees , insisted that they should embrace Christianity , the king would have given the order , and the whole nation would have nominally been Christians .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 15]: I once asked a Burmah soldier what was his idea of a future state .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 49]: His idea of bliss was singular -- `` I shall be turned into a buffalo , and shall lie down in a meadow of grass higher than my head , and eat all day long , and there wo n't be a single mosquito to annoy me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 55]: While on the subject of religion , I may here observe , that at the capture of Rangoon I entered a Chinese temple , the altar-piece , if I may use the term , was the Ganesa of the Hindoos , but not seated on the lotus leaf , but on the Chinese rat .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 24]: On each side of this were two little candelabras , formed of the Egyptian ibis , holding the oil cups in its beak .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 17]: I also found the Hounyman , or monkey god of the Hindoos , and Budhist figures .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 63]: I once observed some sepoys playing and laughing at a bronze image they had picked up at the pagoda of Syriam , and on examining it , I was surprised to find that it was a figure of the Egyptian Isis , with her hand raised , and her person in the position described as the correct one when blessing the world .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 20]: The art of embalming appears to be known to the Burmahs , and is occasionally practised by the priests .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 45]: At the capture of the old Portuguese fort at Syriam , I found , not far from it , a sort of canopied shed , decorated with carving , cut paper , and tinsel , and supported by four pillars , like a bedstead .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 12]: Below lay the body of a priest , embalmed and gilt .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 47]: I intended to have brought this home , but before I arrived there , I found one of my marines , a graceless dog without religion or any other good quality , very busy hammering the mummy to pieces with the butt end of his musket .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 11]: I was very angry , and ordered him to desist .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 43]: In excuse , he replied that it was an abominable molten image , and it was his duty , as a _ good Christian _ , to destroy it -- the only evidence of Christianity ever witnessed on that fellow 's part .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 83]: On examination , I found that the body had been wrapped in sundry clothes , and , like the ark of Noah , pitched within and without : over the clothes was a coat of damma , then of chunam , and lastly it was gilt ; the head of the mummy was fictitious , and formed of a cocoa-nut , the real skull being where , in the mummy , would have appeared to have been the breast of the body .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 28]: It did not smell much , but there were a great many small scarabei inside , and it was so mutilated that I did not remove it .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 38]: The Burmahs are cleanly in their houses , which generally are raised from the ground a few feet , so as to allow the pigs ; which are the scavengers of the town , to walk under .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 37]: They have houses of brick , or stone and mortar , such as the custom-house at Rangoon , and one or two others ; but the most substantial houses are usually built of thick teak plank .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 48]: The smaller houses and cottages are built of bamboo , the floors and walls being woven like wicker-work : the cleanliness and the beauty of these houses when new are very remarkable , and what is still more so , the rapidity with which they are built .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 47]: I have known an officer order a house to be built of three rooms , with doors and windows to each , and of a comfortable size , and three or four Burmahs will complete this house in a day , and thatch the roof over .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 34]: In another point , the Burmahs show a degree of civilisation , which might be an example to the northern Athens -- to every house there is a very neat and clean cloaca .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 37]: The government , like all in Asia , is most despotic ; and the people have the faults which are certain to be generated by despotism -- but not to that degree which might be expected .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 16]: They have their hereditary nobility , and the orders of it are very clearly defined .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 60]: They consist of gold chains , worn round the neck , with four plates or chased bosses dividing them ; the lowest order wears the bosses linked together by three chains , the next highest in degree with six , the next nine , and the last and highest order has twelve ; the king only wears twenty-four chains .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 20]: The use of gold and silver , as drinking cups , etcetera , is only permitted to the nobility .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 44]: They are very clever in chasing of metals , and they have a description of work in glass and enamel , quite their own , with which they decorate the temples , houses of the priests , and coffers containing the sacred volumes .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 33]: Their ornamental writings in the Pali language , a variety of the Sanscrit , known only to the priests , are also very beautiful -- especially that upon long leaves of ivory .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 18]: Upon the whole , their manufactures are superior to all around them , except perhaps the Chinese .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 49]: The women are small , and delicately formed , in proportion to the men ; they are not shut up , but go where they please ; their dress is becoming ; they braid the hair with flowers , and they are much fairer than would be supposed .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 13]: Those who keep much within doors are nearly as white as Europeans .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 47]: They have a singular custom of putting a patch of white chunam on the cheek bone , something in opposition to the black patches which used formerly to be worn by our belles ; and it is intended to show how near they approach to white .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 45]: Indeed , when the men of the lower class , who are exposed all day to the sun , remove their garments , it is singular to witness how many shades lighter they are in that part of their bodies which is covered up .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 15]: Usually , the men have but one wife , but occasionally there are supernumeraries .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 30]: The laws of the Burmahs appear to be good , but , as in all despotic countries , they are not acted upon , unless it please the ruler .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 8]: Slavery of a certain species is allowed .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 64]: Should one man be in debt to another , and is summoned before the chief ; if he states his inability to pay , he is asked how many children he has , and according to the debt , so are his children given in bond slavery to his debtor , who writes off a certain sum every year until they are free .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 21]: If he has no children , his wife , or himself perhaps , will be bonded in the same manner .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 69]: But in this case , where ill-treatment can be proved , the bondage will be removed ; and further , any person so bonded , may at his or her wish remove to the service of another master , provided they can find one who will pay to the debtor the amount still due , and thus finish the time of servitude under one whom they like better .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 12]: These bonds are all in writing , and must be produced .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 15]: Some of our military officers released several of the young women from their slavery .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 19]: _ Sitting down _ in your presence , is , among the Burmese , a mark of respect .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 26]: Every poor man who is sent for , immediately drops down on his hams in the corner of the room , or at the portal .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 28]: The use of the cocoa , or betel nut , is universal among the men , but not so common with the women until they grow old .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 26]: The consequence is , that the teeth of the men are quite black and decayed , while those of the young women are very good .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 30]: The most remarkable feature in the character of the Burmahs is their _ good temper _ ; I think they are the most even-tempered race , ever met with .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 11]: They are always gay , always content under any privation .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 34]: I had , as will be seen hereafter , more opportunities of seeing into the character of this people than others had , for we mixed with them in amity for some weeks .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 17]: They are very fond of marionettes , and puppet playing , and are very amusing mimics .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 11]: They work very hard , and with the greatest cheerfulness .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 51]: They have a high respect for the English , or the white faces , as they call us ; and the superiority of our warlike instruments , and our ships , _ was _ a subject of wonder , and , at the same time , of most careful examination .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 16]: They perceive how far they are behind us , and are most anxious to improve .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 69]: From this reason , joined to others , it was a pity that we ever made war with the Burmahs ; they had made an easy conquest of those around them , and were satisfied with their supposed superiority , but now they are not , for they are active and enterprising , fond of war , and will not be content until they have improved their system .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 76]: Twenty years hence we shall find the Burmahs a much more formidable nation than they are at present , for they have every quality necessary to become the first nation in the East : indeed , when we consider with what weapons they defended themselves , and the nature of the warfare , it is not a little to their credit that they held out for nearly three years against the power of Great Britain .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 4]: February , 1836 .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 24]: The Burmahs are decidedly a brave nation : the government being despotic , their rulers are cruel , but the people are not .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 14]: I state this , as cowardice and cruelty usually go hand in hand .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 21]: Good temper and generosity are the prominent features in their character -- excellent materials to work upon in judicious hands .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 40]: I witnessed acts of courage at the early part of the war , before the Burmahs found out how impossible it was to cope with our superior arms , which were most surprising , and which excited our admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 15]: They are peculiarly a warlike nation ; indeed , they are fond of war .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 26]: Every man is a soldier , and when ordered out to join the ranks , obeys without receiving any pay , providing his own arms .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 14]: This fact , at once , establishes that they are inclined to war .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 47]: Their aims generally consist of a double-handed sword , a weapon of great force , and very large spears ; but every one will possess a musket if he can , and if it has not a lock , he will fire it with a match .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 54]: It is in this point that the Burmahs are so deficient in aims : we used to consider it a very courageous act to venture to fire off a Burmese musket , they were in such a wretched condition : and to crown all , every man _ makes his own gunpowder _ .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 37]: Now it may be easily imagined what stuff this must be ; as , previous to an expected combat , each Burmah sits down and composes the article to the best of his knowledge and belief .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 42]: The consequences are , that when these muskets do go off -LRB- and it is ten to one they do not -RRB- , it is again ten to one that the bullet falls short , from the inefficacy of the powder .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 34]: There is another singular fact , and one which proves that they have been used to muskets but a short time : it is , that they have no bullet-moulds or leaden bullets .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 39]: All their bullets are of iron , hammered as round as they can hammer them at the forge ; of course the windage produced by this imperfect shape , occasions it to deviate much from its intended direction .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 20]: The guns on their stockades and war-boats are equally defective from bad powder , and the hammered iron bullets .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 15]: It is difficult to know where they could have collected such a curious assemblage .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 30]: Sometimes you will fall in with a small brass piece of exquisite Spanish manufacture , at others you will find them of the strangest forms that can be conceived .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 21]: I rather think they were purchased , or taken as a part of the duties on vessels trading to Rangoon .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 29]: I recollect once at the first taking of a stockade , we knocked off the trunnions of an old iron gun , and left it there as useless .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 46]: The Burmahs reoccupied the stockade , and we had to take it a second time , when we found that they had most ingeniously supplied the want of trunnions with iron hoops and rivets , and the gun was fired at us before we entered .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 43]: At another time , we entered a stockade which had kept up a brisk fire for a few minutes , and to our surprise found that they had made _ wooden _ guns , very well bound and braced with iron hoops .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 57]: Of course these guns would not fire more than two or three shots each , as the touch-holes became inflamed , and were soon so large as to render the guns unserviceable ; but I mention these points , to prove the perseverance of these people , and the efforts they made in their own defence .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 70]: After the first campaign it is true that they deserted , and the levies were made by force ; but the reason of this , for I inquired into it , was not that they had any objection to fight , but that , fighting without pay , they wanted to go home and put the seed into the ground , as otherwise their wives and families would starve .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 35]: The Burmah war-boats are very splendid craft , pulling from eighty to one hundred oars ; the Burmahs manage them very dexterously , and will pull them from seven to eight miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 42]: They have a war-boat dedicated to the Deity , which brought intelligence that saved the nation at the time of the war with the empire of Pegu , in a space of time so short , as almost to appear incredible .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 25]: As I before observed , the gun mounted on the boat 's bow is of little effect , but their spears are really formidable .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 33]: At a night attack upon some of our vessels , anchored off a stockade which they wanted to regain , I had an evidence of the force with which they are thrown .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 40]: The sides of the vessels were covered with them , sticking out like porcupine 's quills , and they had entered the plank with such force , that it required a very strong arm to pull them out again .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 40]: We lost some men by them ; the effect of a hundred spears hurtling through the air at the same time was singularly appalling to our men , who were not accustomed the sound , especially during the night .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 35]: I heard several of the sailors observe afterwards that they `` did not like that at all , '' and I am sure they would have infinitely preferred to have been met with fire-arms .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 26]: Some of these spears were sixteen feet long , with an iron head , sharp at both sides , weighing from twelve to fourteen pounds .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 27]: I have seen bows and arrows in the possession of the Burmahs , but never have observed that they used them in their conflicts with us .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 6]: They appeared to despise them .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 21]: The system of warfare and defence pursued by these people , is undoubtedly excellent for the peculiarities of the country .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 42]: Their stockades are usually built of any thick teak timber , or rather squared trees , which are much too strong to be penetrated by any other than battering cannon , and , in consequence , were invariably carried by escalade .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 18]: Some of them are built of bamboos , running from a foot to two feet in diameter .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 28]: These are equally strong , with the peculiarity that if you fire cannon at them the bamboos yield , admit the shot , and then close again .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 51]: If these stockades are not close to the river side , they usually have a deep ditch round them , and are further protected by what was more serious to us than the escalading , which were abbatis of pointed bamboos , stuck in a slanting direction in the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 17]: The slight wounds made by these bamboos brought on lock-jaw , and too often terminated fatally .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 25]: In the attacks upon us at Rangoon they made their approaches with some degree of military skill , throwing up trenches as they advanced .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 11]: Their fire-rafts on such a rapid river were also formidable .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 33]: They have wells of petroleum up the country : their rafts were very large , and on them , here and there , were placed old canoes filled with this inflammable matter .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 28]: When on fire , it blazed as high as our maintop , throwing out flames , heat , and stink quite enough to drive any one away .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 45]: I have mentioned their mode of warfare and their deficiencies , to prove that if the Burmahs had been as well provided with every species of arms equal to our own , the country would not have been so soon subjugated as it was .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 19]: Their system of defence was good , their bravery was undoubted , but they had no effective weapons .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 35]: I strongly suspect that they will , now that they have been taught their inferiority , use every means to obtain them ; and if so , they will really become a formidable nation .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 48]: As one proof of their courage , I will mention , that at every stockade there is a look-out man , perched on a sort of pole , about ten feet or more clear of the upper part of the stockade , in a situation completely exposed .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 50]: I have often observed these men , and it was not till the cannonade had fairly commenced on both sides , that they came down , and when they did , it was without hurry ; indeed , I may say , in a most leisurely and indifferent manner .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 11]: Of their invulnerables and their antics I have already spoken .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 17]: In countries governed despotically , life is not so much valued as it is in others .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 25]: The very knowledge that it may be taken in a moment at the will of the rulers , renders even the cowardly comparatively indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 24]: Having been accustomed from our earliest years to anticipate an event , when it actually arrives we meet it with composure and indifference .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 46]: The lad in England who is brought up to thieving , and who is continually reminded by his parents , that he _ must be hung _ before he is twenty goes to the gallows when his turn comes with much _ sang froid _ .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 32]: So it is in a despotic country , where the people witness the heads of their companions roll on the ground , and surmise how soon their own turn will come .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 12]: I had more than one evidence of this during my stay .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 17]: In one instance I wished to obtain information from a prisoner , but could extract none .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 43]: He had been sitting between the carronades on deck for twenty-four hours , and some of the men or officers had given him a bowl of grog and a couple of cigars , with which he was busy when I interrogated him .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 49]: As he professed ignorance , I told him that if he would not give me the desired information , I should take his head off ; and I sent for the serjeant of marines , who appeared with two of his party , and with his drawn sword .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 55]: We called him out from between the guns , but he begged through the interpreter to be allowed to finish his grog , to which I consented : when that was done , he was again ordered out , but requested leave to finish about an inch of cigar which remained in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 22]: To which I also acceded , not being in a particular hurry to do that which I never intended to do .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 21]: During all this the man was perfectly composed , and did not show the least alarm at his approaching fate .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 20]: As soon as the cigar was finished , he bound his long hair up afresh , and made preparation .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 63]: I again asked him if he would tell , but he pleaded ignorance , and stepped forward , went down on his knees and took off the cloth from about his loins , which he spread on the deck to receive his head , and then putting his hands on the deck , held it in the position to be cut off .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 12]: Not a muscle trembled , for I watched the man carefully .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 38]: He was , of course , remanded , and the sailors were so pleased with him , that he went on shore with more grog and more tobacco than he had probably ever seen in his life .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 33]: The Burmahs have , however , a means of extracting information from spies , etcetera , which I never saw practised by them , although it was borrowed from them by us .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 30]: It was in our own quarter-master-general 's office that I witnessed this species of torture , so simple in its operation , and apparently so dreadful in its effects .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 25]: It consists in giving one single blow upon the region of the heart , so as to stop for some seconds the whole circulation .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 82]: The way by which this is effected is as follows : -- the man -- the Burmahs are generally naked to the waist -- is made to sit down on the floor ; another man stands behind him , and leaning over him , takes a very exact aim with his sharp bent elbow at the precise spot over his heart , and then strikes a blow which , from its being propelled so very mechanically , descends with increased force .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 34]: The effect appears dreadful ; the dark hue of the sufferer 's face turns to a deadly white ; the perspiration bursts out from his forehead , and he trembles in every limb .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 7]: I never witnessed such apparent agony .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 24]: These blows repeated three or four times , will unman the most resolute , and they will call for death as a favour .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 44]: There is one point which must not be overlooked by the Indian government , and which , connected with what I have already mentioned , makes the Burmese nation more formidable ; it is , the great contempt they have for the sepoys .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 15]: And what is equally true , the fears which the sepoys have of them .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 17]: The Burmahs are only afraid of the white faces , as I shall very soon establish .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 12]: They despise the sepoys , although they are so well armed .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 56]: Now , that the sepoys are good troops , there can be no doubt ; they have proved it often ; but , at the same time , they are not , as some of the Indian officers have asserted in my presence , the best troops in the world , and preferable to Europeans .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 51]: That they are much easier to control , and that they excel in discipline , I grant , because they are never intoxicated ; but they have , in the first place , very little stamina , and are , generally speaking , a small and very effeminately built race .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 37]: Still they have fought well -- very well ; but they never fought well against the Burmahs ; and for this simple reason , -- that superstition is more powerful than courage , and subdues it .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 44]: The sepoys are very superstitious , and had the idea , which was never eradicated , that the Burmahs were _ charmed men _ , and they never went out against them willingly , even when they were headed by the English troops .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 13]: As for the Burmahs ' contempt of them , it was notorious .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 64]: I have myself seen one of the Burmah prisoners at Rangoon lift up a piece of timber that six of the sepoys could hardly have moved , and throw it down , so as to make it roll at the feet of the sepoy guard who watched him , making them all retreat several paces , and then laugh at them in derision .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 8]: But we had many more decisive proofs .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 19]: The Burmahs had stockaded themselves about seven miles from Rangoon , and it was determined to dislodge them .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 33]: Colonel S -- , who was very partial to the native troops , was ordered on this service , and he requested particularly that he might have no troops but the sepoys .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 39]: Sir A Campbell did not much like to consent , but , as the stockades were not higher than breastworks , and the Burmahs not in very great force , he eventually yielded to the Colonel 's arguments .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 15]: Fifteen hundred sepoys were ordered out , and the Colonel went on his expedition .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 39]: The Burmahs had good intelligence that there were no European troops , and when the sepoys arrived , they did not wait to be attacked , but attacked the sepoys , and put them completely to the rout .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 32]: One half of the sepoys were said to be killed ; the others came back to Rangoon in parties of ten or twelve , and in the utmost consternation and confusion .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 24]: Sir A Campbell was , of course , much annoyed , and the next day a European force was despatched against the Burmahs .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 11]: On their arrival they witnessed a dreadful and disgusting scene .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 41]: A long avenue had been cut in the wood , and on each side of it were hung by the heels , at equal distances , shockingly mutilated , the naked bodies of the seven hundred and fifty sepoys killed .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 23]: The Burmahs did not , however , attempt to resist the European force , but after a few shots made their retreat .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 28]: Now , this is a very important fact : and it is a fact which can not be denied , although it has not been made known .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 87]: In India there is a nominal force of three hundred thousand men ; but they are scattered over such a vast extent of territory , that , allowing they could be made disposable , which they could not , it would require many months before they could be collected , and if the Burmahs despise the sepoys , and the sepoys dread the Burmahs , the only check against the latter will be the European troops ; and of them how many can be called out .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 26]: Not ten thousand , at the very utmost ; and the difficulty of collecting them was well known at the commencement of the Burmah war .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 62]: There certainly is a great difference between attacking others in their own territories , and defending ourselves ; but if the Burmahs could hold out against us , as they did , for nearly three years , without arms to cope with us , what might be the consequence if they were supplied with arms and officers by any other nation ?
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 37]: We have now a footing in the country , and it must be our object to prevent the ingress of any other , and to keep the Burmahs as quiet and as peaceable as we can .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 37]: But our very intercourse will enlighten them by degrees , and we have more to dread from that quarter than from all the hordes of Russia or Runjeet Sing , and the whole disaffection of India .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 30]: As I have more to say relative to the Burmahs , I will , in my next chapter , enter into a short narrative of the expedition to Bassein .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 30]: It was a bloodless one , although very important in its results : and circumstances occurred in it which will throw much light upon the character of the nation .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 38]: It was not until many months after the war had been carried on , that Sir Archibald Campbell found himself in a position to penetrate into the heart of the Burmah territory , and attempt the capital .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 25]: He wanted almost every thing , and among the rest reinforcements of men ; for the rainy season had swept them off by thousands .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 55]: At last , when determined to make the attempt , he did it with a most inadequate force ; so small that , had the Burmahs thought of even trenching up and barricading the roads at every half mile , he must have been compelled , without firing a shot , to have retreated .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 22]: Fortunately , he had an accession of men-of-war , and his river detachment was stronger than he could have hoped for .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 50]: I do not pretend to state the total force which was embarked on the river or that which proceeded by hand , communicating with each other when circumstances permitted , as the major part of the provisions of the army were , I believe , carried up by water .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 54]: The united river force was commanded by Brigadier Cotton , Captain Alexander , and Captain Chads ; the land forces , of course , by Sir A Campbell , who had excellent officers with him , but whose tactics were of no use in this warfare of morass , mud , and jungle .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 21]: It will be proper to explain why it was considered necessary to detach a part of the forces to Bassein .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 23]: The Rangoon river joins the Irrawaddy on the left , about one hundred and seventy miles from its flowing into the ocean .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 51]: On the right of the Irrawaddy is the river of Bassein , the mouth of it about one hundred and fifty miles from that of the Irrawaddy , and running up the country in an angle towards it until it joins it about four hundred miles up in the interior .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 44]: The two rivers thus enclose a large delta of land , which is the most fertile and best peopled of the Burmah provinces , and it was from this delta that Bundoola , the Burmah general , received all his supplies of men .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 47]: Bundoola was in the strong fortress of Donabue , on the Bassein side of the river , about half way between where the Rangoon river joined it on the left , and the Bassein river communicated with it a long way farther up on the right .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 60]: Sir A Campbell 's land forces were on the left of the river , so that Bundoola 's communication with the Bassein territory was quite open ; and as the river forces had to attack Donabue on their way up , the force sent to Bassein , was to take him in the rear and cut off his supplies .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 19]: This was a most judicious plan of the General 's , as will be proved in the sequel .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 52]: Major S -- , with four or five hundred men in three transports , the Larne , and the Mercury , Hon. Company 's brig , were ordered upon this expedition , which sailed at the same time that the army began to march and the boats to ascend the river .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 79]: On the arrival at the mouth of the river we found the entrance most formidable in appearance , there being a dozen or more stockades of great extent ; but there were but two manned , the guns of the others , as well as the men , having been forwarded to Donabue , the Burmahs not imagining , as we had so long left that part of their territory unmolested , that we should have attempted it .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 44]: Our passage was therefore easy ; after a few broadsides , we landed and spiked the guns , and then , with a fair wind , ran about seventy miles up one of the most picturesque and finest rivers I was ever in .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 23]: Occasionally the right lines of stockades presented themselves , but we found nobody in them , and passed by them in peace .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 20]: But the river now became more intricate , and the pilots , as usual , knew nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 30]: It was , however , of little consequence ; the river was deep even at its banks , over which the forest trees threw their boughs in wild luxuriance .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 37]: The wind was now down the river , and we were two or three days before we arrived at Bassein , during which we tided and warped how we could , while Major S -- grumbled .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 23]: If the reader wishes to know why Major S -- grumbled , I will tell him -- because there was no fighting .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 30]: He grumbled when we passed the stockades at the entrance of the river because they were not manned ; and he grumbled at every dismantled stockade that we passed .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 56]: But there was no pleasing S -- ; if he was in hard action and not wounded , he grumbled ; if he received a slight wound , he grumbled because it was not a severe one ; if a severe one , he grumbled because he was not able to fight the next day .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 17]: He had been nearly cut to pieces in many actions , but he was not content .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 41]: Like the man under punishment , the drummer might strike high or strike low , there was no pleasing S -- : nothing but the _ coup de grace _ , if he be now alive , will satisfy him .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 16]: But notwithstanding this mania for being carved , he was an excellent and judicious officer .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 61]: I have been told he is since dead ; if so , his Majesty has lost one of the most devoted and chivalric officers in his service , to whom might most justly be applied the words of Hotspur , -- `` But if it be a sin to covet honour , I am the most offending soul alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 6]: -LSB- See note 1 . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 30]: As I before observed , the branches of the trees hung over the sides of the river , and a circumstance occurred which was a source of great amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 28]: We had a little monkey , who had been some time on board , and was a favourite , as usual , of the ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 43]: The baffling winds very often threw us against the banks of the river , near which there was plenty of water ; and when this was the case , the boughs of the trees were interlaced with the rigging of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 61]: This unusual embracing between nature and art gave Jacko the idea of old times when he frolicked in the woods , and unable to resist the force of early associations , he stepped from the top-sail yard to the branch of a large tree , and when the ship had hauled off clear , we found that Jacko had deserted .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 23]: We lamented it , and ten minutes afterwards , thinking no more about him , we continued our course up the river .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 33]: About an hour had elapsed , during which we had gained upwards of a mile , when again nearing the bank on that side , we heard a loud chattering and screaming .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 21]: `` That 's Jacko , sir , '' said one of the men , and others expressed the same opinion .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 19]: We manned the jolly-boat , and sent it on shore towards the place where the noise was heard .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 54]: The monkey did not wait till the bow of the boat touched the shore , but springing into it when some feet off , he took his seat very deliberately on the stern , and was pulled on board , where immediately he flew up the side , caressing every one he met .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 45]: The fact was , that Jacko had found several of his own race in the woods , but , like all wild animals , they immediately attacked one who had worn the chains of servitude , and Jacko had to fly for his life .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 32]: We very often interlaced the rigging with the boughs after that , but the monkey remained quiet on the booms , and showed not the slightest wish to renew his rambles .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 34]: I think it was on the third day that we arrived below the town of Naputah , which was defended by a very formidable stockade , commanding the whole reach of the river .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 45]: The stockade was manned , and we expected that it would be defended , but as we did not fire , neither did they ; and we should have passed it quietly , had not S -- grumbled so much at his bad luck .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 18]: The next day we arrived at Bassein , one of the principal towns in the Burman Empire .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 44]: Here again the Major was disappointed , for it appeared that , on hearing of the arrival of the expedition at the entrance of the river , the people had divided into two parties , one for resistance , the other for submission .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 35]: This difference of opinion had ended in their setting fire to the town and immense magazines of grain , dismantling the stockades , and the major part of the inhabitants flying into the country .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 15]: The consequence was , that we took possession of the smoking ruins without opposition .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 22]: It was soon observed that the people were tired of the protracted war , and of the desolation occasioned by it .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 14]: They wanted to return to their wives and families , who were starving .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 59]: But up to this time the chiefs had remained faithful to Bundoola , who had amassed stores and provisions at Bassein , intending to retreat upon it , should he be driven out of the fortress of Donabue ; and as long as he held that fortress , receiving from Bassein his supplies of men and of provisions .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 60]: The Burmahs were so unwilling to fight any longer , that they were collected by armed bands , and made prisoners by the chiefs , who sent them up as required ; and many hundreds were still in this way detained , enclosed in stockaded ground , and watched by armed men , in several towns along the river .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 51]: An expedition was first despatched up the river , to its junction with the Irrawaddy , as there was a town there in which was the dockyard of the Burmahs , all their war boats , and _ canoes _ of every description being _ built _ at that place .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 32]: They ascended without difficulty , and , after a little skirmishing , took possession of the place , burnt all the boats built or building , and then returned to Bassein .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 37]: Of course , we had then nothing to do : Major S -- 's orders were to join Sir A Campbell , if he possibly could ; which , with much difficulty , he ultimately effected .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 31]: We must now return to the Irrawaddy expedition sent up at the same time that Sir A Campbell marched by land , and our expedition went up the Bassein river .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 11]: This force arrived at Donabue before we had gained Bassein .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 50]: It found a most formidable fortress , or rather , three fortresses in one , mounting a great number of guns , and , as I before observed , held by Bundoola , the commander of the Burmah forces , in whom the Burmah troops placed the greatest confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 34]: I speak from hearsay and memory , but I believe I am correct when I state that there were not less than ten thousand men in Donabue , besides war elephants , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 46]: Now the river force did not amount in fighting men certainly to one thousand , and they were not in sufficient strength to attack a place of this description , upon which every pains had been taken for a long while to render it impregnable .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 44]: The attack was however made , and the smaller stockade of the three carried ; but when they had possession of the smallest stockade , they discovered that they were at the mercy of the second , and in a sort of trap .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 19]: The consequence was , defeat -- the only defeat experienced by the white troops during the whole war .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 23]: The troops were re-embarked , and the boats were obliged to drop down the river clear of the fire of the fort .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 38]: I believe two hundred and fifty English troops were left dead in the stockade , and the next day their bodies , crucified on rafts , were floated down among the English boats by the triumphant Bundoola .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 50]: In the meantime a despatch had been sent to Sir A Campbell , who was in advance on the banks of the river ; stating that the force afloat was not able to cope with the fortress , the real strength of which no one had been aware of .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 34]: The consequence was , that Sir A Campbell retraced his steps , crossed the river , and attacked it in conjunction with the flotilla , Sir A Campbell taking it in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 31]: After some hard fighting , in which the elephants played their parts , the troops gained possession , and Bundoola having been killed by a shell , the Burmahs fled .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 55]: Now it was very fortunate that the expedition had been sent to Bassein , for otherwise the Burmahs would have fallen back upon that place , which held all their stores , and would thus have been able to continue in the rear of Sir A Campbell , as he advanced up the river .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 24]: But they had heard of the destruction and capture of Bassein , and consequently directed their flight up the river towards the capital .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 73]: We were in possession of all these circumstances shortly after we had taken possession of Bassein ; and although the death of Bundoola and taking of Donabue had dispirited the Burmahs , yet there were many chiefs who still held out , and who , had they crossed with their troops to the Irrawaddy , would have interrupted the supplies coming up , and the wounded and sick who were sent down .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 16]: We had , therefore , still the duty of breaking up these resources if possible .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 47]: Having ascertained who the parties were , we sent a message to one of the weakest to say , that if he did not tender his submission , and come in to us , we should attack him , and burn the town to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 23]: The chief thought it advisable to obey our summons , and sent word that he would come in on the ensuing day .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 44]: He kept his promise : about noon , as we were sitting in the verandah of a large _ Sammy _ house -LRB- a sort of monastery -RRB- , which we had taken possession of , we were informed that he had arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 22]: The token of submission on the part of the Burmahs is , presenting the other party with _ wax candles _ .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 33]: If a poor man has a request to make , or favour to ask of a great man , he never makes it without laying a small wax candle at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 14]: Neither do they approach the Rayhoon and Mayhoon without this mark of respect .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 48]: Some time after this , one of the chiefs who had submitted took up his quarters at Bassein ; and his little daughter , about eight or nine years old , was very fond of coming to see me , as I generally made her little presents .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 32]: She became very much attached to me , but she never appeared without a little wax candle , which she dropped at my feet before she threw herself into my lap .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 30]: In the present instance , the chief first made his appearance , and having come within a few feet , sat down as a _ mark of respect _ .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 29]: He was followed by six more , who each carried about two pounds of wax candles , tastefully arranged in a sort of filigree work of coloured papers .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 36]: After these came about fifty men , carrying large baskets full of vegetables and fruit , which they poured out on the floor before us , and then walked away and squatted at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 47]: A few words of ceremony were then exchanged , and the friendship cemented over a bottle of brandy and some wine ; which , notwithstanding the use of spirituous liquors is against their religion , and forbidden by the government , they did not object to .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 20]: Before he left I made him a present in return , and he went away delighted with the gift .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 91]: Several more of the minor chiefs afterwards came in , and the same formalities were gone through ; but there were three of the most important who would not make their appearance ; one , the chief of Naputah , the town which we had passed , which did not fire at us from the stockades , and two others down at another large arm of the river , who had many men detained for the service of the army if required , and who were still at open defiance .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 27]: All these three were gold chatta chiefs , that is , permitted to have a gold umbrella carried over their heads when they appeared in public .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 45]: After waiting a certain time for these people to send in their submission , we sent word down to the chief of Naputah , that we should visit him the next day , threatening him with the consequences of not complying with our request .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 31]: Accordingly we weighed in the Larne , and dropped down the river till we were abreast of the town and stockade , which was about thirty miles distant from Bassein .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 56]: Our broadside was ready ; but as we were about to fire , we perceived that boats were manning , and in about five minutes the chief of Naputah , in his own war-boat , accompanied by about twelve others , and a great many canoes , pulled off from the shore and came alongside .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 18]: He made his submission , with the usual accompaniments , and we were soon very good friends .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 22]: We gave him a beautiful little brass gun , which ornamented our poop , and he went away very well pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 16]: We here had an opportunity of witnessing the dexterity with which they handle their boats .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 16]: They really appeared to be alive , they darted through the water with such rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 50]: Many of the Burmahs remained on board , examining every part of the vessel and her equipment ; and soon they were on the best of terms with the seamen and the few troops which I had on board to assist us , for we were very short manned .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 49]: We had gained intelligence that there were some guns sunk in a creek , about three miles from Bassein , and we had despatched a boat to look for them , having the assurance of a chief who was at Bassein that the people were peaceable and well-disposed .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 30]: By some mistake , the boat went up the wrong creek , and pulled many miles into the country , without finding the spot pointed out by marks given .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 21]: At night they were at the mercy of the Burmahs , who came to them to know what they required .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 35]: The Burmahs told them that they had mistaken the creek , but were very kind to them , giving them a good supper , and passing the night among them , playing their marionettes .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 55]: The next day they showed them their way , and when they came to the guns , the Burmahs dived , and made ropes fast , and brought them up for them , sending a message that they would come and see the _ Great Water-dog _ -LRB- meaning me -RRB- the next day .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 47]: We remained two days at anchor , off the town of Naputah , waiting for this boat , as it was our intention to go down the river , and attack the two other gold chatta chiefs , if they did not send in their submission .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 46]: On the second day the chief came on board to ask us if we would attend a Nautch which he gave that evening in compliment to us ; but requested that we would not bring all our people , as it would frighten his own .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 46]: Although it was not pleasant to trust ourselves on shore in the night , in the midst of so large a force , yet , anxious to make friends with him , we thought it advisable to accept the invitation in the manner he desired .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 26]: I replied , `` that I would only bring on shore a few officers , and my usual attendants of six marines without arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 31]: At eight o'clock some of the officers and I went on shore : it was quite dark , but we found the chief at the landing-place ready to receive us .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 95]: The marines had their bayonets , and the officers had pistols concealed in case of treachery , and the first lieutenant kept a good look out , with the broadside of the ship all ready at the first flash of a pistol , but these precautions were unnecessary ; the chief took me by the hand and led me up to his house , in front of which had been erected a sort of covered circus , brilliantly lighted up with oil in cocoa-nut shells , and round which were squatted several hundred Burmahs .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 44]: He took us all to the raised verandah of the house , which was fitted up for the ceremony , where we found his wife , and all his attendants , but not his daughter , who was said to be very handsome .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 12]: As soon as we had taken our seats the Nautch commenced .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 23]: About twenty men struck up a very barbarous kind of music , in which the bells and drums made the most noise .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 12]: After a few minutes of discordant sound , the play began .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 18]: The actors were in a sort of costume , and appeared quite at home in their parts .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 55]: The story consisted in the attempts of a young prince to obtain the hand of a young princess ; and the dialogue was constantly interrupted by an actor who appeared to be a looker-on , but who made his remarks upon what passed , so as to excite bursts of laughter from the audience .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 22]: He was the Jack Pudding , or wit of the piece , and several of his jokes were not very delicate .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 23]: At all events , he was the Liston of the company , for he never spoke nor moved without creating a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 69]: The play ended very curiously ; after the prince had gained the princess , they had a procession , in which they made an imitation of a ship , out of compliment to us ; and then built a little house on the stage with singular rapidity , to the door of which they conducted the youthful couple , closed it , and then the play was over .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 66]: In the meantime _ pickled tea _ -LRB- which is a great compliment and excessively nasty -RRB- was handed round to us , and we all partook of it , taking it out with our fingers ; but we could not swallow it , so it remained like a quid of tobacco in our cheeks until we had an opportunity of getting rid of it .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 44]: The purser had had the foresight to put a couple of bottles of wine , and one of brandy , in the pockets of the marines , which were now produced , while the band continued to play , and wrestling was introduced .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 72]: We asked the chief to join us , but he refused ; he handed down a sort of picture , in which was represented the white elephant , pagodas , etcetera , and told us that he was not only the war chief , but the head of the religion at Naputah , and that it would not be right that he should be seen by his people transgressing the laws .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 38]: In the meantime his daughter , who did not come out to us , was very anxious to know what sort of people we were , and she sent for one to be brought in to her .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 7]: My clerk was the favoured party .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 29]: She examined him very closely , pulled his dress about , made him bare his legs , to see how white they were , and then dismissed him .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 36]: The clerk reported her as very handsome , and quite as white as he was ; splendidly dressed ; and with an air of command , which showed that she was aware of her importance .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 15]: We staid about two hours longer , and then we rose to go away .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 48]: The chief walked with us down to the boats , and we were not sorry to find ourselves on board again ; for the population was much more numerous than we had imagined , and had any treachery been attempted , we must have fallen a sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 5]: EXPEDITION TO BASSEIN CONTINUED .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 4]: May , 1836 .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 62]: Although on friendly terms with the chief of Naputah , he was a person of such weight in that part of the country , that it was advisable , if possible , to identify him with us , so that he should never again fall off , and oppose us , in the contingency of a reverse , on the Irrawaddy .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 27]: The next day we sent for him , informing him that it was to make him a present in return for his civility the day before .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 57]: But before we handed the present to him , we stated our intention of dropping down the river to reduce the two gold chatta chiefs who still held out ; and that , as we did not exactly know where their towns were situated , we wished for some of his people to go with me .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 12]: To this first proposition , after some hesitation , he consented .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 47]: We then pointed out that our men were not accustomed to work in the sun , and were often ill ; that , as we were now friends , we wished him to allow me some of his boats to assist the ship in the river .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 6]: To this also he consented .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 77]: In fine , we brought forward our last proposition , which was , that he should supply us with six or eight war-boats , well manned , and that we would pay the men and officers at the same rate per day as we paid our own men ; stating the sum we would give , and that , if he was really sincere in his friendship and goodwill , we expected not to be refused .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 44]: Now , among the Burmahs who were with him , there were many whose relations were detained to join the army ; a consultation ensued ; the chief was pressed by his own people , and , at last , gave his consent .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 40]: We then presented him with the piece of plate , upon which his eyes had constantly been turned , and he went away , promising us that the men and boats should be alongside by daylight the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 36]: This chief adhered to his promise , and we weighed anchor the next day , and made sail down with the war-boats , and three or four despatch-canoes , pulled by four or five men .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 48]: These little canoes , when put to their speed , dashed through the water at such a rate , that they threw off from each bow one continued little fan-shaped _ jet-d'eau _ , which had a very beautiful appearance , the sunbeams forming them into rainbows .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 59]: As for our Burmah force , they were at one time pulling against the vessel sailing ; at others , hanging on , and the people climbing about the rigging , and ascending the masthead of the vessel ; but they soon all congregated to the stand of muskets , for that was the great object of attraction .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 26]: In the afternoon we had ball practice with the small arms ; and the Burmahs were , much to their delight , permitted to fire .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 20]: It is surprising how exact they were in their aims , considering the little practice they must have had .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 45]: Bad as all the muskets are which are served out to the ships of war , I really believe that there was not a Burmah who would not have laid down every thing he possessed , except his life , to have obtained one .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 34]: One of them , when he was permitted to take a musket , looked proudly round , and said , with a smile of joy , `` Now I 'm a man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 19]: The next day we arrived at the branch of the river where one of the chiefs held out .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 74]: At daylight our own boats were manned , and with the Burmah boats ranged in line , made an imposing appearance , which was very necessary , for at that time we were so short-handed , that we could not send away more than forty men -- a force so small , that , had the Burmahs opposed to us seen it advance , they would probably have tried their strength with us .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 52]: As it was , we pulled into the stockaded town in a line , the despatch-boats flying across us backwards and forwards like porpoises before the bows of a ship running down the trades : not that they had any messages to carry , but merely to show their own dexterity .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 55]: When we had advanced to within a quarter of a mile , a boat came out and communicated with one of the despatch-boats , saying that the Burmahs would not fight if we did not attack them , and that they would deliver up the men detained , and their chief as a prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 30]: We agreed to these terms , landed , took possession of the chief with his gold chatta , correspondence with Bundoolah , etcetera , and took him on board .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 28]: On this occasion , we would not trust the Burmahs employed with muskets ; it was too soon ; they had only their own swords and spears .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 12]: The chief was a fine tall man with a long beard .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 35]: Like all Burmahs , he took his loss of liberty very composedly , sitting down between the guns with his attendants , and only expressing his indignation at the treachery of his own people .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 45]: We were very anxious to know what had become of the guns of the dismantled stockade , which were said to be in his possession , but he positively denied it , saying that they had been despatched in boats across to the Irrawaddy .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 61]: Whether this were true or not , it was impossible to say ; but , at all events , it was necessary to make some further attempts to obtain them , so we told him , that if he did not inform us where the guns were , by the next morning his head would be taken off his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 13]: At this pleasant intelligence he opened his betel-bag and renewed his quid .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 75]: The next day he was summoned forth to account for the said guns , and again protested that they had been sent to Donabue , which I really believe was false , as they were not taken out of the stockade until after Donabue was in the possession of Sir A. Campbell : it was therefore judged proper to appear to proceed to extremities ; and this time it was done with more form .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 20]: A file of marines was marched aft with their muskets , and the sergeant appeared with his drawn sword .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 40]: Sand was strewed on the deck in front of the marines ; and he was led there and ordered to kneel down , so that his head , if cut off , would fall where the sand was strewn .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 33]: He was again asked if he would tell where the guns were concealed , and again stated that they were at Donabue ; upon which he was desired to prepare for death .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 33]: He called one of his attendants and gave him his silver betel-box , saying , `` Take this to my wife , -- when she sees it she will know all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 30]: I watched him very closely ; his countenance was composed , but , as he bent forward over the sand , the muscles of his arms and shoulders quivered .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 39]: However , as it is not the custom to cut off people 's heads on the quarter-deck of his Majesty 's ships , we very magnanimously reprieved him , and he was afterwards sent a prisoner to Calcutta .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 17]: But that he had the guns , we discovered afterwards , which adds to his merit .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 23]: Having succeeded in this attempt , we made sail for the stockade of the other chief , and arrived there that evening .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 48]: As he was supposed to be greater in force than the other , we decided upon an attack in the dark , when he would not be able to distinguish of what our force was composed ; and this time we gave muskets to our Burmah comrades .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 32]: The attack was successful , we obtained possession , and the chief fled , but our Burmahs pursued him nearly two miles , made him prisoner , and brought him aboard .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 21]: As he immediately tendered his submission , which the other would not do , he was released the next day .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 39]: We had done all our work , and having employed the Burmahs for a few days more in destroying the stockades at the entrance of the river , they were paid and discharged from his Majesty 's service .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 45]: They would not , however , quit us ; but , so long as we remained in the river they continued to hang on to the ship , and discovered three guns which had been sunk , which they weighed and brought on board .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 21]: I have entered into this short narrative , as it will give some idea of the character of these people .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 70]: The government is despotic , cruel , and treacherous , but the people are neither cruel nor treacherous : on the contrary , I think they would make most excellent and faithful soldiers ; and it is singular to find , surrounded by natives who have not the slightest energy of mind or body , a people so active , so laborious , and so enterprising as the Burmahs .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 27]: The English seamen are particularly partial to them , and declared they were `` the best set of chaps they had ever fallen in with . ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 13]: They admitted the Burmahs to their messes , and were sworn friends .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 35]: I forgot to say , that when the chiefs sent in their submissions , at first , among other presents , they sent _ slaves _ , usually females , which was rather awkward .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 30]: But not wishing to affront them , I begged that the slaves sent might be children , and not grown up , as we had no accommodation for them .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 29]: The consequence was , that I had quite a young family when I left the river , which I distributed at Rangoon and the presidencies on my return .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 28]: For if they were only bond-slaves , which I suppose they were , it was a kindness to have them educated and taken care _ of _ .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 27]: We lost one little fellow , that was a great favourite with the men ; he was about three years old , and could speak English .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 19]: He had been christened by the sailors Billy Bamboo , and was quite as amusing as the monkey .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 17]: The poor little fellow died very suddenly , and was much regretted by all on board .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 59]: I certainly do think that we may eventually find the Burmahs to be the most powerful enemy that we shall have to contend with in India ; and , at the same time , I can not help giving my opinion as to the ridiculous fear we entertain of the Russians ever interfering with us in that quarter .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 64]: That the extension of the Russian empire has been a favourite object through many of her dynasties , is true : but it is so no longer : they have discovered that already their empire is too extensive ; and hardly a year passes but they have outbreaks and insurrections to quell in quarters so remote that they are scarcely heard of here .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 51]: That Russia might _ possibly _ lead an army through our Indian possessions , I admit ; but that she never could hold them if she did do so , is equally certain ; the conquest would be useless to her , after having been obtained at an enormous sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 113]: The fact is , the Russians -LRB- with the exception of the Emperor Paul -RRB- never had any intention of the kind , and _ never will attempt it _ : but they have discovered how very alive we are to the possibility , and how very jealous and anxious we are on the subject , and it is possible that they have made demonstrations in that direction to alarm us ; but I think myself , that the great object of Russia in these advances has been to force a channel for trade , which in her present situation she is to the south of her extensive empire nearly deprived of .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 68]: Notwithstanding the outcry which has so often been raised against the Russian empire , it has always appeared to me that _ our natural ally _ is Russia ; as for an alliance with France it is morally impossible that two rival nations like us can continue very long at peace ; our interests are separate and conflicting , and our jealousy but sleeps for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 62]: We have been at peace with France many years , and have not yet succeeded in making a satisfactory commercial treaty with her ; neither will any of the other Continental powers permit our manufactures to enter , with the exception of Russia , who not only takes them , but returns to us what is most valuable for our marine .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 12]: Why , then , this outcry against the ambition of Russia ?
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 9]: nothing but tirades against _ Russian _ ambition .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 6]: Does France show no ambition ?
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 6]: Does America show no ambition ?
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 6]: Have we no ambition ourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 33]: Why this constant suspicion and doubt against a power whose interest it is to be closely allied to us , and who can always prove a valuable aid in case of emergency ?
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 14]: -- simply because Russia wishes to have an opening to the Black Sea .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 28]: And this is very natural ; her northern ports are closed nine months in the year , and therefore her navy and mercantile marine are almost useless .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 11]: She has no outlet , no means of raising either .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 9]: Does she , then , ask too much ?
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 24]: Is a great empire like Russia to be blocked up , her commerce and navy crippled , for the want of an outlet ?
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 17]: She does require the opening of the Black Sea ; it is all that she requires .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 32]: She never will remain quiet until she obtains it ; and obtain it sooner or later she certainly will ; and in my opinion she is perfectly justified in her attempts .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 9]: What would be the consequence if she succeeded ?
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 50]: -- that , if we were wise enough to continue on terms of amity with Russia , who has invariably extended the hand of friendship to us , and has I believe never failed in her treaties , we should have a balance of power to us very important .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 11]: Whose navies shall we in future have to contend against ?
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 32]: -- those of France and America ; for it is certain that whenever we go to war with France , America will back her , and their navies will be united .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 49]: At present , the navy of America is not very large , but it can soon be made so ; and we should not be sorry to have the navy of Russia on our side , to balance against the two which will always be opposed to us .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 30]: It is , therefore , our interest to _ assist _ Russia in the object she has in view , and to keep up a firm alliance with her .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 68]: It is the interest of France to excite jealousies between Russia and this country ; and her emissaries have been but too successful , at the very time that France has , contrary to all treaty , and exclaiming against _ Russian _ ambition , seized upon Algiers , and is now playing her game , so as if possible to command the whole of the Mediterranean .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 40]: The very strides which France has made in that quarter should point out to us the propriety of opening the Black Sea for Russia , so as to restore the balance of power in that future site of contention .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 122]: I repeat that we are blind in every way to our own interests , in not uniting ourselves firmly by an alliance , offensive and defensive , with Russia ; and that by so doing , we should be the greatest gainers ; for with France we must never expect more than a _ hollow truce _ , concealing for the time her jealousy and thirst for revenge , -- a truce during which her secret efforts to undermine us , will be still carried on as indefatigably as ever , and which must only be considered as a mere feint to recover her breath , before she again renews her frenzied efforts to humiliate England , and obtain universal dominion .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 6]: London , June , 1837 .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 29]: To one who has visited foreign climes , how very substantial everything appears in England , from the child 's plaything to the Duke of York 's column !
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 12]: To use a joiners phrase , everything abroad is comparatively scamp-work .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 56]: Talk about the Palais Royale , the Rue Richelieu , and the splendour of the Parisian shops -- why , two hundred yards of Regent-street , commencing from Howell and James 's , would buy the whole of them , and leave a balance sufficient to buy the remainder of the French _ expositions _ .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 18]: But still , if more substantial and massive , we are at the same time also heavy .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 43]: We want more space , more air , more room to breathe , in London ; we are too closely packed ; we want gardens with trees to absorb the mephitic air , for what our lungs reject is suitable to vegetation .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 19]: But we can not have all we want in this world , so we must do without them .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 9]: What wealth is now pouring into the country !
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 34]: and , thank God , it is now somewhat better expended than it was in the bubble mania , which acted upon the plethora certainly , but bled us too freely and uselessly .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 66]: The rail-road speculators have taken off many millions , and the money is well employed ; for even allowing that , in some instances , the expectations of the parties who speculate may be disappointed , still it is spent in the country ; and not only is it affording employment and sustenance to thousands , but the staple produce of England only is consumed .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 20]: In these speculations -- in the millions required and immediately produced , you can witness the superiority of England .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 20]: Undertakings from which foreign governments would shrink with dismay are here effected by the meeting of a few individuals .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 6]: And now for my commissions .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 4]: What a list !
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 64]: And the first item is -- two Canary birds , the last having been one fine morning found dead : nobody knows how ; there was plenty of seed and water -LRB- put in after the servant found that they had been starved by his neglect -RRB- , which , of course , proved that they did not die for want of food .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 26]: I hate what are called pets ; they are a great nuisance , for they will die , and then such a lamentation over them !
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 48]: In the `` Fire Worshippers '' Moore makes his Hinda say -- `` I never nursed a dear gazelle , To glad me with its soft black eye , But when it came to know me well And love me -- it was sure to die . ''
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 15]: Now Hinda was perfectly correct , except in thinking that she was peculiarly unfortunate .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 13]: Every one who keeps pets might tell the same tale as Hinda .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 73]: I recollect once a Canary bird died , and my young people were in a great tribulation ; so to amuse them we made them a paper coffin , put the defunct therein , and sewed on the lid , dug a grave in the garden , and dressing them out in any remnants of black we could find for weepers , made a procession to the grave where it was buried .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 8]: This little divertissement quite took their fancy .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 25]: The next day one of the youngest came up to me and said , `` Oh , papa , when will you die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 17]: -- A strange question , thought I , quite forgetting the procession of the day before .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 11]: -- `` Why do you ask , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 14]: -- `` Oh , because it will be such fun burying you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 11]: -- `` Much obliged to you , my love . ''
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 11]: There is much more intellect in birds than people suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 25]: An instance of that occurred the other day , at a slate quarry belonging to a friend , from whom I have the narrative .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 38]: A thrush , not aware of the expansive properties of gunpowder , thought proper to build her nest on a ridge of the quarry , in the very centre of which they were constantly blasting the rock .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 56]: At first she was very much discomposed by the fragments flying in all directions , but still she would not , quit her chosen locality ; she soon observed that a bell rang whenever a train was about to be fired , and that , at the notice , the workmen retired to safe positions .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 33]: In a few days , when she heard the bell , she quitted her exposed situation , and flew down to where the workmen sheltered themselves , dropping close to their feet .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 18]: There she would remain until the explosion had taken place , and then return to her nest .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 26]: The workmen , observing this , narrated it to their employers , and it was also told to visitors who came to view the quarry .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 50]: The visitors naturally expressed a wish to witness so curious a specimen of intellect ; but , as the rock could not always be ready to be blasted when visitors came , the bell was rung instead , and , for a few times , answered the same purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 95]: The thrush flew down close to where they stood ; but she perceived that she was trifled with , and it interfered with her process of incubation : the consequence was , that afterwards , when the bell was rung , she would peep over the ledge to ascertain if the workmen did retreat , and if they did not , she would remain where she was , probably saying to herself , `` No , no , gentlemen ; I 'm not to be roused off my eggs merely for your amusement . ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 15]: Some birds have a great deal of humour in them , particularly the raven .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 17]: One that belonged to me was the most mischievous and amusing creature I ever met with .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 56]: He would get into the flower-garden , go to the beds where the gardener had sowed a great variety of seeds , with sticks put in the ground with labels , and then he would amuse himself with pulling up every stick , and laying them in heaps of ten or twelve on the path .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 16]: This used to irritate the old gardener very much , who would drive him away .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 19]: The raven knew that he ought not to do it , or he would not have done it .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 69]: He would soon return to his mischief , and when the gardener again chased him -LRB- the old man could not walk very fast -RRB- , the raven would keep just clear of the rake or hoc in his hand , dancing back before him , and singing as plain as a man could , `` Tol de rol de rol ; tol de rol de rol ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 7]: with all kinds of mimicking gestures .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 19]: The bird is alive now , and continues the same meritorious practice whenever he can find an opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY NINE .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 6]: June , Steam-boat Princess Victoria .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 35]: It certainly appears that the motion of a steam-vessel produces more nausea than that of a sailing-vessel ; and people appear to suffer in some degree in proportion to the power of the engines .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 17]: This may be accounted for by the vibration of the vessel increasing in the same ratio .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 31]: We are now in a vessel of two hundred and fifty horse power , and the consequence is that the passengers are as sick as two hundred and fifty horses .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 17]: The effect of the vibration of the after part of the vessel amounts to the ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 33]: When dinner was put on the table , we had no occasion for a bell to announce it , for every glass on the table was dancing to its own jingling music .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 28]: And when the covers were taken off , it was still more absurd -- everything in the dishes appeared to be infected with Saint Vitus 's dance .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 90]: The boiled leg of mutton shook its collops of fat at a couple of fowls which figured in a sarabande round and round their own dish , -- roast beef shifted about with a slow and stately movement -- a ham _ glisseed croisee _ from one side to the other -- tongues wagged that were never meant to wag again -- bottles reeled and fell over like drunken men , and your piece of bread constantly ran away and was to be pulled back into its proper place .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 20]: It was a regular jig-a-jig -- a country-dance of pousette , down the middle , and right and left .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 48]: The communication of motion was strange ; the whole company seated on long forms were jig-a-jigging up and down together -- your knife jigged and your fork jigged -- even the morsel which was put into your mouth gave one more jump before it could be seized .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 25]: However , we jigged it to some purpose ; for , in eighteen hours and a half , we passed from London to Antwerp .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 18]: The English are naturally great _ voyageurs _ : the feeling is inherent from our insular position .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 73]: I have been reflecting whether I can recollect , in my whole life , ever to have been three months in one place , but I can not , nor do I believe that I ever was -- not even when sent to school ; for I used to run away every quarter , just to see how my family were -- an amiable weakness , which even flogging could not eradicate .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 94]: And then I was off to sea ; there I had my wish , as Shakespeare says , borne away by `` the viewless winds , and blown with restless violence about the pendent world , '' north , south , east , and west ; one month freezing , the next burning ; all nations , all colours , -- white , copper , brown , and black ; all scenery , from the blasted pine towering amidst the frost and snow , to the cocoa-nut waving its leaves to the sea-breeze .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 28]: Well , `` homekeeping youths have homely wits , '' says the same author ; and he has told more truth than any man who ever wrote .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 35]: I certainly did hear of one young man who did not gain much by travelling ; he was a banker 's clerk , and obtained three months ' vacation to go on the Continent .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 25]: He landed at Ostend , and the next day found himself in the track-schuyt that is towed by horses , from Bruges to Ghent .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 32]: The cabins were magnificent , velvet and gold the down cushions luxurious , the dinner and breakfast sumptuous , the wine excellent , the bed-rooms comfortable , and the expense moderate .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 7]: Moreover , the motion was imperceptible .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 7]: What could a man wish more ?
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 64]: He arrived at Ghent , and could not make his mind up to quit this barge ; so he returned in her to Bruges , and then back again to Ghent ; and thus he continued between the two towns , backwards and forwards , until the three months ' leave had expired , and he was obliged to return to the desk .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 19]: I have never yet made up my mind whether this personage was a wise man or a fool .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 77]: But , until the opening of the Continent , the English were only voyageurs , not travellers ; and that , after having been so long debarred , they should be desirous of visiting the various portions of Europe , is not only natural but praiseworthy ; but that they should make the Continent their residence -- should expatriate themselves altogether , is , to me , a source of astonishment as well as of regret .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 7]: The excuse offered is the cheapness .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 95]: It is but an excuse , for I deny it to be the fact : I have visited most places , with and without a family ; and I will positively assert , not for the benefit of others who have already expatriated themselves , but as a check to those who feel so inclined , that they will discover too soon that , at less expense , they can command more good living and substantial comforts in England , than in any part of the Continent they may fix upon as their habitation .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 9]: Let us enter a little into the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 13]: First , as to the capitals , Paris , Brussels , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 28]: Let it first be remembered that we have no longer war prices in England , that almost every article has fallen from thirty-five to fifty per cent .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 37]: It is true that some tradespeople who are established as fashionable keep up their prices ; but it is not absolutely necessary to employ them , as there are those equally skilled who are more moderate .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 36]: But even the most fashionable have been obliged , to a certain degree , to lower their prices ; and their present prices , reduced as they are , will most assuredly die with them .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 21]: Everything will , by degrees , find its level ; but this level is not to be found at once .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 46]: Should peace continue , ten years from this date will make a great alteration in every article , not only of necessity , but of luxury ; and then , after having been the dearest , England will become the cheapest residence in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 20]: House rent in the capitals abroad is certainly as dear , if not dearer than it is in England .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 25]: There are situations more or less fashionable in every metropolis ; and if you wish to reside in those quarters , you pay accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 70]: It is true that , by taking a portion of a house , you to a certain degree indemnify yourself ; -- a first , second , or third story , with a common staircase loaded with dirt and filth ; but is this equal to the comfort of a clean English house , in which you have your own servants , and are not overlooked by your neighbours ?
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 26]: If they were to let out houses in floors in England as they do in Paris and elsewhere , a less sum would be demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 23]: You may procure a handsome house in a fashionable quarter , well furnished , in London , for 300 pounds per annum .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 73]: Go to the Place Vendome , or those quarters styled the English quarters , at Paris , and which are by no means the most fashionable quarters , and you will pay for a handsome front floor 700 francs per month ; so that for one floor of a house in Paris you will pay 336 pounds per annum , when in London you will obtain the whole house for 300 pounds .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 22]: The proprietor of the Paris house , therefore , receives much more by letting his floors separate than the English do .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 30]: The common articles of necessity are as dear , if not dearer abroad ; the _ octroi _ duty upon all that enters the barriers raising the price excessively .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 53]: Meat at Paris or Brussels is as dear as in London , and not so good ; it is as dear , because they charge you the same price all round , about 5 pence per pound , independent of its inferiority and the villainous manner in which it is cut up .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 14]: Our butchers only butcher the animal , but foreign butchers butcher the meat .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 14]: Poultry is as dear ; game much dearer ; and so is fish .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 13]: Indeed , fish is not only dear , but scarce and bad .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 17]: Horses and carriages are quite as dear abroad , in the capitals , as in London .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 26]: Clothes are in some respects cheaper , in others dearer , especially articles of English manufacture , which are more sought after than any others .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 34]: Amusements are said to be cheaper ; but , admitting that , the places of amusement are oftener resorted to , and in consequence as much money is spent abroad as in England .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 57]: It is true that there are an immense number of theatres in Paris , and that most of them are very reasonable in their charges for admission ; but be it recollected that there are not above three of them which are considered fashionable , if even respectable ; and there the prices are sufficiently high .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 53]: If people went to Sadler 's Wells , the Coburg , Victoria , Queen 's Theatre , Astley 's , and other minor theatres in London , as they do to the Theatres Saint Martin , Gymnase , et Varietes at Paris , they would find no great difference in the prices .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 6]: What then is there cheaper ?
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 2]: Wine .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 16]: I grant it ; and , it is also asserted , the education of children .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 35]: We will pass over these two last points for the present , and examine whether living is cheaper on the Continent , provided you do _ not _ hive in any of the capitals .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 56]: That at Tours and other places in the south of France , at Genoa , at Bruges , in Belgium , you may live cheaper than in London , I grant ; but if any one means to assert that you can live cheaper than in the country in England , I deny it altogether .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 16]: People go abroad , and select the cheapest parts of the Continent to live in .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 45]: If they were to do the same in England , they would find that they could live much cheaper and much better ; for instance , in Devonshire , Cornwall , and Wales , and , indeed , in almost every county in England .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 21]: The fact is , it is not the cheapness of the living which induces so many people to reside abroad .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 22]: There are many reasons ; and as I wish to be charitable , I will put forward the most favourable ones .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 25]: In England , we are money-making people , and we have the aristocracy of wealth as well _ as _ the aristocracy of rank .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 28]: It has long been the custom for many people to live beyond their incomes , and to keep up an appearance which their means have not warranted .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 21]: Many , especially the landed proprietors , finding their rentals reduced from various causes , have been necessitated to retrench .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 33]: They were too proud to put down their carriages and establishments before the eyes of those who had perhaps looked upon them with envy , and whose derision or exultation they anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 22]: They therefore have retired to the Continent , where a carriage is not necessary to prove that you are a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 26]: Should those return who have emigrated for the above reasons , they would find that this striving for show is hardly perceptible now in England .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 22]: Those who have remained have either had sense enough , or have been forced by circumstances , to reduce their expenditure .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 26]: Another cause is the easy introduction into what is called good society abroad on the Continent , but which is in reality very bad society .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 43]: Certainly there are a sufficient number of Counts , Viscounts , and Marquesses to associate with ; but in France high birth is not proved by titles , which are of little or no value , and do not even establish gentility .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 39]: This society may certainly be entered into at a much less expense than that of England , especially in the metropolis ; but , depend upon it , there is a species of society dear at any price .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 39]: With respect to education of children , that boys may receive advantage from a Continental education I admit ; but woe be to the mother who intrusts her daughter to the ruin of a French _ Pension _ !
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 45]: In England there are many excellent schools in the country , as cheap and cheaper than on the Continent : but the schoolmasters near London , generally speaking , are ruining them by their adherence to the old system , and their extravagant terms .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 63]: The _ system _ of education on the Continent is certainly superior to that of England , and the attention to the pupils is greater : of course there are bad schools abroad as well as in England ; but the balance is much in favour of those on the Continent , with the advantage of being at nearly one-half the expense .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 35]: A great alteration has taken place in modern education ; the living languages and mathematics have been found to be preferable to the classics and other instruction still adhered to in the English schools .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 25]: I have always considered , and have every reason to be confirmed in my opinion , that the foundation of all education is mathematics .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 34]: Every thing else may be obtained by rote , and without thinking ; but from the elements of arithmetic up to Euclid and algebra , no boy can work his task without thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 36]: I never yet knew a man who was a good mathematician who was not well-informed upon almost every point ; and the reason is clear -- mathematics have prepared his mind to receive and retain .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 35]: In all foreign schools this important branch of education is more attended to than it is in England ; and that alone would be a sufficient reason for me to give them the preference .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 44]: In point of morals , I consider the schools of both countries much upon a par ; although , from the system abroad of never debasing a child by corporal punishment , I give the foreign schools the preference even in that point .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 35]: I consider , then , that boys are better educated abroad than in England , and acquire much more correctly the living languages , which are of more use to them than the classics .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 25]: So much I can say in favour of the Continent ; but in every other respect I consider the advantage in favour of England .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 44]: Young women who have been brought up abroad I consider , generally speaking , as unfitted for English wives ; and that in this opinion I am not singular , I know well from conversation with young men at the clubs and elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 85]: Mothers who have returned with their daughters full of French fashions and ideas , and who imagine that they will inevitably succeed in making good matches , would be a little mortified and surprised to hear the young men , when canvassing among themselves the merits of the other sex , declare that `` such a young lady may be very handsome and very clever , but she has received a _ Continental education _ , and that wo n't do for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 56]: Many mothers imagine , because their daughters , who are bold and free in their manners , and talk and laugh loud , are surrounded by young men , while the modest girl , who holds aloof , is apparently neglected , that their daughters are more admired ; but this is a great mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 45]: Men like that boldness , that coquetry , that dash , if I may use the term , because it amuses for the time being ; but although they may pay attention to women on that account , marrying them is quite another affair .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 32]: No : the modest retiring girl , who is apparently passed by , becomes the wife ; the others are flattered before their faces , and laughed at behind their backs .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 55]: It certainly is unmanly , on the part of our sex , to behave in this manner , to encourage young women in their follies , and ruin them for their own amusement ; as Shakespeare says : -- `` Shame to him whose cruel striking Kills for faults of his own liking . ''
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 28]: But so it is , and so it will be so long as the world lasts , and mankind is no better than it is at present .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 35]: If then , as I have asserted , there is so little to be gained by leaving a comfortable home , what is the inducement which takes so many people abroad to settle there ?
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 18]: I am afraid that the true reason has been given by the author whom I now quote .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 33]: Speaking of the French metropolis , she says -- `` I have been lately trying to investigate the nature of the charm which renders Paris so favourite a sojourn of the English .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 20]: `` In point of gaiety -LRB- for gaiety read dissipation -RRB- it affords nothing comparable with that of London .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 37]: A few ministerial fetes every winter may perhaps exceed in brilliancy the balls given in our common routine of things ; but for one entertainment in Paris at least thirty take place _ chez nous _ .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 13]: Society is established with us on a wider and more splendid scale .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 34]: The weekly _ soirees _ , on the other hand , which properly represent the society of this place , are dull , meagre , and formal to the last degree of formality .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 38]: There is no brilliant point of reunion as at Almack 's , -- no theatre uniting , like our Italian Opera , the charm of the best company , the best music , and the best dancing .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 42]: Of the thousand and one theatres boasted of by the Parisians , only three are of a nature to be frequented by people of consideration , the remainder being as much out of the question as the Pavilion or the Garrick .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 23]: Dinner parties there are none ; water parties none ; _ dejeuners _ , unless given by a foreign ambassadress , none .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 10]: A thousand accessories to London amusements are here wanting .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 21]: In the month of May , I am told , the public gardens and the Bois de Boulogne become enchanting .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 11]: But what is not charming in the month of May ?
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 36]: Paris , perhaps , least of all places ; for at the commencement of the month every French family of note quits the metropolis for its country seat , or for sea or mineral bathing .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 10]: Foreigners and the mercantile and ministerial classes alone remain .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 36]: What , then , I would fain discover , constitutes the peculiar merit of inducing persons uninstigated by motives of economy to fix themselves in the comfortless and filthy city , and call it Paradise ?
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 16]: my solution of the problem is far from honourable to the taste of our absentees .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 44]: _ In Paris people are far less amenable than in London to the tribunal of public opinion _ ; or , as a lady once very candidly said to me , ` One gets rid of one 's friends and relations . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 30]: Indeed , there are so many petty annoyances and vexatious of life attendant upon residents abroad , that it must require some strong motives to induce them to remain .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 35]: Wherever the English settle they raise the price of everything , much to the annoyance of the _ rentiers _ and respectable people of the place , although of advantage to the country generally .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 24]: The really highbred and aristocratic people will not associate with the English , and look upon them with any feeling but good will .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 86]: With regard to servants , they are invariably badly served , although they pay two or three times the wages that are paid by the inhabitants , who , in most places , have made it a rule never to take a domestic that has once lived in an English family ; the consequence is that those engaged by the English are of the worst description , a sort of _ pariahs _ among the community , who extort and cheat their employers without mercy .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 40]: If not permitted so to do , they leave them at a minutes warning ; and you can not go to any foreign colony of English people without listening to very justified tirades of the villany of the servants .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 30]: Upon the same principle , there are few places abroad where the tradespeople have not two prices ; one for the English , and the other for the inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 26]: I was in company with an English lady of title , who gave me a very amusing instance of the insolence of the Belgian servants .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 22]: She had a large family to bring up on a limited income , and had taken up her abode at Brussels .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 27]: It should be observed that the Belgians treat their servants like dogs , and yet it is only with the Belgians that they will behave well .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 28]: This lady , finding her expenses very much exceeding her means , so soon as she had been some time in the country , attempted a reformation .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 32]: Inquiring of some Belgian families with whom she was acquainted what were the just proportions allowed by them to their servants , she attempted by degrees to introduce the same system .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 17]: The first article of wasteful expenditure was bread , and she put them upon an allowance .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 50]: The morning after she was awoke with a loud hammering in the saloon below , the reason of which she could not comprehend ; but on going down to breakfast she found one of the long loaves made in the country nailed up with tenpenny nails over the mantelpiece .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 36]: She sent to inquire who had done it , and one of the servants immediately replied that she had nailed it there that my lady might see that the bread did not go too fast .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 59]: There is another point on which the English abroad have long complained , and with great justice , -- which is , that in every litigation or petty dispute which may appear before a smaller or more important tribunal , from the Juge de Paix to the Cour de Cassation , the verdict invariably is given against them .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 18]: I never _ heard _ an instance to the contrary , although there may have been some .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 51]: In no case can an Englishman obtain justice ; the detention of his property without just cause , all that he considers as law and justice in his own country , is overruled : he is obliged to submit to the greatest insults , or consent to the greatest imposition .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 39]: This is peculiarly , observable at Paris and Brussels , and it is almost a _ jour de fete _ to a large portion of the inhabitants when they hear that an Englishman has been thrown into prison .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 167]: It must , however , be acknowledged that most of this arises not only from the wish of the rentiers , or those who live upon their means -LRB- who have these means crippled by the concourse of English raising the price of every article -RRB- , that the English should leave and return to their own country ; but also from the number of bad characters who , finding their position in society no longer tenable in England , hasten abroad , and , by their conduct , leave a most unfavourable impression of the English character , which , when Englishmen _ only travelled _ , stood high , but , now they reside to economise , is at its lowest ebb ; for the only charm which the English had in the eyes of needy foreigners was their lavishing their money as they passed through the country , enriching a portion of the community without increasing the prices of consumption to the whole .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 37]: As a proof of the insolence to which the English are subjected , I will give the reader a verbatim copy of a letter sent to me by a friend not more than a year ago .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 33]: I have heard of such a circumstance taking place in France , but then the innkeeper was a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour ; but this case is even more remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 23]: Depend upon it , those who travel will find many a Monsieur Disch before they are at the end of their journey .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 22]: I will vouch for the veracity of every word in the letter : -- `` Wisbaden , July 3 , 1836 .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 167]: `` My Dear -- , As you kindly said that you would be glad to hear of our progress when any opportunity offered of writing you a letter , I now avail myself of some friends passing through Brussels to let you know that thus far we have proceeded in health and safety ; but whether we shall complete our project of wintering in Italy seems more and more doubtful , as I believe the cholera to be doing its work pretty actively in some of the states we propose to visit ; and a gentleman told me yesterday , who has lately left the country , that the Pope is so glad of an excuse to keep heretics out of his dominions , that he has never taken off the quarantine : so that , under any circumstances , we must vegetate in some frontier hole for a fortnight before we can be admitted ; a circumstance in itself sufficiently deterring , in my opinion .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 85]: Besides which , what with the perplexity of the coinage , and the constant attempt at pillage which we have already met with , and which , I am told , is quadrupled on the other side of the Alps , such a counterbalance exists to any of the enjoyments of travelling , that I am heartily weary of the continual skirmishing and _ warfare _ I am subjected to ; -- warfare indeed , as at Cologne I was _ called out _ .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 35]: The story is too good to be lost , so I will tell it for your amusement and that of our friends at Brussels ; moreover that you may caution every one against Mons .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 42]: Disch , of the Cour Imperiale : -- We had _ marchandeed _ with Madame Disch for rooms , who at last agreed to _ our _ terms ; but when the bill came , she changed her _ own _ .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 12]: We remonstrated , and the bill was altered ; but Mons .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 29]: Disch made his appearance before I could pay it , insisting on the larger sum , saying his wife had no business to make a bargain for him .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 32]: I remonstrated in vain , and Mrs -- commenced most eloquently to state the case : he was , however , deaf to reason , argument , eloquence , and beauty .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 88]: At last I said , ` Do not waste words the matter , I will pay the fellow and have done with him , taking care that neither I nor my friends will ever come to his house again , ' at the same time snatching the bill from his hand when he demanded , in a great fury , what I meant by that ; exclaiming , ` I am Germans gentlemans , -- you English gentlemans , I challenge you -- I challenge you . '
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 6]: Although somewhat wroth before this .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 62]: I was so amused that I laughed in the rascal 's face , which doubled his rage , and he reiterated his mortal defiance ; adding , -- ` I was in London last year ; they charge me twelve -- fourteen shillings for my dinner at coffee-house , but I too much gentlemans to ask them take off one farding .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 9]: I challenge you -- I challenge you . '
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 19]: I then said , ` Hold your tongue , sir ; take your money and be off . '
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 6]: ` Me take money ! '
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 8]: replied he ; ` me take money !
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 16]: No , my servant take money ; I too much gentlemans to take money . '
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 26]: Upon which the waiter swept the cash off the table , handed it to his master , who immediately sacked it and walked off . ''
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 20]: I certainly have myself come to the conclusion that the idea of going abroad for economy is most erroneous .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 44]: As I have before observed , the only article , except education , which is cheaper , is wine ; and I am afraid , considering the thirsty propensities of my countrymen , that is a very strong attraction with the nobler sex .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 57]: If claret and all other French wines were admitted into England at a much lower duty , they would be almost as cheap in England as they are in foreign capitals ; and , as the increased consumption would more than indemnify the government , it is to be lamented that it is not so arranged .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 49]: -- Formerly we shut out the French wines , and admitted those of Portugal , as our ancient ally ; but our ancient ally has shown any thing but good-will towards us lately , and we are at all events under no further obligation to support her interests .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 38]: Let us admit French wines in bottles at a very low duty , and then England will be in every respect as cheap , and infinitely more comfortable as a residence than any part of the Continent .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 32]: The absentees who are worth reclaiming will return ; those who prefer to remain on the Continent are much better there than if they were contaminating their countrymen with their presence .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 26]: How true is the following observation from the author I before quoted on her return from abroad : -- `` Home , home at last .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 9]: How clean , how cheerful , how comfortable !
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 31]: I was shown at Marthien the shabby , dirty-looking lodgings where the -- are economising , in penance for the pleasure of one little year spent in this charming house !
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 3]: Poor people !
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 7]: How they must long for England !
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 19]: how they must miss the thousand trivial but essential conveniences devised here for the civilisation of human life !
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 11]: What an air of decency and respectfulness about the servants !
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 12]: what a feeling of homeishness in a house exclusively our own !
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 55]: The modes of life may be easier on the Continent , -- but it is the ease of a beggar 's ragged coat which has served twenty masters , and is twitched off and on till it scarcely holds together , in comparison with the decent , close-fitting suit characteristic of a gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTY .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 2]: Brussels .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 11]: Authors , like doctors , are very apt to disagree .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 37]: Reading , the other day , a very amusing publication , called the `` Diary of a Desennuyee , '' some passages in it induced me to fall back upon Henry Bulwer 's work on France .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 68]: Among his remarks upon literary influence in that country , he has the following : -- `` A literary Frenchman , whom I met not long ago in Paris , said to me that a good-natured young English nobleman , whom I will not name , had told him that dancers and singers were perfectly well received in English society , but not men of letters . ''
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 13]: ` Est il possible qu'on soit si barbare chez vous ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 18]: He subsequently adds : -- `` To be known as a writer is certainly to your prejudice .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 50]: `` First , people presume you are not what they call a gentleman ; and the grandfather who , if you were a banker or a butcher , or of any other calling or profession , would be left quiet in his tomb , is evoked against you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 29]: Mr Bulwer then proceeds with a variety of argument to prove that literary men are not _ Maecenased _ by either the government or aristocracy of Great Britain .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 34]: He points out the advantages which the French literati have from their Institute , the ennoblements , the decorations , and pensions which they receive ; and certainly makes out a strong case .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 52]: The author of the `` Diary '' would attempt to deny the statements of Mr Bulwer ; but , in the very denial , she admits all his points but one -- to wit that they are not so well received by the aristocracy in England as they are in France .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 26]: She says -- `` What does Henry Bulwer mean by the assertion that literary men are more eagerly welcomed in society here than in England ?
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 66]: `` They occupy , perhaps , a more independent and honourable position , are less exposed to being lionised by patronising dowagers , and more sure of obtaining public preferment ; but , with the exception of Mignet and Merimee -- who are courted for their personal merits and official standing rather than for their literary distinctions -- I have scarcely met one of them .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 70]: To the parties of the ministers of the _ Grand Referendaire _ , and other public functionaries , artists and men of letters are admitted as part of a political system ; but they are not to be found -- like Moore , Rogers , Chantrey , Newton , and others -- in the boudoirs of the _ elite _ , or the select fetes of a Devonshire House .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 34]: `` The calling of ` _ un homme de lettres _ ' is here , however , a profession bearing its own rewards and profits , and forming an especial and independent class .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 30]: In common with the artists they look to ennoblement in the Academy , and under the existing order of things have been richly endowed with places and pensions . ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 50]: It appears then , in France , that to the parties of ministers , etcetera , they are admitted as a part of the political system ; and further , that they have been festered by the government , by being ennobled and richly endowed with places and pensions .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 17]: Therefore , upon his opponent 's own showing , Henry Bulwer has made out his case .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 32]: In another part of the same work there is the following amusing passage , in advice given by a lady of fashion to her protegee upon entering into London society . ''
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 42]: ` Pore over their books as much as you please , but do not so much as dip into the authors , ' said she , when I proposed an introduction to one of the most popular authors of the day .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 37]: ` These people expend their spirit on their works -- the part that walks through society is a mere lump of clay , like the refuse of the wine-press after the wine has been expressed . '
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 33]: In conversing with a clever author you sometimes see a new idea brighten his eye or create a smile round his lip ; but for worlds he would not give it utterance .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 25]: It belongs to his next work , and is instantly booked in the ledger of his daily thoughts , value 3 shillings 6 pence .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 24]: The man 's mind is his mine ; he ca n't afford to work it gratis , or give away the produce . ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 36]: If we are to draw any inference from this extract , it is , that although some noblemen do extend their patronage to literary men , at all events the general feeling is against them .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 17]: I must say that I never was more amused than when I read the above sarcasm .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 14]: There is much truth in it , and yet it is not true .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 39]: In future when I _ do _ say good things , as they call them , in company , I shall know precise value of my expenditure during the dinner or evening party by reckoning up the three-and-sixpences .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 23]: One thing is clear , that if an author say half a dozen good things , he fully pays for his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 25]: In the `` Student , '' Edward Bulwer makes some remarks which range in opposition to the author of the above `` Diary . ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 41]: In arguing that most authors may be known by their works , he says -- `` Authors are the only men we really do know ; the rest of mankind die with only the surface of their character understood . ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 42]: It appears , then , that people have no excuse for being disappointed in authors ; when they meet them in company they have but to read their works , and if they like the works they must live the authors .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 13]: Before I proceed I must be permitted to make a remark here .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 38]: An author 's opinion given as his own will allow the public to have an insight into his character and feelings , and the public are justified in forming their opinions of an author upon such grounds .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 104]: But it too often happens that the public will form their opinion of an author from opinions put by him into the mouths of the characters drawn in a work of fiction , forgetting that in these instances it is not the author who speaks , but the individuals which his imagination has conjured up ; and that the opinions expressed by these creatures of his brain , although perfectly in keeping with the character , and necessary to produce that _ vraisemblance _ which is the great merit of fiction , may be entirely opposed to the real sentiments of the author .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 54]: The true merit of fiction , and that which is essential to its success , is the power of the author at the time that he is writing to divest himself , as it were , of himself , and be for the time the essence of the character which he is delineating .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 53]: It is therefore a great injustice to an author to accuse him of being an infidel because his infidel character is well portrayed , particularly as , if he is equally fortunate in describing a character which is perfect , the public do not ever give him the credit for similar perfection .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 6]: That is quite another affair .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 69]: Again , Edward Bulwer says , in opposition to the poverty of the _ mine _ : -- `` A man is , I suspect , but of a second-rate order whose genius is not immeasurably above his works , -- who does not feel within him an inexhaustible affluence of thoughts , feelings , and invention , which he never will have leisure to embody in print .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 21]: He will die and leave only a thousandth part of his wealth to posterity , which is his heir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 8]: I like to bring all in juxtaposition .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 20]: There is excitement in making mischief , and that is the reason why people are so fond of it .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 75]: Still , the question at issue ought to be fairly decided ; and , as in case of arbitration , when the disputants can not agree , a third party is called in by mutual consent , I shall venture to take upon myself that office , and will fairly argue the point , as there is more dependent upon it than , upon the first view , the question may appear to merit .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 17]: If we turn back to the last century , in what position shall we find authors ?
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 25]: -- looking up to patrons among the aristocracy , and dedicating their works to them in panegyrics , fulsome from their obsequiousness and flattery .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 18]: At that period the aristocracy and the people were much wider apart than they are at present .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 46]: Gradually the people have advanced ; and , as they have advanced , so have the authors thrown off the trammels of servitude , and have attacked the vices and follies as well as the privileges of those to whom they once bowed the knee .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 24]: The advancement of the people , and the lowering of the aristocracy , have both been effected through the medium of the press .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 9]: The position of authors has been much altered .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 25]: Formerly we behold such men as Dryden , Otway , and many others -LRB- giants in their days -RRB- , humbling themselves for bread .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 18]: Now we have seldom a dedication , and of those few we have the flattery is delicate .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 24]: The authors look to the public as their patrons , and the aristocracy are considered but as a part and portion of it .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 11]: These remarks equally hold good with respect to the government .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 30]: Authors are not to be so easily purchased as formerly ; they prefer writing in conformity with public opinion to writing for government , because they are better remunerated .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 119]: Now , if it will be recalled to mind that in the rapid march of the people , in their assertion of their right to a greater share in the government of the country , in the pointing out and correcting of abuses , and in the breaking down of all the defences which have gradually yielded in so many years , it is the authors and the press who have led the van , and that in these continual inroads the aristocracy have been the party attacked , -- it is no wonder that there has arisen , unwittingly perhaps on the part of the aristocracy , a feeling against the press and against authors in general .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 40]: The press has been , and will probably for a long while continue to be , the enemy of the aristocracy ; and it is hardly reasonable to expect that the aristocracy should admit the enemy within its camp .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 56]: For , be it observed , whether a man write a political pamphlet or a novel , he has still the same opportunity of expressing his sentiments , of flattering the public by espousing their opinions ; and as a writer of fiction , perhaps , his opinions have more effect that as a pamphleteer .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 29]: In the first instance , you are prepared to expect a political partisan ; in the latter , you read for amusement , and unconsciously receive the bias .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 53]: For one who reads a political pamphlet -LRB- by-the-by , they are generally only read by those who are of the same way of thinking as the author -RRB- there are hundreds who read through a work of fiction , so that the opinions of the latter are much more widely disseminated .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 38]: Now , as most works are written for profit as well as reputation , they are naturally so worded as to insure the good-will of the majority , otherwise they would not have so extensive a sale .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 19]: The majority being decidedly liberal , every work that now appears more or less attacks the higher orders .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 54]: When , therefore , a gentleman who has been well received in the best society ventures upon writing a work , it is quite sufficient to state that he is an author -LRB- without his book being read -RRB- to occasion him to '' _ lose caste _ '' to a certain degree .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 10]: Authors have been the enemies of the higher classes .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 15]: You have become an author -- consequently you have ranked yourself with our enemies .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 28]: Henry Bulwer , therefore , is right where he asserts that `` to be known as an author is to your prejudice among the higher classes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 32]: Having made these observations to point out that the aristocracy and the press are at variance , let us now examine into the merits of authors , as mixing in society .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 26]: And here I think it will be proved that it is more their misfortune than their fault that there should be a prejudice against them .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 12]: They are overrated before they are seen , and underrated afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 24]: You read the works of an author -- you are pleased with them , and you wish to become acquainted with the man .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 73]: You anticipate great pleasure -- you expect from his lips , in _ impromptu _ , the same racy remarks , the same chain of reasoning , the same life and vigour which have cost him so many hours of labour and reflection , or which have been elicited in his happiest moods , and this from a person who comes , perhaps , almost a total stranger into a large company .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 8]: Is this fair or just to him ?
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 23]: Did you find any of your other friends , at first meeting , play the fiddle to a whole company of strangers ?
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 15]: Are not authors as reserved and shy as other people -- even more so ?
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 25]: And yet you ask them , as if they were mountebanks or jugglers with a certain set of tricks , to amuse the company .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 33]: The very circumstance of being aware that this is expected of him makes the man silent , and his very anxiety to come up to your expectations takes away from his power .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 30]: The consequence is , that you are disappointed , and so are the company , to whom you have announced that `` Mr So-and-So '' is to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 34]: Had you become intimate with this person you would perhaps have found the difference , and that he whom you pronounced as so great a failure , would have turned out equally amusing .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 37]: At the same time there is some truth in the remarks of the `` Desennuyee '' that `` some authors will not let out their new ideas , because they require them for their books . ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 19]: But , as Bulwer observes , they must be but second-raters , as the majority of authors are .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 44]: In many instances they are punsters ; but punning is not a standard of authorship ; or , perhaps , there may be other second-rate authors present , and if so , they know that they are in the company of literary pickpockets .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 30]: To prove that this remark of the `` Desennuyee '' can only apply to second-rate authors , let us examine into the conversational powers of those who are first-rate .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 19]: And here I can only speak of those whom I have known -- there may be many others .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 25]: Where could you find such conversationists as Coleridge , Charles Lamb , Sir John Malcolm , and many others , who are now gone ?
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 47]: And among those in existence , I have but to mention Croker , Theodore Hooke , Professor Wilson , Bulwer , Lockhart , the Smiths , and , in the other sex , Lady Blessington , Lady Morgan , Mesdames Somerville , Austin , and Jameson .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 37]: Now these are all first-rate authors in their various styles ; and I can challenge any one to bring forward an equal number out of the whole mass who are so powerful or delightful in society .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 13]: And there is still more to be said in favour of authors .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 72]: I know many whose conversation is superior to their writings ; I will not name them as they , perhaps , would not consider this to be a compliment but it fully tends to disprove the remarks of the `` Desennuyee '' as to authors of talent reserving their thoughts for their hooks , for , on the _ contrary _ , when in company , they generally take the lead .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 68]: Still , there is a difference arising from the variety of temperament : some , accustomed to mix constantly in society , will be indifferent whether they are acquainted with the parties present or not ; others , more retiring , require to feel at their ease , and it is only in small coteries , and among friends , that their real value can be appreciated .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 18]: Theodore Hooke is a proof of the former , the late Charles Lamb was of the latter .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 43]: Some shine most when they have no competitors ; others are only to be brought out when other men of talent are in company , and , like the flint and steel , their sparks are only to be produced by collision .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 33]: If I might be permitted to offer an opinion to the authors themselves , it would be , not to mix in general company , but confine themselves to their own friends .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 65]: They would stand much higher in reputation if they adhered to this plan ; above all , let them avoid what the author of the `` Desennuyee '' terms those `` Skinnerian lion feeds '' given by those who have no talent to appreciate , and who , to fill their menagerie , will mix you up with foreign swindlers , and home-bred ruffians .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 11]: This is most humiliating and has certainly injured the fraternity .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 9]: I have but one more remark to make .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 14]: Authors in England have little to expect from the Government and the aristocracy .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 35]: Pensions and honours have been given , but until Sir Robert Peel set a more worthy example , they were bestowed for the support of political opinions , not as a reward of talent .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 30]: That the aristocracy , with but a few exceptions , have not fostered talent , is most true ; and they are now suffering from their want of judgment .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 18]: They have shut their doors to authors , and the authors have been gradually undermining their power .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 66]: To what extent this may be carried , it is impossible to say ; but one thing is certain , that the press is more powerful than either king or lords , and that , if the conflict continue , the latter must yield to the influence of the former , who will have ample retaliation for the neglect to which they have been subjected .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 27]: What a superiority there is in England over France , and every other nation , in the periodical and daily press , especially in the latter !
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 46]: Take up the `` Constitutionnel , '' or `` Journal des Debats '' at Paris , and then look at the broad double sheets of the `` Times '' and other morning papers , with the columns of information and original matter which they contain .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 52]: Compare the flimsy sheets , bad printing , and general paucity of information of the continental daily press , with the clear types , rapid steam power called into action , the outlay , enormous expenditure , and rapid information obtained by our leading journals from all quarters of the globe .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 34]: I have looked with astonishment and admiration at the working of the `` Times '' newspaper by its beautiful steam-engine ; it is one of the most interesting sights that can be beheld .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 21]: Nothing but the assistance of steam could , indeed , enable the great daily newspapers to accomplish their present task .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 97]: When the reader calls to mind that the debates in the House are sometimes kept up till two or three o'clock in the morning ; that the reporters , relieved every twenty minutes , have to carry all their communications to the office ; that all this matter has to be arranged , put in type , and then worked off ; and that , notwithstanding this , the double sheet of matter is on thousands and thousands of tables by nine o'clock the next morning , it is really wonderful how it can be accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 33]: Saturday night appears to be the only night on which those connected with these immense , undertakings can be said to have any repose from year 's end to year 's end .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 49]: What a life of toil what an unnatural life must theirs be , who thus cater during the hours of darkness for the information and amusement of the mass who have slept soundly through the night , and rise to be instructed by the labour of their vigils !
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 12]: It can be effected in no other country in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 18]: It is another link in the great chain of miracles , which proves the greatness of England .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 12]: The editors of these papers must have a most onerous task .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 58]: It is not the writing of the leading article itself , but the obligation to write that article every day , whether inclined or not , in sickness or in health , in affliction , distress of mind , winter and summer , year after year , tied down to one task , remaining in one spot .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 14]: It is something like the walking a thousand miles in a thousand hours .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 21]: I have a fellow-feeling for them , for I know how a monthly periodical will wear down one 's existence .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 26]: In itself it appears nothing -- the labour is not manifest nor is it the labour -- it is the continual attention which it requires .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 9]: Your life becomes as it were the magazine .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 14]: One month is no sooner corrected and printed than on comes the other .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 51]: It is the stone of Sisyphus -- an endless repetition of toil -- a constant weight upon the mind -- a continual wearing upon the intellect and spirits , demanding all the exertion of your faculties , at the same time that you are compelled to do the severest drudgery .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 20]: To write for a magazine is very well , but to edit one is to condemn yourself to slavery .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 45]: Magazine writing , as it is generally termed , is the most difficult of all writing , and but few succeed in it ; the reason of which is obvious -- it must always be what is termed `` up to the mark . ''
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 61]: Any one who publishes a work in one , two , or three volumes , may be permitted to introduce a dull chapter or two : no one remarks it ; indeed , these dull chapters allow the mind of the reader to relax for the time , and , strange to say , are sometimes favourable to the author .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 56]: But in magazine-writing these can not be permitted ; the reader requires excitement , and whether the article be political or fictitious , there requires a condensation of matter , a pithiness of expression -LRB- to enable you to tell your story in so small a space -RRB- , which is very difficult to obtain .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 43]: Even in continuations the same rule must be adhered to , for , being read month after month , each separate portion must be considered as a whole and independents of the other ; it must not therefore flag for one minute .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 26]: A proof of this was given in that very remarkable production in `` Blackwood 's Magazine , '' styled `` Tom Cringle 's Log . ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 43]: Every separate portion was devoured by the public -- they waited impatiently for the first of the month that they might read the continuation , and every one was delighted , oven to its close , because the excitement was so powerful .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 19]: Some time afterwards the work was published in two volumes , and then , what was the consequence ?
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 20]: -- people complained that it was overcharged -- that it was too full of excitement -- gave no repose .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 42]: This was true ; when collected together it had that fault -- a very good one , by the by , as well as a very uncommon one ; but they did not perceive that until it was all published together .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 13]: During the time that it came out in fragments they were delighted .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 40]: Although , in this instance , the writing was overcharged , still it proved , from the popularity it obtained when it appeared in the magazine , what force and condensation of matter is required in writing for periodicals .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 34]: I am grave to-day ; it is the birth-day of one of my children -- a day so joyful in youth , in more advanced life so teeming with thought and serious reflections .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 17]: How happy the child is -- and it is its happiness which has made me grave .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 11]: How changed are our feelings as we advance in life !
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 10]: -- Our responsibility is increased with each fleeting year .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 14]: In youth we live but for ourselves -- self predominates in every thing .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 24]: In mature age , if we have fulfilled the conditions of our tenure , we feel that we must live for our children .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 50]: Fortunately , increase of years weans us from those selfish and frivolous expenses which youth requires , and we feel it little or no sacrifice to devote to our children the means which , before , we considered so important to the gratification of our pride and our ambition .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 49]: Not that we have lost either our pride or our ambition , but they have become centred in other objects dearer to us than ourselves -- in the race springing up -- to whom we shall leave our names and worldly possessions when our own career is closed .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 45]: Worn out with the pursuit of vanity , we pause at a certain age , and come to the conclusion that in this life we require but little else than to eat , drink , prepare for a future existence , and to die .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 10]: What a miserable being must an old bachelor be !
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 27]: -- he vegetates , but he can not be said to exist -- he passes his life in one long career of selfishness , and dies .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 34]: Strange , that children , and the responsibility attached to their welfare , should do more to bring a man into the right path than any denunciations from holy writ or holy men !
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 43]: How many who might have been lost , have been , it is to be hoped , saved , from the feeling that they must leave their children a good name , and must provide for their support and advancement in life !
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 42]: Yes , and how many women , after a life so frivolous as to amount to wickedness , have , from their attachment to their offspring , settled down into the redeeming position of careful , anxious , and serious-minded mothers !
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 17]: Such reflections will rise upon a birth-day , and many more of chequered hopes and fears .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 18]: How long will these flowers , now blossoming so fairly , be permitted to remain with us ?
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 27]: Will they be mowed down before another birth-day , or will they be permitted to live to pass through the ordeal of this life of temptation ?
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 5]: How will they combat ?
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 17]: Will they fall and disgrace their parents , or will they be a pride and blessing ?
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 27]: Will it please Heaven to allow them to be not too much tempted , not overcome by sickness , or that they shall be severely chastised ?
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 24]: Those germs of virtue now appearing , those tares now growing up with the corn -- will the fruit bring forth good seed ?
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 12]: will the latter be effectually rooted up by precept and example ?
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 5]: How much to encourage !
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 6]: and how much to check !
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 47]: Virtues in excess are turned to vice -- liberality becomes extravagance -- prudence , avarice -- courage , rashness -- love , weakness -- even religion may turn to fanaticism -- and superior intellect may , in its daring , mock the power which granted it .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 6]: what a responsibility is here .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 35]: A man may enjoy or suffer when he lives for himself alone ; but he is doubly blest or doubly cursed when , in his second stage , he is visited through his children .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 10]: What a blessing is our ignorance of the future !
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 21]: Fatal , indeed , to all happiness in this world would be a foreknowledge of that which is to come .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 34]: We have but to do our duty and hope for the best , acknowledging , however severe may be the dispensation , that whatever is , or is to be , is right .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 33]: How strange , although we feel in the midst of life we are in death , that mortals should presume to reduce it to a nice calculation , and speculate upon it !
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 26]: I can sell my life now to an annuity-office for twenty years ' purchase or more , and they will share a dividend upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 44]: Well , if ever I do insure my life , I hope that by _ me _ they will lose money , for , like every body else in this world , I have a great many things to do before I die .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 31]: There was but one man I ever heard of who could lie down and die , saying , `` Now , Lord , let thy servant depart in peace . ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 39]: I have no warning yet , no screw is loose in this complex mechanism ; and yet , this very day , a chimney-pot may fall on my head , and put an end to all my calculations .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 63]: It is right that the precarious tenure of our existence should not be wholly forgotten , but certainly was never intended that it should be borne on the mind , for , if we had ever in our memory that we may die this very hour , what a check there would be to all energy , and enterprise , and industry .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 25]: Who would speculate with the anticipation of large returns upon some future day , if he did not calculate upon living to receive them ?
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 11]: We should all stop to say _ Cui bono _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 31]: If it were not that our hopes support us , not only support us in all reasonable , but even unreasonable calculations , the world would be at a stand-still .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 4]: No , no !
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 23]: we have our duty to perform towards our God ; but we are also enjoined to perform our duty towards our neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 26]: The uncertainty of life is to be remembered as a check to our worldly passions , but not as a drag-chain to our worldly career .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 7]: En route , August , 1837 .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 18]: There is a great art in packing property , and in it our profession are fortunately adepts .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 18]: A midshipman , for instance , contrives to put every thing at the bottom of his chest .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 43]: No very easy matter to pack up and arrange a carriage full of children , two birds , and a spaniel puppy -- in all , twelve living beings with all their appendages , down to the birds and dogs ' tails .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 20]: As for packing up a dog , that is impossible ; the best way is to pack it off .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 68]: Canary birds travel very well in the carriage lamps , in the summer time , when they are not lighted ; and I mention this as a hint to those who travel with such indispensable appendages ; independent of their being out of the way , their appearance behind the glass is a source of great amusement to those who are standing by where you change horses .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 13]: Stopped at Saint Frond , and asked what was to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 7]: Nothing here but churches and monks .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 26]: One of the little girls , three years old , looked with avidity at the Virgin Mary , three feet high , in gold brocade .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 37]: The old verger observing this , led her nearer to it , ascribing her admiration probably to piety , when , to his horror , she screamed out , '' _ Quel jolie poupee _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 17]: Solomon says , `` Out of the mouths of babes shall ye be taught wisdom . ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 34]: The old man dropped her hand , and looked as if he would have lighted the faggots had she been bound to the stake , as she , in his opinion , deserved .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 13]: The perseverance of Belgian beggars is most remarkable , and equally annoying .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 39]: The best way is to take out your purse , and pretend to throw something over their heads ; they turn back to look for it ; and if you keep pointing farther off , you distance them .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 23]: On the whole , I consider that it is much more advisable not to give to beggars , than to relieve them .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 12]: Begging is demoralising , and should be discountenanced in every country .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 38]: If children are brought up to whine , cry , and humiliate themselves as in Belgium , that feeling of pride and independence in early youth , which leads to industry in after life , is destroyed .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 16]: And yet , the aged and infirm would appear to be proper objects of charity .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 33]: In many cases , of course , they must be ; but to prove how you may be deceived , I will state a circumstance which occurred to me some years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 10]: I was driving up the road with a friend .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 15]: He was one of the pleasantest and most honest men that nature ever moulded .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 19]: His death was most extraordinary : of a nervous temperament , ill health ended in aberration of intellect .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 33]: At that time Lord Castlereagh had ended his life of over-excitement by suicide ; the details in the newspapers were read by him , and he fancied that he was Lord Castlereagh .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 35]: Acting precisely by the accounts recorded in the newspapers , he went through the same forms , and actually divided his carotid artery , using his penknife , as had done the unfortunate peer .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 5]: Peace be with him !
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 3]: To proceed .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 43]: I was driving in a gig , a distance of about forty miles from town , on the Northern Road , when , at the bottom of a steep hill , we fell in with a group who were walking up it .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 53]: It consisted of a venerable old man , with his grey locks falling down on his shoulders , dressed as a countryman , with a bundle on a stick over his shoulders ; with him were a young man and woman , both heavily burdened , and five children of different sizes .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 25]: The appearance of the old man was really patriarchal , and there was a placidity in his countenance which gave a very favourable impression .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 63]: For a short time they continued breasting the hill on the pathway : when about one-third up , the old man crossed the road to us , as our horse was walking up , and taking off his hat , said , `` Gentlemen , if not too great a liberty , may I ask how far it is to -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 8]: mentioning a town about twelve miles off .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 28]: We told him , and he replied , `` That 's a long way for old legs like mine , and young legs of tired children . ''
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 49]: He then informed us that they had lost their employment in the country , and that , with his son and daughter , and their children , he had gone to town to procure work , but had been unsuccessful , and they were now on their return .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 8]: `` God 's will be done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 61]: continued he , after his narrative , `` and thankful shall we be to find ourselves at our cottages again , although twelve miles is a weary bit of road , and I have but a few halfpence left ; but that will buy a bit of bread for the poor children , and we must do as we can .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 12]: Good morning , and thank ` ye kindly , gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 13]: Now there was no begging here , certainly , except by implication .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 30]: The effect , however , of his narrative was to extract a crown out of our pockets , which was received with a shower of blessings on our heads .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 31]: We drove off , observing how difficult it was to know how to select real objects of charity , and flattering ourselves that alms in this instance were worthily bestowed .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 12]: My readers will agree with me , I have no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 41]: It so happened that , about ten days afterwards , I was driving on the Dover Road , in the same gig , and in company with the same gentleman , when we came to the bottom of Shooters Hill .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 29]: Who should we fall in with but the very same party , the venerable old man , the young people , and the children trudging up the pathway .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 24]: The same plan of proceeding was observed , for , although we recognised them immediately it appeared that they did not recognise us .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 19]: We allowed the old fellow to tell his tale , as before ; it was just the same .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 42]: He first took off his hat , and inquired the distance to -- ; and then entered into the same narrative , only changing the place of abode , and ending with his few halfpence to buy bread for the children .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 68]: I let him finish , and then I did not , as before , give him a crown , but I gave him a cut across his face with the whip , which made him drop his bundle , put his hands up to it ; and we left him , stamping with pain in the middle of the road , till we were out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 33]: A young rogue I can easily pardon , but an old one , on the verge of the grave , is a proof of hardened villainy , which admits of no extenuation .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 14]: After giving him this _ cut direct _ , we never met again .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 6]: To return to Saint Frond .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 12]: -- In the last church we visited we had a scene .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 40]: A woman was in the confessional ; the priest , with a white handkerchief up to conceal his face , and prevent what he said being overheard , attracted the attention of the children , who demanded an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 6]: Children ask so many questions .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 10]: `` Do you think she has been very wicked ?
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 6]: Will he forgive her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 28]: Before I could offer my opinion upon this important subject , the woman gave a loud scream , and fell back from the confessional in a fit .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 21]: The priest rose , the handkerchief no longer concealed his face , and he appeared to be burning with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 19]: She was carried out of the church , and the priest hastened up the aisle to the vestry .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 5]: What had she done ?
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 14]: At all events , something for which it appeared there was no absolution .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 4]: Aix-la-Chapelle -- alas !
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 22]: What did we care for the tomb of Charles the Great , and his extensive dominions , his splendour and power ?
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 96]: We had lost something to us of much more importance -- a carpet bag ; not that the carpet bag was of much value , for it was an old one , nor the articles which it contained , for they were neither new nor of much worth ; but we lost in that carpet bag an invaluable quantity of comfort , for it contained a variety of little absolute necessaries , the loss of which we could not replace until our arrival at Cologne , to which town all our trunks had been despatched .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 95]: The children could not be brushed , for the brushes were in the carpet bag ; they could not be combed , for the combs were in the carpet bag ; they were put to bed without nightcaps , for the night-caps were in the carpet bag ; they were put to bed in their little chemises , reaching down to the fifth rib or thereabouts , for their night-clothes were in the carpet bag : not only the children , but every one else suffered by this carpet bag being absent without leave .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 45]: My boots burst , and my others were in the carpet bag ; my snuff-box was empty , and the canister was in the carpet bag ; and the servants grumbled , for they had smuggled some of their things into the carpet bag .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 13]: It would appear that everything had been crammed into this unfortunate receptacle .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 51]: Had we lost a jewel-case , or a purse full of money , it would have been a trifle compared to the misery occasioned by this jumble up of every day conveniences of little value , showing how much more comfort depends upon the necessaries than the luxuries of life .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 30]: I may add , now that I read what I have written , that this carpet bag increased in dimensions to a most extraordinary compass for several weeks afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 49]: Everything that was missing was declared by the servants to have been in the carpet bag , which , like the scape-goat of the Jews , wandered in the wilderness , bearing with it all the sins of all the nurses and every other domestic of the family .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 34]: On our road , the landlord of an inn put the following printed document into my hands , which I make public for the benefit of those who are sportsmen without being landholders .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 4]: `` COMFORTABLE INN .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 43]: -- The proprietor of the Red House , at Burgheim , on the road from Aix-la-Chapelle to Cologne , pleasantly situated in the middle of the town , opposite the Post-Office and Post-House , has the honour of recommending himself to travellers .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 13]: The ` Galignani 's Messenger ' and other newspapers are taken in .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 10]: The English , German , and French languages spoken .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 40]: Having excellent preserves of game in the neighbourhood , he is happy to inform travellers that he can provide them with good sports in wild boar , deer , and hare hunting , and wild duck and partridge shooting .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 13]: Horses and carriages of all descriptions supplied for excursions in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 5]: `` AJ HONS . ''
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 4]: _ Prussia _ .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 24]: -- I fear that our political economists are running after a shadow , and that their reciprocity system will never be listened to .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 77]: It is remarkable , that , after subsidising this and other powers to break up the continental system established by Napoleon for the expulsion of English manufactures and the consequent ruin of England , now that the world is at peace , these very powers who , by our exertions and our money , have been liberated from their thraldom , have themselves established the very system of exclusion which we were so anxious to prevent .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 10]: A little reflection will prove that they are right .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 33]: The government of a country ought never , if possible , to allow that country to be dependent upon any other for such resources as it can obtain by its own industry .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 30]: We , ourselves , acted upon this principle when we established the silk manufactories in Spitalfields ; and it is the duty of every government to do the same .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 36]: The indigenous productions of the soil may fairly be admitted on a system of reciprocity and exchange , but not articles of manufacture , of which the raw material is to be obtained by all .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 46]: For instance , the lead , and iron , and tin of Great Britain , the wines of other countries , are all articles to be exchanged or paid for by those who have not mines of those metals , or do not possess vineyards .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 20]: Further than this reciprocity can not go , without being injurious to one , if not to both parties .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 6]: Three of the carriage-wheels defective !
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 21]: Add this to the carpet bag , and people will agree in the trite observation that misfortunes never come single .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 28]: This is not true ; they do come single very often , and when they do , they are more annoying than if they come in heaps .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 40]: You growl at a single mishap , but if you find that Fortune is down upon you and attempts to overload you , you rise up against her with indignation , snap your fingers , and laugh at her .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 51]: The last mishap brought consolation for all the others ; if we had not so fortunately found out the defects in the wheels , we might have broken our necks the next day , especially , as some amateur took a fancy and helped himself to our _ sabot _ .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 16]: I only wish he may be shod with it for the remainder of his days .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 31]: It is curious how the ignorant and simple always rise or depreciate others , whatever their rank may be , to their own levels , when they talk of them .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 24]: I listened to one little girl telling a story to another , in which kings , queens , and princesses were the actors .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 24]: `` And so , '' said the queen to the princess , `` what a very pretty doll that is of yours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 27]: `` Yes , your majesty ; papa bought it for me at the bazaar , and gave 5 shillings 6 pence for it , '' etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 25]: This reminded me of the sailors telling stories on board of a man-of-war , who put very different language into the mouth of royalty .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 18]: `` Well , '' says the king , `` blow me tight if I 'll stand this .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 13]: You must buckle-to as fast as you please , Mrs Queen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 26]: `` I 'll see you hanged first , and your head shaved too , '' answered her majesty in a rage , etcetera , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 28]: What queens may say in a rage it is impossible to assert ; but to the seamen this language appeared to be perfectly regal and quite correct .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 8]: Some people form odd notions of gentility .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 43]: A cabman took up a well-dressed female , who made use of expressions which rather startled him , and he observed to a friend of his , a hackney-coachman , that he had no idea that the higher classes used such language .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 3]: pooh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 12]: replied the coachman , `` she war n't a lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 23]: `` I beg your pardon , '' replied the cabman , `` a real lady , _ hat and feathers _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 2]: Cologne .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 30]: -- This is a regular Golgotha -- the skulls of the Magi , _ par excellence _ , and then the skulls of Saint Ursula and her 11,000 virgins .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 8]: I wonder where she collected so many !
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 30]: Saint Ursula brought a great force into the field , at all events , and , I presume , commands the right wing of the whole army of martyrs .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 15]: I went into the golden chamber , where there are some really pretty things .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 44]: The old fellow handed us the articles one after another , but I observed that there were many things which I had seen when here before , which were not presented to view , so I looked into the cabinet and found them .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 12]: They were crystal vases , mounted with gold and precious stones .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 31]: One had the thigh-bone of Saint Sebastian ; another , part of the ulna of Saint Lawrence ; and a third a bit of the petticoat of the Virgin Mary .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 25]: I handed them out to the ladies , and asked him why he did not show us those as he used to do before .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 24]: The old man smiled and turned the corners of his mouth down , as if to say , `` Its all humbug ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 12]: Relics are certainly at a discount , even among the Catholics .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 47]: I question whether the Bridge of Boats at Cologne do n't pay better than any other in the whole world , although by no means the handsomest ; the stream of passengers on it all day is as strong and as wide as the Rhine itself .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 18]: As for Cologne , the best thing that could happen to it is to be burnt down .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 46]: Narrow streets , badly ventilated , badly drained ; your nose is visited with a thousand varieties of smell as you pass along ; and the Eau de Cologne in the gutters is very different in savour from that which you buy in the bottles .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 22]: We had a pleasant passage from Cologne to Coblentz , and from thence to Mayence , because we had pleasant company .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 36]: It is singular , but it is a fact , that you go on board a steamboat to avoid fatigue , and each night you are more tired than if you had travelled by land .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 49]: You go to avoid dust and heat ; the first is exchanged for blacks out of the funnel , and you are more dirty than if you had travelled twice the distance ; and the heat is about the same ; in these points you certainly gain nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 10]: The expense of these Rhine steamboats is very great .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 36]: By a calculation I made -- to travel by post , five persons in a carriage , from Cologne to Strasburg -- you will expend 200 and odd francs less than by the steam conveyance .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 35]: In time you certainly lose by steam , as you are four days and a half going to Strasburg , and by land carriage it is half the distance , being only forty-five posts .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 64]: Neither do you save trouble ; for the steam-boats being changed every evening , you have to take your luggage on shore , shift it from one to the other , and , at the very time that you are least inclined to do anything , independent of an enormous expense which you ought not to pay , but can not well resist .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 60]: Now , as you really gain nothing in the above points , it is at least to be supposed that you gain in the picturesque ; but this is not the case : and I have no hesitation in asserting that those who go up the Rhine are generally disappointed , although they do not like to say so .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 5]: They expect too much .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 34]: -- The vivid descriptions , the steel engravings , have raised their anticipations too high ; and they find that the reality is not equal to the efforts of the pen and pencil .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 24]: Several of the passengers acknowledged to me that they were disappointed ; and I must confess that I hardly knew the Rhine again .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 21]: When I travelled up the Rhine by land I thought it beautiful ; but in a steam-boat it was tame .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 31]: This was observed by others , besides myself , who had ascended both by steam and by the road running close to the banks ; and the reason was simple .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 62]: When you travel by land you have the whole breadth of the Rhine as a foreground to the scenery of the opposite bank , and this you lose by water ; and the bank you travel on is much more grand from its towering above you , and also from the sharp angles and turns which so suddenly change the scenery .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 17]: Abruptness greatly assists the picturesque : the Rhine loses half its beauty viewed from a steam-boat .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 20]: I have ascended it in both ways , and I should recommend all travellers to go up by land .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 8]: The inconveniences in a steam-boat are many .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 38]: You arrive late and find the hotel crowded , and you are forced to rise very early -LRB- as Mayence at three o'clock in the morning -RRB- , which , with a family , is no trifle .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 53]: The only part of the Rhine worth seeing is from Cologne to Mayence ; below Cologne and above Mayence it is without interest ; and although between these two places the steam-boats are well served , above Mayence everything is very uncomfortable , and you are liable to every species of exaction .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 92]: If I were to plan a tour up the Rhine for any friends , I should advise them not to go by the Rotterdam steamer ; it is a long voyage and without interest , and with many inconveniences ; but start in the steamer to Antwerp , go up to Brussels by the rail-road ; from thence you will start for Cologne by the route of Namur and Liege through Waterloo ; and I rather expect that many will prefer the banks of the _ Meuse _ to the Rhine .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 28]: I know nothing more beautiful than the road from Namur as far as Chaude Fontaine , although compared to the Rhine it is on a miniature scale .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 11]: From Liege to Aix-la-Chapelle , and from thence to Cologne .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 20]: Go up the Rhine by land as far as Mayence , and then you may do as you please .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 35]: When you are coming back , descend by the steam-boats ; for then you go with the stream and with great rapidity , and arrive in good time at the towns where they stop .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 13]: You will then have seen the Rhine by land and by water .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 15]: At present the bubble is at its height ; but it will burst by-and-by .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 20]: The English are lining the banks of the Rhine with gold , and receive insult and abuse in exchange .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 19]: I have been much amused with a young countryman who has come up in the steamer with me .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 37]: Not able to speak a word of French or German , he is pillaged every hour of the day ; but if he could speak , he has no idea of the value of his money .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 22]: He pulls out his purse , and the waiters help themselves -- very _ plentifully _ , I may safely add .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 42]: What he has come for it is difficult to say : not for the picturesque , for he slept the whole time between Cologne and Mayence -- that is , all the time that was not occupied by eating and drinking .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 12]: His only object appears to be to try the Rhenish wines .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 11]: He has tried all upon the _ Wein Presen _ .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 31]: He called for a bottle of the best ; they gave him one not on the _ carte _ , and charged him exactly one pound sterling for the bottle .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 26]: He is a generous fellow ; he sits at the table with his bottle before him , and invites every man to partake of it .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 13]: And he found plenty on board who were willing to oblige him .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 9]: `` Capital wine , a n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 19]: said he to a Frenchman who drank his wine , but did not understand a word of English .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 12]: `` A votre sante , Monsieur , '' replied the Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 12]: `` I say , what wine do you call it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 11]: `` C'est exquis , Monsieur , '' replied the Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 6]: `` Eskey , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 12]: You , waiter , bring us another bottle of eskey . ''
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 3]: To continue .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 28]: -- Should travellers think it advisable to proceed upon the Rhine , so far as Mayence , let them be careful how they venture to proceed farther .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 34]: I did so , out of curiosity to know what the features of the Rhine were , after it had lost its character for magnificence ; and I will now detail my progress .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 60]: At Mayence you are shifted into a smaller steamer , with less power , upon the principle that there being but a few passengers , their comforts do not require so much attention ; for , as the Rhine becomes more rapid as it narrows , upon any other principle the power of the engine should have been greater .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 17]: I must caution the reader not to believe what is told them by the steam-packet company .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 23]: Barbers were once considered liars _ par excellence _ , but I am inclined to give the preference to these new associations .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 45]: The features of the Rhine change immediately that you leave Mayence ; the banks are low , and the river is studded with numerous islands , all of which , as well as the greatest proportion of the banks , are covered with osiers .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 136]: Still , there is a great beauty in the Rhine even there ; the waving of the osiers to the strong breeze , the rapidity of the current , the windings of the river , the picturesque spires of the village churches , or the change of scenery when the river pours through forests , lining each bank as the vessel slowly claws against the rapid stream , are by no means uninteresting ; of course we did not arrive at Leopoldshaffen at the hour stated by the people at the office , but we did arrive late at night , and took up our quarters at a small auberge in the above village , which is not marked down in the maps , but which has post-horses and diligences to convey passengers to Carlsruhe .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 56]: Notwithstanding the assertion at the packet-office , that we were to be in one day to Leopoldshaffen , in one day more to Strasburg , we found there was no steamer until the day after the morrow , and that we must wait one day more if we did not choose to go to Carlsruhe .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 12]: The females , being fatigued , preferred remaining where they were .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 8]: We sauntered about and amused ourselves quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 57]: The next day , we found the steamer had arrived , and that instead of her ascending in one day to Strasburg , it would take a day and a half , and that we must pass the night aboard without the least accommodation -- not very pleasant , with a carriage full of young children .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 41]: We embarked on board the steamer , which was a miserable small vessel , with an engine of bad construction , and very small power ; and with this we were to oppose the most rapid part of the Rhine .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 37]: In every other point the vessel was equally ill found : they had a very small stock of provisions , bad wine , and none of those comforts provided for the passengers in the other vessels .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 19]: To crown all , another family with children -LRB- of whom more hereafter -RRB- had taken their passage .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 29]: The steward told us , that never expecting so many people on board going up to Strasburg , he was totally unprepared ; and so it eventually appeared .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 22]: We started , and soon found out that the power of the engines was quite disproportionate to the object in view .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 9]: The Rhine now assumed a more desolate character .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 49]: For miles and miles not a village nor even a solitary town to be seen ; the Hartz mountains forming a blue opaque mass in the distance ; the stream rapidly passing through narrow and deep channels , leaving one half of the bed of the river dry .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 69]: At times we passed very dangerous straits , where the waters boiled and eddied over reefs of rocks , and were often obliged to force our way by keeping within a foot of steep and muddy banks , where trees torn up , and hanging by the roots , proved how violent must be the current when the river is increased by the melting of the mountain snow .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 73]: Our progress was , as it may be imagined , most tedious ; at no time did we advance above a mile and a half per hour ; sometimes we did not gain a hundred yards in the same time , and occasionally we were swept back by the current , and had to lose still more ground , while they increased the power of the engine at the risk of explosion .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 60]: The consequence was , that when the day closed , the conducteur gave his opinion , that instead of being at Strasburg by eleven or twelve o'clock the next day , we should not arrive till four or five o'clock : we anchored within a yard of the bank , and prepared to pass the night how we could .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 10]: Our party consisted of seven , with two nurses .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 43]: The other party consisted of four grown-up females , one male , four boys , an East African negro , and a _ cowskin _ ; the latter was a very important personage , and made a great noise during the passage .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 158]: The gentleman was apparently one of those who denominate themselves eclectic : he paid very little attention to what was going on ; a peaceable sort of man , whose very physiognomy said `` any thing for a quiet life : '' one of the ladies was his wife , and two others , virgins of some standing , apparently his sisters ; the other lady , a bilious-looking sort of personage , and happy in being the mother of four very fine boys , as great pickles as ever lived ; these she kept in order with the assistance of the negro and the cowskin , the use of the latter occasioning such evident marks of astonishment and horror to _ our _ little ones , as not to be at all satisfactory to the lady in question , who appeared not averse , had she dared , to have given them a taste of it .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 26]: The youngest and the youngest but one of the boys were the two sufferers ; the youngest had a regular dozen administered every half hour .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 40]: The two eldest were more particularly under the care of the negro , who used his fists , I presume because they wore corduroys , and , as Hood says , did not care for `` cut behind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 17]: We had not been in the vessel two minutes before there was a _ breeze _ .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 19]: I heard the negro expostulating as follows : -- `` You very foolish boy , what you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 15]: who ever heard of putting new cloth cap into water to catch fish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 6]: This was the first offence .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 64]: I must say that the coercion used did not appear to originate from any feeling of regard for the children , for they were allowed to climb , and push , and run over the sky-lights , and over the engine , and I every moment expected that some of them would be provided for either by the cog-wheels or the river Rhine .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 88]: It was evident at once , not only from the above accessories , but from the Chinese trunks which contained their luggage , that they were an Indian importation , and their behaviour subsequently proved it , beyond all doubt , even if they had not made it known -- not by talking to us , but by talking at us , for they evidently did not consider that we were sufficiently respectable to be admitted into their society , even in the short intercourse of fellow-travellers .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 19]: I can not here help making an observation relative to most of the people who come from India .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 10]: They are always dissatisfied , and would gladly return .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 30]: The reason is very obvious ; they at once lose their rank and consequence , and sink down to the level which they are entitled to in English society .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 48]: In India the rank of the servants of the Company takes precedence ; but whatever their rank or emolument may be in India , they are still but servants of a company of merchants , and such rank is not , of course , allowed in England .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 109]: Accustomed to unlimited sway and control over a host of fawning slaves , and to that attention as females -- which , where females are not very plentiful , is most sedulously paid -- accustomed to patronise the newcomers , who , of course , feel grateful for such well-timed civility and hospitality -- in short , accustomed to rank , splendour , wealth , and power -- it is not surprising that , upon their return to England , when they find themselves shorn of all these , and that their station in society is far more removed from the apex , they become sullen and dissatisfied .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 100]: Of course , there are many who have been resident in India , where family and connections insure them every advantage upon their return to their native country ; but it must be recollected that the greater proportion of those who return consists of those who were of low origin , and who have obtained their appointments in reward for the exertions of their parents in behalf of their patrons in parliamentary returns , etcetera , and of young females who have -LRB- with their face as their fortune -RRB- been shipped off to India upon a matrimonial speculation .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 61]: Now , however high in rank they may have , in the course of many years ' service , arrived to in India , when they return they are nobodies ; and unless they bring with them such wealth as to warrant their being designated as nabobs , their chance of admittance into the best society is very small indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 16]: I have said that they _ talked _ at us , and not to us .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 34]: The gentleman was civil , and would have conversed , but he was immediately interrupted and sent off on a message ; and , for a quiet life , he gave it up .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 41]: The system of talking at people always reminds me of the play of the `` Critic , '' in which it is asked why , if `` he knows all this , it is necessary to tell him again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 26]: Simply because the audience do not ; so , the party in question were the actors , and we were the audience to be informed .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 25]: The conversation between the adults run as follows : -- `` You recollect how polite Lord C -- was to us at -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 8]: `` To be sure I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 11]: `` Lady D -- told me so and so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 10]: `` Yes , I recollect it very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 13]: `` What a nice man the Honourable Mr E -- is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 8]: `` Yes , that he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 14]: `` How very intimate we were at -- with Lady G -- . ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 6]: `` That we were . ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 16]: And so on , during the whole of the day , much to our edification .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 9]: How contemptible , how paltry is such vanity !
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 51]: But with their indulgence of it for our amusement , the cow-skin , and a scanty dinner , we got through the first day , during which two or three occasional patronising questions or remarks were thrown at our heads , and then they reverted to their own assumed exclusiveness .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 40]: The night , as may be supposed , was anything but comfortable to those in the cabin ; but I shall not dwell upon what , if fairly narrated , would be a very pretty sketch of human nature .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 41]: We were to arrive the next day at five o'clock in the afternoon , but we toiled on ; and the sun at last went down , and we found ourselves with the steeple of Strasburg a long way off .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 18]: We again anchored , and had to pass another night in this miserable vessel and delightful company .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 30]: The detention , of course , made our fellow-passengers more cross ; and could I have obtained possession of the cowskin , I would certainly have thrown it overboard .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 21]: The captain sent a man on shore to procure us something to eat , for the steward declared himself bankrupt .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 40]: The next forenoon we arrived at the bridge of boats between Kehl and Strasburg ; and thus was finished our tedious and unpleasant voyage , of which I have given a description as a warning to all future travellers .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 61]: Our fellow-passengers did once condescend to address and inform us that they had left England -LRB- a party of ten people -RRB- only to pay a visit to some friends in Switzerland -- an expensive sort of trip , and which did not appear at all consistent with the fact that they were travelling without a carriage or female servants .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 19]: Be it as it might , we separated without so much as a salutation or good-bye being exchanged .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 41]: Much of the picturesque on the Rhine is destroyed by the vineyards , which are , in reality , the most unpoetical things in landscape scenery , being ranged up the sides of the mountains in little battalions like infantry .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 17]: It is remarkable in how shallow and how very poor a soil the vine will grow .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 20]: At Saint Michael 's , they dig square holes in the volcanic rocks , and the vines find sustenance .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 17]: At the Cape of Good Hope the Constantia vineyards are planted upon little more than sand .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 12]: I dug down some depth ; and could find nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 40]: The finest grapes grown in Burgundy are upon a stratum of soil little more than a foot deep , over schistus slate quarries , and the soil itself composed chiefly of the _ debris _ of this soft rock .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 40]: We know that the vegetable creation has a sort of instinct as well as the animal and it appears to me that there are different degrees of instinct in that portion of nature as well as in the other .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 25]: A vine , for instance , I take to be a very clever plant , and both apple and pear-trees to be great fools .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 51]: The vine will always seek its own nourishment , hunting with its roots through the soil for the aliment it requires ; and if it can not find it where it is planted , it will seek , in every direction and to a great distance , to obtain it .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 52]: It is asserted that the famous vine at Hampton Court has passed its roots under the bed of the river , and obtains aliment from the soil on the other side ; but an apple or pear-tree will take no such trouble -- it will not even avoid what is noxious .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 58]: Plant one of these trees in the mould three or four feet above the marl or clay ; so long as the roots remain in the mould , the tree will flourish , but so soon as the tap root pierces down to the marl or clay below the mould , the tree will canker and die .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 92]: To prevent this , it is the custom to dig first down to the marl and put a layer of tiles upon it , which turn the roots of the trees from a perpendicular to a horizontal direction , and then they do well ; but leave the tree without assistance , and the fool will commit suicide , blindly rushing to its own destruction ; while the vine will not only avoid it , but use every exertion to procure what is necessary for its continuing in health and vigour .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 13]: The vine is therefore certainly the more intellectual plant of the two .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 2]: Strasbourg .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 47]: There certainly is an impulse implanted in our natures to love something ; our affections were never intended to lie in abeyance , and if they can not be placed upon the other sex or our own children , they still seek something as an object .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 46]: This accounts for old bachelors being fond of their nephews and nieces , for blood relationship has nothing to do with it ; and for old ladies , who have not entered into wedlock , becoming so attached to dogs , cats , and parrots .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 35]: Sometimes , indeed , the affections take much wilder flights in the pursuit of an object , and exhibit strange idiosyncrasies ; but still it proves by nature we are compelled to love something .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 59]: I have been reflecting how far this principle may not be supposed to pervade through the universe , and whether we can not trace it in the inferiors of the animal creation : whether we can not trace a small remnant of Paradise in the beasts who enjoyed it with man , as well as in man himself .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 18]: It is well known that animals will take very strong and very strange attachments towards other animals .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 28]: It is , perhaps , more apparent in domestic animals , but is not that because they are more brought together and more under our immediate eye ?
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 23]: in some instances , as in the case when maternal feelings are roused , the strongest antipathies and habit will be controlled .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 41]: A cat losing her kittens has been known to suckle a brood of young rats , but in this case I consider instinct to have been the most powerful agent ; wild beasts confined in cages show the same propensity .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 72]: The lion secluded in his den has often been known to foster and become strongly attached to a dog thrown in to him to be devoured ; but there never was an instance of a lion or any other wild beast , which had a female in the same den or even a companion of its own species , preserving the life of any other living creature thrown in to him .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 19]: This feeling occasions also the production of Hybrids ; which in a wild state could never take place .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 60]: There is not , probably , a more ferocious or ill-tempered animal than the bear when it is grown up ; it is subdued by fear , but shows no attachment to its keeper ; yet , the other day I fell in with a remarkable narration proving the feeling I have referred to , actuating even this animal .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 81]: A proof of the bad feeling of a bear is fully established by the fact that , although Martin , as the old bear is called in the Jardin des Plantes , at Paris , had been confined in his fosse nearly twenty years , during which time not a day passed that he was not well fed by the people who amused themselves in the gardens , when a man fell into his pit , he immediately destroyed him .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 18]: It does , however , appear , that all bears are not so ill-tempered as Monsieur Martin .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 22]: Leopold , Duke of Lorraine , had a bear confined by a long chain , near the palisades below the glacis .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 39]: Some poor Savoyard boys , who had emigrated as they still do , with the hopes of picking up some money to take back with them , had taken shelter in an out-house daring a severe snow storm .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 48]: One of them who was numbed with the cold , thought that he would try if he could not find some warmer berth , and in seeking this , as the snow fell fast , he at last crawled nearly exhausted into the kennel of the bear .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 31]: Instead of tearing the lad to pieces , the bear took him in his fore paws , and pressed him to his shaggy warm coat till he was quite recovered .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 24]: A bear generally receives you with open arms , whatever may be his ultimate decision ; but in this instance it was favourable .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 32]: The poor little boy finding himself in good quarters , went fast asleep ; the next morning he sallied forth to obtain some victuals if he could , but without success .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 38]: Cold and hunger drove him again to the kennel of the bear , who not only was delighted to see him , but had actually laid aside a portion of his supper for the boy 's use .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 26]: The amicable arrangement continued for some days , and the bear , at last , would not touch his victuals till the boy 's return .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 35]: This peculiar friendship was at last discovered , and the story narrated to the Duke , who sent for the boy , and took care of him , admitting him into his own household .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 19]: The narrator observes that the boy died a year or two after this unusual occurrence had taken place .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 20]: I have no doubt but that many more instances might be brought forward by others to establish my supposition .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 147]: To us , all wild animals of the same species appear to be much alike in disposition , because we have not an opportunity of examining and watching them carefully , but I should rather imagine , that as we can perceive such a manifest difference in temper between individual horses and dogs and other animals who are domesticated , that the same difference must exist in the wild species , and that , in fact , there may be shades of virtue and vice in lions , tigers , bears , and other animals ; and that there does exist in animals as well as in man , more or less according to their natural dispositions , a remnant of those affections which in the garden of our first parents were so strongly implanted as to induce the lion to lie down with the lamb .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 29]: `` God is Love , '' says the Scriptures ; before the devil found his way to this earth all was love , for God only was there .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 12]: Now man struggles between the two principles of good and evil .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 66]: When his nature was changed , so was that of animals ; but the principle not being extinct in man , why should not a portion still remain in the rest of the creation , who with him were permitted to inhabit the garden of Eden , and whose savage natures were not roused until with man they were driven from that abode of peace ?
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 39]: The most affectionate animal that I know of is the common brown Mongoose : it is a creature between the squirrel and the monkey , with all the liveliness but without any of the mischief of the latter .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 37]: Unfortunately they will not live in our country , or they would supersede the cat altogether ; they are very clean , and their attachment is beyond all conception to those who have not seen them .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 35]: They will leap on their master 's shoulder , or get into his bed , and coil their long bushy tails round his neck like a boa , remaining there for hours if permitted .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 67]: I recollect one poor little fellow who was in his basket dying -- much to the grief of his master -- who , just before he expired , crawled out of his straw and went to his master 's cot , where he had just sufficient strength to take his place upon his bosom , coil his tail round his neck , and then he died .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 8]: Hares and rabbits are also very affectionate .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 19]: One of my little girls had one of the latter , which she brought up in the house .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 61]: He grew very large , and was domesticated just like a dog , following you everywhere , in the parlour and up into the bed-room ; in the winter lying on the rug before the fire on his side , and stretching out his four legs as unconcerned as possible , even refusing to go away if you pushed him .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 12]: As for the cat , she durst not go near him .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 40]: He thrashed her unmercifully , for he was very strong ; and the consequence was that she retired to the kitchen , where he would often go down , and if she was in his way drive her out .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 36]: The hare and rabbit , as well as the deer tribe , defend themselves by striking with their fore paws , and the blow which they can give is more forcible than people would suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 68]: One day when I was in a cover , leaning against a tree , with my gun in my hand , I presume for some time I must have been in deep thought , I heard a rustling and then a squeak on the other side of the tree ; I looked round the trunk , and beheld a curious combat between two hares and a stoat .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 23]: The hares were male and female , and had their leveret between them , which latter was not above six weeks old .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 59]: The stoat -- a little devil with all its hair , from the tip of its nose to the end of its tail , standing at end -- was at about two yards distance from them , working round and round to have an opportunity to spring upon the leveret , which was the object of its attack .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 22]: As it went round so did the hares face him , pivoting on a centre with the young one between them .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 11]: At last the stoat made a spring upon the leveret .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 51]: He was received by the hares , who struck him with their fore feet such blows as I could not have believed possible ; they actually resounded , and he was rolled over and over until he got out of distance , when he shook himself and renewed his attacks .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 61]: These continued about ten minutes , and every time he was beaten off ; but , at every spring , his teeth went into the poor little leveret ; at last it gave its last squeak , turned over on its side , and died , the father and mother still holding their relative situations , and facing the stoat .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 26]: The latter showed as much prudence as courage ; for so soon as he perceived that the leveret was dead , he also walked off .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 93]: The hares turned round to their young one , smelt at it apparently , pushed it with their noses , and shortly after , as if aware that it was past all defence , hopped slowly away ; they were hardly out of sight in the bushes when back came the stoat , threw the leveret , twice as big as himself , over his shoulders , and went off with his prize at a hard gallop , reminding me , in miniature , of the Bengal tiger carrying off a bullock .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 40]: All the actors in the drama having gone off ; I walked off , and shortly after both barrels of my gun went off , so the whole party disappeared , and there 's an end of my story .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 92]: If an elephant were not so very unwieldy , and at the same time so very uncertain in his temper , he is the animal who has the most claims from affection and intelligence to be made a pet of ; but an elephant in a drawing-room would be somewhat incommodious ; and , although one may admit a little irritability of temper in a lap-dog weighing three pounds , the anger of an elephant , although he expresses himself very sorry for it afterwards , is attended with serious consequences .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 14]: There is something very peculiar about an elephant in his anger and irritability .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 24]: It sometimes happens that , at a certain season , a wild elephant will leave the herd and remain in the woods alone .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 75]: It is supposed , and I think that the supposition is correct , that these are the weaker males who have been driven away by the stronger , in fact , they are elephants crossed in love ; and when in that unfortunate dilemma , they are very mischievous , and play as many fantastic tricks as ever did any of the knights of the round table on similar occasions in times of yore .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 39]: I was at Trincomalee ; an elephant in this situation had taken possession of the road at some leagues distant , and , for reasons best known to himself , would not allow a soul to pass it .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 24]: He remained _ perdu _ in the jungle till he saw somebody coming , and then he would burst out and attack them .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 24]: It is the custom to travel in palanquins from one part of the island to another , as in all parts of India .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 95]: If some officer or gentleman was obliged to proceed to Colombo or elsewhere , so soon as the palanquin came towards him , out came the elephant ; the native bearers , who knew that it was no use arguing the point , dropped the palanquin and fled , and all that the occupant could do was to bundle out and do the same before the elephant came up , otherwise he had little chance of his life , for the elephant immediately put his knees in the palanquin and smashed it to atoms .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 58]: Having done this , he would toss the fragments in the air in every direction , at the same time carefully unfolding all the articles contained in the palanquin for the occupants use -- shirts , trowsers , boots , bottles , books , undergoing a most rigid examination , and after that being rendered to fragments .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 32]: If the cooley who had the charge of the bag of letters made his appearance , he was immediately pursued until he gave up the whole correspondence , official or private .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 24]: The bag was opened , every letter was opened one by one , and then torn in fragments and tossed to the winds .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 40]: In this way did he keep possession of the road , stopping all communication for several weeks , until it was his sovereign will and pleasure that people might receive their letters and travel across the country as before .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 8]: Now what an unaccountable freak was this !
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 10]: It was like the madness of a reasonable being .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 87]: If I recollect right , it was when Captain Owen was on the east coast of Africa , some of his party who landed were attacked by elephants , who threw them down on the ground and , instead of killing them , as might have been expected , and would have given them no trouble , they drew up a large quantity of mud in their trunks and poured it into their mouths so as to nearly to suffocate them , and then left them .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 39]: On another occasion , they put their fore feet on their limbs , so as to pinch and bruise them severely in every part of their bodies , but avoided their bones so as not to fracture one .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 21]: Now this was evidently two species of torture invented by the elephants , and these elephants in a wild state .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 10]: There certainly is something very incomprehensible about these animals .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 36]: The lion has been styled the king of beasts , but I think he is an usurper allowed to remain on the throne by public opinion and suffrage , from the majesty of his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 9]: In every other point he has no claim .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 34]: He is the head of the feline or cat species , and has all the treachery , cruelty , and wanton love for blood that all this class of animals have to excess .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 25]: The lion , like the tiger and the cat , will not come boldly on to his prey , but springs from his concealment .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 19]: It is true that he will face his assailants bravely when wounded , but so will the tiger .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 49]: In my opinion , the horse is the most noble of all animals , and , I am sorry to say , the most ill-used , at least in England ; for I do not recollect a single instance of having seen a horse ill-treated on the Continent .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 54]: In fact , you hardly ever see a horse on the Continent that is not in good working condition : you never meet the miserable , lame , blind , and worn-out animals that you do in England , which stumble along with their loads behind them till they stumble into their graves .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 44]: If any one would take the trouble to make friends with their horses , they would be astonished at the intelligence and affection of this noble animal ; but we leave him to our grooms , who prefer to use force to kindness .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 59]: At the same time , I have observed , even in colts , very different dispositions ; some are much more fond and good-tempered than others ; but let them be what they will as colts , they are soon spoiled by the cruelty and want of judgment of those who have charge of them in the stable .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 51]: The sympathy between the Arab and his horse is well known : the horse will lie down in the tent , and the children have no fear of receiving a kick ; on the contrary , they roll upon , and with him : such is the result of kindness .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 34]: And I can now give a proof of the effects of the contrary , as it was , in this instance , what may be termed _ malice prepense _ in the animal .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 27]: The horses used in the West Indies are supplied from the Spanish Main ; they are from the Andalusian stock originally , partly Arab and barb .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 55]: These horses are taken by the lasso from the prairies , and are broken in as follows : -- They head them down to the sea beach , saddle and bridle them for the first time , and mount them with a pair of spurs , the rowels of which are an inch long .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 42]: So soon as the animal plunges and attempts to divest himself of his rider , he is forced into the sea , and there he is worked in and out of his depth till he is fairly worn out and exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 26]: This is repeated once or twice till they are submissive , and then they are sent off as broke-in horses to the West India Islands .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 20]: A friend of mine had a very beautiful animal , which he had purchased from one of these ships .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 30]: He had not bought him more than a week before he took the bit in his mouth , and ran away with the black boy who was exercising him .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 60]: The boy lost his seat and fell , and the horse , for a hundred yards , continued his career ; and then it stopped , turned round , and galloped up to the boy , who was still on the ground , and never ceased kicking him till the poor fellow 's brains were scattered in the road .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 8]: Now this was evidently determination for revenge .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 11]: Strasbourg is full of the pomp and circumstance of war .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 40]: Being one of the keys of France , it has a garrison of ten thousand men , and the drums and bands play from morning to evening , much to the delight of the children , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 31]: It is a well-built town , although the houses are most of them of very ancient date , with three stories of _ mansardes _ , in their high-peaked roofs .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 28]: I am rather partial to the Alsatian character ; it is a combination of French , Swiss , and German , which make a very good cross .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 27]: Not being in any particular hurry , I have remained here ten days , and I will say for Strasbourg , that it has many recommendations .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 20]: It is lively and bustling ; the walks outside the ramparts are beautiful , and living is very reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 23]: It has , however , the reputation of being a very unhealthy place , and , I am afraid , with truth .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 27]: It is singular that the beautiful cathedral , although it has already suffered so much by lightning , has not yet been fitted with a conductor .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 34]: There was a meeting of the dignitaries some years back ; some argued in favour and some against it , and it ended in neither party being persuaded , and nothing being done .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 26]: I met another Englishman here , to whom the question might so properly be put , `` What the deuce are you doing here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 51]: An old worthy , nearly seventy , who , after having passed his fair allowance of life very happily in his own country , must , forsooth , come up the Rhine , without being able to speak a word of French , or any other language but his own .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 28]: He very truly told me that he had just begun to see the world at a time that he should be thinking of going out of it .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 37]: He honoured me with the office of interpreter as long as he stayed , and I was not sorry to see him booked for the steam-boat , all the way to the London Custom House stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 44]: There is one remarkable point about the town of Strasbourg , which is , that the Protestants and Catholics have , I believe always , and do now , live in a state of amity which ought to be an example to others .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 42]: In running over the history of the town , I do not find that they ever persecuted each other ; but if they have not persecuted each other , I am shocked to say that they have not spared the Jews .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 33]: At the time of the plague , they accused the Jews of having occasioned it by poisoning the wells , and only burnt alive _ two thousand of them at once _ !
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 22]: I wonder when the lightning struck the cathedral they did not drown two thousand more in the Rhine -- strange Christianity !
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 16]: when smitten by the hand of God , to revenge themselves by smiting their fellow-creatures .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 56]: I had to call upon a Professor here upon some business ; he amused me very much ; he fancied that he could speak English : perhaps he might have been able to do so at one time , but if so , he had forgotten it , but he did not think he had .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 12]: I addressed him in French , and told him my business .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 8]: `` Sir , you speak English ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 34]: -- `` Yes , '' replied I. `` Then , Sir , I tell you that -- '' Then he stopped , pondering and perplexed for some minutes , without saying a syllable .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 60]: `` Speak French , Sir , '' said I ; `` I perceive that you have forgotten a word in our language ; '' and I then put another leading question to him , to which he replied , `` Yes , I recollect that very well , and I -- '' Then another dead pause for the verb .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 84]: I waited a minute in perfect silence , but his memory was as treacherous as he was obstinately bent upon talking English , and then I again spoke to him , and he replied , `` That is true , that you must -- '' Then he broke down again , and I broke up the conference , as I really could not wait until he formed English words , and he was evidently resolved that he would speak in no other language .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 31]: Fortunately , it was no business of my own , but a commission from another , which ended in an omission , which , perhaps , did quite as well .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 45]: This morning I strolled into a small _ debit de tabac _ , to fill my box , and it being excessively warm , was not sorry to sit down and enter into a conversation with the young woman who attended upon the customers .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 14]: I asked her , among other questions , if the shop was hers .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 12]: She replied , `` That she had hired the license . ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 17]: This answer struck me , and I inquired if she could obtain a license for herself .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 33]: She replied , `` No , unless , '' said she , laughing , `` I should marry some old _ estropie _ who has been worn out in the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 37]: She then informed me of what I was not aware which is , that instead of giving pensions to the old militaires , they give them , and them only , the licenses for selling tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 30]: They may either carry on the trade themselves , or may lease out their licenses to others , for as much as they can obtain for it per year .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 26]: I perceive that the Gallic cock now struts on the head of the staff , bearing regimental colours , instead of the eagle of Napoleon .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 20]: They certainly have made the cock a most imposing bird , but still a cock is not an eagle .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 52]: The couplets written upon this change , which was made by Louis Philippe , are somewhat sarcastic : -- `` Le vaillant coq Gaulois , Grattant sur le fumier , A fait sortir le roi Louis Philippe Premier ; Qui par juste reconnoissance Le mit dans les armes de France . ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 26]: Did not sleep very comfortably this night ; there were too many of us in the bed , and all of us bits of philosophers .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 22]: I am a bit of a philosopher myself , and surely fleas can not be considered more than very little bits .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 30]: All French fleas are philosophers , it having been fairly established by a French punster that they belong to the _ secte -- d'Epicure -LRB- des piqueurs _ -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 16]: The English who go up the Rhine to Switzerland generally proceed on the German side .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 24]: Few pass through Alsace or German France , and those who do , take the shortest route , by which they avoid Colmar .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 21]: As I took the longest in preference , I shall in few words point out the features of the country .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 57]: You pass through the valley of the Rhine , which is flat and fertile to excess , the only break in the uniformity of the country being the chain of Vorges mountains , distant about eight miles on your right , and the occasional passage of the dry bed of a winter torrent from the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 9]: The cathedral at Colmar is well worth seeing .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 56]: In outward architecture it is not very remarkable , but its painted windows are quite as fine as those of Strasbourg ; and , in one point , it excels all the cathedrals I have seen , which is the choir , handsomely carved in oak , and with good pictures let into the panels .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 22]: It is in better taste , more solid , and less meretricious in its ornaments , than any I know of .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 30]: It has also a very fine pulpit , the whole of which , as well as the steps and balustrade leading up to it , is of fine marble .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 27]: At Colmar , the eye will be struck with the peculiarity of architecture in some of the old buildings ; it very often is pure Saracenic .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 13]: The roads being excellent , we arrived in good time at Basle .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 31]: Once more in Switzerland ; I have more pleasure now in revisiting a country which has left pleasant reminiscences in my mind , than in passing through one hitherto unexplored .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 10]: In the latter case , I am usually disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 55]: When we revisit those spots in which our childhood was passed , how invariably do we find that the memory is true to what the place appeared to us when children , and hardly to be recognised when our ideas and powers of mind have been developed and enlarged in proportion with our frames .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 4]: Is it possible ?
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 33]: thought I , when I returned , after a lapse of fifteen years , to the house of my childhood out of mere curiosity , for my family had long quitted it .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 22]: Is this the pond which appeared so immense to my eyes , and this the house in my memory so vast ?
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 6]: Why it is a nutshell !
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 49]: I presume that we estimate the relative size of objects in proportion to our stature , and , as when children , we are only half the size of men , of course , to children , everything appears to be twice the size which it really is .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 17]: And not only the objects about us , but everything in the moral world as well .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 30]: Our joy is twice the joy of others , and our grief , for the moment , twice as deep : and these joys and griefs all for trifles .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 42]: Our code of right and wrong is equally magnified : trifles appeared to be crimes of the first magnitude , and the punishments , slight as they were , enough to dissolve our whole frame into tears until we were pardoned .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 33]: all that 's gone , as Byron says -- `` No more , no more , O never more on me , The freshness of the heart shall fall like dew . ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 23]: The cathedral at Basle is nearly one thousand years old , which is a ripe old age , even for a cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 33]: I believe that it is only in Switzerland , and England , and Holland , that you find the Protestants in possession of these edifices , raised to celebrate the Catholic faith .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 16]: I met here a very intelligent Frenchman who has resided many years in the town .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 48]: One of the first questions I put to him was the following : For more than twenty years Switzerland has been overrun with English and other visitors , who have spent an enormous sum of money in the country : what has become of all this money ?
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 10]: He replied that I might well ask the question .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 24]: `` They have no banks in Switzerland ; and , although land exchanges owners , still the money does not leave the country .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 35]: We have here , '' he said , `` a few millionaires , who do lend their money in France upon good securities ; but except these few , they do nothing with it .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 53]: The interest of money is so low , that I have known it lent by one of the rich people at two-and-a-half per cent ; and the Swiss in general , in preference to risking what they can obtain for so small a premium , allow it to remain in their chests .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 31]: There is , at this present moment more bullion in Switzerland than in any other country in Europe , or , perhaps , than in all the countries in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 35]: A Swiss is fond of his money , and he does not use it ; the millionaires that we have here , make no alteration in their quiet and plain state of living . ''
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 35]: He then continued , `` At this moment , those who can afford to spend their money at Basle are retrenching , not from motives of economy , but from feelings of ill will .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 40]: The burghers , who have country seats , to which they retire during the summer , have abandoned them , and if any one wished to settle in this canton , they might purchase them for half their value .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 19]: The reason is , that there has been a difference between the town burghers and the country people .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 17]: The canton wanted a reform bill to be passed , in which they have not succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 57]: They required a more equitable representation -- the country people amount to about forty thousand , the town of Basle to only ten thousand ; and the town of Basle , nevertheless , returns two-thirds of the council , which governs the canton , to which the people who live in the country have raised objections .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 27]: Hence the variance ; and to punish the country people by not spending their money among them , the burghers have abandoned their country houses . ''
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 97]: It may not , perhaps , be generally known , that at the time of the three days at Paris , there was an _ emeute _ in Switzerland , in which the aristocracy were altogether put down ; and in Berne , and some other cantons , the burghers ' families , who , on pretence of preventing the aristocracy from enslaving the count , had held the reins of power for so long a period , were also forced to surrender that power to those who had been so long refused participation in it .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 109]: This was but the natural consequence of the increase of wealth in the country : those who before had remained quiet , feeling themselves of more consequence , insisted upon their rights ; and the usual results were , that the administration of the government changed hands ; but although this might be considered as an advantage gained , still it was but a change , or rather an admission of those who had become wealthy to a participation of the advantages connected with the exercise of authority ; a change beneficial to a few , but to the _ masse _ , productive of no real advantage .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 62]: At Berne , to be a member of the government , is considered as a certain source of wealth , a convincing proof that the interests of those who hold the reins are not neglected ; and that in a republic it is as difficult to insure to the people their legitimate rights , as under any other form of government .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 34]: And so it will be as long as the world turns round ; man is everywhere the same exacting , selfish , preying creature ; and his disposition is not to be changed .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 28]: The Helvetic Republic is , in fact , nothing but an aggregation of petty despotisms -- leniently administered , I grant ; but still nothing but despotisms .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 58]: Those who are in power , or connected with those in power , are the only portion of the community who can amass large sums ; and thus the authority is handed down from one to the other within certain limits , which it but rarely transgresses , something very nearly approximating to the corporations in England .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 41]: In Switzerland , the working man remains the working man , the labourer the labourer , almost as distinct as the Indian castes the nobles are crushed , and the haughty burgh rules with all the superciliousness of vested right .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 18]: I have always held a `` respublica '' as only to exist in theory or in name .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 15]: History has proved the impossibility of its retaining its purity for half a century .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 32]: What the American Republic may be , it is impossible to say , until one has been in the country , and discovered what its advocates have been careful to conceal .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 24]: The Americans had a great advantage in establishing this system of government ; they had nothing to overthrow , nothing to contend with .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 14]: They all started fair , and their half century is now nearly complete .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 24]: Time will prove whether it be possible in this world to govern , for any length of time , upon such a basis .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 33]: Mr Cooper , in his work on Switzerland , is evidently disappointed with his examination into the state of the Helvetic Republic ; and he admits this without intending so to do .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 39]: At Soleure I saw nothing very remarkable , except a dog with a very large goitre on his neck , a sight which I never had witnessed before , during the long time that I wandered through Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 57]: On our way to Berne , to divide the day 's travelling more equally , we stopped at a small village , not usually the resting-place of travellers , and I there met with a little bit of romance in real life , which Sterne would have worked up well , but I am not sentimental .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 71]: The house , to which the sign was the appendage , struck me , at first entering , as not having been built for an _ hotellerie _ ; the rooms were low , but large , and the floors _ parquette _ ; here and there were to be seen remains of former wealth in pieces of _ marquetterie _ for furniture , and clocks of _ ormolu _ .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 32]: There were some old prints , also , on the walls , very superior to those hung up usually in the auberges of the continent , especially in a village auberge .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 27]: When the supper was brought up , I observed that the silver forks and spoons were engraved with double arms and the coronet of a marquis .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 17]: I asked the female who brought up the soup , from whence they had obtained them ?
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 32]: She replied , rather _ brusquement _ , that she supposed they had been bought at the silversmith 's , and left the room as if not wanting to be questioned .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 11]: The master of the auberge came up with some wine .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 24]: He was a tall , fine , aristocratical-looking man , about sixty years of age , and I put the question to him .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 13]: He replied that they belonged to the family who kept the inn .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 19]: `` But , '' said I , `` if so , it is noble by both descents ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 21]: `` Yes , '' replied he , carelessly , `` but they do n't think anything of that beer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 51]: After a few more questions , he acknowledged that they were the armorial bearings of his father and mother , but that the family had been unfortunate , and that , as no tithes were allowed in the country , he was now doing his best to support the family .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 25]: After this disclosure , we entered into a long discussion relative to the Helvetic Republic , with which I shall not trouble my readers .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 57]: Before I went , I inquired his name from one of the servants , and it immediately occurred to me that I had seen it in the list of those twenty-six who are mentioned as the leaders of the Swiss who defeated the Burgundians , and whose monument is carved in the solid rock at Morat .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 23]: Two engravings of the monument were in the rooms we occupied , and I had amused myself with reading over the names .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 9]: I am no aristocrat myself , heaven knows !
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 119]: and if a country could be benefited , and liberty obtained , by the overthrow of the aristocracy , the sooner it is done the better ; but when we see , as in Switzerland , the aristocracy reduced to keeping village inns , and their inferiors , in every point , exerting that very despotism of which they complained , and to free the people from which , was their pretence for a change of government , I can not help feeling that if one is to be governed , let it be , at all events , by those who , from the merits of their ancestors and their long-held possessions , have the most claim .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 45]: Those who are born to power are not so likely to have their heads turned by the possession of it as those who obtain it unexpectedly ; and those who are above money-making are less likely to be corrupt than those who seek it .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 20]: The lower the class that governs , the worse the government will be , and the greater the despotism .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 8]: Switzerland is no longer a patriarchal land .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 22]: Wealth has rolled into the country ; and the time will come when there will be a revolution in the republic .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 39]: Nothing can prevent it , unless all the cantons are vested into one central government , instead of so many petty oligarchies , as at present , and which will eventually tire out the patience of the people .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 57]: I parted from my noble host , and will do him the justice to say that his bill was so moderate , compared to the others paid in Switzerland , that I almost wished that all the inns in the cantons were held by the nobility -- that is , provided they would follow his example .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 22]: His wine was excellent , and I suspect was laid in long before the sign was hung up at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 38]: From Soleure to Berne the whole road was lined with parties of troops ordered in that direction : every man of them was drunk , cheering , and hooting , and hallooing at us as we passed .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 16]: As for the peasant girls they met on the road , I really pitied them .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 8]: At last we have arrived at Berne .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 39]: The Bernese have chosen a most appropriate symbol in their heraldic crests of the bear , and , as if they had not a sufficient quantity inside of their towns , they keep four in the ditch outside .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 15]: What a difference between the _ tables d'hote _ in Germany and in Switzerland !
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 66]: I always prefer the _ table d'hote _ when it is respectable , for nothing is more unpleasant than remaining in a hotel shut up in your own room ; the latter may be more dignified and aristocratic , but it is not the way to see the world ; one might as well be in England , and , indeed , had much better .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 35]: A _ table d'hote _ is a microcosm : you meet there all nations , people of all professions -- some idle , some busy travelling on important matters , others travelling for amusement .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 33]: You are unfortunate if you do not fall in with one clever man at least , and you are quite sure to meet with a fool , which is almost as amusing .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 62]: When I survey a _ table d'hote _ I often think of the calenders who had all come to spend the _ Ramadhan _ at Bagdad , and their histories ; and I have thought that Grattan might make a very good series of Highways and Byways if he could obtain the history of those who meet at this general rendezvous .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 17]: The _ tables d'hote _ in Germany are excellent , properly supplied , and very moderate .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 10]: I can not say so of those in Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 27]: The fondness of the Swiss for money betrays itself in everything , and instead of liberality at the _ table d'hote _ , we have meanness .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 117]: The dinner itself is dearer than in Germany , and not half so good ; but what is the most unexcusable part of our host 's conduct is , that he half serves his guests , as Sancho was served at Barataria ; for instance , as is usually the case , the viands are put on the table and then removed to be carved ; two ducks will make their appearance at one end , two chickens at the other ; are removed , and only one of each is cut up and handed round , the others are sent away whole to be re-dressed for some great man who dines in his own room .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 12]: This has been constantly the case since I have been here .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 11]: It may be asked , why we do not remonstrate ?
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 42]: In the first place , I prefer watching my host 's manoeuvres ; and in the next , although I might get my duck , my host would charge me the whole value of it when he sent in his bill .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 24]: The French Ambassador could not have taken a better step to bring the Swiss to their senses than threatening them with a blockade .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 8]: It would have been ruin to them .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 31]: All the golden harvests would have been over , their country would have been deserted , and their Ranz des Vaches would have been listened to only by the cows .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 38]: As the French minister expected , the councils fumed and vapoured , the officers drew their swords and flourished them , and then -- very quietly pocketed the affront that they might not be out of pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 32]: What a pity it is that a nation so brave and with so many good sterling qualities , should be , as it would appear , so _ innately _ mercenary !
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 16]: There never was a truer saying than `` Point d'argent , point de Suisse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 2]: Geneva .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 16]: Twenty years have made a wonderful alteration in the good sober puritanical city of Geneva .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 28]: The improvement from the new buildings which have been erected is so great , that I could hardly recognise the old city of Geneva in her dress .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 27]: It was an old friend with a new face , for as you enter the town , all the new buildings and streets meet your view .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 38]: As far as it has proceeded -LRB- for there is much left yet to be finished -RRB- , the new portion of Geneva is finer than any portion of Paris , upon an equal space of ground .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 18]: But what surprised me more was to read the _ affiches _ of the _ Comedie _ .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 5]: A theatre in Geneva !
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 21]: When I was last here , a theatre was considered by the good people as criminal to the highest degree .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 25]: I inquired where the theatre was to be found , and it was all true -- there _ was _ a _ theatre _ .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 6]: I then made more inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 11]: It appeared that Mammon had seduced the puritans of Geneva .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 39]: People would not winter at Geneva ; it was so dull -- no amusements ; and as soon as the snow was knee deep at Chamouny , they all ordered horses and flew away to Paris or Italy .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 51]: This affected the prosperity of the good citizens , and they talked among themselves ; but no one of the Town Council would propose a theatre , until it was discovered , by private communication , that they were unanimously agreed , -- then the proposition was started and carried .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 34]: But there are many concomitants attending a theatre , and with the theatre many other innovations have crept in ; so that in a few years Geneva will be no better than Paris .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 14]: When I was last here , Science was the order of the day .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 19]: There were many celebrated men residing in the town , but they are all gone to their forefathers .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 23]: Every branch of Natural History had its _ savant _ ; but , above all , Mineralogy was the most in vogue .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 28]: But Mineralogy has been superseded lately , by her eldest sister Geology , who , although not so pretty , has been declared more interesting and profound .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 14]: Still Mineralogy is the more scientific , although Geology is the more speculative .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 44]: In the education of children , I know no study which so enlarges the mind or gives a habit of research and application , as that of Natural History ; it is amusement and instruction so happily blended , that it never tires .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 38]: Perhaps , the natural cupidity of our natures assists , as the knowledge of every new specimen is for the most part accompanied by the _ possession _ of the specimen and an addition to the collection .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 25]: Moreover , it is a tangible study ; not a nomenclature of things , but each substance is in your hand to be examined .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 26]: The arrangement and classification gives a habit of neatness and order , and children are taught to throw nothing away until its value is known .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 75]: Every child should be made acquainted with Natural History ; and where the specimens can be obtained , and there is room for them , they should be allowed to have a collection , such as minerals , corals , shells , and plants ; for these sciences , amusing in themselves , will gradually impel them to the others more abstruse , as every branch of Natural Philosophy is intimately connected with them .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 23]: The mind will ever be active , and if not interested in rational pursuits , it will fly off to the sensual .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 32]: They have a very excellent plan in Switzerland , in many of the boys ' schools , of all the scholars setting off together on a pedestrian tour of some weeks .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 46]: You will meet a whole school of thirty or forty urchins , with their knapsacks on their shoulders , attired in blouses , trudging away from town to town , and from mountain to mountain , to visit all the remarkable peculiarities of the country .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 26]: This is a most excellent method of relaxing from study , and invigorating the mind at the same time that it is allowed to repose .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 10]: Neither is it so expensive as people would imagine .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 43]: One room will hold a great many school-boys , where the mattresses are spread over the floor : and I saw them make a very hearty breakfast upon bread and cheese and three bottles of wine , among about forty of them .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 29]: Why should not the boys about London set off on a tour to the lakes or elsewhere , in the same way -- every year changing the route .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 28]: They then would see something of their own country , which few do before they are launched in life , and have no time to do afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 26]: I have never seen the lakes ; in fact , I know nothing of my country , although I have scoured the world so long .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 46]: I recollect that my father , who had never seen the Tower of London , was determined every year that he would go and see it ; but he never could find time , it appears , for he died without seeing it at last .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 34]: I did , however , make the observation , that if Geneva had backslided so far as to permit a theatre , there was a feeling that this innovation required being carefully opposed .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 27]: When I was at Geneva before , there was no theatre , but neither were there shops which dealt exclusively in religious tracts and missionary works .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 27]: I observed on this my second arrival , that there were a great many to serve as a check to the increasing immorality of the age .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 28]: I have referred to the change of twenty years , but what a change has been effected in about three hundred years , in this very country .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 16]: Read what took place in these cantons at about the date which I have mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 7]: I have been reading the chronicles .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 49]: Observe the powers assumed by the bishops of that period ; they judged not only men but brutes ; and it must be admitted that there was some show of justice , as the offending parties , being dumb themselves , were allowed lawyers to plead for them .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 27]: How the lawyers were paid , has not been handed down ; and it appears that the judgments were sometimes easier pronounced than carried into execution .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 63]: At Basle , in the year 1474 , it appears that a cock was accused of the enormous crime of having laid an egg : he was brought to trial and condemned to be burnt alive , as a warning to all cocks not to lay eggs , from which it is well known would have been hatched a cockatrice or basilisk .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 11]: In 1481 , cockchafers committed great ravages in the Grisons .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 23]: The Bishop of Coire condemned them all to transportation , and a barren valley was assigned to them as their future residence .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 16]: Whether the cockchafers obeyed his Lordship 's orders , is not handed down to posterity .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 17]: Some years afterwards the river Aar was infested with leeches , who spoilt all the salmon .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 37]: The Bishop of Lausanne excommunicated the whole tribe of leeches in a solemn procession to the river ; and it is dreadful to reflect , that this excommunication remains upon their heads even unto this day .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 46]: Also next door , in France , in 1386 , a sow was arraigned for having eaten a young child , and condemned to be hanged ; to add to the disgrace of her punishment , she was dressed _ in man 's clothes _ .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 22]: About the same period rats were extremely mischievous , and in consequence were summoned to appear before my Lord the Bishop .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 52]: But the rats had a good lawyer , who first asserted that the rats , being dispersed in all the neighbouring villages , had not had time to collect together , and make their appearance ; and that a second and a third summons would be but an act of justice .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 18]: They were , therefore , again summoned after the performance of mass on Sunday in each parish .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 59]: Notwithstanding the three summonses , the rats did not appear in court , and then their defender asserted , that in consequence of the affair having been made so public by the three summonses , all the cats were on the look-out , and therefore his clients dare not make their appearance without all the cats were destroyed .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 18]: The consequence of this difficulty was , that the rats were not punished for contempt of court .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 39]: I have often thought that it is a great pity that agricultural associations in England do not send over a committee to examine into the principle upon which they build and load carts and waggons on the Continent .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 13]: It is a point on which we are very unenlightened in England .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 19]: The waste of wood in the building , and the wear and tear of horses , is enormous .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 21]: We have yet many things to learn in England , and must not be ashamed to profit from our neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 42]: One horse will do more work on the Continent , especially in France and Switzerland , from the scientific principles upon which their vehicles are built , and the loads are put on , than three horses will accomplish in England .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 33]: The inquiries of the committee might be extended much if they went to the Agricultural Association at Berne ; they would discover many things which have not yet entered into their philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 61]: I doubt very much whether the four-course shift of Norfolk , where farming is considered the most perfect , is not more expensive and more exhausting to the land , than the other systems resorted to on the Continent ; that is , that it is not that which will give the greatest possible returns at the minimum of expense .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 55]: I have before observed how very seldom you see a horse out of condition and unfit for work on the Continent ; one great cause must be from their not being racked and torn to pieces by overloading ; and notwithstanding which , the loads they draw are much heavier than those in England .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 27]: I have seen a load of many tons so exactly poised upon two wheels , that the shaft horse neither felt his saddle nor his belly-band .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 23]: One great cause of the ill usage of horses in England is the disgraceful neglect of the public conveyances of all kinds .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 36]: If an alteration was to be made in the regulations of hackney coaches and cabs , we should no longer have our feelings tortured by the spectacles of horse misery which we daily meet with .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 44]: There are plenty of commissioners for hackney coaches , and it is a pity that they had not something to do for the money they receive , or else that they were abolished and their duty put into the hands of the police .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 30]: It may appear a singular remark to make , but I can not help thinking that there would be a good moral effect in the improvement of hackney coaches .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 21]: There are a certain class of people in London , to whom these vehicles are at present of no use .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 50]: I refer to those who have a sufficient independence , but who can not afford to keep their carriages , and who , by the present system of social intercourse , are almost shut out of society , or are inclined to spend more money than prudence would dictate .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 49]: In all other capitals , the hackney coaches are clean and respectable , and in some instances as good as a private carriage ; and besides that , they have a superior kind of carriage for evening parties , which renders the expense of a private carriage unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 59]: There certainly may be some excuse made for those who dislike hackney coaches pulling up at their doors , when we look at the disgusting turn-outs of the London stands , at one time filled with drunken men and women , at others carrying diseased people to the hospital , or dead bodies to the Surgeons ' Hall .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 44]: An English hackney coach is a type of misery , as regards the horses ' outsides , and a _ cloaca _ within ; you know not , when you step into it , whether you are not to encounter disease and death .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 34]: It may be said that there are such vehicles as glass coaches , as they are termed ; but those are only to be hired by the day , and become very expensive .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 38]: The arrangements of these vehicles should be under the police : every coach and cab should be examined , at the commencement of the year , as to its appearance outside as well as its cleanliness inside .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 26]: The horses should be inspected , and if not in fair working condition , and of a certain height , the license should be refused .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 21]: And there should be a superior class allowed at certain stands , who are entitled to demand a higher fare .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 34]: This would not only be a boon to the public , but a much greater one to the poor horse , who would not drag out his lengthened misery as he does now .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 29]: When there was no longer any means of selling a poor brute , to whom death was a release , he would be put out of his misery .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 38]: It would also be a great improvement if the Numbers were put inside instead of out , as they are abroad ; and if _ every _ description of vehicle , if well fitted , were licensed .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 77]: The Hotel des Bergues is certainly a splendid establishment ; many people winter at this hotel in preference to going to a pension , which is , with the best arrangements , disagreeable , for you are obliged to conform to the usages and customs , and to take your meals at certain hours , hungry or not hungry , as if it were a pension of school-boys and girls , and not grown up people .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 29]: The price demanded is the same as at the pensions , viz 200 francs , or 8 pounds per month , which includes everything but wine and fuel .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 8]: The establishment is certainly very well conducted .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 40]: There is a salon , next to the table d'hote , large enough to hold 200 people , well warmed and lighted , handsomely carpeted , with piano , books , prints , newspapers , card tables , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 42]: Indeed , there is everything you wish for , and you are all independent of each other , I was there for two or three days , and found it very pleasant ; I was amused with a circumstance which occurred .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 19]: One of the company , a Russian , sat down to the piano , and played and sang .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 19]: Every one wished to know who he was , and on inquiring , it was a Russian prince .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 43]: Now a prince is a very great person where princes are scarce , as they are in England , although in Russia , a prince , where princes are plenty as blackberries , is about on a par with an English baronet .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 24]: He was a very honest off-hand sort of personage , and certainly gave himself no airs on account of his birth and rank .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 44]: Nevertheless , the English ladies , who were anxious that he should sing again , made a sort of deputation to him , and begged the honour of his highness favouring them with a song , with every variety of courtesy and genuflexion .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 52]: `` Oh yes , to be sure , '' replied his highness , who sat down and played for an hour , and then there was so much thanking , complimentary acknowledgement of condescension on his part , etcetera , and the ladies appeared so flattered when he spoke to them .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 100]: The next day it was discovered that a slight mistake had occurred , and that , instead of being a prince , he had only come to Geneva along with a Russian prince , and that the real prince was in his own room upstairs ; upon which not only he fell himself at least 200 per cent , but , what was really too bad , his singing fell also ; and many who had been most loud in his praises began to discover that he was not even a prince of musicians , which he certainly was .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 57]: We had a good specimen of the independence and familiarity of Swiss servants on the occasion of this gentleman 's singing ; they came into the salon , and mixed almost with the company that they might listen to him ; and had they been ordered out , would , in all probability , have refused .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 42]: An American , with whom I was conversing , observed that in _ his _ country such conduct on the part of servants , notwithstanding what had been said by English travellers on the subject , would never have been permitted .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 10]: I have fallen in with some odd characters here .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 21]: First , what would be considered a curiosity in England -- a clergyman of the Church of England with mustachios !
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 8]: What would the Bishop of London say ?
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 22]: -- and yet I do not see how , if a clergyman choose to wear them , he could be prevented .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 20]: He has good authority to quote ; Calvin wore them , and so , I believe , did Luther .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 16]: Secondly , with a personage who is very peculiarly disorganised when he drinks too much .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 17]: His wife , a most amiable quiet lady , is the party whose character is attacked .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 38]: As soon as Mr -- is in his cups , he immediately fancies that his wife is affected with the liquor , and not himself , and he tells everybody in a loud whisper his important secret .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 80]: `` There now , look at Mrs -- , one of the best women in the world ; an excellent wife and mother , and at most times as lady-like as you would wish to see : but look at her now -- you see she 's quite drunk , poor thing ; what a pity , is n't it , that she can not get over her unfortunate propensity ; but I am afeard it 's no use .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 6]: I 've reasoned with her .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 14]: It 's a sad pity , and a great drawback to my happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 10]: Well , hang sorrow -- it killed a cat .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 15]: Do n't notice what I 've told you , and pass the bottle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 14]: I believe that the English are better acquainted with geography than other nations .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 25]: I have been astonished at the ignorance on this point I have found in foreigners who otherwise were clever and well-informed men and women .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 67]: When the Marquis de Claremont Tonnere was appointed to the office of Minister of the Marine and Colonies , upon the restoration of the Bourbons , a friend of mine had an audience with him , and it was not until a very angry discussion , and a reference to the map , that he could persuade the minister that Martinique was an _ island _ .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 61]: However , in this instance we had nearly as great an error committed in our own Colonial office , which imagined that the Dutch settlement of Demerara upon the coast of South America , and which had fallen into our hands , _ was _ an island ; indeed , in the official papers it was spoken of as such .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 42]: A little before the French Revolution , a princess who lived in Normandy determined upon a visit to her relations in Paris ; and having a sister married to a Polish nobleman , she determined to take Poland in her way .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 20]: To her astonishment , instead of a day to two , her voyage was not completed under four months .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 40]: I have heard it often asserted , that you should not build your house so as to look at a fine prospect out of your windows , but so as to walk to view it at a short distance .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 40]: This may be true with the finest prospects in other countries , but not so in Switzerland , where the view never palls upon the eye , from the constant changing which occurs in the tinting of the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 30]: You may look upon the Lake of Geneva every day , and at no one day , or even portion of the day , is the effect the same .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 37]: The mountains of Savoy are there , and change not their position : neither does the Lake ; but at one time the mountains will appear ten miles nearer to you than they will at another .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 10]: The changing arising from refraction and reflection is wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 19]: Never did I witness anything finer than the Lake of Geneva at the setting of yesterday 's sun .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 31]: The water was calm and glassy as a mirror , and it reflected in broad patches , like so many islands dispersed over it , every colour of the rainbow .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 30]: I can not attempt to describe it ; the effect was heavenly , and all I could say was , with the Mussulman , `` God is great ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 21]: In this world we are so jealous of any discovery being made , that innovation is immediately stigmatised as quackery .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 11]: I say innovation , for improvement is not the term .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 17]: The attempt to improve is innovation , the success of the experiment makes it an improvement .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 10]: And yet how are we to improve without experiment ?
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 45]: Thus we have quackery in everything , although not quite so severely visited as it formerly was by the Inquisition who would have burnt alive him who asserted that the sun did not go round the earth , but the earth round the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 10]: In medicine , quackery is the most frequently stigmatised .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 18]: We know but little of the human frame as far as medicine is to act upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 16]: We know still less of the virtues of various plants which will effect a cure .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 22]: We are acquainted with a few but there are hundreds equally powerful , the properties of which we are ignorant of .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 30]: Could we add to medical science the knowledge of the African negroes and Indians , which they so carefully conceal from us , our pharmacopoeia would be much extended .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 76]: When metallic medicines were first introduced into general use by a physician , an ancestor of mine , and the wonderful effect of them established by the cures , the whole fraternity was up in arms , and he was decried us a quack ; notwithstanding which , the works he wrote have gone through twenty five editions , and the doses prescribed by him are to this day made use of by the practitioners .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 25]: The fact is , that although the surgical knowledge of the day is very perfect , the medical art is still in its infancy .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 23]: Even the quackeries which fail should not be despised , for they have proved something , although they could not be perfected .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 35]: Animal magnetism , for instance : it failed , but still it discovered some peculiar properties , some sympathies of the human body , which may hereafter give a clue to more important results .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 19]: The great proof of the imperfection of medical science is the constant change made by the profession itself .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 28]: One medicine is taken into favour , it is well received every where , until the faculty are tired of it , and it sinks into disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 24]: Even in my time I have seen many changes of this sort , not only in medicine , but in diet , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 17]: What medical men would have thought of prescribing fat bacon for delicate stomachs twenty years ago ?
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 17]: Now it is all the vogue ; breakfast bacon sold in every quarter of the metropolis .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 34]: Either this is quackery , to use their own term , or twenty years ago they were very ignorant , for their patients received positive injunctions to avoid all fat and greasy substances .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 49]: Thus do the regular practitioners chop and change about , groping in the dark : but the only distinction is , that all changes made by the faculty are orthodox ; but any alteration proposed out of the pale of MD , is an innovation and a quackery .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 43]: That we have every where ignorant men , who are _ de facto _ quacks , I admit ; but still that term has been as liberally applied to the attempts of scientific and clever persons to improve the art of medicine .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 15]: Even homoeopathy must not be totally rejected until it has had a fair trial .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 17]: It has one merit in it , at all events , that you take less physic .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 23]: I consider the continual appearance of new quacks on the horizon a sure proof of the low state of our medical knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 17]: The more so as these quacks , although they kill , do effect very remarkable cures .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 7]: Do not regular practitioners kill also ?
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 9]: or rather , do not their prescriptions fail ?
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 16]: If a quack cures , they will tell you that it was by mere accident .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 81]: I suspect that there is more of accident in the practice than the faculty are ready to admit ; and Heaven knows they so change about themselves , that it is clear that they feel no confidence in the little that they do know ; and it is because medicine is so imperfect that every half century we have a new quack , as he is termed , rising up , and beating the regular practitioners out of the field .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 81]: I could tell a story about Morrison 's pills which would surprise not a little , and all the parties are now alive to prove it ; but instead of that , I will tell another which occurred in France , in which a quack medicine had a most wonderful and unusual effect , for it was the means of the _ total destruction of a Banditti _ , who had defied the Government of the country for many years .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 30]: About twenty years ago , -- I am not sure whether he still lives , -- there was an irregular practitioner in France of the name of Le Roi .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 20]: He was , by all accounts , the King of all Empirics , and the Emperor of all Quacks .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 36]: He was more potent than the sovereign , and the _ par l'ordre du Roi _ of Government was insignificant , compared to the _ par l'ordre du Roi _ of this more potent personage .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 18]: He did not publish his cures in _ pamphlets _ , but in large _ quartos _ .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 15]: I have seen them myself , larger in size than an Ainsworth 's dictionary .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 30]: It so happened that an Englishman , who was afflicted with the _ indescribables _ , was recommended from every quarter to buy the medicines of Monsieur Le Roi .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 11]: He did so , and his unknown complaint was removed .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 46]: The consequence was , that the Englishman swore by Le Roi ; and as he was proceeding on to Spain , he took with him a large supply of the doctor 's medicines , that he might be prepared in case his complaint should return .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 16]: All quack gentlemen take care that their medicines shall be palatable ; no unwise precaution .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 14]: I do not know a better dram than Solomon 's Balm of Gilead .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 19]: Old Solomon , by the bye , lived near Plymouth , and was very partial to the Navy .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 11]: He kept an excellent table , and was very hospitable .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 50]: I recollect one day after the officers had drunk a very sufficient quantity of his claret and champagne , being a little elevated , they insisted upon Solomon bringing them out some Balm of Gilead as a finish , and they cleared off about two dozen one guinea bottles .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 61]: The old gentleman made no objection to provide it as often as they called for more , and they separated ; but the next day he sent them all their bills in for the said Balm of Gilead , observing , that although they were welcome to his wine and table , that he must be paid for his medicine .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 4]: But to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 37]: The Englishman travelled with the king 's messenger ; most of his baggage had been sent on , but he would not part with his medicine , and this was all in the vehicle with himself .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 47]: As they passed the Pyrenees they were stopped by the banditti , who dragged them out of the carriage , after shooting the postilion , and made them lie with their faces on the ground , with guards over them , while they rifled the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 72]: They soon came to the packages of medicine , and observing that _ Le Roi _ was upon all the bottles , and knowing that they had possession of a king 's messenger , they imagined that this was some liquor sent as a present to the King of Spain ; they tasted it , and found that , like other quack medicines , it was very strong and very good .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 32]: Each man took his bottle , drank the king 's health , and mirth and revelry took place , until they had consumed all that the Englishman had brought with him .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 79]: Now there is a great difference between taking a table-spoonful , and six or seven bottles per man ; and so it proved , for they had hardly finished the last case before they found that the medicine acted very powerfully as a cathartic ; the whole banditti were simultaneously attacked with a most violent cholera ; they disappeared one by one ; at last the guards could contain themselves no longer , and they went off too .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 24]: The two prisoners , perceiving this , rose from the ground , mounted the horses and galloped off as fast as they could .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 30]: They gave notice to the authorities of the first town they arrived at , not four miles distant , and a large body of cavalry were sent out immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 56]: The effects of the medicine had been so violent that the whole of the banditti were found near to the spot where they had drunk the king 's health , in such a state of suffering and exhaustion that they could make no efforts to escape , and were all secured , and eventually hung .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY NINE .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 2]: Lausanne .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 48]: I recollect some one saying , that in walking out you should never look up in the air , but always on the ground , as , by the former practice , you were certain never to find any thing , although you might by the latter .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 39]: So if you will not enter into conversation , you are not likely to obtain much information ; whereas if you do , you will always chance to obtain some , even from the quarters the least promising .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 31]: I was seated on the box of the carriage , with the Swiss _ voiturier _ -- and asked him , `` If it were not a lucrative profession ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 29]: `` It may appear so to you , sir , '' replied he , `` from the price paid for the horses , but it is not so .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 36]: All we gain , is in five months in the year ; the seven months of winter , we have to feed our horses without employment for them , that is , generally speaking . ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 13]: `` But have you no employment for them in the winter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 21]: `` Yes , we put them into the waggons and draw wood and stone , which about pays their expenses .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 47]: If you are known and trusted , you will be employed to transport wine , which is more profitable ; but that _ voiturier _ who can find sufficient employment for his horses during the winter to pay their keeping , considers himself very fortunate . ''
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 15]: `` When you do make money , what do you do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 28]: `` If we can buy a bit of land we do , but most people , if they can , buy a house , which pays better .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 5]: I prefer land . ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 17]: `` There is not much territory in Switzerland , and land is not often for sale .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 6]: Everybody can not buy land .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 7]: What do the others do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 10]: `` Lock the money up in their chests . ''
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 14]: `` But do you never put your money in the foreign funds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 12]: `` Yes , the rich do and those who understand it .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 34]: We have a few very rich people in Switzerland , but , generally speaking , the people do not like to part with their money , and they keep it by them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 24]: `` I was told by a Frenchman at Basle , that there was a great deal of bullion lying idle in Switzerland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 21]: `` He told you very true , sir ; there is an enormous quantity of it , if collected together .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 16]: Those are Jews , '' continued he , pointing to a _ char-a-banc _ passing .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 9]: `` Have you many of those in Switzerland ?
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 6]: I should think not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 11]: `` No , sir , we do not allow them .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 16]: One or two families are perhaps permitted in a large town , but no more .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 29]: We are a small country , and if we were to allow the Jews to settle here , we should soon have too large a population to support .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 26]: By their customs , they may marry at any age , and they never go into the field , and work at the plough . ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 16]: `` But may not you marry at any age , and when you please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 22]: `` No , sir ; we have good laws in that respect , and it prevents the population increasing too fast .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 46]: I belong to a commune -LRB- parish -RRB- ; if I wish to marry , I must first prove that all my debts are paid , and all my father 's debts , and then the commune will permit the Cure to marry me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 13]: `` All your father 's debts as well as your own ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 17]: `` That is to say , all the debts he may have incurred to the commune .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 51]: Suppose my father had been a poor man and unable to work , the commune would have let him want for nothing ; but in supplying him they would have incurred an expense , that must be repaid by his family before any of the sons are allowed to marry .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 25]: In the same way , when my father died , although he received no assistance from the commune , he left little or nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 16]: The commune clothed and educated me till I was able to gain my own livelihood .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 21]: Since I have done well , I have repaid the debt ; I now may marry if I choose . ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 10]: `` But can not you evade this law ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 22]: Suppose I was at Berne , and wished to marry a woman who belonged to another commune as well as myself .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 24]: The banns must be published three times in my parish , three times in her parish , and three times at Berne . ''
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 11]: `` But suppose you married in a foreign country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 53]: `` If a Swiss marries in a foreign country , and has no debts to prevent his marrying , he must write home to the heads of the commune , stating his intention , and his banns will then be published in the commune , and a license sent him to marry .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 61]: But if , having debts of your own or your father 's , you marry without giving notice , you are then no longer belonging to the commune , and if you come back in distress , you will be conveyed to the confines of the republic , and advised to seek the parish of your wife in her country .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 51]: If you are out of Switzerland with your wife , every child that you have born you must give notice of by letter to the commune , that it may be properly registered ; and if you omit so doing , those children have no claim on their return . ''
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 25]: Such was the result of our conversation , and I repeat it for the benefit of those who occupy themselves with our internal legislation .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 25]: I have been searching a long while for liberty , but I can find her nowhere on this earth : let me be allegorical .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 36]: If all the world are still in love with the name of Liberty , how much more were all the world in love with the nymph herself when she first made her appearance on earth .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 21]: Every one would possess her , and every one made the attempt , but Liberty was not to be caught .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 8]: How was it possible without her destruction ?
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 63]: After being harassed all over the world , and finding that she never was allowed to take breath , she once more fled from her pursuers , and , as they seized her garments , with the spring of the chamois she burst away , and bounding from the world , saved herself in Ether , where she remains to this day .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 16]: Her dress was , however , left behind , and was carried home in triumph .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 27]: It is , however , composed of such slippery materials as its former owner , and it escapes as it pleases from one party to another .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 39]: It is this dress of Liberty which we now reverence as the goddess herself , and whatever is clothed with it for the time receives the same adoration as would have been offered up to the true shrine .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 19]: Even Despotism , when in a very modest mood , will clothe herself in the garb of Liberty .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 25]: Now there is really a sort of petty despotism in these _ free _ cantons , which would be considered very offensive in England .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 24]: What would an English farmer say , if he was told that he could not commence his harvest without the permission of Government ?
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 28]: Yet such is the case in Switzerland , where there is a heavy fine if any one commences his vintage before the time prescribed by the authorities .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 32]: Your grapes may be ripe , and be spoiled ; you have to choose between that alternative , or paying a fine , which reduces your profits to _ nil _ .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 59]: The reason given for this is that there are so many petty proprietors holding half and quarter acres of vineyards mixed together and not separated by a wall or fence , that if one began first he would rob the vineyard of the other -- not arguing much for the Swiss honesty , which has become so proverbial .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 16]: The case of the vintage laws is peculiarly hard this season upon the small proprietors .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 17]: The vintage has been late , and winter has now set in , all at once .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 20]: After weather like summer , we are now deep in snow , and the thermometer below the freezing point .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 29]: Few of the small proprietors have wine-presses ; they have to wait until those who have them have got in their vintage , and then they borrow them .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 36]: The consequence is , that the small proprietors are always the last to gather their grapes , and now they have been overtaken by the weather , and they will lose most of their harvest .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 30]: Had they been permitted to pick their grapes at their own time , they might have used the presses , and have finished before the large vineyards had commenced .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 18]: From the inquiries I have made , it appears that the vineyards of Switzerland pay very badly .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 48]: Land is at a very high price here , in the Canton de Vaud ; 300 or 400 pounds per acre is not thought dear -LRB- 600 pounds have been given -RRB- ; and in the best seasons a vineyard will not yield 10 pounds per acre .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 17]: The wine is very indifferent , and requires to be kept for years to become tolerable .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 46]: But the Swiss are wedded to their vineyards ; and although , if they laid down the land in pasture , they would gain twice as much , they prefer the speculation of the wine-press , which fails at least three times out of four .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 28]: The office of public executioner or Jack Ketch of a canton in Switzerland , as well as in many parts of Germany , is very appropriately endowed .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 38]: He has a right to all animals who die a natural death , with their skins , hoofs , etcetera , and this , it is said , brings in a fair revenue , if attended to .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 21]: Executions are so uncommon in Switzerland , that Jack Ketch would starve if he was not thus associated with death .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 61]: When an execution does take place he is well paid ; they say the sum he receives is upwards of twenty pounds ; but it must be remembered that he does not hang , he decapitates , and this requires some address : the malefactor is seated in a chair , not laid down with his head on the block .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 73]: An execution took place at Berne when I was last in Switzerland ; the criminal , after he was seated in the chair , was offered a cup of coffee , and as he was drinking it , the executioner , with one blow of his heavy sword , struck his head clear off ; for a second or two the blood flew up like a fountain : the effect was horrid .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 14]: An Englishman at Lausanne had a very favourite Newfoundland dog , which died .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 45]: He was about to bury it , when the executioner interfered and claimed the skin ; and it was not until he had submitted to the demands of this official gentleman , that he was permitted to bury his favourite in a whole skin .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 57]: Only imagine , half a dozen old dowagers of Park Lane , whose puffy lap-dogs were dead in their laps , bargaining for their darlings with Jack Ketch , because they wish to have them stuffed ; and Jack 's extortion raising his demands , in proportion to the value apparently placed upon the defunct favourites .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 24]: Talking about lap-dogs , one of the best stories relative to these creatures is to be found in Madame de Crequey 's Memoirs .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 60]: A Madame de Blot , a French dandysette , if the term may be used , who considered her own sex as bound to be ethereal , and would pretend that the wing of a lark was more than sufficient for her sustenance during the twenty-four hours , had one of the smallest female spaniels that was ever known .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 41]: She treated her like a human being , and when she went out to a party , used to desire her lady 's maid to read the animal a comedy in five acts , to amuse it during her absence .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 25]: It so happened that a fat priest , who was anxious for the protection of Madame de Blot , called to pay his respects .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 21]: Madame de Blot made a sign to him , without speaking , to take his seat upon a large fauteuil .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 36]: No sooner had the priest lowered down his heavy carcass into the chair , than he felt something struggling under him , and a little recollection told him that it must be the little spaniel .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 45]: That it was all over with the spaniel was clear , and that if her mistress had discovered his accident , it was equally clear that it was all over with him , as far as the patronage of Madame de Blot was concerned .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 15]: The priest showed a remarkable degree of presence of mind upon this trying occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 38]: He rose himself up a little from his chair and plumped down , so as to give the poor little spaniel her _ coup de grace _ , and then entered into conversation with Madame de Blot .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 22]: During the conversation he contrived by degrees to cram the dog , tail and all , into his capacious coat pockets .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 71]: As soon as it was fairly out of sight , he rose , bade adieu to Madame de Blot , and backed out of the room with as great respect as if he was in the presence of royalty , much to the satisfaction of Madame de Blot , who was delighted at such homage , and little thought why the good priest would not turn his back to her .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 21]: The story says , that the Madame de Blot never could find out what had become of her little dog .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 3]: CHAPTER FORTY .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 2]: Lausanne .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 10]: What a continual strife there is between literary men !
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 33]: I can only compare the world of authors to so many rats drowning in a tub , forcing each other down to raise themselves , and keep their own heads above water .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 65]: And yet they are very respectable , and a very useful body of men , also , in a politico-economical sense of the word , independent of the advantages gained by their labours , by the present and the future ; for their capital is _ nothing _ except brains , and yet they contrive to find support for themselves and thousands of others .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 27]: It is strange when we consider how very few , comparatively speaking , are the number of authors , how many people are supported by them .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 45]: There are more than a thousand booksellers and publishers in the three kingdoms , all of whom rent more than a thousand houses , paying rent and taxes ; support more than a thousand families , and many thousand clerks , as booksellers alone .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 24]: Then we have to add the paper manufacturers , the varieties of bookbinders , printing-ink manufacturers , iron pens , and goose quills .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 14]: All of which are subservient to and dependent upon these comparatively few heads .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 9]: What a _ train _ an author has !
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 8]: unfortunately for him it is too long .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 34]: There are too many dependent upon him , and , like some potentates , the support of his state eats his whole revenue , leaving him nothing but bread and cheese and fame .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 54]: Some French writer has said , `` La litterature est le plus noble des loisirs , mais le dernier de tous les metiers ; '' and so it is , for this one reason , that according as an author 's wants are cogent , so he is pressed down by the publisher .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 16]: Authors and publishers are natural enemies , although they can not live without each other .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 49]: If an author is independent of literature , and has a reputation , he bullies the publisher : he is right ; he is only revenging the insults contumely heaped upon those whom the publishers know to be in their power , and obliged to submit to them .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 55]: Well , every dog has his day , and the time will come when I and others , having swam too long , shall find younger and fresher competitors , who will , like the rats , climb on our backs , and we shall sink to the bottom of the tub of oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 23]: Now , we must drive on with the stream ; the world moves on so fast , that there is no stopping .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 14]: In these times , `` Si on n'avance pas , on recule . ''
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 7]: How the style of literature changes !
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 16]: Even now I perceive an alteration creeping on , which will last for a time .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 12]: We are descending to the homely truth of Tenier 's pictures .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 40]: Every work of fiction now is `` sketched from nature ; '' the palaces , the saloon , all the elegancies of high life are eschewed , and the middle and vulgar classes are the subjects of the pencil .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 7]: But this will not last long .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 22]: It is the satiety of refinement on the part of the public which for a short time renders the change palatable .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 15]: I was yesterday informed that a celebrated author wished to be introduced to me .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 13]: I was ashamed to say that I had never heard his name .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 26]: The introduction took place , and there was a sort of patronising air on the gentleman 's part , which I did not approve of .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 28]: I therefore told him very frankly that I was not aware of the nature of his literary labours , and requested to know what were his works .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 19]: He had _ abridged _ something , and he had written a _ commentary _ upon another thing !
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 19]: -- just the employment fit for some old gentleman who likes still to puddle a little with ink .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 9]: One could write a commentary upon any thing .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 36]: One of my children is singing a nursery song , now I 'll write a commentary on it in the shape of notes : -- Pussy cat , pussy cat , where have you been ?
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 11]: I 've been to London to see the new queen .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 11]: Pussy cat , pussy cat , what did you there ?
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 8]: Hunted a titty mouse under the chair .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 43]: Now for a commentary : -- This simple nursery rhyme is in the familiar style of question and answer , which is always pleasing ; and it is remarkable that two excellent moral lessons are to be found in so few words .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 66]: The child who sings it may be supposed to repeat the words without comprehending their full meaning ; but although such may be the case , still it is most important that even the rhymes put into the infantine lips should afford an opportunity to those who watch over their welfare to point out to them on a proper occasion the instruction which they contain .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 51]: In the first line , the term pussy cat may be considered tautological , as pussy and cat both refer to the same animal ; but if so , it is allowable , as pussy may be considered as the christian name and cat as the surname of the animal .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 26]: It is to be presumed that the cat addressed is young , for it evidently was at play , and old cats do not play .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 20]: Otherwise it would not have been necessary to repeat her name , to call her attention to the question .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 27]: The cat answers in few words , as if not wishing to be interrupted , that she has been to London to see the new queen .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 46]: What queen of England may be referred to , it is impossible to positively ascertain ; but as she says the new queen , we have a right to suppose that it must refer to the accession of a queen to the throne of England .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 59]: We have here to choose between three , -- Elizabeth , Mary , and Anne ; and for many reasons , particularly as the two last were married , we are inclined to give the preference to the first , the word _ new _ having , for the sake of the metre , been substituted for virgin .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 23]: Certain it is that a married woman can not be considered as _ new _ , although she may not be old .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 19]: We therefore adhere to our supposition that this rhyme was composed at the accession of the great Elizabeth .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 112]: And here we may observe , that the old adage `` that a cat may look at the king '' is fully corroborated , for pussy says expressly that she has been to see the new queen , pointing out , that as the sun shines upon all alike , so the sun of royalty , in a well-administered government , will equally dispense its smiles upon all who approach to bask in them ; and that even a cat is not considered as unworthy to look upon that gracious majesty who feels that it is called to rule over so many millions , for the purpose of making them happy .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 54]: It would appear as if the cat continued to play with her ball , or whatever else might have been its amusements , after having answered the first question ; for , on the second question being put , her attention is obliged to be again roused by the repetition of her name .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 23]: She is asked what she did there , and the reply is , that she hunted a titty mouse under the chair .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 31]: There is a wonderful effect in this last line , which fully gives us at once the nature and disposition of the cat , and a very excellent moral lesson .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 28]: The cat calls the mouse a _ titty _ mouse , a term of endearment applied to the very animal that she was putting in bodily fear .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 69]: It is well known how cats will play with a mouse in the most graceful way ; you would almost imagine , from the manner in which it is tossed so lightly and so elegantly , allowed to escape and then caught again , that it was playing with it in all amity , instead of prolonging its miseries and torturing it , previously to its ultimate destruction .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 26]: It is in reference to this peculiar character of the cat , that she is made to use the fond diminutive appellation of titty mouse .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 18]: The moral contained in this last line hardly needs to be pointed out to our intelligent readers .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 65]: A cat goes to court , she enters the precincts of a palace , at last she is in the presence of royalty , not as usual in the kitchen , or the cellar , or the attics , or on the roofs , where cats do most congregate , but actually stands in the presence of royalty ; and what does she do ?
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 85]: Notwithstanding the awe which it may be naturally supposed she is inspired with , notwithstanding the probable presence of noble lords and ladies , forgetful of where she is , and in whose presence she stands , seeing a mouse under the chair , she can no longer control the powerful instincts of her nature ; and forgetting that the object of her journey was to behold royalty , she no longer thinks of any thing but hunting the titty mouse under the chair .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 71]: What a lesson is here taught to the juvenile sexes that we should never attempt to force ourselves above our proper situations in society , and that in so doing we soon prove how much we are out of our place , and how our former habits and pursuits will remain with us , and render us wholly unfit for a position to which we ought never to have aspired .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 2]: Lausanne .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 58]: After all , there is more sympathy in this world than we would suppose , and it is something to find that , in the turmoil and angry war of opinion and interest , nations as well as parties can lay down their weapons for a time , and offer one general and sincere tribute to genius .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 115]: In these exciting times , we hear of revolutions in Spain and Portugal , deaths of crowned men , with indifference , but a shock as astounding as that of an earthquake in the city of Peru was felt throughout Europe when the numerous periodicals spread the unexpected intelligence that the gifted Malibran was no more , that in the fulness of her talent and her beauty , just commencing the harvest ripe and abundant , produced by years of unremitting labour , in which art had to perfect nature , she had been called away to the silent tomb , and that voice which has electrified so many thousands was mute for ever .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 3]: Poor Malibran !
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 22]: she had had but a niggard portion of happiness in this world , although she procured so much pleasure to others .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 29]: A brutal father , from whom she received but blows , who sold her to a dotard , who would have sold her again would she have consented !
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 23]: until her late marriage , toiling for others , without one object in the world on whom to throw her warm affections .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 27]: I remember one day when we were talking of seasickness , I observed that the best remedy was beating the sufferer : she shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 31]: `` No , '' said she ; `` that will not cure it , or surely I should have been cured when I crossed the Atlantic with my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 28]: Those who knew Malibran only as a performer did not know enough of her ; they should have known her in society , and in domestic life .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 48]: She was the _ ne plus ultra _ of genius in a woman ; one moment all sunshine , the next a cloud would come over her expressive features ; changeable as the wind , but in every change delightful , for she never disguised a thought .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 30]: Six weeks -- but six short weeks , and I saw her at Brussels at her country house , whither she had retired after the fatigues of the season .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 7]: How impressive must be her death .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 45]: Had she sickened and died at Brussels , the shock would have been great , for it is a shock when youth , beauty , and talent are so suddenly mowed down ; but she died , as it were , on the stage .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 57]: Admiring and applauding thousands had been listening to her magical powers , thousands more waiting to hear her at the other festivals ; all eyes were upon her , all expectation upon tiptoe , when death , like a matador , comes in , strikes his victim , bows sarcastically to the audience , and retires .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 25]: A thousand sermons , and ten thousand common deaths could not have produced so effective a moral lesson as the untimely fate of Malibran .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 16]: There is but one parallel to it , and the effect of it was tremendous .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 15]: It was that of Mr Huskisson , on the opening of the Manchester Railroad .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 15]: This is the second homily read to the good people of Liverpool and Manchester .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 16]: Peace be with her , although her body is not permitted to be at rest .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 30]: The more I see of the Swiss and Switzerland , the more is my opinion confirmed as to the strongest feature in the national character being that of avarice .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 15]: The country is poetry , but the inhabitants are the prose of human existence .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 44]: Not a chalet but looks as the abode of innocence and peace ; but whether you scale the beetling rock , or pause upon the verdant turf which encircles their picturesque habitations , the demon appears like Satan in the garden of Eden .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 36]: The infant , radiant as love , extends its little hand for money ; the adult , with his keen grey eye , searches into you to ascertain in what manner he may overreach you .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 9]: Avarice rules over the beautiful country of Helvetia .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 22]: The prevailing foible of a nation is generally to be found in the proverbs of the country and of those adjacent .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 36]: The Genevese appear to have the credit of excelling the Swiss generally : they say here , `` Il faut trois Juifs pour faire un Baslois , et trois Baslois pour faire un Genevois . ''
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 16]: Again : -- `` Si un Genevois se jette par la fenetre , suivez le ?
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 7]: Il y aura pour gagner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 32]: It was , however , a very neat answer given by a Swiss to a Frenchman , who asserted that the French fought for honour , and the Swiss for money .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 20]: `` C'est vrai , '' replied the Swiss , `` chacun se bat pour cela que lui manque . ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 87]: The Swiss have abolished titles , they have crushed their nobility ; but human nature will prevail ; and they seek distinction by other channels ; every one who has the least pretention to education or birth looks out for employment under government ; and you can hardly meet with a well-dressed person in the streets who is not a magistrate , inspector , _ directeur _ , or _ employe _ in some way or the other , although the emoluments are little or nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 34]: The question has been brought forward as to trial by jury being introduced , and , strange to say , the majority are opposed to it as not being suitable to the Swiss .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 37]: The reason they give is , that as all respectable people hold offices under Government , and are thereby excused from serving , that there will be nobody but the lower classes to sit as jurors .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 46]: It is very difficult to obtain evidence in a Swiss court of justice ; and this arises from the dislike of the Swiss to give evidence ; as , by so doing , they may make enemies , and their own interests may be injured .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 9]: This is completely the character of the Swiss .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 41]: When I visited Switzerland in my younger days , I used my eyes only , and I was delighted ; now that I visit it again , when years have made me reflect and inquire more , I am disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 50]: The charm is dissolved , the land of liberty appears to me to be a land of petty tyranny in the Government , and of extreme selfishness in the individuals ; even the much-vaunted fidelity of the Swiss seems not to have arisen from any other than mercenary motives .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 43]: Indeed , there is something radically wrong -- however faithful they may be to their employers , or however they may be brave and talented -- in the hearts of those who volunteer for hire and pay to kill their fellow creatures .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 26]: I could not put my trust in such men in private life , although I would in the service for which they have hired themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 22]: Do the faults of this people arise from the peculiarity of their constitutions , or from the nature of their Government ?
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 17]: To ascertain this , one must compare them with those who live , under similar institutions .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 10]: I must go to America , that 's decided .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 8]: SOUTH WEST AND BY WEST THREE-QUARTERS WEST .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 34]: Jack Littlebrain was , physically considered , as fine grown , and moreover as handsome a boy as ever was seen , but it must be acknowledged that he was not very clever .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 32]: Nature is , in most instances , very impartial ; she has given plumage to the peacock , but , as every one knows , not the slightest ear for music .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 19]: Throughout the feathered race it is almost invariably the same ; the homeliest clad are the finest songsters .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 25]: Among animals the elephant is certainly the most intelligent , but , at the same time he can not be considered as a beauty .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 73]: Acting upon this well ascertained principle , nature imagined , that she had done quite enough for Jack when she endowed him with such personal perfection ; and did not consider it was at all necessary that he should be very clever ; indeed , it must be admitted , not only that he was not very clever , but -LRB- as the truth must be told -RRB- remarkably dull and stupid .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 55]: However , the Littlebrains have been for a long while a well-known , numerous , and influential family , so that , if it were possible that Jack could have been taught anything , the means were forthcoming : he was sent to every school in the country ; but it was in vain .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 78]: At every following vacation , he was handed over from the one pedagogue to the other , of those whose names were renowned for the Busbian system of teaching by stimulating both ends : he was horsed every day and still remained an ass , and at the end of six months , if he did not run away before that period was over , he was invariably sent back to his parents as incorrigible and unteachable .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 8]: What was to be done with him ?
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 35]: The Littlebrains had always got on in the world , somehow or another , by their interest and connections ; but here was one who might be said to have no brains at all .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 281]: After many pros and cons , and after a variety of consulting letters had passed between the various members of his family , it was decided that , as his maternal uncle , Sir Theophilus Blazers , GCB , was at that time second in command in the Mediterranean , he should be sent to sea under his command ; the Admiral , having in reply to a letter on the subject , answered that it was hard indeed if he did not lick him into some shape or another ; and that , at all events , he 'd warrant that Jack should be able to box the compass before he had been three months nibbling the ship 's biscuit ; further , that it was very easy to get over the examination necessary to qualify him for lieutenant , as a turkey and a dozen of brown stout in the boat with him on the passing day , as a present to each of the passing captains , would pass him , even if he were as incompetent as a camel -LRB- or , as they say at sea , a cable -RRB- , to pass through the eye of a needle ; that having once passed , he would soon have him in command of a fine frigate , with a good nursing first lieutenant ; and that if he did not behave himself properly , he would make his signal to come on board of the flag-ship , take him into the cabin , and give him a sound horsewhipping , as other admirals have been known to inflict upon their own sons under similar circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 30]: The reader must be aware that , from the tenour of Sir Theophilus 's letter , the circumstances which we are narrating must have occurred some fifty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 49]: When Jack was informed that he was to be a midshipman , he looked up in the most innocent way in the world , -LRB- and innocent he was , sure enough , -RRB- turned on his heels , and whistled as he went for want of thought .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 38]: For the last three months he had been at home , and his chief employment was kissing and romping with the maids , who declared him to be the handsomest Littlebrain that the country had ever produced .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 23]: Our hero viewed the preparations made for his departure with perfect indifference , and wished everybody good bye with the utmost composure .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 50]: He was a happy , good-tempered fellow , who never calculated , because he could not ; never decided , for he had not wit enough to choose ; never foresaw , although he could look straight before him ; and never remembered , because he had no memory .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 109]: The line , `` If ignorance is bliss , 't is folly to be wise , '' was certainly made especially for Jack ; nevertheless he was not totally deficient : he knew what was good to eat or drink , for his taste was perfect , his eyes were very sharp , and he could discover in a moment if a peach was ripe on the wall ; his hearing was quick , for he was the first in the school to detect the footsteps of his pedagogue ; and he could smell anything savoury nearly a mile off , if the wind lay the right way .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 62]: Moreover , he knew that if he put his fingers in the fire that he would burn himself ; that knives cut severely ; that birch tickled , and several other little axioms of this sort which are generally ascertained by children at an early age , but which Jack 's capacity had not received until at a much later date .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 29]: Such as he was , our hero went to sea : his stock in his sea-chest being very abundant , while his stock of ideas was proportionably small .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 50]: We will pass over all the trans-shipments of Jack until he was eventually shipped on board the Mendacious , then lying at Malta with the flag of Sir Theophilus Blazers at the fore -- a splendid ship , carrying 120 guns , and nearly 120 midshipmen of different calibres .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 23]: -LRB- I pass over captain , lieutenant , and ship 's company , having made mention of her most valuable qualifications . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 53]: Jack was received with a hearty welcome by his uncle , for he came in pudding-time , and was invited to dinner ; and the Admiral made the important discovery , that if his nephew was a fool in other points , he was certainly no fool at his knife and fork .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 25]: In a short time his messmates found out that he was no fool at his fists , and his knock-down arguments ended each disputation .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 27]: Indeed , as the French would say , Jack was perfection in the _ physique _ , although so very deficient in the _ morale _ .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 13]: But if Pandora 's box proved a plague to the whole world .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 69]: Jack had his individual portion of it , when he was summoned to _ box _ the compass by his worthy uncle Sir Theophilus Blazers ; who in the course of six months discovered that he could not make his nephew box it in the three , which he had warranted in his letter ; every day our hero 's ears were boxed , but the compass never .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 30]: It required all the cardinal virtues to teach him the cardinal points during the forenoon , and he made a point of forgetting them before the sun went down .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 38]: They attempted it -LRB- and various were the teachers employed to drive the compass into Jack 's head -RRB- his head drove round the compass ; and try all he could , Jack never could compass it .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 45]: It appeared , as some people are said only to have one idea , as if Jack could only have one _ point _ in his head at a time , and _ to _ that point he would stand like a well-broken pointer .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 11]: With him the wind never changed till the next day .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 28]: His uncle pronounced him to be a fool , but that did not hurt his nephew 's feelings ; he had been told so too often already .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 60]: I have said that Jack had a great respect for good eating and drinking , and , moreover , was blessed with a good appetite : every person has his peculiar fancies , and if there was anything which more titillated the palate and olfactory nerves of our hero , it was a roast goose with sage and onions .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 73]: Now it so happened , that having been about seven months on board of the Mendacious , Jack had one day received a summons to dine with the Admiral , for the steward had ordered a roast goose for dinner , and knew not only that Jack was partial to it , but also that Jack was the Admiral 's nephew , which always goes for something on board of a flag-ship .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 118]: Just before they were sitting down to table , the Admiral wishing to know how the wind was , and having been not a little vexed with the slow progress of his nephew 's nautical acquirements , said , `` Now , Mr Littlebrain , go up , and bring me down word how the wind is ; and mark me , as , when you are sent , nine times out of ten you make a mistake , I shall now bet you five guineas against your dinner , that you make a mistake this time : so now be off and we will soon ascertain whether you lose your dinner or I lose my money .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 14]: Sit down , gentlemen , we will not wait for Mr Littlebrain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 31]: Jack did not much admire this bet on the part of his uncle , but still less did he like the want of good manners in not waiting for him .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 22]: He had just time to see the covers removed , to scent a whiff of the goose , and was off .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 23]: `` The Admiral wants to know how the wind is , sir , '' said Jack to the officer of the watch .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 40]: The officer of the watch went to the binnacle , and setting the wind as nearly as he could , replied , `` Tell Sir Theophilus that it is _ South West and by West three-quarters West _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 22]: `` That 's one of those confounded long points that I never can remember , '' cried Jack , in despair .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 21]: `` Then you 'll ` get goose , ' as the saying is , '' observed one of the midshipmen .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 20]: `` No ; I 'm afraid that I sha 'n' t get any , '' replied Jack , despondingly .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 15]: `` What did he say , South West and by North three-quarters East ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 23]: `` Not exactly , '' replied his messmate , who was a good-natured lad , and laughed heartily at Jack 's version .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 10]: `` South West and by West three-quarters West . ''
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 11]: `` I never can remember it , '' cried Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 51]: `` I 'm to have five guineas if I do , and no dinner if I do n't : and if I stay here much longer , I shall get no dinner at all events , for they are all terribly peckish , and there will be none left . ''
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 27]: `` Well , if you 'll give me one of the guineas , I 'll show you how to manage it , '' said the midshipman .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 26]: `` I 'll give you two , if you 'll only be quick and the goose a ` nt all gone , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 33]: The midshipman wrote down the point from which the wind blew , at full length , upon a bit of paper , and pinned it to the rim of Jack 's hat .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 32]: `` Now , '' said he , `` when you go into the cabin , you can hold your hat so as to read it , without their perceiving you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 19]: `` Well , so I can ; I never should have thought of that , '' said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 13]: `` You hav 'n' t wit enough , '' replied the midshipman .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 14]: `` Well I see no wit in the compass , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 20]: `` Nevertheless , it 's full of point , '' replied the midshipman : `` now be quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 65]: Our hero 's eyes served him well , if his memory was treacherous and as he entered the cabin door he bowed over his hat very politely and said , as he read it off , `` South West and by West three-quarters West , '' and then he added , without reading at all , `` if you please , Sir Theophilus . ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 20]: `` Steward , '' said the Admiral , `` tell the officer of the watch to step down . ''
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 10]: `` How 's the wind , Mr Growler ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 14]: `` South West and by West three-quarters West , '' replied the officer .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 24]: `` Then , Mr Littlebrain , you have won your five guineas , and may now sit down and enjoy your dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 28]: Our hero was not slow in obeying the order , and ventured , upon the strength of his success , to send his plate twice for goose .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 38]: Having eaten their dinner , drunk their wine , and taken their coffee , the officers , at the same time , took the hint which invariably accompanies the latter beverage , made their bows and retreated .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 39]: As Jack was following his seniors out of the cabin , the Admiral put the sum which he had staked into his hands , observing , that `` it was an ill wind that blew nobody good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 76]: So thought Jack , who , having faithfully paid the midshipman the two guineas for his assistance , was now on the poop keeping his watch , as midshipmen usually do ; that is , stretched out on the signal lockers , and composing himself to sleep after the most approved fashion , answering the winks of the stars by blinks of his eyes , until at last he shut them to keep them warm .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 19]: But , before he had quite composed himself , he thought of the goose and the five guineas .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 35]: The wind was from the same quarter , blowing soft and mild ; Jack laid in a sort of reverie , as it fanned his cheek , for the weather was close and sultry .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 39]: `` Well , '' muttered Jack to himself , `` I do love that point of the compass , at all events , and I think that I never shall forget South West and by West three-quarters West .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 18]: No I never -- never liked one before , though -- '' `` Is that true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 35]: whispered a gentle voice in his ear ; `` do you love ` South West and by West three-quarters West , ' and will you , as you say , never forget her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 8]: `` Why , what 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 15]: said Jack , opening his eyes , and turning half round on his side .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 22]: `` It 's me -- ` South West and by West three-quarters West , ' that you say you love . ''
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 33]: Littlebrain raised himself and looked round ; -- there was no one on the poop except himself and two or three of the after-guard , who were lying down between the guns .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 10]: `` Why , who was it that spoke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 6]: said Jack , much astonished .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 30]: `` It was the wind you love , and who has long loved you , '' replied the same voice ; `` do you wish to see me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 9]: `` See you , -- see the wind ?
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 17]: -- I 've been already sent on that message by the midshipmen , '' thought Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 16]: `` Do you love me as you say , and as I love you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 4]: continued the voice .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 33]: `` Well , I like you better than any other point of the compass , and I 'm sure I never thought I should like one of them , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 15]: `` That will not do for me ; will you love only me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 28]: `` I 'm not likely to love the others , '' replied Jack , shutting his eyes again ; `` I _ hate _ them all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 6]: `` And love me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 28]: `` Well , I do love you , that 's a fact , '' replied Jack , as he thought of the goose and the five guineas .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 17]: `` Then look round , and you shall see me , '' said the soft voice .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 66]: Jack , who hardly knew whether he was asleep or awake , did at this summons once more take the trouble to open his eyes , and beheld a fairy female figure , pellucid as water , yet apparently possessing substance ; her features were beautifully soft and mild , and her outline trembled and shifted as it were , waving gently to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 42]: It smiled sweetly , hung over him , played with his chestnut curls , softly touched his hips with her own , passed her trembling fingers over his cheeks , and its warm breath appeared as if it melted into his .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 25]: Then it grew more bold , -- embraced his person , searched into his neck and collar , as if curious to examine him .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 60]: Jack felt a pleasure and gratification which he could not well comprehend : once more the charmer 's lips trembled upon his own , now remaining for a moment , now withdrawing , again returning to kiss and kiss again , and once more did the soft voice put the question , -- `` Do you love me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 9]: `` Better than goose , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 41]: `` I do n't know who goose may be , '' replied the fairy form , as she tossed about Jack 's waving locks ; `` you must love only me ; promise me that before I am relieved . ''
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 16]: `` What , have you got the first watch , as well as me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 3]: replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 16]: `` I am on duty just now , but I shall not be so long .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 23]: We southerly winds are never kept long in one place ; some of my sisters will probably be sent here soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 14]: `` I do n't understand what you talk about , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 57]: `` Suppose you tell me who you are , and what you are , and I 'll do all I can to keep awake ; I do n't know how it is , but I 've felt more inclined to go to sleep since you have been fanning me about , than I did before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 14]: `` Then I will remain by your side while you listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 24]: I am , as I told you , a wind -- '' `` That 's puzzling , '' said Jack , interrupting her .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 15]: `` My name is ` South West and by West three-quarters West . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 11]: `` Yes , and a very long name it is .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 17]: If you wish me to remember you , you should have had a shorter one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 48]: This ruffled the wind a little , and she blew rather sharp into the corner of Jack 's eye , -- however , she proceeded , -- `` You are a sailor , and of course you know all the winds on the compass by name . ''
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 27]: `` I wish I did ; but I do n't , '' replied Littlebrain , `` I can recollect you , and not one other . ''
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 48]: Again the wind trembled with delight on his lips , and she proceeded : -- `` You know that there are thirty-two points on the compass , and these points are divided into quarters ; so that there are , in fact , 128 different winds . ''
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 18]: `` There are more than I could ever remember ; I know that , '' said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 9]: `` Well , we are in all 128 .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 22]: All the winds which have northerly in them , are coarse and ugly ; all the southern winds are pretty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 8]: `` You do n't say so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 4]: replied our hero .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 45]: `` We are summoned to blow , as required , but the hardest duty generally falls to the northerly winds , as it should do , for they are the strongest ; although we southerly winds can -- blow hard enough when we choose .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 6]: Our characters are somewhat different .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 58]: The most unhappy in disposition , and I may say , the most malevolent , are the north and easterly winds ; the North West winds are powerful , but not unkind ; the South East winds vary , but , at all events , we of the South West are considered the mildest and most beneficent .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 6]: Do you understand me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 4]: `` Not altogether .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 21]: You 're going right round the compass , and I never could make it out , that 's a fact .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 28]: I hear what you say , but I can not promise to recollect it ; I can only recollect South West and by West three-quarters West . ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 21]: `` I care only for your recollecting me ; if you do that , you may forget all the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 45]: Now you see we South Wests are summer winds , and are seldom required but in this season ; I have often blown over your ship these last three months , and I always have lingered near you , for I loved you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 24]: `` Thank you -- now go on , for seven bells have struck sometime , and I shall be going to turn in .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 6]: Is your watch out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 11]: `` No , I shall blow for some hours longer .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 18]: Why will you leave me -- why wo 'n' t you stay on deck with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 12]: `` What , stay on deck after my watch is out !
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 9]: No , if I do , blow me !
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 40]: We midshipmen never do that -- but I say , why ca n't you come down with me , and turn in my hammock ; it 's close to the hatchway , and you can easily do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 10]: `` Well , I will , upon one promise .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 22]: You say that you love me , now I 'm very jealous , for we winds are always supplanting one another .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 48]: Promise me that you will never mention any other wind in the compass but me , for if you do , they may come to you , and if I hear of it I 'll blow the masts out of your ship , that I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 8]: `` You do n't say so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 10]: replied Jack , surveying her fragile , trembling form .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 38]: `` Yes , I will , and on a lee shore too ; so that the ship shall go to pieces on the rocks , and the Admiral and every soul on board her be drowned . ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 11]: `` No , you would n't , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 6]: said our hero , astonished .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 7]: `` Not if you promise me .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 51]: Then I 'll come to you and pour down your windsails , and dry your washed clothes as they hang on the rigging , and just ripple the waves as you glide along , and hang upon the lips of my dear love , and press him in my arms .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 20]: Promise me , then , on no account ever to recollect or mention any other wind but me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 40]: `` Well , I think I may promise that , '' replied Jack , `` I 'm very clever at forgetting ; and then you 'll come to my hammock , wo n't you , and sleep with me ?
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 12]: you 'll be a nice cool bedfellow these warm nights . ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 41]: `` I ca n't sleep on my watch as midshipmen do ; but I 'll watch you while you sleep , and I 'll fan your cheeks , and keep you cool and comfortable , till I 'm relieved . ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 13]: `` And when you go , when will you come again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 27]: `` That I can not tell -- when I 'm summoned ; and I shall wait with impatience , that you may be sure of . ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 51]: `` There 's eight bells , '' said Jack , starting up ; `` I must go down and call the officer of the middle watch ; but I 'll soon turn in , for my relief is not so big as myself , and I can thrash him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 23]: Littlebrain was as good as his word ; he cut down his relief ; and then thrashed him for venturing to expostulate .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 36]: The consequence was , that in ten minutes he was in his hammock , and `` South West and by West three-quarters West '' came gently down the hatchway , and rested in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 26]: Jack soon fell fast asleep , and when he was wakened up the next morning by the quarter-master , his bedfellow was no longer there .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 38]: A mate inquiring how the wind was , was answered by the quartermaster that they had a fresh breeze from the North North West , by which Jack understood that his sweetheart was no longer on duty .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 51]: Our hero had passed such a happy night with his soft and kind companion , that he could think of nothing else ; he longed for her to come again , and , to the surprise of everybody , was now perpetually making inquiries as to the wind which blew .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 30]: He thought of her continually ; and in fact was as much in love with `` South West and by West three-quarters West '' as he possibly could be .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 36]: She came again -- once more did he enjoy her delightful company ; again she slept with him in his hammock , and then , after a short stay , she was relieved by another .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 101]: We do not intend to accuse the wind of inconstancy , as that was not her fault ; nor of treachery , for she loved dearly ; nor of violence , for she was all softness and mildness ; but we do say , that `` South West and by West three-quarters West '' was the occasion of Jack being very often in a scrape , for our hero kept his word ; he forgot all other winds , and , with him , there was no other except his dear `` South West and by West three-quarters West . ''
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 25]: It must be admitted of Jack , that , at all events , he showed great perseverance , for he stuck to his point .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 56]: Our hero would argue with his messmates , for it is not those who are most capable of arguing who are most fond of it ; and , like all arguers not very brilliant , he would flounder and diverge away right and left , just as the flaws of ideas came into his head .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 27]: `` What nonsense it is your talking that way , '' would his opponent say ; `` why do n't you come to the point ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 10]: `` And so I do , '' cried Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 11]: `` Well , then , what is your point ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 14]: `` South West and by West three-quarters West , '' replied our hero .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 6]: Who could reply to this ?
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 53]: But in every instance , and through every difficulty , our hero kept his promise , until his uncle Sir Theophilus was very undecided , whether he should send him home to be locked up in a Lunatic Asylum , or bring him on in the service to the rank of post-captain .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 50]: Upon mature consideration , however , as a man in Bedlam is a very useless member of society , and a tee-total non-productive , whereas a captain in the navy is a responsible agent , the Admiral came to the conclusion , that Littlebrain must follow up his destiny .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 22]: At last , Jack was set down as the greatest fool in the ship , and was pointed out as such .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 27]: The ladies observed , that such might possibly be the case , but at all events he was the handsomest young man in the Mediterranean fleet .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 11]: We believe that both parties were correct in their assertions .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 30]: Time flies -- even a midshipman 's time , which does not fly quite so fast as his money -- and the time came for Mr Littlebrain 's examination .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 15]: Sir Theophilus , who now commanded the whole fleet , was almost in despair .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 24]: How was it possible that a man could navigate a ship , with only one quarter point of the compass in his head ?
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 34]: Sir Theophilus scratched his wig ; and the disposition of the Mediterranean fleet , so important to the country , was altered according to the dispositions of the captains who commanded the ships .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 44]: In those days , there were martinets in the service ; officers who never overlooked an offence , or permitted the least deviation from strict duty ; who were generally hated , but at the same time were most valuable to the service .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 32]: As for his nephew passing his examination before any of those of the first or second , or even of the third degree , the Admiral knew that it was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 86]: The consequence was , that one was sent away on a mission to Genoa , about nothing ; another to watch for vessels never expected , off Sardinia ; two more to cruise after a French frigate which had never been built : and thus , by degrees , did the Admiral arrange , so as obtain a set of officers sufficiently pliant to allow his nephew to creep under the gate which barred his promotion , and which he never could have vaulted over .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 60]: So the signal was made -- our hero went on board -- his uncle had not forgotten the propriety of a little _ douceur _ on the occasion ; and , as the turkeys were all gone , three couple of geese were sent in the same boat , as a present to each of the three passing captains .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 46]: Littlebrain 's heart failed him as he pulled to the ship ; even the geese hissed at him , as much as to say , `` If you were not such a stupid ass , we might have been left alive in our coops . ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 17]: There was a great deal of truth in that remark , if they did say so .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 13]: Nothing could have been made more easy for Littlebrain than his examination .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 21]: The questions had all been arranged beforehand ; and some kind friend had given him all the answers written down .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 50]: The passing captains apparently suffered from the heat of the weather , and each had his hand on his brow , looking down on the table at the time that Littlebrain gave his answers , so that of course they did not observe that he was reading them off .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 31]: As soon as Littlebrain had given his answer , and had had sufficient time to drop his paper under the table , the captains felt better and looked up again .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 11]: There were but eight questions for our hero to answer .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 32]: Seven had been satisfactorily got through ; then came the eighth , a very simple one : -- `` What is your course and distance from Ushant to the Start ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 25]: This question having been duly put , the captains were again in deep meditation , shrouding their eyes with the palms of their hands .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 11]: Littlebrain had his answer -- he looked at the paper .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 9]: What could be more simple than to reply ?
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 40]: -- and then the captains would have all risen up , shaken him by the hand , complimented him upon the talent he had displayed , sent their compliments to the commander-in-chief , and their thanks for the geese .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 15]: Jack was just answering , `` North -- '' `` Recollect your promise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 10]: cried a soft voice , which Jack well recollected .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 12]: Jack stammered -- the captains were mute -- and waited patiently .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 10]: `` I must say it , '' muttered Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 11]: `` You sha n't , '' replied the little Wind .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 18]: `` Indeed I must , '' said Jack , `` or I shall be turned back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 36]: The captains , surprised at this delay and the muttering of Jack , looked up , and one of them gently inquired if Mr Littlebrain had not dropped his handkerchief or something under the table !
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 12]: And then they again fixed their eyes upon the green cloth .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 57]: `` If you dare , I 'll never see you again , '' cried `` South West and by West three-quarters West , '' -- `` never come to your hammock , -- but I 'll blow the ship on shore , every soul shall be lost , Admiral and all ; recollect your promise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 11]: `` Then I shall never pass , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 17]: `` Do you think that any other point in the compass shall pass you except me ?
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 3]: -- never !
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 7]: I am too jealous for that .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 6]: Come now , dearest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 19]: and the Wind again deliciously trembled upon the lips of our hero , who could no longer resist .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 14]: `` South West and by West three-quarters West , '' exclaimed Jack firmly .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 19]: `` You have made a slight mistake , Mr Littlebrain , '' said one of the captains . ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 16]: _ Look _ again -- I meant to say , _ think again _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 14]: `` South West and by West three-quarters West , '' again repeated Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 9]: `` Dearest , how I love you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 5]: whispered the soft Wind .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 34]: `` Why , Mr Littlebrain , '' said one of the captains -- for Jack had actually laid the paper down on the table -- `` what 's in the wind now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 9]: `` She 's obstinate , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 16]: `` You appear to be so , at all events , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 7]: `` Pray try once more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 6]: `` I have it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 13]: thought Jack , who tore off the last answer from his paper .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 12]: `` I gained five guineas by that plan once before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 26]: He then handed the bit of paper to the passing captain : `` I believe that 's right , sir , '' said our hero .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 23]: `` Yes , that is right ; but could you not have said it instead of writing it , Mr Littlebrain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 26]: Jack made no reply ; his little sweetheart pouted a little , but said nothing ; it was an evasion which she did not like .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 15]: A few seconds of consultation then took place , as a matter of form .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 42]: Each captain asked of the other if he was perfectly satisfied as to Mr Littlebrain 's capabilities , and the reply was in the affirmative ; and they were perfectly satisfied , that he was either a fool or a madman .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 30]: However , as we have had both in the service by way of precedent , Jack was added to the list , and the next day was appointed lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 48]: Our hero did his duty as lieutenant of the forecastle ; and as all the duty of that officer is , when hailed from the quarterdeck , to answer , '' _ Ay , ay , sir _ , '' he got on without making many mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 57]: And now he was very happy ; no one dared to call him a fool except his uncle ; he had his own cabin , and many was the time , that his dear little `` South West and by West three-quarters West '' would come in by the scuttle , and nestle by his side .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 21]: `` You wo n't see so much of me soon , dearest , '' said she one morning , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 9]: `` Why not , my soft one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 3]: replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 14]: `` Do n't you recollect that the winter months are coming on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 9]: `` So they are , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 11]: `` Well , I shall long for you back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 24]: And Jack did long , and long very much , for he loved his dear wind and the fine weather which accompanied her .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 38]: Winter came on and heavy gales and rain , and thunder and lightning ; nothing but double-reefed top-sails , and wearing in succession ; and our hero walked the forecastle , and thought of his favourite wind .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 15]: The North East winds came down furiously , and the weather was bitter cold .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 21]: The officers shook the rain and spray off their garments when their watch was over , and called for grog .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 20]: `` Steward , a glass of grog , '' cried one ; `` and let it be strong . ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 20]: `` The same for me , '' said Jack ; `` only , I 'll mix it myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 12]: Jack poured out the rum till the tumbler was half full .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 28]: `` Why , Littlebrain , '' said his messmate , `` that is a dose ; that 's what we call a regular _ Nor-wester _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 5]: `` Is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 3]: replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 21]: `` Well then , Nor-westers suit me exactly , and I shall stick to them like cobblers ' wax . ''
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 17]: And during the whole of the winter months our hero showed a great predilection for Nor-westers .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 41]: It was in the latter end of February that there was a heavy gale ; it had blown furiously from the northward for three days , and then it paused and panted as if out of breath -- no wonder !
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 26]: And then the wind shifted , and shifted again , with squalls and heavy rain , until it blew from every quarter of the compass .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 21]: Our hero 's watch was over , and he came down and called for a `` Nor-wester '' as usual .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 8]: `` How is the wind now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 13]: asked the first lieutenant the master , who came down dripping wet .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 18]: `` South South West , but drawing now fast to the Westward , '' said old Spunyarn .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 52]: And so it was ; and it veered round until `` South West and by West three-quarters _ West _ , '' with an angry gust , came down the sky-light , and blowing strongly into our hero 's ear , cried , -- `` Oh , you false one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 4]: `` False ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 3]: exclaimed Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 8]: you here , and so angry too ?
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 6]: What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 6]: `` What 's the matter !
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 9]: -- do you think I do n't know ?
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 22]: What have you been doing over since I was away , comforting yourself during my absence with _ Nor-westers _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 15]: `` Why , you a n't jealous of a Nor-wester , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 3]: replied Littlebrain .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 12]: `` I confess , I 'm rather partial to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 5]: this to my face !
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 28]: -- I 'll never come again , without you promise me that you will have nothing to do with them , and never call for one again .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 29]: Be quick -- I can not stay more than two minutes ; for it is hard work now , and we relieve quick -- say the word . ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 20]: `` Well , then , '' replied Littlebrain , `` you 've no objection to _ half-and-half _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 22]: `` None in the world ; that 's quite another thing , and has nothing to do with the wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 47]: `` It has , though , '' thought Jack , `` for it gets a man in the wind ; but I wo n't tell her so ; and , '' continued he , `` you do n't mind a raw nip , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 12]: `` No -- I care for nothing except a Nor-wester . ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 34]: `` I 'll never call for one again , '' replied Jack ; `` it is but making my grog a little stronger ; in future it shall be _ half-and-half _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 6]: `` That 's a dear !
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 21]: Now I 'm off -- do n't forget me ; '' and away went the wind in a great hurry .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 50]: It was about three months after this short visit , the fleet being off Corsica , that our hero was walking the deck , thinking that he soon should see the object of his affections , when a privateer brig was discovered at anchor a few miles from Bastia .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 39]: The signal was made for the boats of the fleet to cut her out ; and the Admiral , wishing that his nephew should distinguish himself somehow , gave him the command of one of the finest boats .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 38]: Now Jack was as brave as brave could be ; he did not know what danger was ; he had n't wit enough to perceive it , and there was no doubt but he would distinguish himself .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 7]: The boats went on the service .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 22]: Jack was the very first on board , cheering his men as he darted into the closed ranks of his opponents .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 62]: Whether it was that he did not think that his head was worth defending , or that he was too busy in breaking the heads of others to look after his own this is certain , that a tomahawk descended upon it with such force as to bury itself in his skull -LRB- and his was a thick skull too -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 26]: The privateer 's men were overpowered by numbers , and then our hero was discovered , under a pile of bodies , still breathing heavily .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 28]: He was hoisted on board , and taken into his uncle 's cabin : the surgeon shook his head when he had examined that of our hero .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 50]: `` It must have been a most tremendous blow , '' said he to the Admiral , `` to have penetrated -- '' `` It must have been , indeed , '' replied the Admiral , as the tears rolled down his cheeks ; for he loved his nephew .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 44]: The surgeon having done all that his art would enable him , left the cabin to attend to the others who were hurt ; the Admiral also went on the quarter-deck , walking to and fro for an hour in a melancholy mood .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 17]: He returned to the cabin , and bent over his nephew ; Jack opened his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 19]: `` My dear fellow , '' said the Admiral , `` how 's your head now ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 31]: _ South West and by West three-quarters West _ , '' faintly exclaimed our hero , constant in death , as he turned a little on one side and expired .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 53]: It was three days afterwards , as the fleet were on a wind , making for Malta , that the bell of the ship tolled , and a body , sewed up in a hammock and covered with the Union Jack , was carried to the gangway by the Admiral 's bargemen .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 112]: It had been a dull cloudy day , with little wind ; the hands were turned up , the officers and men stood uncovered ; the Admiral in advance with his arms folded , as the chaplain read the funeral service over the body of our hero , -- and as the service proceeded , the sails flapped , for the wind had shifted a little ; a motion was made , by the hand of the officer of the watch , to the man at the helm to let the ship go off the wind , that the service might not be disturbed , and a mizzling soft rain descended .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 50]: The wind had shifted to our hero 's much loved _ point _ , his fond mistress had come to mourn over the loss of her dearest , and the rain that descended were the tears which she shed at the death of her handsome but not over-gifted lover .

Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 15]: On the table lay a note ; it was an invitation from the Marquesa .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 45]: I threw it on one side and took up a book , one that required reflection and deep examination ; but the rattling of the wheels of the carriages as they whirled along past my window would not permit me to command my attention .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 34]: I threw down the book ; and taking a chair at the window , watched the carriages full of masks as they rolled past , apparently so eager in the pursuit of pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 7]: I was in a cynical humour .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 35]: What fools , thought I , and yet what numbers will be there ; there will be an immense crowd ; and what can be the assignation which Albert said was of such consequence ?
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 26]: Such was my reflection for the next ten minutes , during which at least fifty carriages and other vehicles had passed in review before me .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 31]: And then I thought of the princely fortune of the Marquesa , the splendid palazzo at which the masquerade was given , and the brilliant scene which would take place .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 16]: `` The Grand Duke is to be there , and everybody of distinction in Lucca .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 10]: I have a great mind to go myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 6]: A few minutes more elapsed .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 18]: I felt that I was lonely , and I made up my mind that I would go .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 10]: I turned from the window and rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 33]: `` Antonio , see if you can procure me a domino , a dark-coloured one if possible ; and tell Carlo to bring the carriage round as soon as he can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 20]: Antonio departed , and was away so long that the carriage was at the door previous to his return .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 40]: `` Signor , I am sorry , very , very sorry ; but I have run to every shop in Lucca , and there is nothing left but a sky-blue domino , which I have brought with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 3]: `` Sky-blue !
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 31]: why , there will not be two sky-blue dominos in the whole masquerade : I might as well tell my name at once , I shall be so conspicuous . ''
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 30]: `` You are as well hidden under a sky-blue domino as a black one , Signor , if you choose to keep your own secrets , '' observed Antonio .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 15]: `` Very true , '' replied I , `` give me my mask . ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 31]: Enshrouding myself in the sky-blue domino , I went down the stairs , threw myself into the carriage , and directed Carlo to drive to the palazzo of the Marquesa .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 17]: In half an hour we arrived at the entrance-gates of the Marquesa 's superb country seat .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 54]: From these gates to the palazzo , a sweep of several hundred yards , the avenue though which the driver passed was loaded with variegated lamps , hanging in graceful festoons from branch to branch ; and the notes of music from the vast entrance-hall of the palazzo floated through the still air .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 43]: When I arrived at the area in front of the flight of marble steps which formed the entrance of the palazzo , I was astonished at the magnificence , the good taste , and the total disregard of expense which were exhibited .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 101]: The palazzo itself appeared like the fabric built of diamonds and precious stones by the genii who obeyed the ring and lamp of Aladdin , so completely was its marble front hidden with a mass of many-coloured lamps , the reflection from whose galaxy of light rendered it bright as day for nearly one hundred yards around ; various mottoes and transparencies were arranged in the walks nearest to the palazzo ; and then all was dark , rendered still darker from the contrast with the flood of light which poured to a certain distance from the scene of festivity .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 45]: Groups of characters and dominos were walking to and fro in every direction ; most of them retracing their steps when they arrived at the sombre walks and alleys , some few pairs only continuing their route where no listeners were to be expected .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 28]: This is an animating scene , thought I , as the carriage stopped , and I am not sorry that I have made one of the party .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 32]: As soon as I had descended , I walked up the flight of marble steps which led to the spacious hall in which the major part of the company were collected .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 50]: The music had , for a moment , ceased to play ; and finding that the perfume of the exotics which decorated the hall was too powerful , I was again descending the steps , when my hand was seized and warmly pressed by one in a violet-coloured domino .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 18]: `` I am so glad that you are come ; we were afraid that you would not .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 23]: I will see you again directly , '' said the domino ; and it then fell back into the crowd and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 16]: It immediately occurred to me that it was my friend Albert who spoke to me .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 18]: `` Very odd , '' thought I , `` that he should have found me out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 26]: And again I fell into the absurdity of imagining that because I had put on a conspicuous domino , I was sure to be recognised .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 8]: `` What can he want with me ?
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 16]: We must be in some difficulty , some unexpected one , that is certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 39]: Such were my reflections as I slowly descended the steps , occasionally pausing for a moment on one , as I was lost in conjecture , when I was again arrested by a slight slap on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 33]: I looked round : it was a female ; and although she wore her half-mask , it was evident that she was young , and I felt convinced that she was beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 21]: `` Not a word , '' whispered she , putting her finger to her lip ; `` follow me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 12]: Of course I followed : who could resist such a challenge ?
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 30]: `` You are late , '' said the incognito , when we had walked so far away from the palazzo as to be out of hearing of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 29]: `` I did not make up my mind to come until an hour ago , '' replied I. `` I was so afraid that you would not come .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 11]: Albert was sure that you would , he was right .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 13]: He told me just now that he had spoken to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 9]: was that Albert in the rose-coloured domino ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 18]: `` Yes ; but I dare not stay now -- my father will be looking for me .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 7]: Albert is keeping him in conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 11]: In half an hour he will speak to you again .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 10]: Has he explained to you what has occurred ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 6]: `` Not one word . ''
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 56]: `` If he has not had time -- and I doubt if he will have , as he must attend to the preparations -- I will write a few lines , if I can , and explain , or at least tell you what to do ; but I am so harassed , so frightened !
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 7]: We do indeed require your assistance .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 3]: Adieu ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 10]: So saying , the fair unknown tripped hastily away .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 9]: `` What the deuce is all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 10]: muttered I , as I watched her retreating figure .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 18]: `` Albert said that he had an appointment , but he did not make me his confidant .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 16]: It appears that something which has occurred this night occasions him to require my assistance .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 9]: Well , I will not fail him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 82]: For about half an hour I sauntered up and down between the lines of orange-trees which were dressed up with variegated lamps , and shed their powerful fragrance in the air : I ruminated upon what might be my friend 's intentions , and what might be the result of an intrigue carried on in a country where the stiletto follows Love so close through all the mazes of his labyrinth , when I was again accosted by the violet-coloured domino .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 4]: `` Hist ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 23]: whispered he , looking carefully round as he thrust a paper into my hand ; `` read this after I leave you .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 11]: In one hour from this be you on this spot .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 5]: Are you armed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 31]: `` No , '' replied I ; `` but Albert -- '' `` You may not need it ; but nevertheless take this , -- I can not wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 18]: So saying , he put a stiletto into my hand , and again made a hasty retreat .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 75]: It had been my intention to have asked Albert what was his plan , and further why he did not speak English instead of Italian , as he would have been less liable to be understood if overheard by eavesdroppers ; but a little reflection told me that he was right in speaking Italian , as the English language overheard would have betrayed him , or at least have identified him as a foreigner .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 8]: `` A very mysterious affair this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 19]: thought I ; `` but , however , this paper will , I presume , explain the business .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 57]: That there is a danger in it is evident , or he would not have given me this weapon ; '' and I turned the stiletto once or twice to the light of the lamp next to me , examining its blade , when , looking up , I perceived a black domino standing before me .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 22]: `` It is sharp enough , I warrant , '' said the domino ; `` you have but to strike home .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 20]: I have been waiting for you in the next walk , which I thought was to be our rendezvous .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 12]: Here is a paper which you will fasten to his dress .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 17]: I will contrive that he shall be here in an hour hence by a pretended message .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 16]: After his death you will put this packet into his bosom ; -- you understand .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 27]: Fail not : remember the one thousand sequins ; and here is my ring , which I will redeem as soon as your work is done .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 7]: The others will soon be here .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 7]: The pass-word is ` Milano . '
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 8]: But I must not be seen here .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 5]: Why a sky-blue domino ?
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 31]: it is too conspicuous for escape ; '' and as I received from him the packet and ring , the black domino retreated through the orange grove which encircled us .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 28]: I was lost in amazement : there I stood with my hands full -- two papers , a packet , a stiletto , and a diamond ring !
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 26]: `` Well , '' thought I , `` this time I am most assuredly taken for somebody else -- for a bravo I am not .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 15]: There is some foul work going on , which perhaps I may prevent . ''
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 8]: `` But why a sky-blue domino ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 8]: I may well ask the same question .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 20]: `` Why the deuce did I come here in a sky-blue domino , or any domino at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 110]: I put the ring on my finger , the stiletto and packet in my bosom , and then hastened away to the garden on the other side of the palazzo , that I might read the mysterious communication put into my hands by my friend Albert ; and as I walked on , my love for admiration led me away so as to find myself pleased with the mystery and danger attending upon the affair ; and feeling secure , now that I had a stiletto in my bosom for my defence , I resolved that I would go right through it until the whole affair should be unravelled .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 18]: I walked on till I had gained the last lamp on the other side of the palazzo .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 22]: I held up to its light the mysterious paper : it was in Italian , and in a woman 's handwriting .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 26]: `` We have determined upon flight , as we can not hope for safety here , surrounded as we are by stilettoes on every side .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 39]: We feel sure of pardon as soon as the papers which Albert received by this day 's mail , and which he will entrust to you when you meet again , are placed in my father 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 10]: We must have your assistance in removing our treasure .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 45]: Our horses are all ready , and a few hours will put us in safety ; but we must look to you for following us in your carriage , and conveying for me what would prove so great an incumbrance to our necessary speed .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 18]: When Albert sees you again , he will be able to tell you where it is deposited .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 16]: Follow us quick , and you will always have the gratitude of -- `` VIOLA .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 3]: `` PS .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 25]: I write in great haste , as I can not leave my father 's side for a moment without his seeking for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 7]: `` What can all this mean ?
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 12]: Albert told me of no papers by this day 's mail .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 2]: Viola !
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 9]: I never heard him mention such a name .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 16]: He said to me , ` Read this , and all will be explained . '
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 16]: I 'll be hanged if I am not as much in the dark as ever !
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 13]: Follow them in my carriage with the treasure -- never says where !
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 13]: I presume he is about to run off with some rich heiress .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 5]: Confound this sky-blue domino !
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 30]: Here I am with two papers , a packet , a stiletto , and a ring ; I am to receive another packet , and am to convey treasure .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 41]: Well , it must solve itself -- I will back to my post ; but first let me see what is in this paper which I am to affix upon the man 's dress after I have killed him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 23]: I held it up to the light , and read , in capital letters , `` The reward of a traitor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 37]: `` Short and pithy , '' muttered I , as I replaced it in my pocket : `` now I 'll back to the place of assignation , for the hour must be nearly expired . ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 27]: As I retraced my steps , I again reverted to the communication of Viola -- `` Surrounded as we are by stilettoes on every side ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 40]: Why , surely Albert can not be the person that I am required by the black domino to despatch ; and yet it may be so -- and others are to join me here before the hour is passed .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 27]: A thought struck me : whoever the party might be whose life was to be taken , whether Albert or another , I could save him .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 12]: My reverie was again broken by a tap on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 5]: `` Am I right ?
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 6]: What is the pass-word ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 4]: `` Milano ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 7]: replied I , in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 20]: `` All 's right , then -- Giacomo and Tomaso are close by -- I will fetch them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 24]: The man turned away , and in a minute re-appeared with two others , bending as they forced their way under the orange-trees .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 14]: `` Here we all are , Felippo , '' whispered the first . ''
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 13]: _ He _ is to be here in a few minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 4]: `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 21]: replied I , in a whisper , and holding up to them the brilliant ring which sparkled on my finger .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 28]: `` Ah , Signor , I cry your mercy , '' replied the man , in a low voice ; `` I thought it was Felippo . ''
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 14]: `` Not so loud , '' replied I , still in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 10]: `` All is discovered , and Felippo is arrested .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 5]: You must away immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 8]: You shall hear from me to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 5]: `` Corpo di Bacco !
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 4]: Where , Signor ?
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 6]: at the old place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 11]: `` Yes away -- now , and save yourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 18]: In a few seconds the desperate men disappeared among the trees , and I was left alone .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 32]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ `` Slaves of the Ring , you have done my bidding at all events , this time , '' thought I , and I looked at the ring more attentively .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 12]: It was a splendid solitaire diamond , worth many hundred crowns .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 14]: `` Will you ever find your way back to our lawful owner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 17]: was the question in my mind when Albert made his appearance in his violet-coloured domino . ''
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 21]: 'T was imprudent of you to send me the paper by the black domino , '' said he , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 15]: `` Did I not tell you that I would be here in an hour ?
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 8]: We have not a moment to spare .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 9]: Follow me quickly , and be silent . ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 29]: I followed -- the paper which Albert referred to needed no explanation ; it was , indeed , the only part of the whole affair which I comprehended .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 16]: He led the way to about three hundred yards of the path through the wood .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 23]: `` There , '' said he , `` in that narrow avenue , you will find my faithful negro with his charge .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 14]: He will not deliver it up without you show him this ring . ''
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 9]: And Albert put a ring upon my finger .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 49]: `` But , Albert , '' -- my mind misgave me -- Albert never had a faithful negro to my knowledge ; it must be some other person who had mistaken me for his friend , -- `` I am afraid , '' continued I -- `` Afraid !
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 9]: -- let me not hear you say that .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 13]: You never yet knew fear , '' said he , interrupting me .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 11]: `` What have you to fear between this and Pisa ?
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 11]: Your own horses will take you there in three hours .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 12]: But here 's the packet , which you must deliver yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 26]: Now that you know where the negro is , return to the palazzo , deliver it into his own hands , requesting his immediate perusal .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 15]: After that do not wait a moment , but hasten here to your charge .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 14]: While the Grand Duke is reading it I will escape with Viola . ''
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 17]: `` I really can not understand all this , '' said I , taking the packet .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 11]: `` All will be explained when we meet at Pisa .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 23]: Away , now ; to the Grand Duke -- I will go to the negro and prepare him for your coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 71]: `` But allow me -- '' `` Not a word more , if you love me , '' replied the violet-coloured domino , who , I was now convinced , was not Albert ; it was not his voice -- there was a mystery and a mistake ; but I had become so implicated that I felt I could not retreat without sacrificing the parties , whoever they might be .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 37]: `` Well , '' said I , as I turned back to the palazzo , `` I must go on now ; for , as a gentleman and man of honour , I can not refuse .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 26]: I will give the packet to the Grand Duke , and I will also convey his treasure to Pisa , Confound this sky-blue domino ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 15]: As I returned to the palazzo , I was accosted by the black domino .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 4]: `` Milano ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 10]: replied I. `` Is all right , Felippo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 7]: said he , in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 12]: `` All is right , Signor , '' was my answer .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 6]: `` Where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 11]: I pointed with my finger to a clump of orange-trees .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 8]: `` And the paper and packet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 5]: I nodded my head .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 14]: `` Then you had better away -- I will see you to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 9]: `` At the old place , Signor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' replied the black domino , cutting into a cross-path , and disappearing .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 38]: I arrived at the palazzo , mounted the steps , forced my way through the crowd , and perceived the Grand Duke in an inner saloon , the lady who had accosted me leaning on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 19]: It then occurred to me that the Grand Duke had an only daughter , whose name was Viola .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 34]: I entered the saloon , which was not crowded , and walking boldly up to the Grand Duke , presented the packet , requesting that his Highness would give it his immediate attention .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 25]: I then bowed , and hastened away , once more passed through the thronged hall , and gained the marble steps of the palazzo .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 7]: `` Have you given it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 8]: said a low voice close to me .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 32]: `` I have , '' replied I ; `` but , Signor -- '' `` Not a word , Carlo : hasten to the wood , if you love me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 15]: And the violet-coloured domino forced his way into the crown which filled the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 33]: `` Now for my journey to Pisa , '' said I. `` Here I am , implicated in high treason , perhaps , in consequence of my putting on a sky-blue domino .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 10]: Well , there 's no help for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 28]: In a few minutes I had gained the narrow avenue , and having pursued it about fifty yards , perceived the glaring eyes of the crouched negro .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 22]: By the starlight , I could just distinguish that he had a basket , or something like one , before him .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 10]: `` What do you come for , Signor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 9]: said the negro , rising on his feet .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 19]: `` For what has been placed under your charge ; here is the ring of your master . ''
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 23]: The negro put his fingers to the ring and felt it , that he might recognise it by its size and shape .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 24]: `` Here it is , Signor , '' said he , lifting up the basket gently , and putting it into my arms .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 12]: It was not heavy , although somewhat cumbrous from its size .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 3]: `` Hark !
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 9]: Signor , there is confusion in the palazzo .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 15]: You must be quick , and I must not be seen with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 11]: And away darted the negro like lightning through the bushes .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 25]: I also hastened away with the basket -LRB- contents unknown -RRB- , for it appeared to me that affairs were coming to a crisis .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 12]: I heard people running different ways , and voices approaching me .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 37]: When I emerged from the narrow avenue , I perceived several figures coming down the dark walk at a rapid pace , and , seized with a sort of panic , I took to my heels .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 15]: I soon found that they were in pursuit , and I increased my speed .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 43]: In the gloom of the night , I unfortunately tripped over a stone , and fell with the basket to the ground ; and then the screams from within informed me that the treasure intrusted to my safe keeping was a child .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 67]: Fearful that it was hurt , and forgetting , for the time , the danger of being captured , I opened the lid , and examined its limbs , while I tried to pacify it ; and while I was sitting down in my sky-blue domino , thus occupied in hushing a baby , I was seized by both shoulders , and found myself a prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 12]: `` What is the meaning of this rudeness , Signors ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 9]: said I , hardly knowing what to say .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 16]: `` You are arrested by order of the Grand Duke , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 5]: `` I am arrested !
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 3]: -- why ?
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 7]: -- I am an Englishman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 21]: `` That makes no difference ; the orders are to arrest all found in the garden in sky-blue dominos . ''
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 7]: `` Confound the sky-blue domino ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 10]: thought I , for the twentieth time at least .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 23]: `` Well , Signora , I will attend you ; but first let me try to pacify this poor frightened infant . ''
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 24]: `` Strange that he should be found running away with a child at the same time that the Lady Viola has disappeared ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 6]: observed one of my captors .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 35]: `` You are right , Signora , '' replied I ; `` it is very strange ; and what is more strange is , that I can no more explain it than you can .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 8]: I am now ready to accompany you .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 18]: Oblige me by one of you carrying the basket while I take care of the infant . ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 11]: In a few minutes we had arrived at the palazzo .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 32]: I had retained my mask , and I was conducted through the crowd into the saloon into which I had previously entered when I delivered the packet to the Grand Duke .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 5]: `` There he is !
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 5]: there he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 9]: was buzzed through the crowd in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 4]: `` Holy Virgin !
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 8]: he has a child in his arms !
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 6]: _ Bambino bellissimo _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 39]: Such were the exclamations of wonder and surprise as they made a lane for my passage , and I was in the presence of the Grand Duke , who appeared to be in a state of great excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 8]: `` It is the same person ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 4]: exclaimed the Duke .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 3]: `` Confess !
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 21]: are you not the party who put a packet into my hands about a quarter of an hour since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 22]: `` I am the person , your Highness , '' replied I , as I patted and soothed the frightened child .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 7]: `` Who gave it you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 13]: `` May it please your Highness , I do not know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 7]: `` What child is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 13]: `` May it please your Highness , I do not know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 8]: `` Where did you get it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 10]: `` Out of that basket , your Highness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 8]: `` Who gave you the basket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 13]: `` May it please your Highness , I do not know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 7]: `` You are trifling with me .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 6]: Let him be searched . ''
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 24]: `` May it please your Highness , I will save them that trouble , if one of the ladies will take the infant .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 25]: I have received a great many presents this evening , all of which I will have the honour of displaying before your Highness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 32]: One of the ladies held out her arms to the infant , who immediately bent from mine toward her , naturally clinging to the other sex as its friend in distress .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 39]: `` In the first place , your Highness , I have this evening received this ring , '' taking off my finger the one given by the party in a violet-coloured domino , and presenting it to him .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 6]: `` And from whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 9]: said his Highness , instantly recognising the ring .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 12]: `` May it please your Highness , I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 25]: I have also received another ring , your Highness , '' continued I , taking off the ring given me by the black domino .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 8]: `` And who gave you this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 9]: interrogated the Duke , again evidently recognising it .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 12]: `` May it please your Highness , I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 19]: Also , this stiletto , but from whom , I must again repeat , I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 18]: Also , this packet , with directions to put it into a dead man 's bosom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 20]: `` And you are , I presume , equally ignorant of the party who gave it to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 29]: `` Equally so , your Highness ; as ignorant as I am of the party who desired me to present you with the other packet which I delivered .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 22]: Here is also a paper I was desired to pin upon a man 's clothes after I had assassinated him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 13]: -- and to this , also , you plead total ignorance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 23]: `` I have but one answer to give to all , your Highness , which is , I do not know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 24]: `` Perhaps , Sir , you do not know your own name or profession , '' observed his Highness , with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 21]: `` Yes , your Highness , '' replied I , taking off my mask , `` that I do know .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 19]: I am an Englishman , and , I trust , a gentleman , and a man of honour .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 25]: My name is Herbert ; and I have more than once had the honour to be a guest at your Highness 's entertainments . ''
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 13]: `` Signor , I recognise you , '' replied the Grand Duke .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 16]: `` Let the room be cleared -- I must speak with this gentleman alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 59]: When the company had quitted the saloon , I entered into a minute detail of the events of the evening , to which his Highness paid the greatest attention ; and when I had finished , the whole mystery was unravelled to me by him , and with which I will now satisfy the curiosity of my readers .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 42]: The Grand Duke had one daughter , by name Viola , whom he had wished to marry to Rodolph , Count of Istria ; but Viola had met with Albert , Marquis of Salerno , and a mutual attachment had ensued .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 35]: Although the Grand Duke would not force his daughter 's wishes and oblige her to marry Count Rodolph , at the same time he would not consent to her espousals with the Marquis Albert .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 31]: Count Rodolph had discovered the intimacy between Viola and the Marquis of Salerno , and had made more than one unsuccessful attempt to get rid of his rival by assassination .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 79]: After some time , a private marriage with the marquis had been consented to by Viola ; and a year afterwards the Lady Viola retired to the country , and without the knowledge , or even suspicions , of her father , had given birth to a male child , which had been passed off as the offspring of one of the ladies of the court who was married , and to whom the secret had been confided .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 35]: At this period the secret societies , especially the _ Carbonari _ , had become formidable in Italy , and all the crowned heads and reigning princes were using every exertion to suppress them .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 33]: Count Rodolph was at the head of these societies , having joined them to increase his power , and to have at his disposal the means of getting rid of his rival .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 49]: Of this the Marquis of Salerno had received intimation , and for some time had been trying to obtain proof against the count ; for he knew that if once it was proved , Count Rodolph would never be again permitted to appear in the state of Lucca .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 31]: On the other hand , Count Rodolph had been making every arrangement to get rid of his rival , and had determined that it should be effected at this masquerade .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 113]: The Marquis of Salerno had notice given him of this intention , and also had on that morning obtained the proof against Count Rodolph , which he was now determined to forward to the Grand Duke ; but , aware that his assassination by the _ Carbonari _ was to be attempted , and also that the wrath of the Grand Duke would be excessive when he was informed of their private marriage , he resolved to fly with his wife to Pisa , trusting that the proofs of Count Rodolph being connected with the _ Carbonari _ , and a little time , would soften down the Grand Duke 's anger .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 68]: The marquis had arranged that he should escape from the Duke 's dominions on the night of the masquerade , as it would be much easier for his wife to accompany him from thence than from the Grand Duke 's palace , which was well guarded ; but it was necessary that they should travel on horseback , and they could not take their child with them .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 56]: Viola would not consent that it should be left behind ; and on this emergency he had written to his friend , the Count d'Ossore , to come to their assistance at the masquerade , and , that they might recognise him , to wear a sky-blue domino , a colour but seldom put on .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 31]: The Count d'Ossore had that morning left his town mansion on a hunting excursion , and did not receive the letter , of which the Marquis and Viola were ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 22]: Such was the state of affairs at the time that I put on the sky-blue domino to go to the masquerade .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 27]: My first meeting with the marquis in his violet-coloured domino is easily understood : being in a sky-blue domino I was mistaken for the Count d'Ossore .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 21]: I was myself led into the mistake by the Marquis Albert having the same Christian name as my English friend .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 16]: The second meeting with the Count Rodolph , in the black domino , was accidental .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 60]: The next walk had been appointed as the place of meeting with the _ Carbonari _ Felippo and his companions ; but Count Rodolph , perceiving me examining my stiletto by the light of the lamp , presumed that I was Felippo , and that I had mistaken the one path for the other which had been agreed upon .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 68]: The papers given to me by Count Rodolph were _ Carbonari _ papers , which were to be hid in the marquis 's bosom after he had been assassinated , to make it appear that he had belonged I to that society , and by the paper affixed to his clothes , that he had been murdered by the agents of the society for having betrayed them .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 49]: The papers which the marquis had requested me to give to the Grand Duke were the proofs of Count Rodolph 's belonging to the secret society ; and with the papers was enclosed a letter to the Grand Duke , in which they I acknowledged their secret union .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 17]: And now , I believe , the reader will comprehend the whole of this mysterious affair .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 102]: After all had been explained , I ventured to ask his Highness if he would permit me to fulfil my promise of taking the child to its mother , as I considered it a point of honour that I should keep my engagement , the more so , as the delay would occasion the greatest distress to his daughter ; and I ventured to add , that I trusted his Highness would pardon what could not now be remedied , and that I should have the satisfaction of being the bearer of such pleasing intelligence to his daughter and the marquis .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 60]: The Grand Duke paced the room for a minute , and then replied , `` Signor Herbert , I feel so disgusted with the treachery and baseness of Count Rodolph , that I hardly need observe , if my daughter were free he never should espouse her ; indeed , he will have immediate orders to quit the state .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 31]: You have been instrumental in preserving the life of the Marquis of Salerno , who is my son-in-law , and as matters now stand , I am indebted to you .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 19]: Your dismissal of the bravoes , by means of the count 's ring , was a masterly stroke .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 29]: You shall have the pleasure of taking my forgiveness to my daughter and her husband ; but as for the child , it may as well remain here .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 17]: Tell Viola I retain it as a hostage for the quick return of its mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 27]: I took my leave of his Highness , and hastened to Pisa , where I soon found out the retreat of the marquis and his wife .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 19]: I sent up my name , requesting immediate admittance , as having a message from the Grand Duke .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 7]: I found them in great distress .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 36]: The Count d'Ossore had returned late on the night of the masquerade , found the letter , hastened to the Marquesa de Cesto 's , and had arrived just after the elopement had been discovered .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 38]: He immediately followed them to Pisa , when an explanation took place , and they discovered that they had been communicating with some unknown person , by whom they had , in all probability , been betrayed .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 91]: It would be difficult to portray their astonishment and joy when I entered into a detail of what had occurred , and wound up with the message from the Grand Duke ; and I hardly need add , now that I wind up my story , that the proofs of gratitude I received from the marquis and his wife , during my subsequent residence in Italy , left me no occasion to repent that I had gone to the masquerade of the Marquesa de Cesto , in a SKY-BLUE DOMINO .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 3]: THE END .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 4]: MODERN TOWN HOUSES .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 69]: I have often thought , when you consider the difference of comfort between houses built from sixty to a hundred years back , in comparison with the modern edifices , that the cry of the magician in `` Aladdin , '' had he called out `` new houses , '' instead of `` new lamps , '' for old ones , would not have appeared so very absurd .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 32]: It was my good fortune , for the major part of my life , to occupy an ancient house , built , I believe , in the reign of Queen Elizabeth .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 24]: My father lived in it before I was in existence : I was born in it , and it was bequeathed to me .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 50]: It has since been my misfortune to have lived three years in one of the modern-built houses ; and although I have had my share of the ills to which we all are heir , I must date my real unhappiness from the first month after I took possession .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 36]: With your permission , I will enter into my history , as it may prove a warning to others , who will not remember the old proverb of '' _ Let well alone _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 45]: I am a married man , with six children ; my three eldest are daughters , and have now quitted a school , near Portman-Square , to which my wife insisted upon my sending them , as it was renowned for finishing young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 25]: Until their return to domiciliate themselves under my roof , I never heard a complaint of my house , which was situated at Brompton .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 54]: It was large , airy , and comfortable , with excellent shrubberies , and a few acres of land ; and I possessed every comfort and even luxury which could be rationally required , my wife and daughters having their carriage , and in every respect my establishment being that of a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 87]: I had not , however , taken my daughters from school more than two months , before I was told that we were `` living out of the world , '' although not a mile and a half from Hyde Park Corner ; and , to my surprise , my wife joined in the cry ; it was always from morn to night , `` We might do this but , we can not do this because , we are quite out of the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 50]: It was too far to dine out in town ; too far for people to come and dine with us ; too far to go to the play , or the opera ; too far to drive in the park ; too far even to walk in Kensington Gardens .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 94]: I remonstrated , that we had managed to dine out , to receive visitors , and to enjoy all other amusements very well for a considerable number of years , and that it did not appear to me that Brompton had walked away from London , on the contrary , that London was making rapid advances towards Brompton ; but it would not do , -- all day the phrase rang in my ears , `` out of the world , '' until I almost began to wish that I was out too .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 16]: But it is no use having the best of an argument when opposed to women .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 25]: I had my choice , either to give up my house , and take another in London , or to give up my peace .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 59]: With an unwilling sigh , I at last consented to leave a place dear to me , from long association and many reminiscences ; and it was arranged that Brompton Hall was to be let , or sold , and that we were to look out immediately for a house in some of the squares in the metropolis .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 29]: If my wife and daughters found that the distance from London was too far for other purposes , at all events it was not too far for house-hunting .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 49]: They were at it incessantly week after week ; and , at last , they fixed upon one in the neighbourhood of Belgrave-Square , which , as they repeated , possessed all the cheerfulness and fresh air of the country , all the advantages of a town residence .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 50]: The next day I was to be dragged to see it , and give my opinion ; at the same time , from the commendations bestowed upon it previous to my going , I felt assured that I was expected to give their opinion , and not my own .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 31]: The next day , accordingly , we repaired thither , setting off immediately after breakfast , to meet the surveyor and builder , who was to be on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 23]: The house in question was one of a row just building , or built , whitened outside , in imitation of stone .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 5]: It was Number 2 .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 19]: Number 1 was finished ; but the windows still stained with the drippings of the whitewash and colouring .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 23]: Number 2 , the one in question , was complete ; and , as the builder asserted , ready for immediate occupation .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 8]: Number 3 was not so far advanced .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 32]: As for the others , they were at present nothing but carcasses , without even the front steps built to them ; and you entered them by a drawbridge of planks .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 13]: The builder stood at the front door , and bowed most respectfully .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 41]: `` Why , '' observed I , looking at the piles of mortar , lime , and bricks , standing about in all directions , `` we shall be smothered with dust and lime for the next two years . ''
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 26]: `` Do n't be alarmed , sir , '' replied the builder ; `` every house in the row will be finished before the winter .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 12]: We really can not attend to the applications for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 5]: We entered the house .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 8]: `` Is not the entrance handsome ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 11]: observed my wife ; `` so neat and clean . ''
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 18]: To this I had not a reply to make ; it certainly did look neat and clean .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 6]: We went into the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 12]: `` What a nice room , '' exclaimed my eldest daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 11]: `` How many can we dine in this room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 4]: `` Um ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 13]: replied I ; `` about twelve , I suppose , comfortably . ''
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 5]: `` Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 23]: observed the builder ; `` you have no notion of the size of the house ; rooms are so deceiving , unfurnished .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 15]: You may sit down twenty with ease ; I 'll appeal to the lady .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 9]: Do n't you think so , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 11]: `` Yes , I do , '' replied my wife .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 13]: After that we went over the drawing-rooms , bed-rooms , and attics .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 37]: Every bed-room was apportioned by my wife and daughters , and the others were allotted to the servants ; and that in the presence of the builder , who took good note of all that passed .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 41]: The kitchen was admired ; so were the pantry , scullery , coal-hole , dust-hole , etcetera ; all so nice and clean ; so compact ; and , as the builder observed , not a nail to drive anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 12]: `` Well , my dear , what do you think now ?
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 8]: is n't it a charming house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 11]: said my wife , as we re-ascended into the dining-parlour .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 29]: `` It 's a very nice house , my dear ; but still it requires a little consideration , '' replied I. `` Consideration , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 7]: replied my wife ; `` what !
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 9]: now that you have gone over it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 43]: `` I am afraid that I can not give you very long , sir , '' observed the builder ; `` there are two other parties after the house , and I am to give them an answer by two o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 14]: `` Mr Smithers told me the same yesterday , '' whispered my wife .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 13]: `` What did you say the rent was , Mr Smithers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 8]: `` Only 200 pounds per annum . ''
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 5]: `` Any ground-rent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 8]: `` Only 27 pounds 10 shillings . ''
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 6]: `` And the taxes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 11]: `` Oh , they will be a mere trifle . ''
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 12]: `` The rent appears to me to be very high . ''
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 7]: `` High , my dear sir !
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 7]: consider the situation , the advantages .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 11]: We ca n't build them fast enough at that price .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 20]: But of course , sir , you best know , '' replied he , carelessly walking towards the window .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 12]: `` Take it ; my dear , '' said my wife .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 9]: `` You must take it , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 8]: `` Pray take it , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 23]: `` Mr Whats-your-name , I beg your pardon -- '' `` Smithers , sir , '' said the builder , turning round .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 16]: `` Pray , Mr Smithers , what term of lease do you let at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 18]: `` Seven , fourteen , or twenty-one , at the option of either party , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 14]: `` I should have no objection to take it for three years . ''
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 8]: `` Three years , my dear sir !
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 9]: -- that would be doing yourself an injustice .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 18]: You would lose half the value of your fixtures provided you left -- and then the furniture .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 22]: Depend upon it , sir , if you once get into it , you will never wish to leave it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 24]: `` That may or not be , '' replied I ; `` but I will not take it for more than three years .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 35]: The town-air may not agree with me ; and if , as you say , people are so anxious to take the houses , of course it can make no difference to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 39]: `` I 'm afraid , sir , that for so short a time -- '' `` I will not take it for longer , '' replied I , rising up , glad of an excuse to be off .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 6]: `` Oh , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 8]: `` My dear Mr B -- . ''
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 16]: `` On that point , '' replied I , `` I will not be overruled .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 23]: I will not take a lease for more than three years , with the right of continuing , if I please . ''
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 9]: The builder perceived that I was in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 37]: `` Well , sir , '' replied he , `` I hardly know what to say ; but rather than disappoint the ladies , I will accept you as a tenant for three years certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 6]: `` Confound the fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 17]: thought I ; but I was pinned , and there was an end of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 35]: Mr Smithers pulled out paper and ink ; two letters of agreement were written upon a small deal table , covered with blotches of various coloured paints ; and the affair was thus concluded .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 52]: We got into the carriage and drove home , my wife and daughters in ecstasies , and I obliged to appear very well satisfied , that I might not damp their spirits ; yet I must say that although the house appeared a very nice house , I had my forebodings .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 25]: `` At all events , '' thought I , `` the lease is only for three years ; '' and thus I consoled myself .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 10]: The next day the whole house was in commotion .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 11]: I believe my wife and daughters were up at daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 44]: When I went into the breakfast room , I discovered that the pictures had been taken down , although there was no chance of their being hung up for many weeks at least , and every thing was in preparation for packing up .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 32]: After breakfast my wife set off for town to order carpets and curtains , and did not come home till six o'clock , very tired with the fatigues of the day .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 55]: She had also brought the measure of every grate , to ascertain what fenders would suit ; the measure of the bed-rooms and attics , to remodel the carpets ; for it was proposed that Brompton Hall should be disposed of , the new occupier taking at a valuation what furniture might be left .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 34]: To this I appeared to consent ; but was resolved in my own mind that , if taken , it should only be for the same term of years as my new lease .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 27]: I will pass over a month of hurry , bustle , and confusion ; at the end of which I found myself in our new habitation .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 37]: It was completely furnished , with the exception of the drawing-room carpet , which had not been laid down , but was still in a roll tied up with packthread in the middle of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 11]: The cause of this I soon understood from my wife .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 28]: It was always the custom , she said , to give a house-warming upon entering a new house , and she therefore proposed giving a little dance .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 17]: To this , as it would please her and my daughters , I raised no objection .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 60]: I have always observed , that what is proposed as a little dance invariably ends in a great one ; for from the time of proposing till the cards are about , it increases like a snowball ; but that arises , perhaps , from the extreme difficulty of knowing when to draw the line between friends and acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 62]: I have also observed that when your wife and daughters intend such a thing , they always obtain permission for the ball first , and then tack on the supper afterwards ; commencing with a mere stand-up affair , -- sandwiches , cakes , and refreshments , -- and ending with a regular sit-down affair , with Gunter presiding over all .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 32]: The music from two fiddles and a piano also swells into Collinet 's band , verifying the old adage , `` In for a penny , in for a pound . ''
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 25]: But to all this I gave my consent ; I could afford it well , and I liked to please my wife and daughters .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 60]: The ball was given , and this house-warming ended in house-breaking ; for just before the supper-quadrille , as it was termed , when about twenty-four young ladies and gentlemen were going the grand ronde , a loud noise below , with exclamations and shrieks , was heard , and soon afterwards the whole staircase was smothered with dust .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 9]: `` What _ is _ the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 16]: cried my wife , who had passed to the landing-place on the stairs before me .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 39]: `` Ma'am , '' said one of Mr Gunter 's men , shaking the lappets of his blue coat , which were covered with white dust , `` the whole ceiling of the dining-room has come down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 6]: `` Ceiling come down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 4]: screamed my wife .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 28]: `` Yes , ma'am , '' replied our own servant ; `` and the supper and supper-tables are all smashed flat with the weight on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 5]: Here was a catastrophe .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 9]: My wife hastened down , and I followed .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 18]: Sure enough the weight of mortar had crushed all beneath it -- all was chaos and confusion .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 35]: Jellies , blancmanges , pates , cold roasts , creams , trifles , -- all in one mass of ruin , mixed up with lime , horse-hair , plaster of Paris , and stucco .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 12]: It wore all the appearance of a Swiss avalanche in miniature .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 8]: `` Good heavens , how dreadful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 4]: exclaimed my wife .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 27]: `` How much more so if there had been people in the room , '' replied I. `` What could be the cause of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 4]: exclaimed my wife .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 21]: `` These new houses , sir , wo n't bear dancing in , '' observed Mr Gunter 's head man .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 9]: `` So it appears , '' replied I .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 49]: This unfortunate accident was the occasion of the party breaking up : they knew that there was no chance of supper , which they had looked forward to ; so they put on their shawls and departed , leaving us to clear up the wreck at our leisure .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 19]: In fact , as my daughters declared , it quite spoiled the ball as well as the supper .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 22]: The next morning I sent for Mr Smithers , who made his appearance , and showed him what had taken place .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 24]: `` Dear me , I 'm very sorry ; but you had too many people above stairs -- that is very clear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 9]: `` Very clear , indeed , Mr Smithers .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 8]: We had a ball last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 6]: `` A ball , sir !
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 7]: Oh , then no wonder . ''
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 4]: `` No wonder !
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 14]: do you mean to say that balls are not to be given ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 42]: `` Why , really , sir , we do not build private houses for ball-rooms -- we could not , sir ; the price of timber just now is enormous , and the additional strength required would never pay us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 4]: `` What then !
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 17]: do you mean to say that there are no balls to be given in London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 6]: `` Oh no , sir !
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 14]: -- certainly not ; but you must be aware that few people do .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 11]: Even our aristocracy hire Willis 's rooms for their balls .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 21]: Some of the old houses , indeed , such as Devonshire House , may do for such a thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 16]: `` But , Mr Smithers , I expect you will make this ceiling good . ''
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 30]: `` Much obliged to you , sir , for giving me the preference -- I will do it as reasonable as anybody , '' replied Mr Smithers , bowing .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 15]: `` I will order my workmen directly -- they are only next door . ''
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 32]: For a fortnight we were condemned to dine in the back dining-room ; and after that Mr Smithers sent in a bill which cost me more than the ball and supper .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 35]: So soon as all was right again , I determined that I would hang up my pictures ; for I had been accustomed to look at them for years , and I missed them .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 11]: I sent for a carpenter , and gave him directions .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 42]: `` I have the middle now , sir , exactly , '' said the man , standing on the high steps ; `` but , '' continued he , tapping with his hammer , `` I ca n't find wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 7]: `` Ca n't find wood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 30]: `` No , sir , '' replied the man , tapping as far as he could reach from right to left ; `` nothing to nail to , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 12]: But there never is no wood in these new-built houses . ''
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 7]: `` Confound your new houses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 14]: exclaimed I. `` Well , it is very provoking , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 4]: exclaimed my wife .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 26]: `` I suppose that their new houses are not built for pictures any more than for balls , '' replied I ; and I sighed .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 7]: `` What must be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 48]: `` I think , sir , if you were to order brass rods to be fixed from one corner to the other , we might find means to fasten them , '' observed the carpenter ; `` but there 's no wood , that 's certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 12]: `` What the devil is the house built of then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 20]: exclaimed I. `` All lath and plaster , sir , '' replied the man , tapping right and left .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 18]: At a heavy expense I procured the rods , and at last the pictures were hung up .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 28]: The next annoyance that we had was a very bad smell , which we found to proceed from the drains ; and the bricklayers were sent for .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 36]: All the drains were choked , it appeared , from their being so very narrow ; and after having up the whole basement , at the expense of 40 pounds , that nuisance was abated .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 53]: We now had two months ' repose , and I was in hopes that things would go on more comfortably ; but one day I overheard a conversation between my wife and daughters , as I passed by the door of the room , which I must candidly acknowledge gave me satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 36]: `` It 's really very awkward , mamma -- one do n't know where to put anything : there 's not a cupboard or stow-hole in the whole house -- not even a store-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 23]: `` Well , it is so , my dear ; I wonder we did not observe it when we looked over it .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 13]: What a nice set of cupboards we had at Brompton Hall . ''
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 11]: yes -- I wish we had them here , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 8]: Could n't we have some built ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 34]: `` I do n't like to speak to your papa about it , my dear ; he has already been put to such expense , what with the ceiling and the drains . ''
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 14]: `` Then do n't , mamma ; papa is really very good-natured . ''
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 41]: The equinoxes now came on , and we had several gales of wind , with heavy rain -- the slates blew off and rattled up and down all night , while the wind howled round the corner of the square .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 51]: The next morning complaints from all the attic residents ; one 's bed was wetted quite through with the water dropping through the ceiling -- another had been obliged to put a basin on the floor to catch the leak -- all declared that the roof was like a sieve .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 11]: Sent again for Mr Smithers , and made a complaint .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 31]: `` This time , Mr Smithers , '' said I , with the lease in my hand , `` I believe you will acknowledge these are landlord 's repairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 46]: `` Certainly , sir , certainly , '' exclaimed Mr Smithers ; `` I shall desire one of my men to look to it immediately ; but the fact is , with such heavy gales , the slates must be expected to move a little .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 15]: Duchesses and countesses are very light , and the wind gets underneath them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 8]: `` Duchesses and countesses very light ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 11]: exclaimed my wife ; `` what do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 30]: `` It 's the term we give to slates , madam , '' replied he ; `` we can not put on a heavy roof with a brick-and-a-half wall .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 8]: It would not support one . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 6]: _ Brick-and-a-half _ wall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 22]: exclaimed I ; -- `` surely , Mr Smithers , that 's not quite safe with a house so high . ''
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 33]: `` Not quite safe , my dear sir , if it were a single house ; but , '' added he , `` in a row , one house supports another . ''
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 25]: `` Thank Heaven , '' thought I , `` I have but a three-years ' lease , and six months are gone already . ''
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 23]: But the annoyances up to this period were internal ; we now had to experience the external nuisances attending a modern-built house .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 33]: `` Number 1 is taken , papa , and they are getting the furniture in , '' said my eldest daughter one day ; `` I hope we shall have nice neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 35]: And William told Mary that Mr Smithers told him , when he met him in the street , that he was now going to fit up Number 3 as fast as he could . ''
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 24]: The report was true , as we found from the report of the carpenters ' hammers for the next three or four weeks .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 29]: We could not obtain a moment 's sleep except in the early part of the night , or a minute 's repose to our ears during the day .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 35]: The sound appeared as if it was _ in _ our house instead of next door ; and it commenced at six o'clock in the morning , and lasted till seven in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 27]: I was hammered to death ; and , unfortunately , there was a constant succession of rain , which prevented me going out to avoid it .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 24]: I had nothing to do but to watch my pictures , as they jumped from the wall with the thumps of the hammers .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 20]: At last Number 3 was floored , wainscotted , and glazed , and we had a week 's repose .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 18]: By this time Number 1 was furnished , and the parties who had taken it came in .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 22]: They were a gouty old gentleman , and his wife , who , report said , had once been his cook .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 10]: My daughters ' hopes of pleasant neighbours were disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 52]: Before they had been in a week , we found ourselves at issue : the old gentleman 's bed was close to the partition-wall , and in the dead of the night we could distinctly hear his groans and also his execrations and exclamations , when the fit came on him .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 20]: My wife and daughters declared that it was quite horrible , and that they could not sleep for them .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 45]: Upon the eighth day there came a note : -- `` Mrs Whortleback 's compliments to Mr and Mrs -- , and begs that the young people will not play on the piany , as Mr Whortleback is very ill with the gout . ''
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 16]: Now , my daughters were proficients on the piano , and practised a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 32]: This note was anything but satisfactory : to play when the old gentleman was ill would be barbarous , -- not to play was to deprive ourselves of our greatest pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 4]: `` Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 9]: how very disagreeable , '' cried my daughters .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 40]: `` Yes , my dear ; but if we can hear his groans , it 's no wonder that he can hear the piano and harp : recollect the wall is only a brick and a half thick . ''
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 14]: `` I wonder music do n't soothe him , '' observed the eldest .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 10]: Music is a mockery to a man in agony .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 21]: A man who has been broken on the wheel would not have his last hours soothed by the finest orchestra .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 71]: After a week , during which we sent every day to inquire after Mr Whortleback 's health , we ventured to resume the piano and harp ; upon which the old gentleman became testy , and sent for a man with a trumpet , placing him in the balcony , and desiring him to play as much out of tune as possible whenever the harp and piano sounded a note .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 57]: Thus were we at open hostility with our only neighbour ; and , as we were certain if my daughters touched their instruments , to have the trumpet blowing discord for an hour or two either that day or the next , at last the piano was unopened , and the harp remained in its case .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 18]: Before the year closed , Number 3 became tenanted ; and here we had a new annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 19]: It was occupied by a large family ; and there were four young ladies who were learning music .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 45]: We now had our annoyance : it was strum , strum , all day long ; one sister up , another down ; and every one knows what a bore the first lessons in music are to those who are compelled to hear them .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 23]: They could just manage to play a tune , and that eternal tune was ringing in our ears from morning to night .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 12]: We could not send our compliments , or blow a trumpet .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 8]: We were forced to submit to it .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 36]: The nursery also being against the partition wall , we had the squalls and noise of the children on the one side , added to groans and execrations of the old gentleman on the other .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 16]: However , custom reconciled us to everything , and the first vexation gradually wore off .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 66]: Yet I could not help observing that when I was supposed not to be in hearing , the chief conversation of my wife , when her friends called upon her , consisted of a description of all the nuisances and annoyances that we suffered ; and I felt assured that she and my daughters were as anxious to return to Brompton Hall as I was .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 17]: In fact , the advantages which they had anticipated by their town residence were not realised .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 37]: In our situation , we were as far off from most of our friends , and still farther from some than we were before , and we had no longer the same amusements to offer them .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 46]: At our former short distance from town , access was more easy to those who did not keep a carriage , that is , the young men ; and those were the parties who , of course , my wife and daughters cared for most .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 87]: It was very agreeable to come down with their portmanteaus , -- enjoy the fresh air and green lanes of the country for an afternoon , -- dine , sleep , and breakfast , and return the next morning by conveyances which passed us every quarter of an hour ; but to dine with us in -- Square , when the expense of a hackney-coach there and back was no trifle , and to return at eleven o'clock at night , was not at all agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 23]: We found that we had not so much society , nor were we half so much courted , as at Brompton Hall .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 39]: This was the bitterest blow of all , and my wife and daughters would look out of the windows and sigh ; often a whole day passed without one friend or acquaintance dropping in to relieve its monotony .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 66]: We continued to reside there , nevertheless , for I had made up my mind that the three years would be well spent if they cured my wife and daughters of their town mania ; and although anxious , as I am sure they were , to return , I never broached the matter , for I was determined that the cure should be radical .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 36]: Numbers 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 , were finished the next year , and , by the persuasions of Mr Smithers , were taken by different parties in the spring .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 7]: And now we had another nuisance .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 8]: Nothing but eternal rings at the bell .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 93]: The man-servant grumbled , and was behind with his work ; and when scolded , replied that there was no time for any thing , that when cleaning his knives and plate the bell was rung , and he was obliged to wash himself , throw on his jacket , and go up to answer the front door ; that the bell was not rung for us , but to find out where some new-comer lived , and to ascertain this they always rang at the house which appeared the longest inhabited .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 27]: There was no end to the ringing for some months , and we had three servants who absolutely refused to stay in so bad a place .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 28]: We had also to contend with letters and notes in the same way , brought to us at haphazard : `` Does Mr So-and-so live here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 9]: -- `` No , he does not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 9]: -- `` Then pray where does he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 18]: This was interminable , and not five minutes in the day passed without the door-bell being rung .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 34]: For the sake of not changing my servants I was at last put to the expense of an extra boy for no other purpose but to answer the constant applications at the door .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 41]: At last we had remained there for two years and nine months , and then my wife would occasionally put the question whether I intended to renew the lease ; and I naturally replied that I did not like change .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 42]: Then she went upon another tack ; observed that Clara did not appear well for some time , and that she thought that she required country air ; but , in this , I did not choose to agree with her .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 56]: One day I came home , and , rubbing my hands as if pleased , said , `` Well , at last I 've an offer for Brompton Villa for a term of seven years , -- a very fair offer and good tenants , -- so that will now be off my hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 13]: My wife looked mortified , and my daughters held down their heads .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 9]: `` Have you let it , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 8]: said one of my daughters , timidly .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 17]: `` No , not yet ; but I am to give an answer to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 13]: `` It requires consideration , my dear , '' replied my wife .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 5]: `` Requires consideration ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 27]: said I. `` Why , my dear , the parties have seen the house , and I have been trying to let it these three years .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 23]: I recollect when I took this house I said it required consideration , but you would not allow any such thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 13]: `` I 'm sure I wish we had , '' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 47]: `` And so do I. '' `` The fact is , my dear , '' said my wife , coming round to the back of my chair , and putting her arms round my neck , `` we all wish to go back to Brompton . ''
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 18]: `` Yes , yes , papa , '' added my daughters , embracing me on each side .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 23]: `` You will allow , then , that I was right in not taking a lease for more than three years . ''
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 11]: `` Yes : how lucky you were so positive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 32]: `` Well , then , if that is the case , we will unfurnish this house , and , as soon as you please , go back to Brompton Hall . ''
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 46]: I hardly need observe that we took possession of our old abode with delight , and that I have had no more applications for a change of residence , or have again heard the phrase that we were living `` out of the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 6]: THE WAY TO BE HAPPY .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 38]: Cut your coat according to your cloth , is an old maxim and a wise one ; and if people will only square their ideas according to their circumstances , how much happier might we all be !
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 29]: If we only would come down a peg or two in our notions , in accordance with our waning fortunes , happiness would be always within our reach .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 21]: It is not what we have , or what we have not , which adds or subtracts from our felicity .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 48]: It is the longing for more than we have , the envying of those who possess that more , and the wish to appear in the world of more consequence than we really are , which destroy our peace of mind , and eventually lead to ruin .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 24]: I never witnessed a man submitting to circumstances with good humour and good sense , so remarkably as in my friend Alexander Willemott .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 52]: When I first met him , since our school days , it was at the close of the war : he had been a large contractor with Government for army clothing and accoutrements , and was said to have realised an immense fortune , although his accounts were not yet settled .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 36]: Indeed it was said that they were so vast , that it would employ the time of six clerks , for two years , to examine them , previous to the balance sheet being struck .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 39]: As I observed , he had been at school with me , and , on my return from the East Indies , I called upon him to renew our old acquaintance , and congratulate him upon his success .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 12]: `` My dear Reynolds , I am delighted to see you .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 20]: You must come down to Belem Castle ; Mrs Willemott will receive you with pleasure , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 8]: You shall see my two girls . ''
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 3]: I consented .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 20]: The chaise stopped at a splendid mansion , and I was ushered in by a crowd of liveried servants .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 11]: Every thing was on the most sumptuous and magnificent scale .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 29]: Having paid my respects to the lady of the house , I retired to dress , as dinner was nearly ready , it being then half-past seven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 8]: It was eight before we sat down .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 42]: To an observation that I made , expressing a hope that I had not occasioned the dinner being put off , Willemott replied , `` On the contrary , my dear Reynolds , we never sit down until about this hour .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 15]: How people can dine at four or five o'clock , I can not conceive .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 8]: I could not touch a mouthful . ''
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 15]: The dinner was excellent , and I paid the encomiums which were its due .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 26]: `` Do not be afraid , my dear fellow -- my cook is an _ artiste extraordinaire _ -- a regular _ Cordon Bleu _ .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 10]: You may eat any thing without fear of indigestion .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 18]: How people can live upon the English cookery of the present day , I can not conceive .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 11]: I seldom dine out , for fear of being poisoned .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 22]: Depend upon it , a good cook lengthens your days , and no price is too great to insure one . ''
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 14]: When the ladies retired , being alone , we entered into friendly conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 17]: I expressed my admiration of his daughters , who certainly were very handsome and elegant girls .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 14]: `` Very true ; they are more than passable , '' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 17]: `` We have had many offers , but not such as come up to my expectations .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 18]: Baronets are cheap now-a-days , and Irish lords are nothings ; I hope to settle them comfortably .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 4]: We shall see .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 19]: Try this claret ; you will find it excellent , not a headache in a hogshead of it .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 12]: How people can drink port , I can not imagine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 15]: The next morning he proposed that I should rattle round the park with him .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 25]: I acceded , and we set off in a handsome open carriage , with four greys , ridden by postilions at a rapid pace .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 33]: As we were whirling along , he observed , `` In town we must of course drive but a pair , but in the country I never go out without four horses .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 30]: There is a spring in four horses which is delightful ; it makes your spirits elastic , and you feel that the poor animals are not at hard labour .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 15]: Rather than not drive four , I would prefer to stay at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 23]: Our ride was very pleasant , and in such amusements passed away one of the most pleasant weeks that I ever remembered .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 25]: Willemott was not the least altered -- he was as friendly , as sincere , as open-hearted , as when a boy at school .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 30]: I left him , pleased with his prosperity , and acknowledging that he was well deserving of it , although his ideas had assumed such a scale of magnificence .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 16]: I went to India when my leave expired , and was absent about four years .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 24]: On my return , I inquired after my friend Willemott , and was told that his circumstances and expectations had been greatly altered .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 66]: From many causes , such as a change in the Government , a demand for economy , and the wording of his contracts having been differently rendered from what Willemott had supposed their meaning to be , large items had been struck out of his balance sheet , and , instead of being a millionaire , he was now a gentleman with a handsome property .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 28]: Belem Castle had been sold , and he now lived at Richmond , as hospitable as ever , and was considered a great addition to the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 12]: I took the earliest opportunity of going down to see him .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 18]: `` Oh , my dear Reynolds , this is really kind of you to come without invitation .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 19]: Your room is ready , and bed well aired , for it was slept in three nights ago .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 12]: Come -- Mrs Willemott will be delighted to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 13]: I found the girls still unmarried , but they were yet young .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 16]: The whole family appeared as contented and happy , and as friendly , as before .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 15]: We sat down to dinner at six o'clock ; the footman and coachman attended .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 14]: The dinner was good , but not by the _ artiste extraordinaire _ .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 4]: I praised everything .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 43]: `` Yes , '' replied he , `` she is a very good cook ; she unites the solidity of the English with the delicacy of the French fare ; and , altogether , I think it a _ decided improvement _ .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 7]: Jane is quite a treasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 22]: After dinner , he observed , `` Of course you know I have sold Belem Castle , and reduced my establishment .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 35]: Government have not treated me fairly , but I am at the mercy of Commissioners , and a body of men will do that which , as individuals , they would be ashamed of .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 31]: The fact is , the odium is borne by no one in particular , and it is only the sense of shame which keeps us honest , I am afraid .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 25]: However , here you see me , with a comfortable fortune , and always happy to see my friends , especially my old schoolfellow .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 21]: Will you take _ port _ or claret ; the port is very fine , and so is the claret .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 33]: By the by , do you know -- I 'll let you into a family secret ; Louisa is to be married to a Colonel Willer -- an _ excellent _ match !
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 8]: It has made us all happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 28]: The next day we drove out , not in an open carriage as before , but in a chariot and with a _ pair of horses _ .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 38]: `` These are handsome horses , '' observed I. `` Yes , '' replied he , `` I am fond of good horses ; and , as I only keep a pair , I have the best .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 31]: There is a certain degree of pretension in _ four horses _ , I do not much like -- it appears as if you wished to overtop your neighbours . ''
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 15]: I spent a few very pleasant days , and then quitted his hospitable roof .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 32]: A severe cold , caught that winter , induced me to take the advice of the physicians , and proceed to the South of France , where I remained two years .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 34]: On my return , I was informed that Willemott had speculated , and had been unlucky on the Stock Exchange ; that he had left Richmond , and was now living at Clapham .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 10]: The next day I met him near the Exchange .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 10]: `` Reynolds , I am happy to see you .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 9]: Thompson told me that you had come back .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 26]: If not better engaged , come down to see me ; I will drive you down at four o'clock , if that will suit . ''
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 27]: It suited me very well , and , at four o'clock , I met him according to appointment at a livery stables over the Iron Bridge .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 22]: His vehicle was ordered out , it was a phaeton drawn by two long-tailed ponies -- altogether a very neat concern .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 8]: We set off at a rapid pace .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 10]: `` They step out well , do n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 26]: We shall be down in plenty of time to put on a pair of shoes by five o'clock , which is _ our dinner-time _ .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 12]: Late dinners do n't agree with me -- they produce indigestion .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 13]: Of course , you know that Louisa has a little boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 8]: I did not ; but congratulated him .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 14]: `` Yes , and has now gone out to India with her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 23]: Mary is also engaged to be married -- a very _ good _ match -- a Mr Rivers , in the law .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 14]: He has been called to the bar this year , and promises well .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 21]: They will be a little pinched at first , but we must see what we can do for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 61]: We stopped at a neat row of houses , I forget the name , and , as we drove up , the servant , the only man-servant , came out , and took the ponies round to the stable , while the maid received my luggage , and one or two paper-bags , containing a few extras for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 13]: I was met with the same warmth as usual by Mrs Willemott .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 31]: The house was small , but very neat ; the remnants of former grandeur appeared here and there , in one or two little articles , favourites of the lady .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 32]: We sat down at five o'clock to a _ plain _ dinner , and were attended by the footman , who had rubbed down the ponies and pulled on his livery .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 17]: `` A good plain cook is the best thing , after all , '' observed Willemott .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 12]: `` Your fine cooks wo n't condescend to roast and boil .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 13]: Will you take some of this sirloin , the under-cut is excellent .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 11]: My dear , give Mr Reynolds some Yorkshire pudding . ''
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 19]: When we were left alone after dinner , Willemott told me , very unconcernedly , of his losses .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 38]: `` It was my own fault , '' said he ; `` I wished to make up a little sum for the girls , and risking what they would have had , I left them almost pennyless .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 26]: However , we can always command a bottle of port and a beef-steak , and _ what more _ in this world can you have ?
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 7]: Will you take port or white ?
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 10]: -- I have no claret to offer you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 14]: We finished our port , but I could perceive no difference in Willemott .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 11]: He was just as happy and as cheerful as ever .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 9]: He drove me to town the next day .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 41]: During our drive , he observed , `` I like ponies , they are so little trouble ; and I prefer them to driving one horse in this vehicle , as I can put my wife and daughters into it .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 29]: It 's selfish to keep a carriage for yourself alone , and one horse in a four-wheeled double chaise appears like an imposition upon the poor animal . ''
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 11]: I went to Scotland , and remained about a year .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 16]: On my return , I found that my friend Willemott had again shifted his quarters .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 28]: He was at Brighton ; and having nothing better to do , I put myself in the `` Times , '' and arrived at the Bedford Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 16]: It was not until after some inquiry , that I could find out his address .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 18]: At last I obtained it , in a respectable but not fashionable part of this overgrown town .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 7]: Willemott received me just as before .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 21]: `` I have no spare bed to offer you , but you must breakfast and dine with us every day .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 19]: Our house is small , but it 's very comfortable , and Brighton is a very convenient place .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 6]: You know Mary is married .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 22]: A good place in the courts was for sale , and my wife and I agreed to purchase it for Rivers .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 13]: It has reduced us a little , but they are very comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 32]: I have retired from business altogether ; in fact , as my daughters are both married , and we have enough to live upon , what can we wish for more ?
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 36]: Brighton is very gay , and always healthy ; and , as for carriage and horses , they are no use here -- there are _ flies _ at every corner of the streets . ''
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 7]: I accepted his invitation to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 16]: A parlour-maid waited , but everything , although very plain , was clean and comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 40]: `` I have still a bottle of wine for a friend , Reynolds , '' said Willemott , after dinner ; `` but , for my part , I prefer _ whisky-toddy _ -- it agrees with me better .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 22]: Here 's to the health of my two girls , God bless them , and success to them in life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 35]: `` My dear Willemott , '' said I , `` I take the liberty of an old friend , but I am so astonished at your philosophy , that I can not help it .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 41]: When I call to mind Belem Castle , your large establishment , your luxuries , your French cook , and your stud of cattle , I wonder at your contented state of mind under such a change of circumstances . ''
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 14]: `` I almost wonder myself , my dear fellow , '' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 99]: `` I never could have believed , at that time , that I could live happily under such a change of circumstances ; but the fact is , that , although I have been a contractor , I have a good conscience ; then , my wife is an excellent woman , and provided she sees me and her daughters happy , thinks nothing about herself ; and , further , I have made it a rule , as I have been going down hill , to find reasons why I should be thankful , and not discontented .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 31]: Depend upon it , Reynolds , it is not a loss of fortune which will affect your happiness , as long as you have peace and love at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 70]: I took my leave of Willemott and his wife , with respect as well as regard ; convinced that there was no pretended indifference to worldly advantages ; that it was not , that the grapes were sour , but that he had learned the whole art of happiness , by being contented with what he had , and by `` cutting his coat according to his cloth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 7]: HOW TO WRITE A FASHIONABLE NOVEL .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 11]: -LSB- _ Scene -- Chamber in Lincoln 's Inn _ .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 17]: ARTHUR ANSARD _ at a briefless table , tete-a-tete with his wig on a block _ .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 15]: A _ casts a disconsolate look upon his companion , and soliloquises _ . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 20]: Yes , there you stand , `` partner of my toils , my feelings , and my fame . ''
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 17]: We do not _ suit _ , for we never gained a _ suit _ together .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 88]: Well , what with reporting for the bar , writing for the Annuals and the Pocket-books , I shall be able to meet all demands , except those of my tailor ; and , as his bill is most characteristically long , I think I shall be able to make it stretch over till next term , by which time I hope to fulfil my engagements with Mr C , who has given me an order for a fashionable novel , written by a `` nobleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 56]: But how I , who was never inside of an aristocratical mansion in my life , whose whole idea of Court is comprised in the Court of King 's Bench , am to complete my engagement , I know no more than my companion opposite , who looks so placidly stupid under my venerable wig .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 37]: As far as the street door , the footman and carriage , and the porter , are concerned , I can manage well enough ; but as to what occurs within doors I am quite abroad .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 18]: I shall never get through the first chapter ; yet that tailor 's bill must be paid .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 7]: -LRB- _ Knocking outside _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 6]: Come in , I pray .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 5]: _ Enter _ BARNSTAPLE .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 7]: Merry Christmas to you , Arthur .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 16]: Sit down , my dear fellow ; but do n't mock me with merry Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 5]: He emigrated long ago .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 19]: Answer me seriously : do you think it possible for a man to describe what he never saw ?
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 13]: _ B -LRB- putting his stick up to his chin _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 18]: Why , 't is possible ; but I would not answer for the description being quite correct .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 14]: But suppose the parties who read it have never seen the thing described ?
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 14]: Why then it wo n't signify whether the description be correct or not .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 18]: You have taken a load off my mind ; but still I am not quite at ease .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 11]: I have engaged to furnish C with a fashionable novel .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 11]: What do you mean to imply by a fashionable novel ?
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 6]: I really can hardly tell .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 27]: His stipulations were , that it was to be a `` fashionable novel in three volumes , each volume not less than three hundred pages . ''
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 17]: That is to say , that you are to assist him in imposing on the public .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 28]: Something very like it , I 'm afraid ; as it is further agreed that it is to be puffed as coming from a highly talented nobleman .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 8]: You should not do it , Ansard .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 23]: So conscience tells me , but my tailor 's bill says Yes ; and that is a thing out of all conscience .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 4]: Only look here .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 7]: _ Displays a long bill _ .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 14]: Why , I must acknowledge , Ansard , that there is some excuse .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 17]: One needs must , when the devil drives ; but you are capable of better things .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 11]: I certainly do n't feel great capability in this instance .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 6]: But what can I do ?
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 16]: The man will have nothing else -- he says the public will read nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 43]: That is to say , that because one talented author astonished the public by style and merits peculiarly his own , and established , as it were , a school for neophites , his popularity is to be injured by contemptible imitators .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 59]: It is sufficient to drive a man mad , to find that the tinsel of others , if to be purchased more cheaply , is to be pawned upon the public instead of his gold ; and more annoying still , that the majority of the public can not appreciate the difference between the metal and the alloy .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 25]: Do you know , Ansard , that by getting up this work , you really injure the popularity of a man of great talent ?
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 8]: Will he pay my tailor 's bill !
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 15]: No ; I dare say he has enough to do to pay his own .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 6]: What does your tailor say ?
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 35]: He is a staunch reformer , and on March the 1st he declares that he will have the bill , the whole bill , and nothing but the bill -- carried to my credit .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 32]: Mr C , on the 10th of February , also expects the novel , the whole novel , and nothing but the novel , and that must be a fashionable novel .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 5]: Look here , Barnstaple .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 10]: -LRB- _ Shows his tailor 's bill _ -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 6]: I see how it is .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 12]: He `` pays your poverty , and not your will . ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 18]: And , by your leave , I thus must pay my bill -LRB- _ bowing _ -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 30]: Well , well , I can help you : nothing more difficult than to write a good novel , and nothing more easy than to write a bad one .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 30]: If I were not above the temptation , I could pen you a dozen of the latter every ordinary year , and thirteen , perhaps , in the bissextile .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 29]: So banish that Christmas cloud from your brow ; leave off nibbling your pen at the wrong end , and clap a fresh nib to the right one .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 7]: I have an hour to spare .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 17]: I thank you : that spare hour of yours may save me many a spare day .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 7]: I 'm all attention -- proceed .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 45]: The first point to be considered is the _ tempus _ , or time ; the next the _ locus _ , or place ; and lastly the _ dramatis personae _ and thus , chapter upon chapter , will you build a novel .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 2]: Build !
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 20]: Yes , build ; you have had your dimensions given , the interior is left to your own decoration .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 7]: First , as to the opening .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 9]: Suppose we introduce the hero in his dressing-room .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 23]: We have something of the kind in Pelham ; and if we ca n't copy his merits , we must his peculiarities .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 29]: Besides , it always is effective : a dressing-room or boudoir of supposed great people , is admitting the vulgar into the arcana , which they delight in .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 5]: Nothing can be better .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 23]: Then , as to time ; as the hero is still in bed , suppose we say four o'clock in the afternoon ?
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 7]: In the morning , you mean .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 5]: No ; the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 33]: I grant you that fashionable young men in real life get up much about the same time as other people ; but in a fashionable novel your real exclusive never rises early .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 13]: The very idea makes the tradesman 's wife lift up her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 3]: So begin .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 16]: `` It was about thirty-three minutes after four , _ post meridian _ -- . ''
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 6]: Minute -- to a minute !
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 15]: `` That the Honourable Augustus Bouverie 's finely chiselled -- '' _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 2]: Chiselled !
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 14]: Yes ; great people are always chiselled ; common people are only cast .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 13]: -- `` Finely chiselled head was still recumbent upon his silk-encased pillow .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 35]: His luxuriant and Antinous-like curls were now confined in _ papillotes _ of the finest satin paper , and the _ tout ensemble _ of his head -- '' _ A. Tout ensemble _ !
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 5]: Yes ; go on .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 28]: -- `` Was gently compressed by a caul of the finest net-work , composed of the threads spun from the beauteous production of the Italian worm . ''
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 8]: now I perceive -- a silk nightcap .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 12]: But why ca n't I say at once a silk nightcap ?
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 8]: Because you are writing a fashionable novel .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 16]: -- `` With the forefinger of his gloved left hand -- '' _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 18]: But he 's not coming in from a walk -- he 's not yet out of bed .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 6]: You do n't understand it .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 61]: -- `` Gloved left hand he applied a gentle friction to the portal of his right eye , which unclosing at the silent summons , enabled him to perceive a repeater studded with brilliants , and ascertain the exact minute of time , which we have already made known to the reader , and at which our history opens . ''
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 6]: A very grand opening indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 12]: Not more than it ought to be for a fashionable novel .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 76]: -- `` At the sound of a silver _ clochette _ , his faithful Swiss valet Coridon , who had for some time been unperceived at the door , waiting for some notice of his master , having thrown off the empire of Somnus , in his light pumps , covered with beaver , moved with noiseless step up to the bedside , like the advance of eve stealing over the face of nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 5]: Rather an incongruous simile .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 6]: Not for a fashionable novel .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 17]: -- `` There he stood , like Taciturnity bowing at the feet of proud Authority . ''
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 11]: Indeed , Barnstaple , that is too _ outre _ .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 15]: Not a whit : I am in the true `` Cambysis ' vein . ''
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 52]: -- `` Coridon having softly withdrawn the rose-coloured gros de Naples bed-curtains , which by some might have been thought to have been rather too extravagantly fringed with the finest Mechlin lace , exclaimed with a tone of tremulous deference and affection , ` _ Monsieur a bien dormi _ ? '
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 39]: ` Coridon , ' said the Honourable Augustus Bouverie , raising himself on his elbow in that eminently graceful attitude for which he was so remarkable when reclining on the ottomans at Almacks -- '' _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 8]: Are you sure they have ottomans there ?
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 10]: No ; but your readers ca n't disprove it .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 45]: -- '' ` Coridon , ' said he , surveying his attendant from head to foot , and ultimately assuming a severity of countenance , ` Coridon , you are becoming gross , if not positively what the people call _ fat _ . '
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 50]: The Swiss attendant fell back in graceful astonishment three steps , and arching his eyebrows , extending his inverted palms forward , and raising his shoulders above the apex of his head , exclaimed , ` _ Pardon , milor , j' en aurais un horreur parfait _ . '
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 34]: ` I tell you , ' replied our gracefully recumbent hero , ` that it is so , Coridon ; and I ascribe it to your partiality for that detestable wine called Port .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 23]: Confine yourself to Hock and Moselle , sirrah : I fear me , you have a base hankering after mutton and beef .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 19]: Restrict yourself to salads , and do not sin even with an omelette more than once a week .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 15]: Coridon must be visionary and diaphanous , or he is no Coridon for me .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 34]: Remove my night-gloves , and assist me to rise : it is past four o'clock , and the sun must have , by this time , sufficiently aired this terrestrial globe . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 15]: I have it now ; I feel I could go on for an hour .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 13]: Longer than that , before you get him out of his dressing-room .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 36]: You must make at least five chapters before he is apparelled , or how can you write a fashionable novel , in which you can not afford more than two incidents in the three volumes ?
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 22]: Two are absolutely necessary for the editor of the Gazette to extract as specimens , before he winds up an eulogy .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 16]: Do you think that you can proceed now for a week , without my assistance ?
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 14]: I think so , if you will first give me some general ideas .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 14]: In the first place , am I always to continue in this style ?
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 8]: No ; I thought you knew better .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 12]: You must throw in patches of philosophy every now and then .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 6]: Philosophy in a fashionable novel ?
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 34]: Most assuredly , or it would be complained of as trifling ; but a piece , now and then , of philosophy , as unintelligible as possible , stamps it with deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 24]: In the dressing-room , or boudoir , it must be occasionally Epicurean ; elsewhere , especially in the open air , more Stoical .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 16]: I 'm afraid that I shall not manage that without a specimen to copy from .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 17]: Now I think of it , Eugene Aram says something very beautiful on a starry night .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 17]: He does : it is one of the most splendid pieces of writing in our language .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 18]: But I will have no profanation , Arthur ; -- to your pen again , and write .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 40]: We 'll suppose our hero to have retired from the crowded festivities of a ball-room at some lordly mansion in the country , and to have wandered into a churchyard , damp and dreary with a thick London fog .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 14]: In the light dress of fashion , he throws himself on a tombstone .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 5]: `` Ye dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 9]: exclaims the hero , `` where are ye ?
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 24]: Do your disembodied spirits now float around me , and , shrouded in this horrible veil of nature , glare unseen upon vitality ?
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 15]: Float ye upon this intolerable mist , in yourselves still more misty and intolerable ?
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 6]: Hold ye high jubilee to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 22]: or do ye crouch behind these monitorial stones , gibbering and chattering at one who dares thus to invade your precincts ?
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 26]: Here may I hold communion with my soul , and , in the invisible presence of those who could , but dare not to reveal .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 2]: Away !
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 6]: it must not be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 5]: What must n't be ?
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 12]: That is the mystery which gives the point to his soliloquy .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 8]: Leave it to the reader 's imagination .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 3]: I understand .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 28]: But still the Honourable Augustus can not lie in bed much longer , and I really shall not be able to get him out without your assistance .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 33]: I do not comprehend how a man can get out of bed _ gracefully _ ; he must show his bare legs , and the alteration of position is in itself awkward .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 8]: Not half so awkward as you are .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 22]: Do you not feel that he must not be got out of bed at all -- that is , by description .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 3]: How then ?
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 6]: By saying nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 58]: Recommence as follows : -- '' ` I should like the bath at seventy-six and a half , Coridon , ' observed the Honourable Augustus Bouverie , as he wrapped his embroidered dressing gown round his elegant form , and sank into a _ chaise longue _ , wheeled by his faithful attendant to the fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 17]: There , you observe , he is out of bed , and nothing said about it .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 7]: Go on , I pray thee .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 5]: _ A _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 8]: ` How is the bath perfumed ? '
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 9]: ` _ Eau de mille fleurs _ . '
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 8]: ` _ Eau de mille fleurs _ !
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 16]: Did not I tell you last week that I was tired of that villainous compound ?
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 11]: It has been adulterated till nothing remains but its name .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 56]: Get me another bath immediately _ a la violette _ ; and , Coridon , you may use that other scent , if there is any left , for the poodle ; but observe , only when _ you _ take him an airing , not when he goes with _ me _ . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 2]: Excellent !
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 21]: I now feel the real merits of an exclusive ; but you said something about dressing-room , or in-door philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 13]: I did ; and now is a good opportunity to introduce it .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 30]: Coridon goes into the ante-chamber to renew the bath , and of course your hero has met with a disappointment in not having the bath to his immediate pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 9]: He must press his hands to his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 34]: By-the-by , recollect that his forehead , when you describe it , must be high and white as snow : all aristocratical foreheads are -- at least , are in a fashionable novel .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 6]: the women 's and all ?
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 15]: The heroine 's must be ; the others you may lower as a contrast .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 7]: But to resume with the philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 65]: He strikes his forehead , lifts his eyes slowly up to the ceiling , and drops his right arm as slowly down by the side of the _ chaise longue _ ; and then in a voice so low that it might have been considered a whisper , were it not for its clear and brilliant intonation , he exclaims -- _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 5]: Exclaims in a whisper !
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 16]: To be sure ; you exclaim mentally , why should you not in a whisper ?
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 8]: I perceive -- your argument is unanswerable .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 51]: Stop a moment ; it will run better thus : -- `` The Honourable Augustus Bouverie no sooner perceived himself alone , than he felt the dark shades of melancholy ascending and brooding over his mind , and enveloping his throbbing heart in their -- their _ adamantine _ chains .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 75]: Yielding to the overwhelming force , he thus exclaimed , ` Such is life -- we require but one flower , and we are offered noisome thousands -- refused that we wish , we live in loathing of that not worthy to be received -- mourners from our cradle to our grave , we utter the shrill cry at our birth , and we sink in oblivion with the faint , wail of terror .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 16]: Why should we , then , ever commit the folly to be happy ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 9]: Hang me , but that 's a poser !
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 2]: Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 12]: hold your tongue ; it is only preparatory to the end .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 21]: `` Conviction astonishes and torments -- destiny prescribes and falsifies -- attraction drives us away -- humiliation supports our energies .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 17]: Thus do we recede into the present , and shudder at the Elysium of posterity . ''
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 20]: I have written all that down , Barnstaple ; but I can not understand it , upon my soul !
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 14]: If you had understood one particle , that particle I would have erased .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 21]: This is your true philosophy of a fashionable novel , the extreme interest of which consists in its being unintelligible .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 34]: People have such an opinion of their own abilities , that if they understood you , they would despise you ; but a dose like this strikes them with veneration for your talents .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 15]: Your argument is unanswerable ; but you said that I must describe the dressing-room .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 23]: Nothing more easy ; as a simile , compare it to the shrine of some favoured saint in a richly-endowed Catholic church .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 23]: Three tables at least , full of materials in methodised confusion -- all tending to the beautification of the human form divine .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 14]: Tinted perfumes in every variety of cut crystal receivers , gold and silver .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 19]: If at a loss , call at Bayley and Blew 's , or Smith 's in Bond Street .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 15]: Take an accurate survey of all you see , and introduce your whole catalogue .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 7]: You can not be too minute .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 17]: But , Arthur , you must not expect me to write the whole book for you .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 75]: Indeed I am not so exorbitant in my demands upon your good-nature ; but observe , I may get up four or five chapters already with the hints you have given me , but I do not know how to move , such a creation of the brain -- so ethereal , that I fear he will melt away ; and so fragile , that I am in terror lest he fall to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 20]: Now only get him into the breakfast-room for me , and then I ask no more for the present .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 12]: Only dress him , and bring him _ down stairs _ .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 7]: There again you prove your incapability .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 5]: Bring him down stairs !
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 13]: Your hero of a fashionable novel never ascends to the first floor .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 17]: Bed-room , dressing-room , breakfast-room , library , and boudoir , all are upon a level .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 45]: As for his dressing , you must only describe it as perfect when finished ; but not enter into a regular detail , except that , in conversation with his valet , he occasionally asks for something unheard-of , or fastidious to a degree .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 77]: You must not walk him from one chamber to another , but manage it as follows : -- `` It was not until the beautiful airs of the French clock that decorated the mantel-piece had been thrice played , with all their variations , that the Honourable Augustus Bouverie entered his library , where he found his assiduous Coridon burning an aromatic pastille to disperse the compound of villainous exhalations arising from the condensed metropolitan atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 82]: Once more in a state of repose , to the repeated and almost affecting solicitations of his faithful attendant , who alternately presented to him the hyson of Pekoe , the bohea of Twankay , the fragrant berry from the Asiatic shore , and the frothing and perfumed decoction of the Indian nut , our hero shook his head in denial , until he at last was prevailed upon to sip a small liqueur glass of _ eau sucre _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 16]: The fact is , Arthur , he is in love -- do n't you perceive ?
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 68]: Now introduce a friend , who rallies him -- then a resolution to think no more of the heroine -- a billet on a golden salver -- a counter resolution -- a debate which equipage to order -- a decision at last -- hat , gloves , and furred great coat -- and by that time you will have arrived to the middle of the first volume .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 13]: I perceive ; but I shall certainly stick there without your assistance .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 9]: You shall have it , my dear fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 15]: In a week I will call again , and see how you get on .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 23]: Then we 'll introduce the heroine ; that , I can tell you , requires some tact -- _ au revoir _ .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 9]: Thanks , many thanks , my dear Barnstaple .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 4]: Fare you well .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 5]: _ Exit _ BARNSTAPLE .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 10]: _ A -LRB- looking over his memoranda _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 5]: -- It will do !
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 11]: -LRB- _ Hopping and dancing about the room _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 2]: Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 10]: my tailor 's bill will be paid after all !
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 4]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ PART II .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 10]: MR ARTHUR ANSARD 'S _ Chambers as before _ .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 3]: MR ANSARD .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 18]: _ with his eyes fixed upon the wig block , gnawing the feather end of his pen .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 19]: The table , covered with sundry sheets of foolscap , show strong symptoms of the Novel progressing _ .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 7]: ANSARD -LRB- _ solus _ -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 4]: Where is Barnstaple ?
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 17]: If he do not come soon , I shall have finished my novel without a heroine .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 16]: Well , I 'm not the first person who has been foiled by a woman .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 14]: -LRB- _ Continues to gnaw his pen in a brown study _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 14]: BARNSTAPLE _ enters unperceived , and slaps _ ANSARD _ on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 6]: The latter starts up _ .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 27]: So , friend Ansard , making your dinner off your pen : it is not every novel-writer who can contrive to do that even in anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 7]: Have you profited by my instructions ?
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 5]: I wish I had .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 36]: I assure you that this light diet has not contributed , as might be expected , to assist a heavy head , and one feather is not sufficient to enable my genius to take wing .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 25]: If the public knew what dull work it is to write a novel , they would not be surprised at finding them dull reading .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 7]: _ Ex nihilo nihil fit _ .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 11]: Barnstaple , I am at the very bathos of stupidity .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 13]: You certainly were absorbed when I entered , for I introduced myself .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 17]: I wish you had introduced another personage with you -- you would have been doubly welcome .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 4]: Who is that ?
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 3]: My heroine .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 9]: I have followed your instructions to the letter .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 21]: My hero is as listless as I fear my readers will be , and he is not yet in love .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 10]: In fact , he is only captivated with himself .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 7]: I have made him dismiss Coridon .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 2]: Hah !
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 6]: how did you manage that ?
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 14]: He was sent to ascertain the arms on the panel of a carriage .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 34]: In his eagerness to execute his master 's wishes , he came home with a considerable degree of perspiration on his brow , for which offence he was immediately put out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 13]: Bravo -- it was unpardonable -- but still -- _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 2]: O !
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 22]: I know what you mean -- that is all arranged ; he has an annuity of one hundred pounds per annum .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 16]: My dear Ansard , you have exceeded my expectations ; but now for the heroine .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 15]: Yes , indeed ; help me -- for I have exhausted all my powers .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 13]: It certainly requires much tact to present your heroine to your readers .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 67]: We are unfortunately denied what the ancients were so happy to possess , -- a whole _ cortege _ of divinities that might be summoned to help any great personage in , or the author out of , a difficulty ; but since we can not command their assistance , like the man in the play who forgot his part , we will do without it .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 19]: Now , have you thought of nothing new , for we must not plagiarise even from fashionable novels ?
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 29]: I have thought -- and thought -- and can find nothing new , unless we bring her in in a whirlwind : that has not yet been attempted .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 3]: A whirlwind !
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 9]: I do n't know -- that 's hazardous .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 114]: Nevertheless , if she were placed on a beetling cliff , overhanging the tempestuous ocean , lashing the rocks with its wild surge ; of a sudden , after she has been permitted to finish her soliloquy , a white cloud rising rapidly and unnoticed -- the sudden vacuum -- the rush of mighty winds through the majestic and alpine scenery -- the vortex gathering round her -- first admiring the vast efforts of nature ; then astonished ; and , lastly , alarmed , as she finds herself compelled to perform involuntary gyrations , till at length she spins round like a well-whipped top , nearing the dangerous edge of the precipice .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 15]: It is bold , and certainly quite novel -- I think it will do .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 32]: Portray her delicate little feet , peeping out , pointing downwards , the force of the elements raising her on her tip toes , now touching , now disdaining the earth .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 31]: Her dress expanded wide like that of Herbele in her last and best pirouette -- round , round she goes -- her white arms are tossed frantically in the air .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 9]: Corinne never threw herself into more graceful attitudes .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 81]: Now is seen her diminishing ankle -- now the rounded symmetry -- must n't go too high up though -- the wind increases -- her distance from the edge of the precipice decreases -- she has no breath left to shriek -- no power to fall -- threatened to be ravished by the wild and powerful god of the elements -- she is discovered by the Honourable Augustus Bouverie , who has just finished his soliloquy upon another adjacent hill .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 33]: He delights in her danger -- before he rushes to her rescue , makes one pause for the purpose of admiration , and another for the purpose of adjusting his shirt collar .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 5]: The devil he does !
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 4]: To be sure .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 10]: The hero of a fashionable novel never loses caste .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 34]: Whether in a storm , a whirlwind , up to his neck in the foaming ocean , or tumbling down a precipice , he is still the elegant and correct Honourable Augustus Bouverie .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 24]: To punish you for your interruption , I have a great mind to make him take a pinch of snuff before he starts .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 40]: Well -- he flies to her assistance -- is himself caught in the rushing vortex , which prevents him from getting nearer to the lady , and , despite of himself , takes to whirling in the opposite direction .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 45]: They approach -- they recede -- she shrieks without being heard -- holds out her arms for help -- she would drop them in despair , but can not , for they are twisted over her head by the tremendous force of the element .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 72]: One moment they are near to each other , and the next they are separated ; at one instant they are close to the abyss , and the waters below roar in delight of their anticipated victims , and in the next a favouring change of the vortex increases their distance from the danger -- there they spin -- and there you may leave them , and commence a new chapter .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 10]: But is not all this naturally and physically impossible ?
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 24]: By no means ; there is nothing supernatural in a whirlwind , and the effect of a whirlwind is to twist everything round .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 18]: Why should the heroine and the Honourable Augustus Bouverie not be submitted to the laws of nature ?
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 9]: besides , we are writing a fashionable novel .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 99]: Wild and improbable as this whirlwind may appear , it is within the range of probability : whereas , that is not at all adhered to in many novels -- witness the drinking scene in -- , and others equally _ outrees _ , in which the author , having turned probability out of doors , ends by throwing possibility out of the window -- leaving folly and madness to usurp their place -- and play a thousand antics for the admiration of the public , who , pleased with novelty , cry out `` How fine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 9]: Buy the book , and laud the author .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 2]: Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 49]: Now , having left your hero and heroine in a situation peculiarly interesting , with the greatest nonchalance , pass over to the continent , rave on the summit of Mont Blanc , and descant upon the strata which compose the mountains of the Moon in Central Africa .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 11]: You have been philosophical , now you must be geological .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 12]: No one can then say that your book is light reading .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 8]: That can be said of few novels .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 12]: In most of them even smoke assumes the ponderosity of lead .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 25]: There is a metal still heavier , which they have the power of creating -- gold -- to pay a dunning tailor 's bill .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 16]: But after being philosophical and geological , ought one not to be a little moral .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 2]: Pshaw !
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 7]: I thought you had more sense .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 22]: The great art of novel-writing is to make the vices glorious , by placing them in close alliance with redeeming qualities .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 85]: Depend upon it , Ansard , there is a deeper , more heartfelt satisfaction that mere amusement in novel-reading ; a satisfaction no less real , because we will not own it to ourselves ; the satisfaction of seeing all our favourite and selfish ideas dressed up in a garb so becoming , that we persuade ourselves that our false pride is proper dignity , our ferocity courage , our cowardice prudence , our irreligion liberality , and our baser appetites , mere gallantry .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 14]: Very true , Barnstaple ; but really I do not like this whirlwind .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 4]: Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 12]: I give it up then : it was your own idea .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 5]: We 'll try again .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 29]: Can not you create some difficulty or dilemma , in which to throw her , so that the hero may come to her rescue with _ eclat _ .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 6]: Her grey palfrey takes fright .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 10]: So will your readers ; stale -- quite stale !
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 17]: A wild bull has his horns close to her , and is about to toss her .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 6]: As your book would be !
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 5]: -- away with contempt .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 5]: Vapid -- quite vapid !
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 12]: A shipwreck -- the waves are about to close over her .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 17]: Your book would be closed at the same moment -- worn out -- quite worn out .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 26]: In the dead of the night , a fire breaks out -- she is already in the midst of the flames -- _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 15]: Where your book would also be by the disgusted reader -- worse and worse .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 21]: Confound it -- you will not allow me to expose her to earth , air , fire , or water .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 22]: I have a great mind to hang her in her garters , and make the hero come and cut her down .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 8]: You might do worse -- and better .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 5]: What -- hang myself ?
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 11]: That certainly would put an end to all your difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 45]: But , Ansard , I think I can put your heroine in a situation really critical and eminently distressing , and the hero shall come to her relief , like the descent of a god to the rescue of a Greek or Trojan warrior .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 9]: Or of Bacchus to Ariadne in her distress .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 5]: Perhaps a better simile .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 34]: The consequence will be , that eternal gratitude in the bosom of the maiden will prove the parent of eternal love , which eternity of passion will of course until they are married .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 5]: I 'm all attention .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 12]: Get up a splendid dinner party for their first casual meeting .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 6]: Place the company at table .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 15]: Surely you are not going to choke her with the bone of a chicken .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 18]: You surely are about to murder me , as Sampson did the Philistines -- _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 11]: With the jaw-bone of a fashionable novel-writer , you mean .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 2]: Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 18]: But to proceed : -- they are seated at table ; can you describe a grand dinner ?
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 10]: Certainly , I have partaken of more than one .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 2]: Where ?
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 13]: I once sat down three hundred strong at the Freemasons ' Tavern .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 2]: Pshaw !
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 5]: a mere hog feed .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 12]: Well , then , I dined with the late lord mayor .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 3]: Still worse .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 11]: My dear Ansard , it is however of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 20]: Nothing is more difficult to attain , yet nothing is more easy to describe , than a good dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 38]: I was once reading a very fashionable novel by a very fashionable bookseller , for the author is a mere nonentity , and was very much surprised at the accuracy with which a good dinner was described .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 40]: The mystery was explained a short time afterwards , when casually taking up Eustache Eude 's book in Sams 's library , I found that the author had copied it out exactly from the injunctions of that celebrated gastronome .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 6]: You can borrow the book .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 28]: Well , we will suppose that done ; but I am all anxiety to know what is the danger from which the heroine is to be rescued .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 4]: I will explain .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 44]: There are two species of existence -- that of mere mortal existence , which is of little consequence , provided , like Caesar , the hero and heroine die decently : the other is of much greater consequence , which is fashionable existence .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 40]: Let them once lose caste in that respect , and they are virtually dead , and one mistake , one oversight , is a death-blow for which there is no remedy , and from which there is no recovery .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 43]: For instance , we will suppose our heroine to be quite confounded with the appearance of our hero -- to have become _ distraite , reveuse _ -- and , in short , to have lost her recollection and presence of mind .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 11]: She has been assisted to _ filet de soles _ .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 42]: Say that the only sauce ever taken with them is _ au macedoine _ -- this is offered to her , and , at the same time , another , which to eat with the above dish would be unheard of .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 49]: In her distraction she is about to take the wrong sauce -- actually at the point of ruining herself for ever and committing suicide upon her fashionable existence , while the keen grey eyes of Sir Antinous Antibes , the arbiter of fashion , are fixed upon her .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 53]: At this awful moment , which is for ever to terminate her fashionable existence , the Honourable Augustus Bouverie , who sits next to her , gently touches her _ seduisante _ sleeve -- blandly smiling , he whispers to her that the _ other _ is the sauce _ macedoine _ .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 64]: She perceives her mistake , trembles at her danger , rewards him with a smile , which penetrates into the deepest recesses of his heart , helps herself to the right sauce , darts a look of contemptuous triumph upon Sir Antinous Antibes , and , while she is dipping her sole into the sauce , her soul expands with gratitude and love .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 6]: I see , I see .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 14]: Many thanks ; my heroine is now a fair counterpart of my hero .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 20]: `` Ah , sure a pair were never seen , So justly form 'd to meet by nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 14]: And now I 'll give you another hint , since you appear grateful .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 72]: It is a species of clap-trap in a novel , which always takes -- to wit , a rich old uncle or misanthrope , who , at the very time that he is bitterly offended and disgusted with the hero , who is in awkward circumstances , pulls out a pocketbook and counts down , say fifteen or twenty thousand pounds in bank notes , to relieve him from his difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 10]: An old coat and monosyllables will increase the interest .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 2]: True .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 6]: -LRB- _ sighing _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 14]: there are no such uncles in real life ; I wish there were .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 24]: I beg your pardon ; I know no time in which _ my uncle _ forks out more bank notes than at present .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 15]: Yes , but it is for value , or more than value , received .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 24]: That I grant ; but I am afraid it is the only `` uncle '' left now ; except in a fashionable novel .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 10]: But you comprehend the value of this new auxiliary .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 5]: Nothing can be better .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 13]: Barnstaple , you are really -- , but I say no more .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 27]: If a truly great man can not be flattered with delicacy , it must not be attempted at all ; silence then becomes the best tribute .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 9]: Your advice proves you to be truly great .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 17]: I am silent , therefore you understand the full force of the oratory of my thanks .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 7]: _ B -LRB- bowing _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 23]: Well , Ansard , you have found out the cheapest way of paying off your bills of gratitude I ever heard of .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 32]: `` Poor , even in thanks , '' was well said by Shakespeare ; but you , it appears , are rich , in having nothing at all wherewith to pay .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 17]: If you could transfer the same doctrine to your tradesmen , you need not write novels .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 10]: my dear fellow , mine is not yet written .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 34]: There is one important feature , nay , the most important feature of all -- the style of language , the diction -- on that , Barnstaple , you have not yet doctrinated .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 7]: _ B -LRB- pompously _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 57]: When Demosthenes was asked what were the principal attributes of eloquence , he answered , that the first was action ; on being asked which was the second , he replied , action ; and the third , action ; and such is the idea of the Irish _ mimbers _ in the House of Commons .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 14]: Now there are three important requisites in the diction of a fashionable novel .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 23]: The first , my dear fellow , is -- flippancy ; the second , flippancy ; and flippancy is also the third .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 41]: With the dull it will pass for wit , with some it will pass for scorn , -- and even the witty will not be enabled to point out the difference , without running the risk of being considered invidious .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 36]: It will cover every defect with a defect still greater ; for who can call small beer tasteless when it is sour , or dull when it is bottled and has a froth upon it ?
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 23]: The advice is excellent ; but I fear that this flippancy is as difficult to acquire an the tone of true eloquence .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 2]: Difficult !
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 16]: I defy the writers of the silver-fork school to write out of the style flippant .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 56]: Read but one volume of -- , and you will be saturated with it ; but if you wish to go to the fountain-head , do as have done most of the late fashionable novel-writers , repair to their instructors -- the lady 's - maid , for flippancy in the vein _ spirituelle _ !
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 49]: to a London footman for the vein critical ; but , if you wish a flippancy of a still higher order , at once more solemn and more empty , which I would call the vein political , read the speeches of some of our members of Parliament .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 43]: Only read them , I wish no man so ill an to inflict upon him the torture of hearing them -- read them , I say , and you will have taken the very highest degree in the order of inane flippancy .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 6]: I see it at once .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 10]: Your observations are as true as they are severe .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 106]: When we would harangue geese , we must condescend to hiss ; but still , my dear Barnstaple , though you have fully proved to me that in a fashionable novel all plot is unnecessary , do n't you think there ought to be a catastrophe , or sort of a kind of an end to the work , or the reader may be brought up short , or as the sailors say , `` all standing , '' when he comes to the word `` Finis , '' and exclaim with an air of stupefaction -- `` And then -- '' _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 17]: And then , if he did , it would be no more than the fool deserved .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 53]: I do n't know whether it would not be advisable to leave off in the middle of a sentence , of a word , nay of a syllable , if it be possible : I am sure the winding-up would be better than the lackadaisical running-down of most of the fashionable novels .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 49]: Snap the mainspring of your watch , and none but an ass can expect you to tell by it what it is o'clock ; snap the thread of your narrative in the same way , and he must be an unreasonable being who would expect a reasonable conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 26]: Finish thus , in a case of delicate distress ; say , `` The Honourable Mr Augustus Bouverie was struck in a heap with horror .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 35]: He rushed with a frantic grace , a deliberate haste , and a graceful awkwardness , and whispered in her ear these dread and awful words , ` IT IS TOO LATE ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 8]: Follow up with a -- and Finis .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 21]: I see ; the fair and agitated reader will pass a sleepless night in endeavouring to decipher the mutilated sentence .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 11]: She will fail , and consequently call the book delightful .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 15]: But should there not have been a marriage previously to this happy awful climax ?
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 38]: Yes ; everything is arranged for the nuptials -- carriages are sent home , jewellery received but not paid for , dresses all tried on , the party invited -- nay , assembled in the blue-and-white drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 110]: The right reverend my lord bishop is standing behind the temporary altar -- he has wiped his spectacles and thumbed his prayer-book -- all eyes are turned towards the door , which opens not -- the bride faints , for the bridegroom cometh not -- he 's not `` i ' the vein '' -- a something , as like nothing as possible , has given him a disgust that is surmountable -- he flings his happiness to the winds , though he never loved with more outrageous intensity than at the moment he discards his mistress ; so he fights three duels with the two brothers and father .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 42]: He wounds one of the young men dangerously , the other slightly ; fires his pistol in the air when he meets her father -- for how could he take the life of him who gave life to his adored one ?
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 21]: Your hero can always hit a man just where he pleases -- vide every novel in Mr C 's collection .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 9]: The hero becomes misanthropical , the heroine maniacal .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 65]: The former marries an antiquated and toothless dowager , as an escape from the imaginary disgust he took at a sight of a matchless woman ; and the latter marries an old brute , who threatens her life every night , and puts her in bodily fear every morning , as an indemnity in full for the loss of the man of her affections .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 35]: They are both romantically miserable ; and then comes on your tantalising scenes of delicate distress , and so the end of your third volume , and then finish without any end at all .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 3]: _ Verb .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 2]: sap .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 3]: sat _ .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 45]: Or , if you like it better , kill the old dowager of a surfeit , and make the old brute who marries the heroine commit suicide ; and , after all these unheard-of trials , marry them as fresh and beautiful as ever .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 4]: _ A _ .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 4]: A thousand thanks .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 13]: Your _ verba _ are not thrown to a _ sap _ .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 12]: Can I possibly do you any favour for all this kindness ?
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 4]: _ B _ .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 6]: Oh , my dear fellow !
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 4]: the very greatest .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 33]: As I see yours will be , at all points , a most fashionable novel , do me the inestimable favour _ not _ to ask me _ to read it _ .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 8]: HOW TO WRITE A BOOK OF TRAVELS .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 7]: MR ANSARD 'S _ Chambers _ .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 4]: -LRB- alone . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 57]: Well , I thought it hard enough to write a novel at the dictate of the bibliopolist ; but to be condemned to sit down and write my travels -- travels that have never extended farther than the Lincoln 's Inn Coffee House for my daily food , and a walk to Hampstead on a Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 16]: These travels to be swelled into Travels up the Rhine in the year 18 -- .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 6]: Why , it 's impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 14]: O that Barnstaple were here , for he has proved my guardian angel !
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 5]: Lazy , clever dog !
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 5]: _ Enter _ BARNSTAPLE .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 15]: Pray , my dear Ansard , to whom did you apply that last epithet ?
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 13]: My dear Barnstaple , I never was more happy to see you .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 17]: Sit down , I have much to tell you , all about myself and my difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 13]: The conversation promises to be interesting to me , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 7]: Everything is interesting to true friendship .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 9]: Now I perceive that you do want something .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 18]: Well , before you state your case , tell me , how did the novel go off ?
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 3]: Wonderfully well .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 34]: It was ascribed to Lord G -- : the bait took , and 750 went off in a first edition , and the remainder of the copies printed went off in a second .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 4]: Without being reprinted ?
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 2]: Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 28]: I was surprised at my success , and told my publisher so ; but he answered that he could sell an edition of any trash he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 5]: That was not flattering .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 14]: Not very ; but his bill was honoured , and that consoled me .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 33]: However , to proceed to business -- he has given me another order -- A Journey up the Rhine , in two volumes , large octavo , in the year 18 -- .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 10]: Now , Barnstaple , what 's to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 7]: Write it , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 15]: But you well know I have never been out of England in my life .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 6]: Never mind , write it .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 21]: Yes , it 's very well to say write it ; but how the devil am I to write it ?
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 32]: Write what I have never seen -- detail events which never occurred -- describe views of that which I have not even an idea -- travel post in my old arm-chair .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 16]: It 's all very well to say write it , but tell me , how .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 12]: I say again , write it , and pocket the money .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 12]: Ansard , allow me to state that you are a greenhorn .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 21]: I will make this mountain of difficulties vanish and melt away like snow before the powerful rays of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 29]: You are told to write what you have never seen ; but if you have not , others have , which will serve your purpose just as well .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 17]: To detail events which have never occurred -- invent them , they will be more amusing .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 30]: Describe views , etcetera , of which you are ignorant -- so are most of your readers ; but have we not the art of engraving to assist you ?
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 40]: To travel post in your arm-chair -- a very pleasant and a very profitable way of travelling , as you have not to pay for the horses and postilions , and are not knocked to pieces by continental roads .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 26]: Depend upon it , the best travels are those written at home , by those who have never put their foot into the Calais packet-boat .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 8]: To me this is all a mystery .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 11]: I certainly must be a greenhorn , as you observe .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 37]: Why , Ansard , my dear fellow , with a book of roads and a gazetteer , I would write a more amusing book of travels than one half which are now foisted on the public .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 12]: All you have to do is to fill up the chinks .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 29]: All I want to do is to fill up the chinks in my stomach , Barnstaple ; for , between you and me , times are rather queer .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 12]: You shall do it , if you will follow my advice .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 27]: I taught you how to write a fashionable novel ; it will be hard , indeed , if I can not send you up the Rhine .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 29]: One little expense must be incurred -- you must subscribe a quarter to a circulating library , for I wish that what you do should be well done .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 9]: Barnstaple , I will subscribe to -- anything .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 14]: Well , then , since you are so reasonable , I will proceed .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 36]: You must wade through all the various `` Journeys on the Rhine '' , `` Two Months on the Rhine '' , `` Autumns on the Rhine , '' etcetera , which you can collect .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 12]: This you will find the most tiresome part of your task .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 36]: Select one as your guide , one who has a reputation ; follow his course , not exactly -- that I will explain afterwards -- and agree with him in every thing , generally speaking .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 43]: Praise his exactitude and fidelity , and occasionally quote him ; this is but fair ; after you rob a man -LRB- and I intend you shall rifle him most completely -RRB- , it is but decent to give him kind words .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 11]: All others you must abuse , contradict , and depreciate .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 41]: Now , there is a great advantage in so doing : in the first place , you make the best writer your friend -- he forgets your larcenies in your commendation of him , and in your abuse of others .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 29]: If his work be correct , so must yours be ; he praises it everywhere -- perhaps finds you out , and asks you to dine with him .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 10]: How should I ever look at his injured face ?
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 19]: On the contrary , he is the obliged party -- your travels are a puff to his own .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 43]: But , Barnstaple , allowing that I follow this part of your advice , which I grant to be very excellent , how can I contradict others , when they may be , and probably are , perfectly correct in their assertions ?
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 12]: If they are so , virtue must be its own reward .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 33]: It is necessary that you write a book of travels , and all travellers contradict each other -- ergo , you must contradict , or nobody will believe that you have travelled .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 9]: Not only contradict , but sneer at them .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 12]: Well , now do explain how that is to be done .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 23]: Nothing more simple : for instance , a man measures a certain remarkable piece of antiquity -- its length is 747 feet .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 21]: You must measure it over again , and declare that he is in error , that it is only 727 .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 20]: To be sure of your being correct , measure it _ twice _ over , and then convict him .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 22]: But surely , Barnstaple , one who has measured it is more likely to be correct than one who has not .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 18]: I 'll grant you that he is correct to half an inch -- that 's no matter .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 28]: The public will , in all probability , believe you , because you are the last writer , and because you have _ decreased _ the dimensions .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 23]: Travellers are notorious for amplification , and if the public do not believe you , let them go and measure it themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 17]: A third traveller may hereafter measure it , and find that I am in the wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 19]: Ten to one if you are not both in the wrong ; but what matter will that be ?
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 7]: your book will have been sold .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 6]: Most true , O king !
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 23]: I perceive now the general outline , and I feel confident that , with your kind assistance , I may accomplish it .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 9]: But , Barnstaple , the beginning is everything .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 18]: If I only had the first chapter as a start , I think I could get on .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 13]: It is the _ modus _ that I want -- the style .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 19]: A first chapter would be a key-note for the remainder of the tune , with all the variations .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 9]: Well , then , take up your pen .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 26]: But before I commence , it may be as well to observe , that there is a certain method required , even in writing travels .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 12]: In every chapter you should have certain landmarks to guide you .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 29]: For instance , enumerate the following , and select the works from which they may be obtained , so as to mix up the instructive with the amusing .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 58]: Travelling -- remarks on country passed through -- anecdote -- arrival at a town -- churches -- population -- historical remarks -- another anecdote -- eating and drinking -- natural curiosities -- egotism -- remarks on the women -LRB- never mind the men -RRB- -- another anecdote -- reflections -- an adventure -- and go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 28]: You understand , Ansard , that in these memoranda you have all that is required ; the rule is not to be followed absolutely , but generally .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 18]: As you observed , such is to be the tune , but your variations may be infinite .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 38]: When at a loss , or you think you are dull , always call in a grisette , and a little mystery ; and , above all , never be afraid of talking too much about yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 17]: Many , many thanks ; but now , my dear Barnstaple , for the first chapter .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 28]: Let your style be flowery -- I should say florid -- never mind a false epithet or two in a page , they will never be observed .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 25]: A great deal depends upon the first two pages -- you must not limp at starting ; we will , therefore , be particular .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 4]: Take your pen .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 14]: -LSB- BARNSTAPLE _ muses for a while , and then continues _ . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 56]: `` A severe cough , which refused to yield even to the balmy influence of the genial spring of 18 -- , and threatened a pulmonary complaint , induced me to yield to the reiterated persuasions of my physicians to try a change of air , as most likely to ward off the threatened danger .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 12]: Where to direct my steps was the difficult point to ascertain .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 15]: Brighton , Torquay , Cromer , Ilfracombe , had all been visited and revisited .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 43]: At either of these fashionable resorts I was certain to fall in with a numerous acquaintance , whose persuasions would have induced me to depart from that regularity of diet and of rest , so imperiously insisted upon by my medical advisers .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 32]: After much cogitation , I resolved upon a journey up the Rhine , and to escape the ruthless winter of our northern clime in the more genial land of history . ''
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 17]: Land of history -- I presume you mean Italy ; but am I to go there ?
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 20]: No , you may recover , and come back again to skate upon the Serpentine , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 33]: You observe , Ansard , I have not made you a fellow with 50 pounds in his pocket , setting out to turn it into 300 pounds by a book of travels .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 79]: I have avoided mention of Margate , Ramsgate , Broadstairs , and all common watering-places ; I have talked of physicians in the plural ; in short , no one who reads that paragraph , but will suppose that you are a young man of rank and fortune , to whom money is no object , and who spends hundreds to cure that which might be effected by a little regularity , and a few doses of ipecacuanha .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 6]: I wish it were so .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 29]: Nevertheless , I 'll travel _ en grand seigneur _ -- thats more agreeable even in imagination , than being rumbled in a '' _ diligence _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 14]: And will produce more respect for your work , I can assure you .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 4]: But to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 13]: Always , when you leave England , talk about _ hospitality _ .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 5]: The English like it .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 15]: Have you no relations or friends in whose opinion you wish to stand well ?
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 19]: Public mention in print does wonders , especially with a copy handsomely bound `` from the author . ''
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 11]: Really , Barnstaple , I do not know any one .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 16]: My poor mother is in Cumberland , and that is not _ en route _ .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 35]: I have a maternal uncle of the name of Forster , who lives on the road -- a rich , old , miserly bachelor ; but I ca n't say much for his hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 17]: I have called upon him twice , and he has never even asked me to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 3]: Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 19]: People like being praised for a virtue which they do not possess -- it may prove a legacy .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 26]: Say , then , that you quitted the hospitable roof of your worthy and excellent-hearted relation , Mr Forster and felt -- _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 3]: Felt how ?
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 26]: How -- why you felt , as he wrung your hand , that there was a sudden dissolution of the ties of kindred and affection .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 16]: There always has been in that quarter , so my conscience is so far clear .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 33]: You arrive at Dovor -LRB- mind you spell it Dovor -RRB- -- go to bed tired and reflective -- embark early the next morning -- a rough passage -- _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 6]: And sea-sick , of course ?
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 21]: No , Ansard ; there I 'll give you a proof of my tact -- you sha n't be sea-sick .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 8]: But I 'm sure I should be .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 29]: All travellers are , and all fill up a page or two with complaints , _ ad nauseam _ -- for that reason sick you shall not be .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 47]: Observe -- to your astonishment you are not sea-sick : the other passengers suffer dreadfully ; one young dandy puffs furiously at a cigar in bravado , until he sends it over the side , like an arrow from the blow-pipe of a South American Indian .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 68]: Introduce a husband with a pretty wife -- he jealous as a dog , until he is sick as a cat -- your attentions -- she pillowed on your arms , while he hangs over the lee gunwale -- her gratitude -- safe arrival at Calais -- sweet smiles of the lady -- sullen deportment of the gentleman -- a few hints -- and draw the veil .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 4]: Do you understand ?
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 2]: Perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 6]: I can manage all that .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 22]: Then when you put your foot on shore , you must , for the first time , _ feel sea-sick _ .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 3]: On shore ?
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 17]: Yes ; reel about , not able to stand -- every symptom as if on board .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 32]: Express your surprise at the strange effect , pretend not to explain it , leave that to medical men , it being sufficient for you to state the _ fact _ .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 5]: The _ fact _ !
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 3]: O Barnstaple !
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 11]: That will be a great hit for a first chapter .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 7]: You reverse the order of things .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 6]: That I do most certainly .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 12]: Shall I finish the first chapter with that _ fact _ ?
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 12]: Travellers always go to bed at the end of each chapter .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 16]: It is a wise plan , and to a certain degree it must be followed .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 163]: You must have a baggage adventure -- be separated from it -- some sharp little urchin has seized upon your valise -- it is nowhere to be found -- quite in despair -- walk to the Hotel d'Angleterre , and find that you are met by the landlord and garcons , who inform you that your carriage is in the remise , and your rooms ready -- ascend to your bedroom -- find that your baggage is not only there , but neatly laid out -- your portmanteau unstrapped -- your trunk uncorded -- and the little rascal of a commissaire standing by with his hat in his hand , and a smile _ de malice _ , having installed _ himself _ as your _ domestique de place _ -- take him for his impudence -- praise the '' _ Cotelettes _ and the _ vin de Beaune _ '' -- wish the reader good night , and go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 6]: Thus ends the first chapter .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 21]: -LSB- ANSARD _ gets up and takes _ BARNSTAPLE 'S _ hand , which he shakes warmly without speaking _ .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 8]: BARNSTAPLE _ smiles and walks out _ .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 13]: ANSARD _ is left hard at work at his desk _ . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 17]: ARTHUR ANSARD _ in his Chambers , solus , with his pen in his hand _ .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 2]: Capital !
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 8]: that last was a _ hit _ .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 8]: It has all the appearance of reality .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 18]: To be sure , I borrowed the hint , but that nobody will be able to prove .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 6]: -LRB- _ Yawns _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 2]: Heigho !
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 18]: I have only got half way on my journey yet , and my ideas are quite exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 22]: I am as much worn out and distressed as one of the German post-horses which I described in my last chapter .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 12]: -LRB- _ Nods , and then falls fast asleep _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 15]: BARNSTAPLE _ taps at the door ; receiving no answer , he enters _ .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 5]: So -- quite fast .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 8]: What can have put him to sleep ?
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 11]: -LRB- _ Reads the manuscript on the table _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 11]: No wonder , enough to put anybody to sleep apparently .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 4]: Why , Ansard !
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 11]: -LRB- _ starting up , still half asleep _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 2]: Already ?
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 9]: Why , I 've hardly shut my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 18]: Well , I 'll be dressed directly ; let them get some _ cafe _ ready below .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 11]: Henri , did you order the hind-spring to be repaired !
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 11]: -LRB- _ Nods again with his eyes shut _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 2]: Hallo !
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 14]: What now , Ansard , do you really think that you are travelling ?
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 7]: -LRB- _ waking up _ -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 11]: Upon my word , Barnstaple , I was so dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 23]: I thought I was in my bed at the Hotel de Londres , after the fatiguing day 's journey I described yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 14]: I certainly have written myself into the conviction that I was travelling post .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 32]: All the better -- you have embodied yourself in your own work , which every writer of fiction ought to do ; but they can seldom attain to such a desideratum .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 11]: Now , tell me , how do you get on ?
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 6]: Thank you -- pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 13]: I have been going it with four post-horses these last three weeks .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 7]: And how far have you got ?
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 14]: Half way -- that is , into the middle of my second volume .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 27]: But I 'm very glad that you 're come to my assistance , Barnstaple ; for to tell you the truth , I was breaking down .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 12]: Yes , you said something about the hind-spring of your carriage .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 15]: That I can repair without your assistance ; but my spirits are breaking down .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 4]: I want society .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 7]: This travelling post is dull work .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 13]: Now , if I could introduce a companion -- _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 4]: So you shall .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 15]: At the next town that you stop at , buy a _ Poodle _ .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 5]: A _ Poodle _ !
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 2]: Barnstaple ?
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 11]: How the devil shall I be assisted by a poodle ?
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 24]: He will prove a more faithful friend to you in your exigence , and a better companion than one of your own species .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 25]: A male companion , after all , is soon expended , and a female , which would be more agreeable , is not admissible .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 13]: If you admit a young traveller into your carriage -- what then ?
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 34]: He is handsome , pleasant , romantic , and so forth ; but you must not give his opinions in contradiction to your own , and if they coincide , it is superfluous .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 29]: Now , a poodle is a dog of parts , and it is more likely that you fall in with a sagacious dog than with a sagacious man .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 44]: The poodle is the thing ; you must recount your meeting , his purchase , size , colour , and qualifications , and anecdotes of his sagacity , vouched for by the landlord , and all the _ garcons _ of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 26]: As you proceed on your travels , his attachment to you increases , and wind up every third chapter with `` your faithful Mouton . ''
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 8]: Will not all that be considered frivolous ?
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 2]: Frivolous !
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 4]: by no means .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 61]: The frivolous will like it , and those who may have more sense , although they may think that Mouton does not at all assist your travelling researches , are too well acquainted with the virtues of the canine race , and the attachment insensibly imbibed for so faithful an attendant , not to forgive your affectionate mention of him .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 13]: Besides it will go far to assist the verisimilitude of your travels .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 14]: As for your female readers , they will prefer Mouton even to you .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 32]: All-powerful and mighty magician , whose wand of humbug , like that of Aaron 's , swallows up all others , not excepting that of divine Truth , I obey you !
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 24]: Mouton shall be summoned to my aid : he shall flourish , and my pen shall flourish in praise of his endless perfections .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 11]: But , Barnstaple , what shall I give for him ?
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 7]: -LRB- _ thinks awhile _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 6]: Not less than forty louis .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 6]: Forty louis for a poodle !
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 8]: Most certainly ; not a sou less .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 17]: The value of any thing in the eyes of the world is exactly what it costs .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 48]: Mouton , at a five-franc piece , would excite no interest ; and his value to the reader will increase in proportion to his price , which will be considered an undeniable proof of all his wonderful sagacity , with which you are to amuse the reader .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 9]: But in what is to consist his sagacity ?
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 7]: He must do everything but speak .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 19]: Indeed , he must so far speak as to howl the first part of `` Lieber Augustin . ''
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 11]: His instinct shall put our boasted reason to the blush .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 14]: But -- I think I had better not bring him home with me .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 4]: Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 41]: In the first place , it 's absolutely necessary to kill him , lest his reputation should induce people to seek him out , which they would do , although , in all probability , they never will his master .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 13]: Lady Cork would certainly invite him to a literary _ soiree _ .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 56]: You must therefore kill him in the most effective way possible , and you will derive the advantage of filling up at least ten pages with his last moments -- licking your hand , your own lamentations , violent and inconsolable grief on the part of Henri , and tanning his skin as a memorial .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 11]: A beautiful episode , for which receive my best thanks .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 13]: But , Barnstaple , I have very few effective passages as yet .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 36]: I have remodelled several descriptions of mountains , precipices , waterfalls , and such wonders of the creation -- expressed my contempt and surprise at the fear acknowledged by other travellers , in several instances .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 37]: I have lost my way twice -- met three wolves -- been four times benighted -- and indebted to lights at a distance for a bed at midnight , after the horses have refused to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 13]: All is incident , and I am quite hard up for description .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 25]: Now , I have marked down a fine passage in -- 's work -- a beautiful description of a cathedral with a grand procession .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 6]: -LRB- _ Reads _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 58]: `` What with the effect of the sun 's brightest beams upon the ancient glass windows -- various hues reflected upon the gothic pillars -- gorgeousness of the procession -- sacerdotal ornaments -- tossing of censers -- crowds of people -- elevation of the host , and sinking down of the populace _ en masse _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 15]: It really is a magnificent line of writing , and which my work requires .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 27]: One or two like that in my book would do well to be quoted by impartial critics , before the public are permitted to read it .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 10]: But here , you observe , is a difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 7]: I dare not borrow the passage .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 27]: But you shall borrow it -- you shall be even finer than he is , and yet he shall not dare to accuse you of plagiarism .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 9]: How is that possible , my dear Barnstaple ?
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 5]: I am all impatience .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 11]: His description is at a certain hour of the day .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 16]: All you have to do is to portray the scene in nearly the same words .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 24]: You have as much right to visit a cathedral as he has , and as for the rest -- here is the secret .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 9]: You must visit it at _ night _ .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 55]: Instead of `` glorious beams , '' you will talk of `` pale melancholy light ; '' instead of `` the stained windows throwing their various hues upon the gothic pile , '' you must `` darken the massive pile , and light up the windows with the silver rays of the moon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 69]: The glorious orb of day must give place to thousands of wax tapers -- the splendid fret -- work of the roof you must regret was not to be clearly distinguished -- but you must be in ecstasies with the broad light and shade -- the blaze at the altar -- solemn hour of night -- feelings of awe -- half a Catholic -- religious reflections , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 5]: Do n't you perceive ?
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 3]: I do .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 15]: Like the rest of my work , it shall be all _ moonshine _ .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 20]: It shall be done , Barnstaple ; but have you not another idea or two to help me with ?
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 6]: Have you talked about cooks ?
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 7]: As yet , not a word .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 12]: By this time you ought to have some knowledge of gastronomy .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 5]: Talk seriously about eating .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 6]: -LRB- _ writes _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 6]: I have made a memo .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 6]: Have you had no affront ?
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 3]: Not one .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 2]: B .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 48]: Then be seriously affronted -- complain to the burgomaster , or mayor , or commandant , whoever it may be -- they attempt to bully -- you are resolute and firm as an Englishman -- insist upon being righted -- they must make you a thousand apologies .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 13]: This will tickle the national vanity , and be read with interest .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 6]: -LRB- _ writes _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 5]: I have been affronted .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 12]: Anything else which may proceed from your prolific brain , Barnstaple ?
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 7]: Have you had a serious illness ?
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 7]: Never complained even of a headache .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 37]: Then do everything but die -- Henri weeping and inconsolable -- Mouton howling at the foot of your bed -- kick the surgeons out of the room -- and cure yourself with three dozen of champagne .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 6]: -LRB- _ writes _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 31]: Very sick -- cured with three dozen of champagne -- I wish the illness would in reality come on , if I were certain of the cure _ gratis _ .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 7]: Go on , my dear Barnstaple .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 44]: You may work in an episode here -- delirium -- lucid intervals -- gentle female voice -- delicate attentions -- mysterious discovery from loquacious landlady -- eternal gratitude -- but no marriage -- an apostrophe -- and all the rest left to conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 7]: -LRB- _ writes down _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 13]: Silent attentions -- conjecture -- I can manage that , I think .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 12]: By the bye , have you brought in Madame de Stael ?
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 12]: No -- how the devil am I to bring her in ?
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 12]: As most other travellers do , by the head and shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 12]: Never mind that , so long as you bring her in .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 6]: -LRB- _ writes _ -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 16]: Madame de Stael by the shoulders -- that 's not very polite towards a lady .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 9]: These hints are invaluable ; pray go on .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 16]: Why , you have already more hints this morning than are sufficient for three volumes .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 8]: But , however , let me see .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 9]: -LRB- _ Barnstaple thinks a little _ -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 6]: Find yourself short of cash .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 6]: A sad reality , Barnstaple .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 14]: I shall write this part well , for truth will guide my pen .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 4]: All the better .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 25]: But to continue -- no remittances -- awkward position -- explain your situation -- receive credit to any amount -- and compliment your countrymen .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 6]: -LRB- _ writes _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 8]: Credit to any amount -- pleasing idea .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 15]: But I do n't exactly perceive the value of this last hint , Barnstaple .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 46]: All judicious travellers make it a point , throughout the whole of their works , to flatter the nation upon its wealth , name , and reputation in foreign countries ; by doing so you will be read greedily , and praised in due proportion .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 50]: If ever I were to write my travels into the interior of Africa , or to the North Pole , I would make it a point to discount a bill at Timbuctoo , or get a cheque cashed by the Esquimaux , without the least hesitation in either case .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 52]: I think now , that what with your invention , your plagiarism , and my hints , you ought to produce a very effective Book of Travels ; and with that feeling I shall leave you to pursue your Journey , and receive , at its finale , your just reward .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 12]: When we meet again , I hope to see you advertised .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 9]: Yes , but not exposed , I trust .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 9]: I am _ incognito _ , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 14]: To be sure , that will impart an additional interest to your narrative .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 11]: All the world will be guessing who you may be .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 4]: Adieu , voyageur .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 7]: -LSB- _ Exit _ BARNSTAPLE . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 10]: And Heaven forfend that they should find me out !
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 6]: But what can be done ?
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 43]: In brief , I can not get a brief , and thus I exercise my professional acquirements how I can , proving myself as long-winded , as prosy perhaps , and certainly as lying , as the more fortunate of my fraternity .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY NINE .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 6]: HOW TO WRITE A ROMANCE .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 31]: MR ARTHUR ANSARD , _ standing at his table , selecting a steel pen from a card on which a dozen are ranged up , like soldiers on parade _ .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 15]: I must find a regular _ graver _ to write this chapter of horrors .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 9]: No goose quill could afford me any assistance .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 3]: Now then .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 27]: Let me see -- -LRB- _ Reads , and during his reading _ BARNSTAPLE _ comes in at the door behind him , unperceived _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 108]: `` At this most monstrously appalling sight , the hair of Piftlianteriscki raised slowly the velvet cap from off his head , as if it had been perched upon the rustling quills of some exasperated porcupine -- -LRB- I think that 's new -RRB- -- his nostrils dilated to that extent that you might , with ease , have thrust a musket bullet into each -- his mouth was opened so wide , so unnaturally wide , that the corners were rent asunder , and the blood slowly trickled down each side of his bristly chin -- while each tooth loosened from its socket with individual fear .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 91]: -- Not a word could he utter , for his tongue , in its fright , clung with terror to his upper jaw , as tight as do the bellies of the fresh and slimy soles , paired together by some fisherwoman ; but if his tongue was paralysed , his heart was not -- it throbbed against his ribs with a violence which threatened their dislocation from the sternum , and with a sound which reverberated through the dark , damp subterrene -- '' I think that will do .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 7]: There 's _ force _ there .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 7]: There is , with a vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 7]: Why , what is all this ?
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 7]: My dear Barnstaple , you here !
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 9]: I 'm writing a romance for B -- .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 10]: It is to be supposed to be a translation .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 32]: The Germans will be infinitely obliged to you ; but , my dear fellow , you appear to have fallen into the old school -- that 's no longer in vogue .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 8]: My orders are for the old school .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 9]: B -- was most particular on that point .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 12]: He says that there is a re-action -- a great re-action .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 5]: What , on literature ?
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 10]: Well , he knows as well as any man .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 21]: I only wish to God there was in everything else , and we could see the good old times again .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 19]: To confess the truth , I did intend to have finished this without saying a word to you .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 7]: I wished to have surprised you .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 16]: So you have , my dear fellow , with the few lines I have heard .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 16]: How the devil are you to get your fellow out of that state of asphyxia ?
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 18]: By degrees -- slowly -- very slowly -- as they pretend that we lawyers go to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 20]: But I 'll tell you what I have done , just to give you an idea of my work .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 33]: In the first place , I have a castle perched so high up in the air , that the eagles , even in their highest soar , appear but as wrens below .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 5]: That 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 59]: And then it has subterraneous passages , to which the sewers of London are a mere song ; and they all lead to a small cave at high-water mark on the sea-beach , covered with brambles and bushes , and just large enough at its entrance to admit of a man squeezing himself in : _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 5]: That 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 51]: You can not be too much underground ; in fact , the two first , and the best part of the third volume , should be wholly in the bowels of the earth , and your hero and heroine should never _ come to light _ until the last chapter .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 17]: Then they would never have been born till then , and how could I marry them ?
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 52]: But still I have adhered pretty much to your idea ; and , Barnstaple , I have such a heroine -- such a love -- she has never seen her sweetheart , yet she is most devotedly attached , and has suffered more for his sake than any mortal could endure .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 5]: Most heroines generally do .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 88]: I have had her into various dungeons for three or four years , on black bread and a broken pitcher of water -- she has been starved to death -- lain for months and months upon wet straw -- had two brain fevers -- five times has she risked violation , and always has picked up , or found in the belt of her infamous ravishers , a stiletto , which she has plunged into their hearts , and they have expired with or without a groan .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 33]: Excellent : and of course comes out of her dungeons each time as fresh , as sweet , as lovely , as pure , as charming , and as constant as ever .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 36]: Exactly ; nothing can equal her infinite variety of adventure , and her imperishable beauty and unadhesive cleanliness of person ; and , as for lives , she has more than a thousand cats ' .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 35]: After nine months ' confinement in a dungeon , four feet square , when it is opened for her release , the air is perfumed with the ambrosia which exhales from her sweet person .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 5]: Of course it does .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 10]: The only question is , what ambrosia smells like .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 9]: But let me know something about your hero .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 8]: He is a prince and a robber .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 9]: The two professions are not at all incompatible .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 3]: Go on .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 18]: He is the chief of a band of robbers , and is here , there and everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 12]: He fills all Europe with terror , admiration , and love .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 3]: Very good .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 50]: His reasons for joining the robbers are , of course , a secret -LRB- and upon my word they are equally a secret to myself -RRB- ; but it is wonderful the implicit obedience of his men , and the many acts of generosity of which he is guilty .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 44]: I make him give away a great deal more money than his whole band ever take , which is so far awkward , that the query may arise in what way he keeps them together , and supplies them with food and necessaries .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 11]: Of course with _ IOUs _ upon his princely domains .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 75]: I have some very grand scenes , amazingly effective ; for instance , what do you think , at the moment after the holy mass has been performed in Saint Peter 's at Rome , just as the pope is about to put the sacred wafer into his mouth and bless the whole world , I make him snatch the wafer out of the pope 's hand , and get clear off with it .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 7]: What for , may I ask ?
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 10]: That is a secret which I do not reveal .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 12]: The whole arrangement of that part of the plot is admirable .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 17]: The band of robbers are disguised as priests , and officiate , without being found out .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 7]: But is n't that rather sacrilegious ?
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 41]: No ; it appears so to be , but he gives his reasons for his behaviour to the pope , and the pope is satisfied , and not only gives him his blessing , but shows him the greatest respect .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 8]: They must have been very weighty reasons .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 7]: And therefore they are not divulged .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 13]: That is to say , not until the end of the work .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 24]: They are never divulged at all ; I leave a great deal to the reader 's imagination -- people are fond of conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 15]: All they know is , that he boldly appears , and demands an audience .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 29]: He is conducted in , the interview is private , after a sign made by our hero , and at which the pope almost leaps off the chair .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 18]: After an hour he comes out again , and the pope bows him to the very door .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 14]: Every one is astonished , and , of course , almost canonise him .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 11]: That 's going it rather strong in a Catholic country .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 11]: But tell me , Ansard , what is your plot ?
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 6]: Plot ; I have none .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 3]: No plot !
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 7]: No plot , and all plot .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 8]: I puzzle the reader with certain materials .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 17]: I have castles and dungeons , corridors and creaking doors , good villains and bad villains .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 16]: Chain armour and clank of armour , daggers for gentlemen , and stilettoes for ladies .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 43]: Dark forests and brushwood , drinking scenes , eating scenes , and sleeping scenes -- robbers and friars , purses of gold and instruments of torture , an incarnate devil of a Jesuit , a handsome hero , and a lovely heroine .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 20]: I jumble them all together , sometimes above , and sometimes underground , and I explain nothing at all .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 5]: Have you nothing supernatural ?
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 3]: O yes !
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 35]: I 've a dog whose instinct is really supernatural , and I have two or three visions , which may be considered so , as they tell what never else could have been known .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 51]: I decorate my caverns and dungeons with sweltering toads and slimy vipers , a constant dropping of water , with chains too ponderous to lift , but which the parties upon whom they are riveted , clang together as they walk up and down in their cells , and soliloquise .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 7]: So much for my underground scenery .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 52]: Above , I people the halls with pages and ostrich feathers , and knights in bright armour , a constant supply of generous wine , and goblets too heavy to lift , which the knights toss off at a draught , as they sit and listen to the minstrel 's music .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 6]: Bravo , Ansard , bravo .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 14]: It appears to me that you do not want assistance in this romance .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 28]: No , when I do I have always a holy and compassionate friar , who pulls a wonderful restorative or healing balm , out of his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 24]: The puffs of Solomon 's Balm of Gilead are a fool to the real merits of my pharmacopoeia contained in a small vial .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 33]: And pray what may be the title of this book of yours , for I have known it take more time to fix upon a title than to write the three volumes .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 21]: I call it _ The Undiscovered Secret _ , and very properly so too , for it never is explained .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 14]: But if you please , I will read you some passages from it .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 8]: I think you will approve of them .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 14]: For instance , now let us take this , in the second volume .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 41]: You must know , that Angelicanarinella -LRB- for that is the name of my heroine -RRB- is thrown into a dungeon not more than four feet square , but more than six hundred feet below the surface of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 56]: The ways are so intricate , and the subterranean so vast , and the dungeons so numerous , that the base Ethiop , who has obeyed his master 's orders in confining her , has himself been lost in the labyrinth , and has not been able to discover what dungeon he put her in .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 69]: For three days he has been looking for it , during which our heroine has been without food , and he is still searching and scratching his woolly head in despair , as he is to die by slow torture , if he does not reproduce her -- for you observe , the chief who has thrown her into his dungeon is most desperately in love with her .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 33]: That of course ; and that is the way to prove romantic love -- you ill treat -- but still she is certainly in a dilemma , as well as the Ethiop .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 12]: Granted ; but she talks like the heroine of a romance .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 2]: Listen .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 7]: -LRB- ANSARD _ reads _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 71]: `` The beauteous and divinely moulded form of the angelic Angelicanarinella pressed the dank and rotten straw which had been thrown down by the scowling , thick-lipped Ethiop for her repose -- she , for whom attendant maidens had smoothed the Sybaritic sheet of finest texture , under the elaborately carved and sumptuously gilt canopy , the silken curtains , and the tassels of the purest dust of gold . ''
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 6]: Tassels of dust of gold !
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 6]: only figuratively , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 3]: Nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 92]: `` Each particular straw of this dank , damp bed was elastic with delight , at bearing such angelic pressure ; and , as our heroine cast her ineffably beaming eyes about the dark void , lighting up with their effulgent rays each little portion of the dungeon , as she glanced them from one part to another , she perceived that the many reptiles enclosed with her in this narrow tomb , were nestling to her side , their eyes fixed upon her in mute expressions of love and admiration .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 41]: Her eclipsed orbs were each , for a moment , suffused with a bright and heavenly tear , and from the suffusion threw out a more brilliant light upon the feeling reptiles who paid this tribute to her undeserved sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 141]: She put forth her beauteous hand , whose ` faint tracery ' -- -LRB- I stole that from Cooper -RRB- -- whose faint tracery had so often given to others the idea that it was ethereal , and not corporeal , and lifting with all the soft and tender handling of first love a venerable toad , which smiled upon her , she placed the interesting animal so that it could crawl up and nestle in her bosom , ` Poor child of dank , of darkness , and of dripping , ' exclaimed she , in her flute-like notes , ` who sheltereth thyself under the wet and mouldering wall , so neglected in thy form by thy mother Nature , repose awhile in peace where princes and nobles would envy thee , if they knew thy present lot .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 63]: But that shall never be ; these lips shall never breathe a tale which might endanger thy existence ; fear not , therefore , their enmity , and as thou slowly creepest away thy little round of circumscribed existence , forget me not , but shed an occasional pearly tear to the memory of the persecuted , the innocent Angelicanarinella ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 6]: What d'ye think of that ?
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 2]: Umph !
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 12]: a very warm picture certainly ; however , it is natural .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 18]: You know , a person of her consequence could never exist without a little _ toadyism _ .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 24]: I have a good many subterraneous soliloquies , which would have been lost for ever , if I did not bring them up .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 15]: That one you have just read is enough to make everybody else bring up .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 7]: I rather plume myself upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 23]: Yes , it is a feather in your cap , and will act as a feather in the throat of your readers .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 26]: Now I 'll turn over the second volume , and read you another _ morceau _ , in which I assume the more playful vein .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 26]: I have imitated one of our modern writers , who must be correct in her language , as she knows all about heroes and heroines .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 10]: I must confess that I 've cribbed a little .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 4]: Let 's hear .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 21]: `` The lovely Angelicanarinella _ pottered _ for some time about this fairy chamber , then ` wrote journal . '
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 37]: At last , she _ threw herself down on the floor _ , pulled out the miniature , _ gulped _ when she looked at it , and then _ cried herself to sleep _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 8]: _ Pottered _ and _ gulped _ !
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 7]: What language do you call that ?
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 9]: It 's all right , my dear fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 20]: I understand that it is the refined slang of the modern boudoir , and only known to the initiated .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 10]: They had better keep it entirely to their boudoirs .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 10]: I should advise you to leave it all out .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 21]: Well , I thought that one who was so very particular , must have been the standard of perfection herself .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 7]: That does not at all follow .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 24]: But what I wish to read to you is the way in which I have managed that my secret shall never be divulged .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 7]: It is known only to four .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 7]: A secret known to four people !
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 6]: You must be quick then .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 63]: So I am , as you shall hear ; they all meet in a dark gallery , but do not expect to meet any one but the hero , whom they intend to murder , each one having , unknown to the others , made an appointment with him for that purpose , on the pretence of telling him the great secret .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 24]: Altogether the scene is well described , but it is long , so I 'll come at once to the _ denouement _ .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 3]: Pray do .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 30]: `` Absenpresentini felt his way by the slimy wall , when the breath of another human being caught his ear : he paused , and held his own breath .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 25]: ` No , no , ' muttered the other , ` the _ secret of blood and gold _ shall remain with me alone .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 11]: Let him come , and he shall find death . '
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 22]: In a second , the dagger of Absenpresentini was in the mutterer 's bosom : -- he fell without a groan .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 21]: ` To me alone the secret of blood and gold , and with me it remains , ' exclaimed Absenpresentini .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 46]: ` It does remain with you , ' cried Phosphorini , driving his dagger into his back : -- Absenpresentini fell without a groan , and Phosphorini , withdrawing his dagger , exclaimed , ` Who is now to tell the secret but me ? '
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 20]: ` Not you , ' cried Vortiskini , raising up his sword and striking at where the voice proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 17]: The trusty steel cleft the head of the abandoned Phosphorini , who fell without a groan .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 22]: ` Now will I retain the secret of blood and gold , ' said Vortiskini , as he sheathed his sword .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 28]: ` Thou shalt , ' exclaimed the wily Jesuit , as he struck his stiletto to the heart of the robber , who fell without a groan .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 31]: ` With me only does the secret now rest , by which our order might be disgraced ; with me it dies , ' and the Jesuit raised his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 18]: ` Thus to the glory and the honour of his society does Manfredini sacrifice his life . '
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 15]: He struck the keen-pointed instrument into his heart , and died without a groan .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 9]: ` Stop , ' cried our hero . ''
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 24]: And I agree with your hero : stop , Ansard , or you 'll kill me too -- but not without a groan .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 9]: Do n't you think it would act well ?
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 14]: Quite as well as it reads ; pray is it all like this ?
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 6]: You shall judge for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 19]: I have half killed myself with writing it , for I chew opium every night to obtain ideas .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 7]: Now again -- _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 23]: Spare me , Ansard , spare me ; my nerves are rather delicate ; for the remainder I will take your word .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 84]: I wish my duns would do the same , even if it were only my washerwoman ; but there 's no more tick for me here , except this old watch of my father 's , which serves to remind me of what I can not obtain from others -- time ; but , however , there is a time for all things , and when the time comes that my romance is ready , my creditors will obtain the _ ready _ .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 6]: Your only excuse , Ansard .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 7]: The public require strong writing now-a-days .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 21]: We have thousands who write well , and the public are nauseated with what is called _ good writing _ .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 9]: And so they want something bad , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 10]: Well , Ansard , you certainly can supply them .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 26]: My dear Barnstaple , you must not disparage this style of writing -- it is not bad -- there is a great art in it .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 9]: It may be termed writing intellectual and ethereal .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 17]: You observe , that it never allows probabilities or even possibilities to stand in its way .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 20]: The dross of humanity is rejected : all the common wants and grosser feelings of our natures are disallowed .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 11]: It is a novel which is all mind and passion .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 19]: Corporeal attributes and necessities are thrown on one side , as they would destroy the charm of perfectability .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 38]: Nothing can soil , or defile , or destroy my heroine ; suffering adds lustre to her beauty , as pure gold is tried by fire : nothing can kill her , because she is all mind .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 18]: As for my men , you will observe when you read my work -- _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 4]: When I do !
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 43]: Which , of course , you will -- that they also have their appetites in abeyance ; they never want to eat , or drink , or sleep -- are always at hand when required , without regard to time or space .
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 12]: Now there is a great beauty in this description of writing .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 23]: The women adore it because they find their sex divested of those human necessities , without which they would indeed be angels !
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 20]: the mirror is held up to them , and they find themselves perfect -- no wonder they are pleased .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 34]: The other sex are also very glad to dwell upon female perfectability , which they can only find in a romance , although they have often dreamt of it in their younger days .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 8]: There is some truth in these remarks .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 54]: Every milliner 's girl , who devours your pages in bed by the half-hour 's light of tallow stolen for the purpose , imagines a strong similarity between herself and your Angelicanarinella , and every shop-boy measuring tape or weighing yellow soap will find out attributes common to himself and to your hero .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 2]: Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 37]: As long as you draw perfection in both sexes , you are certain to be read , because by so doing you flatter human nature and self-love , and transfer it to the individual who reads .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 11]: Now a picture of real life -- _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 42]: Is like some of Wouvermans ' best pictures , which will not be purchased by many , because his dogs in the foreground are doing exactly what all dogs will naturally do when they first are let out of their kennels .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 27]: Wouvermans should have known better , and made his dogs better mannered if he expected his pictures to be hung up in the parlour of refinement .
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 6]: _ Barnstaple _ Very true .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 11]: Perhaps you would like to have another passage or two .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 9]: Excuse me : I will imagine it all .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 16]: I only hope , Ansard , this employment will not interfere with your legal practice .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 4]: _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 19]: My dear Barnstaple , it certainly will not , because my legal practice can not be interfered with .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 16]: I have been called to the bar , but find no employment in my calling .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 30]: I have been sitting in my gown and wig for one year , and may probably sit a dozen more before I have to rise to address their lordships .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 9]: I have not yet had a guinea brief .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 27]: My only chance is to be sent out as judge to Sierra Leone , or perhaps to be made a commissioner of the Court of Requests .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 8]: You are indeed humble in your aspirations .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 39]: I recollect the time , Ansard , when you dreamt of golden fame , and aspired to the woolsack -- when your ambition prompted you to midnight labour , and you showed an energy -- _ Ansard _ .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 19]: -LRB- _ putting his hands up to his forehead , with his elbows on the table _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 7]: What can I do , Barnstaple ?
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 18]: If I trust to briefs , my existence will be but brief -- we all must live .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 4]: _ Barnstaple _ .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 50]: I will not reply as Richelieu did to a brother author , `` Je ne vois pas la necessite ; '' but this I do say , that if you are in future to live by supplying the public with such nonsense , the shorter your existence the better .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTY .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 7]: THE LEGEND OF THE BELL ROCK .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 17]: There was a grand procession through the streets of the two towns of Perth and Dundee .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 105]: The holy abbots , in their robes , walked under gilded canopies , the monks chanted , the censers were thrown , flags and banners were carried by seamen , lighted tapers by penitents ; Saint Antonio , the patron of those who trust to the stormy ocean , was carried in all pomp through the streets ; and , as the procession passed , coins of various value were thrown down by those who watched it from the windows , and , as fast as thrown were collected by little boys dressed as angels , and holding silver vessels to receive the largesses .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 20]: During the whole day did the procession continue , and large was the treasure collected in the two towns .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 66]: Every one gave freely , for there were few , indeed none , who , if not in their own circle , at least among their acquaintances , had to deplore the loss of some one dear to them , or to those they visited , from the dangerous rock which lay in the very track of all the vessels entering the Firth of Tay .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 92]: These processions had been arranged , that a sufficient sum of money might be collected to enable them to put in execution a plan proposed by an adventurous and bold young seaman , in a council held for the purpose , of fixing a bell on the rock , which could be so arranged that the slightest breath of wind would cause the hammer of it to sound , and thus , by its tolling , warn the mariner of his danger ; and the sums given were more than sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 69]: A meeting was then held , and it was unanimously agreed that Andrew M'Clise should be charged with the commission to go over to Amsterdam , and purchase the bell of a merchant residing there , whom Andrew stated to have one in his possession , which , from its fine tone and size , was exactly calculated for the purport to which it was to be appropriated .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 13]: Andrew M'Clise embarked with the money , and made a prosperous voyage .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 72]: He had often been at Amsterdam , and had lived with the merchant , whose name was Vandermaclin ; and the attention to his affairs , the dexterity and the rapidity of the movements of Andrew M'Clise , had often elicited the warmest encomiums of Mynheer Vandermaclin ; and many evenings had Andrew M'Clise passed with him , drinking in moderation their favourite scheedam , and indulging in the meditative merschaum .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 38]: Vandermaclin had often wished that he had a son like Andrew M'Clise , to whom he could leave his property , with the full assurance that the heap would not be scattered , but greatly added to .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 5]: Vandermaclin was a widower .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 33]: He had but one daughter , who was now just arrived at an age to return from the pension to her father 's house , and take upon herself the domestic duties .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 9]: M'Clise had never yet seen the beautiful Katerina .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 65]: `` And so , Mynheer M'Clise , '' said Vandermaclin , who was sitting in the warehouse on the ground-floor of his tenement , `` you come to purchase the famous bell of Utrecht ; with the intention of fixing it upon that rock , the danger of which we have so often talked over after the work of the day has been done ?
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 23]: I , too , have suffered from that same rock , as you well know ; but still I have been fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 24]: The price will be heavy ; and so it ought to be , for the bell itself is of no small weight . ''
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 12]: `` We are prepared to pay it , Mynheer Vandermaclin . ''
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 22]: `` Nevertheless , in so good a cause , and for so good a purport , you shall not be overcharged .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 18]: I will say nothing of the beauty of the workmanship , or even of the mere manufacture .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 25]: You shall pay but its value in metal ; the same price which the Jew Isaacs offered me for it but four months ago .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 23]: I will not ask what a Jew would ask , but what a Jew would give , which makes no small difference .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 7]: Have you ten thousand guilders ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 8]: `` I have , and more . ''
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 30]: `` That is my price , Mynheer M'Clise , and I wish for no more ; for I , too , will contribute my share to the good work .
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 11]: Are you content , and is it a bargain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 22]: `` It is ; and the holy abbots will thank you on vellum , Mynheer Vandermaclin , for your generosity . ''
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 26]: `` I prefer the thanks of the bold seamen to those of the idle churchmen ; but , never mind , it is a bargain .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 15]: Now , we will go in ; it is time to close the doors .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 20]: We will take our pipes , and you shall make the acquaintance of my fair daughter , Katerina . ''
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 45]: At the time we are speaking of , M'Clise was about six-and-twenty years of age ; he was above the middle size , elegant in person , and with a frankness and almost nobility in his countenance , which won all who saw him .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 16]: His manners were like those of most seamen , bold , but not offensively so .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 21]: His eye was piercing as an eagle 's ; and it seemed as if his very soul spoke from it .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 26]: At the very first meeting between him and the daughter of Vandermaclin , it appeared to both as if their destinies were to unite them .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 26]: They loved not as others love , but with an intensity which it would be impossible to portray ; but they hardly exchanged a word .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 14]: Again and again they met ; their eyes spoke , but nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 23]: The bell was put on board the vessel , the money had been paid down , and M'Clise could no longer delay .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 25]: He felt as if his heart-strings were severed as he tore himself away from the land where all remained that he coveted upon earth .
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 53]: And Katerina , she too felt as if her existence was a blank ; and as the vessel sailed from the port , she breathed short ; and when not even her white and lofty topgallant sail could be discovered as a speck , she threw herself on her couch and wept .
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 34]: And M'Clise as he sailed away , remained for hours leaning his cheek on his hand , thinking of , over and over again , every lineament and feature of the peerless Katerina .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 23]: Two months passed away , during which M'Clise was busied every ebb of the tide in superintending the work on the rock .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 27]: At last , all was ready ; and once more was to be beheld a gay procession ; but this time it was on the water .
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 65]: It was on a calm and lovely summer 's morn , that the abbots and the monks , attended by a large company of the authorities , and others , who were so much interested in the work in hand , started from the shore of Aberbrothwick in a long line of boats , decorated with sacred and with other various banners and devices .
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 32]: The music floated along the water , and the solemn chants of the monks were for once heard where never yet they had been heard before , or ever will again .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 32]: M'Clise was at the rock , in a small vessel purposely constructed to carry the bell , and with sheers to hang it on the supports imbedded in the solid rock .
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 39]: The bell was in its place , and the abbot blessed the bell ; and holy water was sprinkled on the metal , which was for the future to be lashed by the waves of the salt sea .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 33]: And the music and the chants were renewed ; and as they continued , the wind gradually rose , and with the rising of the wind the bell tolled loud and deep .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 103]: The tolling of the bell was the signal for return , for it was a warning that the weather was about to change , and the procession pulled back to Aberbrothwick , and landed in good time ; for in one hour more , and the rocky coast was again lashed by the waves , and the bell tolled loud and quick , although there were none there but the sea-gull , who screamed with fright as he wheeled in the air at this unusual noise upon the rock , which , at the ebb he had so often made his resting-place .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 22]: M'Clise had done his work ; the bell was fixed ; and once more he hastened with his vessel to Amsterdam .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 23]: Once more was he an inmate of Vandermaclin 's house ; once more in the presence of the idol of his soul .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 16]: This time they spoke ; this time their vows were exchanged for life and death .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 10]: But Vandermaclin saw not the state of their hearts .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 44]: He looked upon the young seamen as too low , too poor , to be a match for his daughter ; and as such an idea never entered his head , so did he never imagine that he would have dared to love .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 34]: But he was soon undeceived ; for M'Clise frankly stated his attachment , and demanded the hand of Katerina ; and , at the demand , Vandermaclin 's face was flushed with anger .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 64]: `` Mynheer M'Clise , '' said he , after a pause , as if to control his feelings ; `` when a man marries , he is bound to show that he has wherewithal to support his wife ; to support her in that rank , and to afford her those luxuries to which she has been accustomed in her father 's house .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 20]: Show me that you can do so , and I will not refuse you the hand of Katerina . ''
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 30]: `` As yet , I have not , '' replied M'Clise ; `` but I am young and can work ; I have money , and will gain more .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 22]: Tell me what sum do you think that I should possess to warrant my demanding the hand of your daughter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 16]: `` Produce twelve thousand guilders , and she is yours , '' replied the merchant .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 11]: `` I have but three thousand , '' replied M'Clise .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 9]: `` Then , think no more of Katerina .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 12]: It is a foolish passion , and you must forget it .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 16]: And , Mynheer M'Clise , I must not have my daughter 's affections tampered with .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 17]: She must forget you ; and that can only be effected by your not meeting again .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 16]: I wish you well , Mynheer M'Clise , but I must request your absence . ''
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 16]: M'Clise departed from the presence of the merchant , bowed down with grief and disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 22]: He contrived that a letter , containing the result of his application , should be put in the hands of Katerina .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 55]: But Vandermaclin was informed of this breach of observance , and Katerina was sent to a convent , there to remain until the departure of her lover ; and Vandermaclin wrote to his correspondent at Dundee , requesting that the goods forwarded to him might not be sent by the vessel commanded by M'Clise .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 8]: Of this our young captain received information .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 15]: All hope was nearly gone ; still he lingered , and delayed his departure .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 18]: He was no longer the active , energetic seaman ; he neglected all , even his attire .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 40]: M'Clise knew in which convent his fair Katerina had been immured ; and often would he walk round its precincts , with the hope of seeing her , if it were but for a moment , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 13]: His vessel was now laden , and he could delay no longer .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 36]: He was to sail the next morning ; and once more did the unhappy young man take his usual walk to look at those walls which contained all that was dear to him on earth .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 33]: His reverie was broken by a stone falling down to his feet ; he took it up ; there was a small piece of paper attached to it with a silken thread .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 24]: He opened it ; it was the handwriting of Katerina , and contained but two words -- '' _ The Bell _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 3]: The bell !
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 11]: M'Clise started ; for he immediately comprehended what was meant .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 10]: The whole plan came like electricity through his brain .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 10]: Yes ; then there was a promise of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 24]: The bell was worth ten thousand guilders ; that sum had been offered , and would now be given by Isaacs the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 18]: He would be happy with his Katerina ; and he blessed her ingenuity for devising the means .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 16]: For a minute or two he was transported ; but the re-action soon took place .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 7]: What was he about to attempt ?
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 4]: sacrilege -- cruelty .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 20]: The bell had been blessed by the holy church ; it had been purchased by holy and devout alms .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 34]: It had been placed on the rock to save the lives of his brother seamen ; and were he to remove it , would he not be responsible for all the lives lost ?
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 23]: Would not the wail of the widow , and the tears of the orphan , be crying out to Heaven against him ?
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 4]: No , no !
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 2]: never !
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 34]: The crime was too horrible ; and M'Clise stamped upon the paper , thinking he was tempted by Satan in the shape of woman ; but when woman tempts , man is lost .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 37]: He recalled the charms of Katerina ; all his repugnance was overcome ; and he resolved that the deed should be accomplished , and that Katerina should be gained , even if he lost his soul .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 13]: Andrew M'Clise sailed away from Amsterdam , and Katerina recovered her liberty .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 21]: Vandermaclin was anxious that she should marry : and many were the suitors for her hand , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 38]: She reminded her father , that he had pledged himself , if M'Clise counted down twelve thousand guilders , that she should be his wife ; and to that pledge she insisted that he was bound fast .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 86]: And Vandermaclin after reasoning with her , and pointing out to her that twelve thousand guilders was a sum so large , that M'Clise might not procure until his old age , even if he were fortunate , acknowledged that such was his promise , and that he would , like an honest man , abide by it , provided that M'Clise should fulfil his part of the agreement in the space of two years ; after which he should delay her settlement no longer .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 22]: And Katerina raised her eyes to heaven , and whispered , as she clasped her hands , `` The Bell . ''
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 30]: that we should invoke Heaven when we would wish to do wrong : but mortals are blind , and none so blind as those who are impelled by passion .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 70]: It was in the summer of that year that M'Clise had made his arrangements : having procured the assistance of some lawless hands , he had taken the advantage of a smooth and glassy sea and a high tide to remove the bell on board his own vessel ; a work of little difficulty to him , as he had placed it there , and knew well the fastenings .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 19]: He sailed away for Amsterdam , and was permitted by Heaven to arrive safe with his sacrilegious freight .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 29]: He did not , as before , enter the canal opposite to the house of Vandermaclin , but one that ran behind the habitation of the Jew Isaacs .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 44]: At night , he went into the house , and reported to the Jew what he had for sale ; and the keen grey eyes of the bent-double little Israelite sparkled with delight , for he knew that his profit would be great .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 53]: At midnight the bell was made fast to the crane , and safely deposited in the warehouse of the Jew , who counted out the ten thousand guilders to the enraptured M'Clise , whose thoughts were wholly upon the possession of his Katerina , and not upon the crime he had committed .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 4]: But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 25]: to conceal one crime , we are too often obliged to be guilty of even deeper ; and thus it was with Andrew M'Clise .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 45]: The people who had assisted , upon the promise of a thousand guilders being divided among them , now murmured at their share , and insisted upon an equal division of the spoils , or threatened with an immediate confession of the black deed .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 31]: M'Clise raved , and cursed , and tore his hair ; promised to give them the money as soon as he had wedded Katerina ; but they would not consent .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 19]: Again the devil came to his assistance , and whispered how he was to act : he consented .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 10]: The next night the division was to be made .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 30]: They met in his cabin ; he gave them wine , and they drank plentifully ; but the wine was poisoned , and they all died before the morning .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 48]: M'Clise tied weights to their bodies , and sunk them in the deep canal ; broke open his hatches , to make it appear that his vessel had been plundered ; and then went to the authorities denouncing his crew as having plundered him , and escaped .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 25]: Immediate search was made , but they were not to be found ; and it was supposed that they had escaped in a boat .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 47]: Once more M'Clise , whose conscience was seared , went to the house of Vandermaclin , counted down his twelve thousand guilders , and claimed his bride ; and Vandermaclin , who felt that his daughter 's happiness was at stake , now gave his consent .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 41]: As M'Clise stated that he was anxious to return to England , and arrange with the merchants whose goods had been plundered , in a few days the marriage took place ; and Katerina clasped the murderer in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 47]: All was apparent joy and revelry ; but there was anguish in the heart of M'Clise , who , now that he had gained his object , felt that it had cost him much too dear , for his peace of mind was gone for ever .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 40]: But Katerina cared not ; every spark of feeling was absorbed in her passion , and the very guilt of M'Clise but rendered him more dear ; for was it not for her that he had done all this ?
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 32]: M'Clise received her portion , and hasted to sail away ; for the bodies were still in the canal , and he trembled every hour lest his crime should be discovered .
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 32]: And Vandermaclin bade farewell to his daughter : and , he knew not why , but there was a feeling he could not suppress , that they never should meet again .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 8]: `` Down -- down below , Katerina !
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 21]: this is no place for you , '' cried M'Clise , as he stood at the helm of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 14]: `` Down , dearest , down , or you will be washed overboard .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 16]: Every sea threatens to pour into our decks ; already have we lost two men .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 4]: Down , Katerina !
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 7]: down , I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 12]: `` I fear not ; let me remain with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 8]: `` I tell you , down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 18]: cried M'Clise , in wrath ; and Katerina cast upon him a reproachful look , and obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 31]: The storm was at its height ; the sun had set , black and monstrous billows chased each other , and the dismasted vessel was hurried on towards the land .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 17]: The wind howled , and whistled sharply at each chink in the bulwarks of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 13]: For three days had they fought the gale , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 24]: Now , if it continued , all chance was over ; for the shore was on their lee , distant not many miles .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 24]: Nothing could save them , but gaining the mouth of the Firth of Tay , and then they could bear up for Dundee .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 81]: And there was a boiling surge , and a dark night , and roaring seas , and their masts were floating far away ; and M'Clise stood at the helm , keeping her broadside to the sea : his heart was full of bitterness , and his guilty conscience bore him down , and he looked for death , and he dreaded it ; for was he not a sacrilegious murderer , and was there not an avenging God above ?
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 13]: Once more Katerina appeared on deck , clinging for support to Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 7]: `` I can not stay below .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 10]: Tell me , will it soon be over ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 21]: `` Yes , '' replied M'Clise , gloomily ; `` it will soon be over with all of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 5]: `` How mean you ?
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 9]: you told me there was no danger . ''
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 24]: `` I told you falsely ; there is death soon , and damnation afterwards ; for you I have lost my soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 5]: say not so . ''
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 5]: `` I say it .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 14]: Leave me , leave me , woman , or I curse thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 6]: `` Curse me , Andrew ?
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 4]: Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 23]: Kiss me , Andrew ; and if we are to perish , let us expire in each other 's arms . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 12]: 'T is as well ; you have dragged me to perdition .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 14]: Leave me , I say , for you have my bitter curse . ''
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 19]: Thus was his guilty love turned to hate , now that death was staring him in the face .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 5]: Katerina made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 17]: She threw herself on the deck , and abandoned herself to her feeling of bitter anguish .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 35]: And as she lay there , and M'Clise stood at the helm , the wind abated ; the vessel was no longer borne down as before , although the waves were still mountains high .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 27]: The seamen on board rallied ; some fragments of sail were set on the remnants of the masts , and there was a chance of safety .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 9]: M'Clise spoke not , but watched the helm .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 14]: The wind shifted in their favour ; and hope rose in every heart .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 13]: The Firth of Tay was now open , and they were saved !
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 22]: Light was the heart of M'Clise when he kept away the vessel , and gave the helm up to the mate .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 37]: He hastened to Katerina , who still remained on the deck , raised her up , whispered comfort and returning love ; but she heard not -- she could not forget -- and she wept bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 9]: `` We are saved , dear Katerina ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 9]: `` Better that we had been lost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 5]: replied she , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 5]: `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 15]: say not so , with your own Andrew pressing you to his bosom . ''
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 7]: `` Your bitter curse ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 14]: 'T was madness -- nothing -- I knew not what I said . ''
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 9]: But the iron had entered into her soul .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 5]: Her heart was broken .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 26]: `` You had better give orders for them to look out for the Bell Rock , '' observed the man at the helm to M'Clise .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 4]: The Bell Rock !
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 8]: M'Clise shuddered , and made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 40]: Onward went the vessel , impelled by the sea and wind : one moment raised aloft , and towering over the surge ; at another , deep in the hollow trough , and walled in by the convulsed element .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 26]: M'Clise still held his Katerina in his arms , who responded not to his endearments , when a sudden shock threw them on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 32]: The crashing of the timbers , the pouring of the waves over the stern , the heeling and settling of the vessel , were but the work of a few seconds .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 23]: One more furious shock , -- she separates , falls on her beam ends , and the raging seas sweep over her .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 18]: M'Clise threw from him her whom he had so madly loved , and plunged into the wave .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 14]: Katerina shrieked , as she dashed after him , and all was over .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 65]: When the storm rises , and the screaming sea-gull seeks the land , and the fisherman hasten his bark towards the beach , there is to be seen , descending from the dark clouds with the rapidity of lightning , the form of Andrew M'Clise , the heavy bell to which he is attached by the neck , bearing him down to his doom .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 79]: And when all is smooth and calm , when at the ebbing tide , the wave but gently kisses the rock , then by the light of the silver moon , the occupants of the vessels which sail from the Firth of Tay , have often beheld the form of the beautiful Katerina , waving her white scarf as a signal that they should approach , and take her off from the rock on which she is seated .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 44]: At times , she offers a letter for her father , Vandermaclin ; and she mourns and weeps as the wary mariners , with their eyes fixed on her , and with folded arms , pursue their course in silence and in dread .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 4]: CHAPTER FIFTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 2]: MOONSHINE .
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 44]: Those who have visited our West India possessions must have often been amused with the humour and cunning which occasionally appear in a negro more endowed than the generality of his race , particularly when the master also happens to be a humourist .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 32]: The swarthy servitor seems to reflect his patron 's absurdities ; and having thoroughly studied his character , ascertains how far he can venture to take liberties without fear of punishment .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 64]: One of these strange specimens I once met with in a negro called Moonshine , belonging to a person equally strange in his own way , who had , for many years , held the situation of harbour-master at Port Royal , but had then retired on a pension , and occupied a small house at Ryde , in the Isle of Wight .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 28]: His name was Cockle , but he had long been addressed as Captain Cockle ; and this brevet rank he retained until the day of his death .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 47]: In person he was very large and fat -- not unlike a cockle in shape : so round were his proportions , and so unwieldy , that it appeared much easier to roll him along from one place to another , than that he should walk .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 50]: Indeed , locomotion was not to his taste : he seldom went much farther than round the small patch of garden which was in front of his house , and in which he had some pinks and carnations and chrysanthemums , of which he was not a little proud .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 38]: His head was quite bald , smooth , and shining white ; his face partook of a more roseate tint , increasing in depth till it settled into an intense red at the tip of his nose .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 41]: Cockle had formerly been a master of a merchant-vessel , and from his residence in a warm climate had contracted a habit of potation , which became confirmed during the long period of his holding his situation at Port Royal .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 31]: He had purchased Moonshine for three hundred dollars , when he was about seven years old , and , upon his return to England , had taken him with him .
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 33]: Moonshine was very much attached to his master , very much attached to having his own way , and was , farther , very much attached to his master 's grog bottle .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 29]: The first attachment was a virtue : the second human nature ; and the third , in the opinion of old Cockle , a crime of serious magnitude .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 38]: I very often called upon Captain Cockle , for he had a quaint humour about him which amused ; and , as he seldom went out , he was always glad to see any of his friends .
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 26]: Another reason was , that I seldom went to the house without finding some entertainment in the continual sparring between the master and the man .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 24]: I was at that time employed in the Preventive Service , and my station was about four miles from the residence of Cockle .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 21]: One morning I stalked in , and found him , as usual , in his little parlour on the ground-floor .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 13]: `` Well , Cockle , my boy , how are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 16]: `` Why , to tell you the truth , Bob , I 'm all wrong .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 30]: I 'm on the stool of repentance ; to wit , on this easy chair , doing penance , as you perceive , in a pair of duck trousers .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 23]: Last night I was half-seas over , and tolerably happy ; this morning I am high and dry , and intolerably miserable .
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 32]: Carried more sail than ballast last night , and lost my head ; this morning I 've found it again , with a pig of ballast in it , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 8]: All owing to my good nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 8]: `` How is that , Cockle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 47]: `` Why , that Jack Piper was here last night ; and rather than he should drink all the grog and not find his way home , I drank some myself -- he 'd been in a bad way if I had not , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 15]: -- and now , you see , I 'm suffering all from good nature .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 27]: Easiness of disposition has been my ruin , and has rounded me into this ball , by wearing away all my sharp edges , Bob . ''
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 31]: `` It certainly was very considerate and very kind of you , Cockle , especially when we know how much you must have acted at variance with your inclinations . ''
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 16]: `` Yes , Bob , yes , I am the milk punch of human kindness .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 18]: I often cry -- when the chimney smokes ; and sometimes -- when I laugh too much .
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 31]: You see , I not only give my money , as others will do , but , as last night , I even give my head to assist a fellow-creature .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 17]: I could , however , dispense with it for an hour or two this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 31]: `` Nay , do n't say that ; for although you might dispense with the upper part , you could not well get on without your mouth , Cockle . ''
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 48]: `` Very true , Bob ; a chap without a mouth would be like a ship without a companion hatch ; -- talking about that , the combings of my mouth are rather dry -- what do you say , Bob , shall we call Moonshine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 11]: `` Why it 's rather broad daylight for Moonshine . ''
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 15]: `` He 's but an eclipse -- a total eclipse , I may say .
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 33]: The fact is , my head is so heavy , that it rolls about on my shoulders ; and I must have a stiffener down my throat to prop it it up .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 11]: So Moonshine , shine out , you black-faced rascal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 19]: The negro was outside , cleaning his knives : -- he answered , but continued at his work .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 18]: `` How me shine , Massa Cockle , when you neber gib me _ shiner _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 37]: `` No : but I 'll give you a _ shinner _ on your lower limb , that shall make you feel planet-struck , if you do n't show your ugly face , '' replied Cockle .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 12]: `` Massa Cockle , you full of dictionary dis marning . ''
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 7]: `` Come here , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 34]: `` Why you so parsonal dis marning , sar , '' replied Moonshine , rubbing away at the knifeboard -- `` my face no shine more dan your white skull widout hair . ''
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 23]: `` I pulled one out , you scoundrel , every time you stole my grog , and now they are all gone .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 40]: -- Hairs ; what should I do with heirs when I 've nothing to leave , '' continued Cockle , addressing me -- `` hairs are like rats , that quit a ship as soon as she gets old .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 15]: Now , Bob , I wonder how long that rascal will make us wait .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 20]: I brought him home and gave him his freedom -- but give an inch and he takes an ell .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 18]: Moonshine , I begin to feel angry -- the tip of my nose is red already . ''
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 8]: `` Come directly , Massa Cockle . ''
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 15]: Moonshine gave two more rubs on the board , and then made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 8]: `` You call me , sar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 14]: `` What 's the use of calling you , you black rascal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 43]: `` Now sar , dat not fair -- you say to me , Moonshine , always do one thing first -- so I ` bey order and finish knives -- dat ting done , I come and ` bey next order . ''
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 12]: `` Well , bring some cold water and some tumblers . ''
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 19]: Moonshine soon appeared with the articles , and then walked out of the room , grinning at me .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 11]: `` Moonshine , where are you going , you thief ?
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 19]: -- when did you ever see me drink cold water , or offer it to my friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 35]: `` Neber see you drink it but once , and den you tipsy , and tink it gin ; but you very often gib notin but water to your friends , Massa Cockle . ''
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 7]: `` When , you scoundrel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 16]: `` Why , very often you say dat water quite strong enough for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 10]: `` That 's because I love you , Moonshine .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 9]: Grog is a sad enemy to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 20]: `` Massa Cockle real fine Christian -- he lub him enemy , '' interrupted Moonshine , looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 25]: `` At all events , I 'm not ashamed to look mine enemy in the face -- so hand us out the bottle . ''
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 8]: Moonshine put the bottle on the table .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 20]: `` Now , Bob , '' said Cockle , `` what d'ye say to a _ seven bell-er _ ?
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 4]: Why , hallo !
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 9]: what 's become of all the grog ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 13]: `` All drank last night , Massa Cockle , '' replied Moonshine .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 39]: `` Now , you ebony thief , I 'll swear that there was half a bottle left when I took my last glass ; for I held the bottle up to the candle to ascertain the ullage . ''
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 15]: `` When you go up tairs , Massa Cockle , so help me Gad !
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 9]: not one drop left in de bottle . ''
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 19]: `` Will you take your oath , Moonshine , that you did not drink any last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 26]: `` No , Massa Cockle , because I gentleman , and neber tell lie -- me drink , because you gib it to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 9]: `` Then I must have been drunk indeed .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 13]: Now , tell me , how did I give it to you ?
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 9]: -- tell me every word which passed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 14]: `` Yes , Massa Cockle , me make you recollect all about it .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 36]: When Massa Piper go away , you look at bottel and den you say , ` ` Fore I go up to bed , I take one more glass for _ coming _ up . '
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 22]: -- Den I say , ` ` Pose you do , you nebber be able to _ go up _ . '
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 29]: Den you say , ` Moonshine , you good fellow -LRB- you always call me good fellow when you want me -RRB- , you must help me . '
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 26]: You drink you grog -- you fall back in de chair , and you shut first one eye , and den you shut de oder .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 28]: I see more grog on the table : so I take up de bottel and I say , ` Massa Cockle , you go up stairs ? '
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 12]: and you say , ` Yes , yes -- directly . '
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 20]: Den I hold de bottel up and say to you , ` Massa , shall I help you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 15]: and you say , ` Yes , you must _ help _ me . '
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 18]: So den I take one glass of grog , 'cause you tell me to help you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 15]: `` I did n't tell you to help yourself though , you scoundrel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 25]: `` Yes , Massa , when you tell me to help you with de bottel , I ` bey order , and help myself .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 66]: Den , sar , I waits little more , and I say , ` Massa now you go up ` tairs , ' and you start up and you wake , and you say , ` Yes , yes ; ' and den I hold up and show you bottel again , and I say , ` Shall I _ help _ you massa ? '
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 8]: and den you say ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 13]: So I ` bey order again , and take one more glass .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 45]: Den you open mouth and you snore -- so I look again and I see one little glass more in bottel , and I call you , ` Massa Cockle , Massa Cockle , ' and you say , ` high -- high ! '
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 41]: -- and den you head fall on you chest , and you go sleep again -- so den I call again and I say ; ` Massa Cockle , here one lilly more drop , shall I drink it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 36]: and you nod you head on you bosom , and say noting -- so I not quite sure , and I say again , ` Massa Cockle , shall I finish this lilly drop ? '
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 8]: and you nod you head once more .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 29]: Den I say , ` all right , ' and I say , ` you very good helt , Massa Cockle ; ' and I finish de bottel .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 18]: Now , Massa , you ab de whole tory , and it all really for true . ''
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 28]: I perceived that Cockle was quite as much amused at this account of Moonshine 's as I was myself , but he put on a bluff look .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 21]: `` So , sir , it appears that you took advantage of my helpless situation , to help yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 32]: `` Massa Cockle , just now you tell Massa Farren dat you drink so much , all for good nature Massa Piper -- I do same all for good nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 67]: `` Well , Mr Moonshine , I must have some grog , '' replied Cockle , `` and as you helped yourself last night , now you must help me ; -- get it how you can , I give you just ten minutes -- '' '' ` Pose you give gib me ten shillings , sar , '' interrupted Moonshine , `` dat better . ''
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 6]: `` Cash is all gone .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 17]: I hav n't a skillick till quarter-day , not a shot in the locker till Wednesday .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 17]: Either get me some more grog , or you 'll get more kicks than halfpence . ''
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 19]: `` You no ab money -- you no ab tick -- how I get grog , Massa Cockle ?
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 40]: Missy O'Bottom , she tells me , last _ quarter _ day , no pay _ whole _ bill , she not _ half _ like it ; she say you great deceiver , and no trust more . ''
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 6]: `` Confound the old hag !
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 41]: Would you believe it , Bob , that Mrs Rowbottom has wanted to grapple with me these last two years -- wants to make me landlord of the Goose and Pepper-box , taking her as a fixture with the premises .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 21]: I suspect I should be the goose and she the pepper-box ; -- but we never could shape that course .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 25]: In the first place , there 's too much of her ; and , in the next , there 's too much of me .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 48]: I explained this to the old lady as well as I could ; and she swelled up as big as a balloon , saying , that , when people were really _ attached _ , they never _ attached _ any weight to such trifling obstacles . ''
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 13]: `` But you must have been sweet upon her , Cockle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 21]: `` Nothing more than a little sugar to take the nauseous taste of my long bill out of her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 15]: As for the love part of the story , that was all her own .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 39]: I never contradict a lady , because it 's not polite ; but since I explained , the old woman has huffed , and wo n't trust me with half a quartern -- will she , Moonshine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 24]: `` No , sar : when I try talk her over , and make promise , she say dat _ all moonshine _ .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 16]: But , sar , I try ` gain -- I tink I know how . ''
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 17]: And Moonshine disappeared , leaving us in the dark as to what his plans might be .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 14]: `` I wonder you never did marry , Cockle , '' I observed .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 10]: `` You would not wonder if you knew all .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 17]: I must say , that once , and once only , I was very near it .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 15]: And to whom do you think it was -- a woman of colour . ''
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 6]: `` A black woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 21]: `` No : not half black , only a quarter -- what they call a quadroon in the West Indies .
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 5]: But , thank Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 5]: she refused me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 4]: `` Refused you ?
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 20]: hang it , Cockle , I never thought that you had been refused by a woman of colour . ''
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 6]: `` I was , though .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 7]: You shall hear how it happened .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 47]: She had been the quadroon wife -LRB- you know what that means -RRB- of a planter of the name of Guiness ; he died , and not only bequeathed her her liberty , but also four good houses in Port Royal , and two dozen slaves .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 20]: He had been dead about two years , and she was about thirty , when I first knew her .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 46]: She was very rich , for she had a good income and spent nothing , except in jewels and dress to deck out her own person , which certainly was very handsome , even at that time , for she never had had any family .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 33]: Well , if I was not quite in love with her , I was with her houses and her money ; and I used to sit in her verandah and talk sentimental .
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 7]: One day I made my proposal .

Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 16]: ` Pose I ` cept your offer , you must change you name . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 16]: ` Suppose you accept my offer , Mistress Guiness , you 'll change your name .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 16]: I do n't know how I am to change mine , ' I replied . ''
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 24]: ` I make ` quiry , Massa Cockle , and I find that by act and parliament you get another name . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 7]: ` An act of parliament ! '

Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 40]: ` Yes , sar ; and I pay five hundred gold Joe ` fore I hear people call me Missy Cockle -- dat _ shell _ fish , ' said she , and she turned up her nose . ''
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 17]: said I , ` and pray what is the next thing which you wish ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 66]: ` De oder ting , sar , is , you no ab _ coat am arms _ , no ab seal to your watch , with bird and beast ` pon 'em ; now ` pose you promise me dat you take oder name , and buy um coat am arms ; den , sar , I take de matter into ` sideration . ' ''

Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 22]: `` Well , that was a very odd sort of a wind-up to a proposal ; but here comes Moonshine . ''
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 16]: The black entered the room , and put a full bottle down on the table .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 13]: `` Dare it is , sar , '' said he , grinning .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 20]: `` Well , done , Moonshine , now I forgive you ; but how did you manage it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 32]: `` Me tell you all de tory , sar -- first I see Missy O'Bottom , and I say , ` How you do , how you find himsel dis marning ?

Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 7]: `` The devil you did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 29]: roared Cockle ; `` now I shall be bothered again with that old woman ; I wish she was moored as a buoy to the Royal George . ''
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 7]: `` Massa no hear all yet .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 14]: I say , ` Miss O'Bottom , ` pose you no tell ? '
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 5]: ` I tell . '

Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 19]: Den he say , ` Moonshine , gib me one glass grog , den I hab courage . '

Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 17]: ` But , ' say Missy O'Bottom , ` why he no send for some ? '
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 17]: ` 'Cause , ' I say , ` quarter-day no come -- money all gone . '
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 69]: -- Den say she , ` If you poor massa so _ very _ bad , den I trust you one bottel -- you gib my compliments and say , I very appy to see him , and stay at home , ' -- Den I say , ` Missy O'Bottom pose massa not come soon as he take one two glass grog cut my head off . '
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 6]: Dat all , sar . ''
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 8]: `` That 's all , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 12]: A pretty scrape you have got me into , you scoundrel !
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 8]: What 's to be done now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 39]: `` Why , let 's have a glass of grog first , Cockle , '' replied I , `` we 've been waiting a long while for it , and we 'll then talk the matter over . ''
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 57]: `` Bob , you 're sensible , and the old woman was no fool in sending the liquor -- it requires _ Dutch _ courage to attack such a Dutch-built old schuyt ; let 's get the cobwebs out of our throats , and then we must see how we can get out of this scrape .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 18]: I expect that I shall pay ` dearly for my whistle ' this time I wet mine .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 11]: Now , what 's to be done , Bob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 20]: `` I think that you had better leave it to Moonshine , '' said I. `` So I will .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 22]: -- Now , sir , as you have got me into this scrape , you must get me out of it .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 5]: -- D'ye hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 15]: `` Yes , Massa Cockle , I tink -- but no ab courage . ''
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 24]: `` I understand you , you sooty fellow -- here , drink this , and see if it will brighten up your wits .
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 16]: He 's a regular turnpike , that fellow , every thing must pay toll . ''
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 27]: `` Massa Cockle , I tell Missy O'Bottom dat you come soon as you hab two glass grog ; ` pose you only drink one . ''
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 24]: `` That wo n't do , Moonshine , for I 'm just mixing my second ; you must find out something better . ''
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 28]: `` One glass grog , massa , gib no more dan one tought -- dat you ab -- '' `` Well , then , here 's another .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 42]: -- Now recollect , before you drink it , you are to get me out of this scrape ; if not , you get into a scrape , for I 'll beat you as -- as white as snow . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 25]: ` Pose you no _ wash _ nigger white , you no _ mangle _ him white , Massa Cockle , '' added Moonshine .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 17]: `` The fellow 's _ ironing _ me , Bob , ar 'n' t he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 5]: said Cockle , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 12]: `` Now , before you drink , recollect the conditions . ''
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 26]: `` Drink first , sar , make sure of dat , '' replied Moonshine , swallowing off the brandy ; `` tink about it afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 3]: -- Eh !
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 35]: I ab it , '' cried Moonshine , who disappeared , and Cockle and I continued in conversation over our grog , which to sailors is acceptable in any one hour in the twenty-four .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 13]: About ten minutes afterwards Cockle perceived Moonshine in the little front garden .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 14]: `` There 's that fellow , Bob ; what is he about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 19]: `` Only picking a nosegay , I believe , '' replied I , looking out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 12]: `` The rascal , he must be picking all my chrysanthemums .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 6]: Stop him , Bob . ''
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 15]: But Moonshine vaulted over the low pales , and there was no stopping him .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 51]: It was nearly an hour before he returned ; and when he came in , we found that he was dressed out in his best , looking quite a dandy , and with some of his master 's finest flowers , in a large nosegay , sticking in his waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 28]: `` All right , sar , all right ; dat last glass grog gib me fine idee ; you neber ab more trouble bout Missy O'Bottom . ''
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 11]: `` Well , let 's hear , '' said Cockle .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 14]: `` I dress mysel bery ` pruce , as you see , massa .
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 5]: I take nosegay . ''
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 14]: `` Yes , I see that , and be hanged to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 7]: `` Neber mind , Massa Cockle .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 47]: I say to Missy O'Bottom , ` Massa no able come , he very sorry , so he send me ; ' ` well , ' she say , ` what you ab to say , sit down , Moonshine , you very nice man . '

Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 46]: Den Missy O'Bottom say , ` ` Top a moment , ' and she bring a bottel from cupboard , and me drink something did make ` tomach feel really warm ; and den she say , ` Moonshine , what you massa say ? '
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 123]: den I say , massa say , ` You fine ` oman , make good wife ; ' but he shake um head , and say , ` I very old man , no good for noting ; I tink all day how I make her appy , and I find out -- Moonshine , you young man , you ` andsome feller , you good servant , I not like you go away , but I tink you make Missy O'Bottom very fine ` usband ; so I not care for myself , you go to Missy O'Bottom , and tell I send you , dat I part wid you , and give you to her for ` usband . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 7]: Cockle and I burst out laughing .
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 13]: `` Well , and what did Mrs Rowbottom say to that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 67]: `` She jump up , and try to catch me hair , but I bob my head , and she miss ; den she say , ` You filthy black rascal , you tell you massa , ` pose he ever come here , I break his white bald pate ; and ` pose you ever come here , I smash you woolly black skull . '
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 21]: -- Dat all , Massa Cockle ; you see all right now , and I quite dry wid talking . ''
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 4]: `` All right !
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 5]: do you call it .
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 22]: I never meant to quarrel with the old woman ; what d'ye think , Bob -- is it all right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 20]: `` Why , you must either have quarrelled with her , or married her , that 's clear . ''
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 18]: `` Well , then , I 'm clear of her , and so it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 23]: It a 'n' t every man who can get out of matrimony by sacrificing a nosegay and two glasses of grog . ''
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 11]: `` Tree glasses , Massa Cockle , '' said Moonshine .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 20]: `` Well , three glasses ; here it is , you dog , and its dog cheap , too .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 9]: Thank God , next Wednesday 's quarter day .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 15]: Bob , you must dine with me -- cut the service for to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 46]: `` With all my heart , '' replied I , `` and I 'll salve my conscience by walking the beach all night ; but , Cockle , look here , there is but a drop in the bottle , and you have no more .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 11]: I am like you , with a clean swept hold .
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 6]: You acknowledge the difficulty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 16]: `` It stares me in the face , Bob ; what must be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 18]: `` I 'll tell you -- in the first place , what have you for dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 11]: `` Moonshine , what have we got for dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 5]: `` Dinner , sar ?
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 8]: -- me not yet tink about dinner .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 9]: What you like to eat , sar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 12]: `` What have we got in the house , Moonshine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 7]: `` Let me see , sar ?
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 36]: first place , we ab very fine piece picklum pork ; den we have picklum pork ; and den -- let me tink -- den we ab , we ab picklum pork , sar . ''
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 30]: `` The long and the short of it is , Bob , that we have nothing but a piece of pickled pork ; can you dine off that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 9]: `` Can a duck swim , Cockle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 19]: `` Please , sar , we ab plenty pea for _ dog baddy _ , '' said Moonshine .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 65]: `` Well , then , Cockle , as all that is required is to put the pot on the fire , you can probably spare Moonshine , after he has done that , and we will look to the cookery ; start him off with a note to Mr Johns , and he can bring back a couple of bottles from my quarters . ''
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 27]: `` Really dat very fine tought , Massa Farren ; I put in pork , and den I go and come back in one hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 14]: `` That you never will , Mr Moonshine ; what 's o'clock now ?
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 27]: mercy on us , how time flies in your company , Cockle , it is nearly four o'clock ; it will be dark at six . ''
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 25]: `` Neber mind , sar , me always ab _ moonshine _ whereber I go , '' said the black , showing his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 30]: `` It will take two hours to boil the pork , Bob ; that fellow has been so busy this morning that he has quite forgot the dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 9]: `` All you business , Massa Cockle . ''
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 28]: `` Very true ; but now start as soon as you can , and come back as soon as you can ; here 's the note . ''
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 27]: Moonshine took the note , looked at the direction , as if he could read it , and in a few minutes was seen to depart .
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 32]: `` And now , Cockle , '' said I , `` as Moonshine will be gone some time , suppose you spin us a yarn to pass away the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 23]: `` I 'll tell you what , Bob , I am not quite so good at that as I used to be .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 20]: I 've an idea that when my pate became bald , my memory oozed away by insensible perspiration . ''
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 18]: `` Never mind , you must have something left , you ca n't be quite empty . ''
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 34]: `` No , but my tumbler is ; so I 'll just fill that up , and then I 'll tell you how it was that I came to go to sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 16]: `` The very thing that I should like to hear , above all others . ''
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 37]: `` Well , then , you must know that , like cockles in general , I was born on the sea-shore , just a quarter of a mile out of Dover , towards Shakespeare 's Cliff .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 66]: My father was a fisherman by profession , and a smuggler by practice , all was fish that came to his net ; but his cottage was small , he was supposed to be very poor , and a very bad fisherman , for he seldom brought home many ; but there was a reason for that , he very seldom put his nets overboard .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 29]: His chief business lay in taking out of vessels coming down Channel , goods which were shipped and bonded for exportation , and running them on shore again .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 45]: You know , Bob , that there are many articles which are not permitted to enter even upon paying duty , and when these goods , such as silks , etcetera , are seized or taken in prizes , they are sold for exportation .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 85]: Now , it was then the custom for vessels to take them on board in the river , and run them on shore as they went down Channel , and the fishing-boats were usually employed for this service ; my father was a well-known hand for this kind of work , for not being suspected , he was always fortunate ; of course , had he once been caught , they would have had their eyes upon him after he had suffered his punishment .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 51]: Now the way my father used to manage was this : there was a long tunnel-drain from some houses used as manufactories , about a hundred yards above his cottage , which extended out into the sea at low-water mark , and which passed on one side of our cottage .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 72]: My father had cut from a cellar in the cottage into the drain , and as it was large enough for a man to kneel down in , he used to come in at low-water with his coble , and make fast the goods , properly secured from the wet and dirt in tarpaulin bags , to a rope , which led from the cellar to the sea through the drain .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 45]: When the water had flowed sufficiently to cover the mouth of the drain , he then threw the bags overboard , and , securing the boat , went to the cottage , hauled up the articles , and secured them too ; d'ye understand ?
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 79]: My father had no one to assist him but my brother , who was a stout fellow , seven years older than myself , and my mother , who used to give a helping hand when required ; and thus did he keep his own counsel , and grow rich ; when all was right , he got his boat over into the harbour , and having secured her , he came home as innocent as a lamb .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 50]: I was then about eight or nine years old , and went with my father and brother in the coble , for she required three hands , at least , to manage her properly , and like a tin-pot , although not very big , I was very useful .
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 62]: Now it so happened that my father had notice that a brig , laying in Dover harbour , would sail the next day , and that she had on board of her a quantity of lace and silks , purchased at the Dover custom-house for exportation , which he was to put on shore again to be sent up to London .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 38]: The sending up to London we had nothing to do with ; the agent at Dover managed all that ; we only left the articles at his house , and then received the money on the nail .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 25]: We went to the harbour , where we found the brig hauling out , so we made all haste to get away before her .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 19]: It blew fresh from the northward and eastward , and there was a good deal of sea running .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 51]: As we were shoving out , the London agent , a jolly little round-faced fellow , in black clothes , and a bald white head , called to us , and said that he wanted to board a vessel in the offing , and asked whether we would take him .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 30]: This was all a ruse , as he intended to go on board of the brig with us to settle matters , and then return in the pilot boat .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 95]: Well , we hoisted our jib , drew aft our foresheet , and were soon clear of the harbour ; but we found that there was a devil of a sea running , and more wind than we bargained for ; the brig came out of the harbour with a flowing sheet , and we lowered down the foresail to reef it -- father and brother busy about that , while I stood at the helm , when the agent said to me , ` When do you mean to make a voyage ? '
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 21]: ` Sooner than father thinks for , ' said I , ` for I want to see the world . '
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 16]: It was sooner than I _ thought for _ too , as you shall hear .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 101]: As soon as the brig was well out , we ran down to her , and with some difficulty my father and the agent got on board , for the sea was high and cross , the tide setting against the wind ; my brother and I were left in the boat to follow in the wake of the brig ; but as my brother was casting off the rope forward , his leg caught in the bight , and into the sea he went ; however , they hauled him on board , leaving me alone in the coble .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 72]: It was not of much consequence , as I could manage to follow before the wind under easy sail , without assistance : so I kept her in the wake of the brig , both of us running nearly before it at the rate of five miles an hour , waiting till my father should have made up his packages , of a proper size to walk through the tunnel drain .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 20]: `` The Channel was full of ships , for the westerly winds had detained them for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 89]: I had followed the brig about an hour , when the agent went on shore in a pilot boat , and I expected my father would soon be ready ; then the wind veered more towards the southward , with dirt : at last it came on foggy , and I could hardly see the brig , and as it rained hard , and blew harder , I wished that my father was ready , for my arms ached with steering the coble for so long a while .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 50]: I could not leave the helm , so I steered on at a black lump , as the brig looked through the fog : at last the fog was so thick that I could not see a yard beyond the boat , and I hardly knew how to steer .
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 17]: I began to be frightened , tired , and cold , and hungry I certainly was .
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 34]: Well , I steered on for more than an hour , when the fog cleared up a little , and to my joy I saw the stern of the brig just before me .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 39]: I expected that she would round-to immediately , and that my father would praise me for my conduct ; and , what was still more to the purpose , that I should get something to eat and drink .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 43]: But no : she steered on right down Channel , and I followed for more than an hour , when it came on to blow very hard , and I could scarcely manage the boat -- she pulled my little arms off .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 89]: The weather now cleared up , and I could make out the vessel plainly ; when I discovered that it was not the _ brig _ , but a bark which I had got hold of in the fog , so that I did not know what to do ; but I did as most boys would have done in a fright , -- I sat down and cried ; still , however , keeping the tiller in my hand , and steering as well as I could .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 3]: At last .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 48]: I could hold it no longer ; I ran forward , let go the fore and jib haul-yards , and hauled down the sails ; drag them into the boat I could not , and there I was , like a young bear adrift in a washing-tub .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 45]: I looked around , and there were no vessels near ; the bark had left me two miles astern , it was blowing a gale from the SE , with a heavy sea -- the gulls and sea-birds wheeling and screaming in the storm .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 47]: The boat tossed and rolled about so that I was obliged to hold on , but she shipped no water of any consequence , for the jib in the water forward had brought her head to wind , and acted as a sort of floating anchor .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 15]: At last I lay down at the bottom of the boat and fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 37]: It was daylight before I awoke , and it blew harder than ever ; and I could just see some vessels at a distance , scudding before the gale , but they could hardly see me .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 19]: I sat very melancholy the whole day , shedding tears , surrounded by nothing but the roaring waves .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 26]: I prayed very earnestly : I said the Lord 's Prayer , the Belief , and as much of the Catechism as I could recollect .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 10]: I was wet , starving , and miserably cold .
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 9]: At night I again fell asleep from exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 44]: When morning broke , and the sun shone , the gale abated , and I felt more cheered ; but I was now ravenous from hunger , as well as choking from thirst , and was so weak that I could scarcely stand .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 29]: I looked round me every now and then , and in the afternoon saw a large vessel standing right for me ; this gave me courage and strength .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 28]: I stood up and waved my hat , and they saw me -- the sea was still running very high , but the wind had gone down .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 11]: She rounded-to so as to bring me under her lee .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 24]: Send a boat she could not , but the sea bore her down upon me , and I was soon close to her .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 19]: Men in the chains were ready with ropes , and I knew that this was my only chance .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 62]: At last , a very heavy sea bore her right down upon the boat , lurching over on her beam ends , her main chains struck the boat and sent her down , while I was seized by the scruff of the neck by two of the seamen , and borne aloft by them as the vessel returned to the weather-roll .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 4]: I was safe .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 18]: And , as soon as they had given me something to eat , I told my story .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 25]: It appeared that she was an East India-man running down Channel , and not likely to meet with anything to scud me back again .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 37]: The passengers , especially the ladies , were very kind to me : and as there was no help for it , why , I took my first voyage to the _ East Indies _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 9]: `` And your father and your brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 48]: `` Why , when I met them , which I did about six years afterwards , I found that they had been in much the same predicament , having lost the coble , and the weather being so bad that they could not get on shore again .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 63]: As there was no help for it , they took their first voyage to the _ West Indies _ ; so there was a dispersion of an united family -- two went west , one went east , coble went down , and mother , after waiting a month or two , and supposing father dead , went off with a soldier .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 27]: All dispersed by one confounded gale of wind from the northward and eastward , so that 's the way that I went to sea , Bob .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 11]: And now it 's time that Moonshine was back . ''
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 43]: But Moonshine kept us waiting for some time : when he returned it was then quite dark , and we had lighted candles , anxiously waiting for him ; for not only was the bottle empty , but we were very hungry .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 32]: At last we heard a conversation at the gate , and Moonshine made his appearance with the two bottles of spirits , and appeared himself to be also in high spirits .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 10]: The pork and peas-pudding soon were on the table .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 51]: We dined heartily , and were sitting over the latter part of the first bottle in conversation , it being near upon the eleventh hour , when we heard a noise , at the gate -- observed some figures of men , who stayed a short time and then disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 9]: The door opened , and Moonshine went out .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 33]: In a few seconds he returned , bringing in his arms an anker of spirits , which he laid on the floor , grinning so wide that his head appeared half off .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 14]: Without saying a word , he left the room and returned with another .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 10]: `` Why , what the devil 's this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 3]: cried Cockle .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 32]: Moonshine made no answer , but went out and in until he had brought six ankers in , one after another , which he placed in a row on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 45]: He then shut the outside door , bolted it , came in , and seating himself on one of the tubs , laughed to an excess which compelled him to hold his sides ; Cockle and I looking on in a state of astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 11]: `` Where the devil did all this come from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 10]: cried Cockle , getting out of his easy chair .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 29]: `` Tell me , sir , or by -- '' `` I tell you all , Massa Cockle : -- you find me better friend dan Missy O'Bottom .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 17]: Now you hab plenty , and neber need scold Moonshine ` pose he take lilly drap .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 12]: I get all dis present to you , Massa Cockle . ''
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 11]: Feeling anxious , I pressed Moonshine to tell his story .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 8]: `` I tell you all , sar .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 28]: When I come back wid de two bottle I meet plenty men wid de tubs : dey say , ` Hollo there , who be you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 20]: I say , ` I come from station : bring massa two bottel , and I show um . '
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 10]: Den dey say , ` Where you massa ? '
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 53]: and I say , ` At um house at Ryde ' -- -LRB- den dey tink dat you my massa , Massa Farren -RRB- -- so dey say , ` Yes , we know dat , we watch him dere , but now you tell , so we beat you dead . '
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 39]: Den I say , ` What for dat ; massa like drink , why you no gib massa some tub , and den he neber say noting , only make fuss some time , 'cause of Admirality . '
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 11]: Den dey say , ` You sure of dat ? '
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 14]: and I say , ` Quite sure massa neber say one word . '
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 24]: Den dey talk long while ; last , dey come and say , ` You come wid us and show massa house . '
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 51]: So two men come wid me , and when dey come to gate I say , ` Dis massa house when he live at Ryde , and dere you see massa ; ' -- and I point to Massa Cockle , but dey see Massa Ferran -- so dey say .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 51]: ` All very good ; tree , four hour more , you find six tub here ; tell you massa dat every time run tub , he alway hab six ; ' den dey go way , den dey come back , leave tub ; dat all , massa . ''
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 5]: `` You rascal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 24]: exclaimed I , rising up , `` so you have compromised me ; why I shall lose my commission if found out . ''
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 34]: `` No , sar ; nobody wrong but de smuggler ; dey make a lilly mistake ; case you brought to court-martial , I give evidence , and den I clear you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 13]: `` But what must we do with the tubs , Cockle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 7]: said I , appealing to him .
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 4]: `` Do Bob ?
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 21]: -- why they are a present -- a very welcome one , and a very handsome one into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 28]: I shall not _ keep _ them , I pledge you my word ; let that satisfy you -- they shall be _ fairly entered _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 23]: `` Upon that condition , Cockle , '' I replied , `` I shall of course not give information against you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 20]: -LRB- I knew full well what he meant by saying he would not _ keep _ them . -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 31]: _ How _ I do , Massa Cockle , '' said Moonshine , with a grave face ; `` I take um to the Custom-house to-night or to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 20]: `` To-morrow , Moonshine , '' replied Cockle ; `` at present just put them out of sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 59]: I did not think it prudent to make any further inquiries ; but I afterwards discovered that the smugglers , true to their word , and still in error , continued to leave six tubs in old Cockle 's garden whenever they succeeded in running a cargo , which , notwithstanding all our endeavours , they constantly did .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 48]: One piece of information I gained from this affair , I found that the numbers of the cargoes which were run compared to those which were seized during the remainder of the time I was on that station , was in the proportion of ten to one .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 56]: The cargoes run were calculated by the observations of old Cockle , who , when I called upon him , used to say very quietly , `` I should n't wonder if they did not run a cargo last night , Bob , in spite of all your vigilance -- was it very dark ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 28]: `` On the contrary , '' replied I , looking at the demure face of the negro ; `` I suspect it was _ Moonshine _ . ''
