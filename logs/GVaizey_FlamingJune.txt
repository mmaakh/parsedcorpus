Parsing [sent. 1 len. 23]: Flaming June By Mrs George de Horne Vaizey This book is a little different from most of the others from this author .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 40]: The cast of the story are just a shade older than we are used to in Vaizey books , and there is no one who is afflicted with a disabling disease , such as the author herself suffered from .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 13]: I suppose you could describe the setting as the upper-class Mayfair set .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 38]: The scene opens in the house of a tidy old spinster , living in a tidy little seaside town , in a row of large houses of similar people , sharing private access to a well-kept garden .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 5]: A rather stable existence .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 21]: There is also a nice young American girl , over in England as part of her education , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 35]: Her father has become very rich in America , but he is the brother of the tidy old spinster , on whom , and to whose dismay , he has imposed Cornelia 's visit .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 24]: Cornelia is simply not used to the standards of English behaviour , for instance chaperones , and not gadding about with young men .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 11]: Cornelia has quite enough pocket-money to do as she pleases .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 30]: But her aunt is proved right in the end , for among all these nice well-brought-up people there is a baddy , which is revealed only towards the end .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 12]: NH FLAMING JUNE BY MRS. GEORGE DE HORNE VAIZEY CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 35]: Somewhere on the West coast of England , about a hundred miles from the metropolis , there stands a sleepy little town , which possesses no special activity nor beauty to justify its existence .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 10]: People live in it for reasons of their own .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 35]: The people who do _ not _ live in it wonder for _ what _ reasons , but attain no better solution of the mystery than the statement that the air is very fine .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 8]: `` We have such bracing air ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 18]: says the resident , as proudly as if that said air were his special invention and property .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 37]: Certain West-country doctors affect Norton-on-Sea for patients in need of restful change , and their melancholy advent justifies the existence of the great hotel on the esplanade , and the row of bath-chairs at the corner .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 45]: There are ten bath-chairs in all , and on sunny days ten crumpled-looking old ladies can generally be seen sitting inside their canopies , trundling slowly along the esplanade , accompanied by a paid companion , dressed in black and looking sorry for herself .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 30]: Occasionally on Saturdays and Sundays a pretty daughter , or a tall son takes the companion 's place , but as sure as Monday arrives they disappear into space .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 25]: One can imagine that one hears them bidding their farewells -- `` So glad to see you getting on so well , mother dear !
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 16]: I positively _ must _ rush back to town to attend to a hundred duties .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 13]: It 's a comfort to feel that you are so well placed .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 13]: Miss Biggs is a treasure , and this air is so bracing !
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 48]: ... '' The esplanade consists of four rows of lodging-houses and two hotels , in front of which is a strip of grass , on which a band plays twice a week during the summer months , and the school-children twice a day all the year long .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 54]: The invalids in the hotel object to the children and make unsuccessful attempts to banish them from their pitch , and the children in their turn regard the invalids with frank disdain , and make audible and uncomplimentary surmises as to the nature of their complaints as the procession of chairs trundles by .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 59]: In front of the green , and separating it from the steep , pebbly shore , are a number of fishermen 's shanties , bathing machines , and hulks of old vessels stretched in a long , straggling row , while one larger shed stands back from the rest , labelled `` Lifeboat '' in large white letters .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 33]: Parallel with the esplanade runs the High Street , a narrow thoroughfare showing shops crowded with the useless little articles which are supposed to prove irresistibly attractive to visitors to the seaside .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 105]: At the bazaar a big white label proclaims that everything in the window is to be sold at the astounding price of `` eleven-three , '' and the purchaser is free to make his choice from such treasures as work-boxes lined in crimson plush , and covered with a massed pattern in shells ; desks fitted with all the implements for writing , scent bottles tied with blue ribbons ; packets of stationery with local views , photograph frames in plush and gelatine , or to select more perishable trophies in glass and china , all solemnly guaranteed to be worth double the price .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 39]: At the photographer 's , a few yards farther along , a visitor can have his portrait taken a yard square , the size of a postage stamp , or on a postcard to send to his friends .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 88]: Ingenious backgrounds are on hand , representing appropriate seaside scenes in which the sitter has nothing to do but to press his face against a hole on the canvas , and these are extensively patronised , for what can be more convenient than to stand on solid earth , attired in sober , everyday clothing , yet be portrayed splashing in the waves in the spandiest of French bathing costumes , riding a donkey along the sands , or manfully hauling down the sails of a yacht !
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 21]: Mr Photographer Sykes is a man of resource , and deserves the prosperity which is the envy of his neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 20]: Mrs Sykes wears silk linings to her skirts on Sundays , and rustles like the highest in the land .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 31]: She had three new hats in one summer , and the fishmonger 's wife knows for a fact that not one of the number costs less than `` twenty-five-six . ''
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 88]: The High Street and the esplanade constitute the new Norton-on-Sea which has sprung into being within the last ten years , but the real , original , aristocratic Norton lies a couple of miles inland , and consists of a wide , sloping street , lined with alternate shops and houses , branching off from which are a number of sleepy roads , in which detached and semi - detached villas hide themselves behind trees and hedges , and barricade their windows with stiff , white curtains .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 22]: The one great longing actuating the Norton householder seems to be to see nothing , and to be seen by none .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 7]: `` Is the house overlooked ? ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 13]: they ask the agent anxiously on the occasion of the first application .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 9]: `` Does it overlook any other house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 14]: `` There _ is _ another house across the road , madam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 20]: the agent is sometimes regretfully obliged to admit , `` but it has been very cleverly planted out . ''
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 4]: So it has !
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 37]: by means of a fir or an elm planted within a few yards of the windows , and blocking out something more important than another villa , but the Norton resident desires privacy above all things .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 14]: The sun and the air have to creep in as best they may .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 16]: The more aristocratic the position of a family , the more secluded becomes their position .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 37]: Fences are raised by an arrangement of lattice - work on the top of boards ; shrubs are planted thickly inside the hedges ; even the railings of the gates are backed by discreetly concealing boards .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 52]: If there happens to be a rise in the road from which a passer - by can catch a glimpse of white figures darting to and fro on the tennis courts , the owner promptly throws up a bank , and plants on the top one or two quickly growing limes .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 8]: It is so disagreeable to be overlooked !
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 76]: At the date at which this history opens , there were several large places in the neighbourhood of Norton , foremost among them were the Manor House , occupied by the young squire , Geoffrey Greville , and Madame , his mother ; Green Arbour , owned by Admiral Perry , who had married the widow of the late High Sheriff ; and The Meads , the ofttime deserted seat of a rich London banker .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 81]: With these exceptions , quite the most aristocratic dwellings were situated in what was known as `` The Park , '' though perhaps `` The Crescent '' would have been the more appropriate name , for the twelve houses were built on one side of a curving road , looking out on a charming stretch of land , dipping down to a miniature lake , and rising again to a soft green knoll , surmounted by a bank of trees .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 47]: The carefully-mowed grass looked like softest velvet , and might be seen , but not touched , being surrounded by tiny wire arches , and protected by wooden boards , requesting visitors to keep to the paths , and not trespass on the `` verges . ''
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 3]: Impressive title !
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 34]: Visitors were likewise requested not to touch the flowering shrubs ; not to pick the flowers ; not to throw rubbish into the lake , or to inscribe their initials on the seats .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 36]: These rules being carefully observed , the twelve householders who paid for the upkeep of these decorous gardens were free to enjoy such relaxations as could be derived from gravel paths , and wooden benches .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 36]: The view from their windows the residents apparently did not wish to enjoy , for they planted their trees and heightened their fences as industriously as the owners of the fifty-pound villas in Hill Street .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 43]: Mrs Garnett , at Buona Vista , having a garden deficient in foliage , had even erected a temporary trellis at the end of the lawn , and covered it with creepers , rather than face the indignity of an open view .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 19]: It gave her such a `` feeling of publicity '' to see the neighbours pass to and fro !
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 36]: It was only the residents themselves who enjoyed the proud privilege of pacing the Park unmolested , for at either entrance stood small eaved lodges in which were housed the two gardeners and their wives .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 25]: To be lodge-keeper to the Park was as great a guarantee of respectability in Norton as to be vicar of the parish church itself .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 33]: Only middle-aged , married , teetotal , childless churchmen could apply for the posts , and among their scant ranks the most searching inquiries were instituted before an appointment was finally arranged .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 39]: It is safe to affirm that no working couples on earth were more clean , industrious , and alive to their duty towards their betters , than the occupants of the North and South Lodges of Norton Park !
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 45]: All day long the two husbands mowed grass , clipped hedges , and swept up gravel paths ; all day long the wives scrubbed and dusted their immaculate little houses , keeping a weather-eye on the door to see who passed to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 28]: Their duty it was to pounce out on any stranger who dared attempt to force an entrance through the hallowed portals , and send them back discomfited .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 10]: `` You ca n't come this way , madam !
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 6]: This road is private ! ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 12]: `` Ca n't I just walk straight through on the path ?
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 13]: It is so much nearer than going all the way round ! ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 14]: `` The park is private , madam ; there is no thoroughfare . ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 10]: Occasionally some child of sin would endeavour to prevaricate .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 9]: `` I wish to pay a call ! ''
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 13]: `` Which house did you wish to go to , madam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 7]: `` Er -- Buona Vista ! ''
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 8]: `` Buona Vistas is away from home .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 13]: They wo n't be back till the end of the month . ''
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 39]: Foiled in her attempts the miscreant would have to retrace her steps , or make her way round by the narrow lane by means of which the tradesmen made their way to the back-doors of these secluded dwellings .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 36]: Perhaps the most unpromisingly decorous house in the Park was christened `` The Nook , '' with that appalling lack of humour which is nowhere portrayed more strikingly than in the naming of suburban residences .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 30]: It stood fair and square in the middle of the crescent ; and from garret to cellar there was not a nooky corner on which the eye could light .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 18]: Two drawing-room windows flanked the front door on the left ; two dining-room windows on the right .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 18]: There was not even a gable or a dormer to break the square solidity of the whole .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 62]: Fourteen windows in all , each chastely shrouded in Nottingham lace curtains , looped back by yellow silk bands , fastened , to a fraction of an inch , at the same height from the sill , while Aspidistra plants , mounted on small tables , were artfully placed so as to fill up the space necessarily left in the centre .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 32]: They were handsome plants of venerable age , which Mason , the parlourmaid , watered twice a week , sponging their leaves with milk before she replaced them in their pots .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 39]: It was a typical early Victorian residence , inhabited by a spinster lady of early Victorian type and her four henchwomen -- Heap the cook , Mary the housemaid , Mason the parlourmaid , and Jane the tweeny .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 53]: Four women , plus a boot-boy , to wait upon the wants of one solitary person , yet in conclave with the domestic at The Croft to the right , and The Holt to the left , Miss Briskett 's maids were wont to assert that they were worked off their feet .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 19]: It was , as has been said , an early Victorian household , conducted on early Victorian lines .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 44]: Other people might be content to buy half their supplies ready-made from the stores , but Miss Briskett insisted on home-made bread , home-made jams and cakes ; home - made pickles and sauces ; home-cured tongues and hams , and home-made liqueurs .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 44]: Cook kept the tweeny busy in the kitchen , while Mary grumbled at having to keep half a dozen unused bedrooms in spick and span perfection , and Mason spent her existence in polishing , and sweeping invisible grains of dust from out-of-the-way-corners .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 84]: As a rule the domestic wheel turned on oiled wheels and Miss Briskett 's existence flowed on its even course , from one year 's end to another , with little but the weather to differentiate one month from another , but on the day on which this history begins , a thunderbolt had fallen in the shape of a letter bearing a New York post-mark , which the postman handed in at the door of The Nook at the three o'clock delivery .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 84]: Miss Briskett read its contents , and gasped ; read them again , and trembled ; read them a third time , and sat buried in thought for ten minutes by the clock , at the expiration of which time she opened her own desk , and penned a note to her friend and confidant , Mrs Ramsden , of The Holt -- `` My dear Friend , -- I have just received a communication from America which is causing me considerable perturbation .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 30]: If your engagements will allow , I should be grateful if you will take tea with me this afternoon , and give me the benefit of your wise counsel .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 8]: Pray send a verbal answer by bearer .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 11]: -- Yours sincerely , -- `` Sophia A Briskett . ''
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 22]: The trim Mason took the note to its destination , and waited in the hall while Mrs Ramsden wrote her reply .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 13]: The reference to a verbal answer was only a matter of form .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 43]: Miss Briskett would have been surprised and affronted to receive so unceremonious a reply to her invitation -- `` My dear Friend , -- It will give me pleasure to take tea with you this afternoon , as you so kindly suggest .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 35]: I trust that the anxiety under which you are labouring may be of a temporary nature , and shall be thankful indeed if I can in any way assist to bring about its solution .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 12]: -- Most truly yours , -- `` Ellen Bean Ramsden . ''
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 14]: `` The best china , Mason , and a teapot for two ! ''
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 33]: was Miss Briskett 's order on receipt of this cordial response , and an hour later the two ladies sat in conclave over a daintily-spread table in the drawing-room of The Nook .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 36]: Miss Briskett was a tall , thin woman of fifty-eight or sixty , wearing a white cap perched upon her grey hair , and an expression of frosty propriety on her thin , pointed features .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 11]: Frosty is the adjective which most accurately describes her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 61]: One felt a moral conviction that she would suffer from chilblains in winter , that the long , thin fingers must be cold to the touch , even on this bright May day ; that the tip of her nose was colder still , that she could not go to sleep at night without a hot bottle to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 23]: She was addicted to grey dresses , composed of stiff and shiny silk , and to grey bonnets glittering with steely beads .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 18]: She creaked , as she moved , and her thin figure was whale-boned into an unnatural rigidity .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 30]: Mrs Ramsden was , in appearance at least , a striking contrast to her friend , being a dumpy little woman , in whose demeanour good-nature vied with dignity .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 17]: She was dressed in black , and affected an upright feather in front of her bonnets .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 10]: `` To give me height , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 33]: In looking at her one was irresistibly reminded of a pouter pigeon strutting along on its short little legs , preening its sleek little head to and fro above its protuberant breast .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 5]: `` Read that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 65]: said Miss Briskett , tragically , handing the thin sheet of paper to her friend , and Mrs Ramsden put on her spectacles and read as follows -- `` My dear Sister , -- Business connected with mines makes it necessary for me to go out West for the next few months , and the question has arisen how to provide for Cornelia meantime .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 16]: I had various notions , but she prefers her own -LRB- she generally does ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 25]: , and reckons she ca n't fill in this gap better than by running over to pay you a visit in the Old Country .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 18]: I can pick her up in the fall , and have a little trot round before returning .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 19]: She has friends sailing in the _ Lucania _ on the 15th , and intends crossing with them .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 36]: You will just have time to cable to put her off if you are dead , or otherwise incapacitated ; but I take it you will be glad to have a look at my girl .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 6]: She 's worth looking at !
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 11]: I shall feel satisfied to know she is with you .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 9]: She might get up to mischief over here .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 18]: `` Looking forward to seeing you later on , -- Your brother , Edward Briskett . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 16]: _ P S _ -- Dear Aunt Soph , do n't you worry to prepare !
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 13]: I 'll just chip in , and take you as you are .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 8]: We 'll have some high old times !
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 7]: -- Your niece , Cornelia . ''
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 11]: Letter and eye-glasses fell together upon Mrs Ramsden 's knee .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 12]: She raised startled eyes , and blinked dumbly at her friend .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 16]: Miss Briskett wagged her head from side to side , and heaved a sepulchral sigh .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 8]: The halcyon days of peace were over !
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 18]: `` My dear , '' said Mrs Ramsden , solemnly , `` this is indeed great news .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 10]: I do n't wonder that you feel unnerved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 6]: `` I do , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 20]: The three o'clock post came in , and I was quite surprised when Mary came in with the salver .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 7]: I was not expecting any letters .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 18]: I have so few correspondents , and I am mostly in their debt , I am afraid .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 11]: Still , of course , there are always the circulars .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 15]: I looked for nothing more exciting , and then -- _ this _ arrived !
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 19]: I really felt that I could not sit alone and think it out by myself all day long .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 18]: I hope you will forgive me for asking you to come over on such short notice . ''
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 14]: `` Indeed , I am flattered that you should wish to have me .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 8]: Do tell me all about this brother .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 11]: He has lived abroad a long time , I think ?
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 9]: It is the eldest , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 8]: The rich one -- in America ? ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 10]: `` I believe he is rich for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 15]: Goodness knows how long it may last , '' sighed Miss Briskett , dolefully .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 18]: `` He speculates in mines , my dear , and you know what _ that _ means !
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 36]: Half the time he is a pauper , and the other half a millionaire , and so far as I can gather from his letters he seems just as well satisfied one way as another .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 19]: He was always a flighty , irresponsible creature , and I fear Cornelia has taken after him . ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 8]: `` She is the only child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 26]: She had an English mother , I 'm thankful to say ; but poor Sybil died at her birth , and Edward never married again .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 20]: He was devoted to Sybil , and said he would never give another woman the charge of her child .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 3]: Such nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 19]: As if any man on earth could look after a growing girl , without a woman 's help .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 37]: Instead of a wise , judicious stepmother , she has been left to nurses and governesses , and from what I can hear , has ruled _ them _ , instead of the other way about .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 18]: You can see by the tone of her father 's letter that he is absurdly prejudiced . ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 21]: `` That is natural , perhaps , with an only child , left to him in such peculiarly sad circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 17]: We must not judge him hardly for that , '' said little Mrs Ramsden , kindly .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 23]: `` Has the girl herself ever written to you before , may I ask , or is this her first communication ? ''
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 16]: Miss Briskett 's back stiffened , and her thin lips set in a straight line .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 40]: `` She has addressed little notes to me from time to time ; on birthdays , and Christmases , and so on ; but to tell you the truth , my dear , I have not encouraged their continuance .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 17]: They were unduly familiar , and I object to being addressed by abbreviations of my name .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 19]: Ideas as to what is right and fitting seem to differ on different sides of the Atlantic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 6]: `` They do , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 17]: I have always understood that young people are brought into quite undue prominence in American households .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 6]: And their manners , too !
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 30]: One sees in that postscript -- you do n't mind my saying so , just between ourselves -- a -- a _ broadness _ -- '' `` Quite so !
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 5]: I feel it myself .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 8]: I am most grieved , about it .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 14]: Cornelia is my niece , and Edward is the head of the family .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 25]: Her position as his only child is one of importance , and I feel distressed that she is so little qualified to adorn it .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 29]: She has been well educated , I believe ; has ` graduated , ' as they call it ; but she has evidently none of our English polish .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 22]: Quite in confidence , Mrs Ramsden , I feel that she may be somewhat of a shock to the neighbourhood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 9]: `` You think of receiving her , then ?
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 23]: Your brother leaves you the option of refusing , and I should think things over very seriously before incurring such a responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 5]: A three-months ' visit !
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 9]: I doubt you could not stand the strain !
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 18]: If you excused yourself on the ground of health , no offence could possibly be taken . ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 8]: But at that Miss Briskett protested strongly .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 11]: `` Oh , my dear , I could not refuse !
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 22]: Edward wishes to find a home for the girl , and says he would be relieved to have her with me .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 6]: I could not possibly refuse !
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 28]: I think I may say that I have never yet shirked a duty , distasteful though it might be , and I must not do so now .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 22]: I shall cable to say that I will be pleased to receive Cornelia , when it suits her to arrive . ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 42]: Mrs Ramsden crumbled her seed-cake and wondered why -- that being the case -- she had been summoned to give advice , but being a good-natured soul , smiled assent , and deftly shifted the conversation to the consideration of details .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 13]: `` Well , dear , I only trust you may be rewarded .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 14]: Miss Cornelia is fortunate to have such a home waiting to receive her .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 12]: What room do you propose to dedicate to her use ? ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 15]: Miss Briskett 's face clouded , and she drew a long , despairing sigh .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 10]: `` That 's another thing I am troubled about .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 12]: I had the best spare room done up only this spring .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 23]: The carpet had faded , and when I was renewing it I took the opportunity to have in the painters and paperhangers .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 13]: It is _ all _ fresh , even the curtains and bed-hangings .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 8]: They have not once been used . ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 7]: Mrs Ramsden purred in sympathetic understanding .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 4]: `` Poor dear !
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 25]: When one has just made a room all fresh and clean , it is _ most _ trying to have it taken into use !
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 11]: But why give her that room at all , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 5]: You have several others .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 22]: A young , unmarried girl should be satisfied with a room at the back , or even on the third storey .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 17]: You have a nice little guest room over your own bedroom , have you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 12]: Miss Briskett again manifested a noble determination to do her duty .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 23]: `` I should like Edward to feel , when he comes over , that I have paid his daughter all due honour .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 26]: She must have the spare room , and if she spills things over the new carpet , I must pray for grace to bear it .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 34]: She has been accustomed to a very luxurious style of living for the last few years , and I daresay even my best room will not be as handsome as her own apartment .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 21]: In the present state of Edward 's finances , she is , I suppose , a very great heiress . ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 12]: Little Mrs Ramsden stared into her cup with a kindly thoughtfulness .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 18]: `` I should keep that fact secret , if I were you , '' she said earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 4]: `` Poor lassie !
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 22]: it 's always a handicap to a girl to be received for what she has , rather than what she is .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 27]: And there are two or three idle , worthless young men hanging about , who might be only too glad to pick up a rich wife .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 37]: I should simply announce that I was expecting a niece from the United States of America , to pay me a visit of some months ' duration , and offer no enlightenment as to her circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 14]: You will have enough responsibility as it is , without embarrassing entanglements . ''
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 5]: `` Yes , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 5]: Thank you so much .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 16]: I feel sure that your advice is wise , and I shall certainly follow it .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 19]: There 's that soldier nephew of Mrs Mott 's , who is constantly running down on short visits .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 8]: I object intensely to that dashing style !
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 16]: He is just the type of man to run after a girl for her money .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 11]: I shall take special care that they do not meet .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 34]: One thing I am determined upon , '' said Miss Briskett , sternly , `` and that is that there shall be no love-making , nor philandering of any kind under my roof .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 16]: I could not be troubled with such nonsense , nor with the responsibility of it .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 27]: I am accustomed to a quiet , regular life , and if Cornelia comes to me , she must conform to the regulations of the household .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 20]: At my age I can not be expected to alter my ways for the sake of a girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 9]: She is a mere girl , I suppose !
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 7]: How old may she be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 4]: Miss Briskett considered .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 8]: `` She was born in the winter !
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 20]: I distinctly remember coming in and seeing the cable , and taking off my fur gloves to open it .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 11]: -- It was the year I bought the dining-room carpet .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 47]: It was just down , I remember , and as we drank the baby 's health , the cork flew out of the bottle , and some of the champagne was spilt , and there was a great fuss wiping it up -- Twenty-two years ago !
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 11]: Who would have thought it could be so long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 17]: `` Ah , it always pays to get a good thing while you are about it .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 16]: It costs a great deal at the start , but you have such satisfaction afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 8]: It 's not a bit faded ! ''
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 22]: Mrs Ramsden affirmed , alluding , be it understood , to the Turkey carpet , and not to Miss Cornelia Briskett .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 3]: `` Twenty-two .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 8]: Just a year younger than my Elma !
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 10]: Elma will be glad to have a companion . ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 10]: `` It is kind of you to say so .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 15]: Nothing would please me better than to see Cornelia become intimate with your daughter .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 28]: Poor child , she has not had the advantages of an English upbringing ; but we must hope that this visit will be productive of much good .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 10]: She could not have a better example than Elma .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 14]: She is a type of a sweet , guileless , English girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 4]: `` Ye-es ! ''
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 67]: asserted the sweet girl 's mother , doubtfully ; `` but you know , dear Miss Briskett , that at times even Elma ... '' She shook her head , sighed , and continued with a struggling smile : `` We must remember -- must we not -- that we have been young ourselves , and try not to be too hard on little eccentricities ! ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 16]: Mrs Ramsden spoke with feeling , for memory , though slumbering , was not dead .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 23]: She had not always been a well-conducted widow lady , who expressed herself with decorum , and wore black cashmere and bugles .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 19]: Thirty odd years ago she had been a plump little girl , with a lively capacity for mischief .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 43]: On one occasion she had danced two-thirds of the programme at a ball with an officer even more dashing than the objectionable nephew of Mrs Mott , and in a corner of the conservatory had given him a flower from her bouquet .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 31]: He had kissed the flower before pressing it in his pocket - book , and had looked as if he would have liked to kiss something else into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 26]: ... After twenty-five years of life at Norton , it was astonishing how vividly the prim little widow recalled the guilty thrill of that moment !
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 37]: On yet another occasion she had carried on a clandestine correspondence with the brother of a friend , and had awakened to tardy pangs of conscience only when a more attractive suitor came upon the scene !
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 26]: Mrs Ramsden blushed at the remembrance , and felt a kindly softening of the heart towards the absent Cornelia but Miss Briskett remained coldly unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 21]: She had been an old maid in her cradle , and had gone on steadily growing old maidier ever since .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 44]: Never had she so forgotten herself as to dally with the affections of any young man , which was perhaps the less to her credit , as no young man had exhibited any inclination to tempt her from the paths of single blessedness .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 47]: She looked down her nose at her friend 's remark , and replied that she trusted she might be enabled to do her duty , without either prejudice or indulgence , and soon afterwards Mrs Ramsden took her leave , and returned to her own domain .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 46]: At one of the windows of the over-furnished sitting-room of The Holt , a girl was standing gazing dreamily through the spotted net curtains , with a weary little droop in the lines of the figure which bespoke fatigue , rather mental , than physical .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 75]: She was badly dressed , in an ill-cut skirt , and an ill-cut blouse , and masses of light brown hair were twisted heavily together at the back of her head ; but the face , which she turned to welcome her mother reminded one instinctively of a bunch of flowers -- of white , smooth-leaved narcissi ; of fragrant pink roses ; of pansies -- deep , purple-blue pansies , soft as velvet .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 48]: Given the right circumstances and accessories , this might have been a beauty , an historical beauty , whose name would be handed down from one generation to another ; a Georgina of Devonshire , a beautiful Miss Gunning , a witching Nell Gwynne ; but alas !
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 10]: beauty is by no means independent of external aid !
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 39]: The poets who declaim to the contrary are men , poor things , who know no better ; every woman in the world will plump for a good dressmaker , when she wishes to appear at her best .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 29]: Elma Ramsden , with the makings of a beauty , was just a pretty , dowdy girl , at whom a passer-by would hardly cast a second glance .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 20]: She looked bored too , and a trifle discontented , and her voice had a flat , uninterested tone .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 8]: `` Well , mother , back again !
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 7]: Have you enjoyed your call ? ''
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 14]: `` Thank you , dear , it was hardly a case of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 14]: I was invited to give my opinion of a matter of importance . ''
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 6]: `` Yes , I know !
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 15]: -- Should she have the sweep this week , or the week after next ?
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 10]: -- Should she have new covers for the drawing-room ?
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 13]: -- Would you advise slate-grey , or grey-slate for the new dress ?
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 26]: ... I hope you brought the weight of your intellect to bear on the great problems , and solved them to your mutual satisfaction ! ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 18]: Mrs Ramsden seated herself on a deeply-cushioned arm-chair , and began pulling off her tight kid gloves .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 26]: A touch of offence was visible in her demeanour , and the feather in the front of her bonnet reared itself at an aggressive angle .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 20]: `` It is not in good taste , my dear , to talk in that tone to your mother .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 24]: Matters of domestic interest may not appeal to you in your present irresponsible position , but they are not without their own importance .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 14]: The subject of to-day 's discussion , however , was something quite different .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 26]: You will be interested to hear that Miss Briskett is expecting a young American niece to pay her a visit at an early date . ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 5]: `` How young ? ''
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 5]: inquired Elma , tentatively .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 24]: Her mother had a habit of alluding to `` girls '' of thirty-five , which did not commend itself to her youthful judgment .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 11]: She reserved her interest until assured on this important point .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 9]: `` About your own age or slightly younger .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 14]: The only daughter of Mr Edward Briskett , the head of the family .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 28]: His business takes him away from home for several months , and his daughter is anxious to avail herself of the opportunity of visiting her aunt . ''
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 26]: said Elma ; no more and no less , but as she turned her pansy-like eyes once more to the window , she grimaced expressively .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 27]: She was sorry for the delusion of the American daughter who was willing to cross a whole ocean for the privilege of beholding Miss Sophia Briskett !
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 7]: `` What is she like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 4]: she asked presently .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 9]: `` Did you hear anything about her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 7]: Mrs Ramsden shook her head dolefully .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 25]: `` I fear , dear -- strictly between ourselves -- that she is not precisely what we should call a _ nice _ girl !
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 9]: The tone of her letter was decidedly flippant .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 9]: Miss Briskett is hoping much from your influence .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 30]: You two girls will naturally come a good deal into contact , and I hope you will do your utmost to set her an example of ladylike demeanour . ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 8]: Elma stared steadily through the window . ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 14]: _ Flippant _ '' she repeated to herself in a breathless whisper . ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 5]: _ Flippant _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 5]: The pansy eyes widened .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 10]: She heaved a sigh of deep , incredulous delight .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 33]: The _ Lucania _ was due to arrive in the Mersey early on a Tuesday forenoon , and Miss Briskett expected to welcome her niece on the evening of the same day .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 40]: The best spare room was already swept and garnished , and nothing remained but to take counsel with Heap the cook , and draw out a menu of a dinner which could most successfully combat the strain of waiting .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 53]: The spinster 's own appetite , though sparse , was fastidious , and Heap was a mistress of her art , so that between the two a dainty little meal was arranged , while Mason , not to be outdone , endeavoured to impart an extra polish to her already highly-burnished silver .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 12]: In the seclusion of the pantry she hummed a joyful air .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 5]: `` Praise the pigs !
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 18]: we shall have something young in the house , at last , '' said she to herself .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 21]: `` I do n't mind the extra work , if she 'll only make a bit of a stir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 42]: By six o'clock the dinner-table was laid , and Miss Briskett was sitting in state , clad in her newest grey silk gown , though a reference to Bradshaw made it seem improbable that the traveller could arrive before seven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 29]: At half-past six hot water was carried up to the bedroom ; ten minutes later Miss Briskett left her seat to move another few yards nearer the window .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 17]: Streaks of colour showed in her cheeks , her fingers clasped and unclasped in nervous fashion .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 32]: She was conscious of a quick thud-thud at the left side of the thickly-boned bodice , and realised with surprise that it came from that almost forgotten organ , her heart .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 16]: She had never experienced this agitation before when awaiting the arrival of her own friends .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 14]: The old adage was right after all -- blood was thicker than water !
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 7]: What would the child be like ?
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 14]: Edward was a big fair man , with no special beauty of feature .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 7]: Sybil had been slight and dainty .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 37]: It did not seem likely that Cornelia would be specially pretty , her aunt prayed above all things that she was unnoticeable -- to be unnoticeable was regarded as the climax of elegance in Norton society !
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 23]: -- then with a sudden softening of expression found herself hoping that there would be something of Edward in looks or manner !
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 12]: She was a lonely woman , living apart from her kin .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 14]: To have someone of her own would be a new and delightful experience .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 13]: She felt glad , actually _ glad _ that Cornelia was coming !
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 3]: Seven o'clock !
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 16]: At any moment now a cab might appear bearing the expected guest from the station .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 36]: Miss Briskett crossed the room to alter the arrangement of a vase of flowers , and as she did so , the door opened , and Mason entered carrying a telegram upon a silver salver .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 18]: Miss Briskett tore it open , and read the following message : -- `` Safe and sound .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 7]: Staying night in London with friends .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 4]: Sight-seeing to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 6]: Be with you at five .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 5]: God save the Queen !
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 4]: -- Cornelia . ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 6]: Miss Briskett 's lips tightened .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 43]: She folded the orange-coloured paper and returned it to its envelope , cleared her throat and said coldly -- `` Inform Heap that my niece will not arrive until to-morrow evening , and be good enough to serve dinner at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 7]: Mason 's face clouded with disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 33]: In the kitchen Heap banged the saucepan-lids , and wanted to know what was the use of doing your best in a despicable world where you never got nothing for your pains !
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 49]: Mary repaired dolefully upstairs to take away the hot water , and shroud the furniture in dust-sheets ; even the tweeny felt a sudden dampening of spirits , while in the dining-room the mistress of her house sat at her solitary meal with anger smouldering in her heart !
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 75]: A delay to the boat would , of course , have been inevitable ; if Cornelia had been so fatigued that she felt it necessary to break her journey half-way , that would have been a disappointment pure and simple , but that the girl had _ chosen _ to delay her arrival for her own amusement and gratification , this was an offence indeed -- a want of respect and consideration well-nigh unforgivable .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 6]: Staying in town with friends !
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 6]: -- Staying _ where _ ?
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 5]: -- With what friends ?
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 6]: Doing the sights to-morrow morning !
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 8]: Miss Briskett 's lip curled in disdain .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 5]: Then that ridiculous ending !
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 19]: What would Miss Brewster , the telegraph clerk at the post - office , think of such frivolity !
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 75]: In this tiny township , everyone was as well acquainted with their neighbour 's business as with their own , and while Emily Brewster at the post-office was keenly interested in the advent of the American visitor , Miss Briskett , in her turn , knew all about Emily 's parentage and education , the nature and peculiarities of the diseases which she had enjoyed , and vouchsafed a patronising interest in her prospects .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 31]: It was gall and wormwood to feel sure that Emily had laughed and made merry over a message addressed to a Briskett , from a member of her own house !
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 30]: Everyone has experienced the flatness which ensues when an expected excitement is postponed at the last moment , leaving the hours to drag along a slow , uneventful course .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 21]: It was long since Miss Briskett had felt so consciously lonely and depressed as at her solitary dinner that evening .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 32]: In the drawing-room , even Patience lost its wonted charm , and she was thankful when the time arrived to sip her tumbler of hot water , and retire to bed .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 37]: Next day it seemed somewhat flat to make the same preparations a second time over , but as no contradictory message had been received , it did not appear possible that a second disappointment could supervene .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 24]: The tea - table was set out with special care , and a supply of home-made cakes placed on the three-storied brass stand .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 18]: Once more Miss Briskett donned her best gown , and sat gazing through the lace window curtains .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 3]: At last !
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 23]: A cab drove up to the gate ; two cabs , laden with enough luggage for a family journeying to the seaside .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 18]: The door of the first was thrown open and there jumped out -- a _ man _ !
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 33]: a tall , alert young man clad in a suit of light-checked tweed , who turned and gave his hand to a girl in blue serge , carefully assisting her to alight .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 47]: They sauntered up the path together , laughing and chattering in leisurely enjoyment ; half-way to the house the girl turned round , and stood for a moment to stare at the view , pointing , as she did so , in frank , unabashed fashion .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 14]: Then they approached the door , held hospitably open in Mason 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 11]: `` Why , Aunt Soph , is that you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 21]: cried a high , clear voice , with a pronounced American accent , which rang strangely in the unaccustomed ears .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 16]: `` This is me , anyhow , and I 'm real glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 7]: I 've had a lovely ride !
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 17]: This is Mr Eustace C Ross , who crossed with us in the _ Lucania _ .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 18]: He 's brought me right here in case I got lost , or fell over the edge .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 4]: England 's sweet !
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 17]: I 've been all over London this morning , and we did a theatre last night .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 14]: ... Aunt Soph , you have a look of father about the nose !
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 10]: Makes me feel kinder homesick to see your nose .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 10]: I 'm going to kiss it right away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 32]: And kiss it she did , on its thin , chilly tip , with Mason sniggering with delight in the background , and the strange young man chuckling in the foreground .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 22]: Miss Briskett retreated hastily into the drawing-room , and her niece followed , casting curious glances to right and to left .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 13]: `` You 've got a real cosy little house , Aunt Soph .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 14]: It looks real English -- not a mite like our place at home .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 4]: Is that tea ?
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 17]: I 'm just about dying for a cup of tea , and so 's Mr Ross .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 18]: Do n't you want a cup of tea more than anything in the world , Mr Ross ?
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 11]: I see you do by the way you look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 20]: She sank into an easy chair , and flashed a mischievous glance at the young man by her side .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 29]: He was a tall , well-built young fellow , with the square shoulders and aggressive chin which to the English eye are the leading characteristics of American men .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 29]: He had the air of being exceedingly well able to look after himself , but even his self - possession wavered before the frosty nature of his reception .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 60]: He stood irresolutely , hat in hand , waiting for a repetition of Cornelia 's invitation , but none came , and with an almost imperceptible shrug of the shoulders , he resigned himself to the inevitable , and announced that it was imperative that he should hasten back to the station to catch a return train to town .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 31]: He proceeded , therefore , to take leave of his travelling companion , a proceeding characterised on his side by transparent regret , on hers by an equally transparent indifference .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 15]: `` You 'll be sure to let me know when you come home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 5]: `` Yes , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 17]: I 'll write when I start , and you shall come down to meet the boat .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 2]: Good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 6]: You 've been real kind !
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 8]: I 'm ever so much obliged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 9]: `` Oh , I 've enjoyed it enormously .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 23]: You must be sure to let me know if there is anything I can do -- at any time -- anywhere ! ''
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 7]: repeated the young fellow , ardently .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 43]: He bowed to Miss Briskett , who extended her hand in patronising farewell , accompanying him to the door of the room , less , it appeared , from motives of kindliness , than to satisfy herself that he had really departed .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 31]: On her return she found that her niece had taken off her hat , and was leaning back in her chair , sticking hat-pins through the crown with smiling complacence .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 30]: Miss Briskett surveyed her with not unnatural curiosity , and came to the swift conclusion that she was not at all pretty , but most objectionably remarkable in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 23]: The sort of girl whom people would stare at in the street ; the sort of girl whom Norton would emphatically disapprove !
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 7]: Her hair in itself was arresting .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 8]: Miss Briskett had never seen such hair .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 24]: It was not red , it was not gold , it was not brown ; but rather a blending of all three colours .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 43]: It was , moreover , extraordinarily thick , and stood out from the head in a crisp mass , rippling into big natural waves , while behind each ear was a broad streak of a lighter shade , almost flaxen in colour .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 18]: No artificial means could have produced such an effect ; it was obviously the work of nature .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 5]: `` American nature ! ''
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 8]: Miss Briskett told herself with a sniff .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 13]: A respectably brought-up English girl could never have possessed such a head !
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 22]: Underneath this glorious mass of hair was a pale , little face , lighted up by a pair of golden-brown eyes .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 26]: The eyebrows were well - marked and remarkably flexible ; the nose was thin and pointed , a youthful replica of Miss Briskett 's own .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 35]: The only really good feature was the mouth , and that was adorable , with coral red lips curling up at the corners ; tempting , kissable lips , made for love and laughter .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 45]: For the rest , it was difficult to understand how a plain blue serge gown could possibly contrive to look so smart , or how those tiniest of tiny brown boots had managed to keep so dazzlingly free from dust throughout a railway journey .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 15]: Miss Briskett sat herself down by the tea-table , and cleared her throat ominously .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 22]: Her niece had not been ten minutes in the house , yet already an occasion had arisen for a serious rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 16]: `` Are you engaged to that young man , may I ask , Cornelia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 20]: Cornelia gave a little jump upon her seat , and opened her golden eyes in a stare of amazement .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 5]: `` Mussy , no !
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 13]: What in the land put such an idea in your head ? ''
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 22]: `` Your tone and manner , my dear , and the fact of his accompanying you all the way from town .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 20]: It is not usual for young men to put themselves to so much trouble for a mere acquaintance . ''
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 9]: `` He do n't think it a trouble .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 5]: He loves flying around !
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 23]: He 's a sweet thing , '' said Miss Cornelia , with smiling recollection , `` but he 's not my Chubb !
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 21]: I 'm sorry he could n't stay to tea , for he 's real amusing when he once gets started .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 10]: He 'd have made you screech with laughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 15]: Miss Briskett looked down her nose , in her most dignified and rebuking fashion .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 42]: `` I am not accustomed to ` screech ' about anything , and in this country , my dear , it is not considered convenable for young girls to accept the escort of a gentleman to whom they are not engaged .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 12]: No English girl would think of doing such a thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 32]: `` They must have a middling dull time of it , '' retorted Cornelia , calmly , `` I must teach them a thing or two while I 'm over . ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 27]: She rose to take the teacup from her aunt 's hand , and to help herself to a couple of sandwiches from a dainty heart-shaped dish .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 14]: `` Well -- are n't you pleased to have me , Aunt Soph ?
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 11]: I 've wanted years to come over and see you .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 13]: It seemed too bad that I knew none of Poppar 's people .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 7]: And now I 'm here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 84]: She wheeled round , teacup in hand , staring curiously around the handsome , over-furnished room ; at the big ebony console table , ornamented with bunches of fruit manufactured out of coloured pebbles ; at the grand piano in its walnut case ; the piano which was never opened , but which served as a stand for innumerable photographs and ornaments ; at the old-fashioned sofas and chairs in their glazey chintz covers ; at the glass-shaded vases on the marble mantelshelf .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 13]: `` I 'm here , and it 's too quaint for words !
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 7]: Everything 's -- _ different _ !
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 16]: I suppose England _ is _ different , is n't it , Aunt Soph ? ''
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 5]: `` Very different ! ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 9]: Miss Briskett 's tones fairly bubbled with innuendoes .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 37]: She put down her rolled slice of bread and butter , and added frostily , `` Before we go any further , Cornelia , I must really beg you to address me by my proper name .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 5]: My name is Sophia .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 20]: You have no intention of being disrespectful , I feel sure , but I am not accustomed to abbreviations .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 23]: I have never had a nickname in my life , and I have no wish to begin at this late date . ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 3]: `` My !
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 9]: you poor sufferer , how lonesome for you !
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 7]: Nicknames are so homely and cosy .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 10]: I have about as many as I have toes .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 10]: One of my friends calls me ` Corney . '
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 16]: He 's a bit of a wag -- -LRB- ` He , ' indeed ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 15]: -- Another one calls me ` Nelia , ' -- ` Neel-ya ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 13]: She threw a lingering sentiment into the repetition , and chuckled reminiscently .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 13]: `` To most of my chums I 'm just ` Neely . '
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 14]: Life 's too short for three syllables every day of the week ! ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 18]: `` Over here in England we are not too hurried to address people in a proper manner .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 20]: I shall call you by your full name , and expect you to do the same by me . ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 19]: `` All right , Aunt Sophia Ann , just as you please , '' cried Cornelia , naughtily .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 44]: She was standing up , cup in hand , but even as she spoke she subsided on to a footstool by Miss Briskett 's side , with a sudden lithe collapse of the body , which made that good lady gasp in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 34]: She had never seen anybody but a professional acrobat move so quickly or unexpectedly , and felt convinced that the tea must have been spilt , and crumbs scattered wholesale over the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 3]: But no !
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 40]: not even a drop had fallen into the saucer , and there sat Cornelia nibbling at an undamaged sandwich with little , strong , white teeth , as cool and composed as if such feats were of everyday occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 21]: `` This is how I sit by Poppar at home ; it 's more sociable than right across the room .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 18]: Poppar and I are just the greatest chums , and I hate it when he 's away .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 36]: There was a real nice woman wanted to come and keep house , and take me around -- Mrs Van Dusen , widow of Henry P Van Dusen , who made a boom in cheese .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 7]: Maybe you 've heard of him .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 16]: He made a pile , and lost it all , trying to do it again .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 24]: Then he got tired of himself and took the _ grippe _ and died , and it was pretty dull for Mrs Van .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 15]: She visits round , and puts in her time the best way she can .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 34]: She 'd have liked quite well to settle down at our place for three or four months , and I 'd have liked it too , if it had n't been for you .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 12]: I wanted to see you Aunt Soph -- ia Ann ! ''
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 87]: She put up a thin little hand , and rubbed it ingratiatingly up and down the shiny silk lap , to the stupefaction of Mason , who came in at that moment bearing a plate of hot scones , and retired to give a faithful rendering of the position to her allies in the kitchen , sitting down on the fender stool , and stroking the cook 's apron in dramatic imitation , while that good lady and her satellites went into helpless fits of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 24]: `` I 'd as soon stroke a nettle myself , '' said the cook , `` but there 's no accounting for taste !
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 30]: You take my word for it , if she goes on stroking much longer , she 'll get a sting as she wo n't forget in a hurry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 15]: Upstairs in the drawing-room , Miss Briskett 's fidgeting uncomfortably beneath that caressing hand .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 30]: In her lonely , self-contained life , she was so unused to demonstrations of the kind that she was at a loss how to receive them when they came .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 40]: Instinctively she drew herself away , shrinking into the corners of her chair and busying herself with the re - arrangement of the tray , while Cornelia asked one question after another in her high-pitched , slightly monotonous voice .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 14]: `` It 's mighty quiet out here , Aunt Soph -- ia Ann !
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 10]: Does it always go on being just as still ?
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 26]: Do you live all the year round , right here in this house by your lonesome , listening to the grass growing across the lane ?
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 9]: What do you _ do _ , anyway ?
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 7]: That 's a real smart-looking maid !
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 10]: Will she be the one to wait upon me ?
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 28]: Most all my shirt waists fasten up the back , and there 's got to be someone round to fix them , or I 'm all undone .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 15]: I guess you 're pretty tidy by the looks of you , Aunt Soph .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 23]: I ca n't see after things myself , but I fidget the life out of everybody if I 'm not just so .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 7]: I 've got the sweetest clothes .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 11]: -- Do you have gay times over here in Norton ?
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 9]: Is there a good deal of young society ?
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 10]: I love prancing round and having a good time .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 32]: Poppar says the boys spoil me ; there 's always a crowd of them hanging round , ready to do everything I want , and to send me flowers and bon-bons .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 7]: I 'm just crazed on bonbons !
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 12]: My state-room was piled full of bouquets and chocolates coming over .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 11]: I had more than any other girl on board ! ''
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 7]: Miss Briskett 's lips tightened ominously .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 28]: `` If by ` boys ' you mean young men , Cornelia , I am surprised that your father allows you to receive indiscriminate gifts from strangers .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 15]: I fear he hag become a thorough American , and forgotten his early training .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 29]: In England no young man would venture to send a gift to a lady to whom he was not either related , or engaged to be married . ''
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 3]: `` My !
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 3]: how mean !
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 19]: Amurican men are for ever sending things , and the girls just love to have them do it .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 26]: Seems to me , Aunt Soph , it 's about time I came over to teach you how to do things in this benighted isle !
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 37]: Poppar says you 're all pretty mouldy , but , short of an earthquake , he ca n't think of anything better calculated to shake you up , than a good spell of me waltzing around .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 7]: I guess he 's about right .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 9]: I 'm never quiet unless I 'm sick .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 14]: There 's not much of the Sleeping Beauty about Cornelia E Briskett ! ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 11]: Miss Briskett sat still , a pillar of outraged propriety .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 9]: This was worse than anything she had expected !
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 16]: The girl appeared to have no modesty , no decorum , no sense of shame .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 60]: She might straighten her back until it was as stiff as a poker , might arch her brows into semicircles , and purse her lips into an expression of disapproval which would have frightened Elma Ramsden out of her senses , but Cornelia never appeared to notice that anything was amiss , and continued her meal with bland enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 58]: When she had finished the sandwiches she rested her left arm more firmly on her aunt 's knee , and raised her pointed chin until it rested , actually rested , upon the edge of the table , the while she carefully scrutinised the different varieties of cake , and selected the piece most to her taste .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 32]: At this she proceeded to nibble with evident satisfaction , lifting it to her lips in one thin hand , while the other still rested caressingly on that shiny silk lap .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 22]: Miss Briskett 's dumb swellings of anger gradually subsided to the point when it became possible to put them into words .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 45]: She cleared her throat with the usual preliminary grunt , whereupon the girl turned her stag-like head , to gaze questioningly upwards , her expression sweetly alert , her eyes -- limpid , golden eyes -- widely opened between the double line of lashes !
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 12]: Miss Briskett looked , and the remonstrance died on her lips .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 60]: The scene shifted , and in an instant she had travelled back through the years to a day long , long ago , when she sat , a girl in her teens , talking to the little boy brother who was the dearest of all created things , telling him stories , and watching the wonder in his eyes !
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 32]: Pert , self - sufficient , and presumptuous as she might be , by some contradictory freak of nature , that divine innocence still lingered in this young girl 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 13]: The sight of it arrested the words on the spinster 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 33]: She realised with shame that almost every word which she had spoken to the girl since her arrival had been tinged with reproof , and blushed for her own lack of hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 12]: The frown faded , and was replaced by a struggling smile .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 17]: With a half-strained movement she advanced a chilly hand to meet the girl 's warm grasp .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 28]: Cornelia drew a long , fluttering sigh ; a sigh of utter contentment , and laid her russet head on the folds of the stiff grey silk .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 8]: `` Oh , Aunt Soph -- ia !
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 7]: you are just as sweet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 6]: she murmured beneath her breath .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 53]: Perfect health , radiant spirits , supreme self-confidence , a sweetly smiling determination to have her own way , and go her own course , though the skies fell , and all creation conspired to prevent her -- these were the characteristics of Miss Cornelia Briskett most apparent on a superficial acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 56]: On the morning after her arrival , when Mary the housemaid carried the cup of early morning tea to her bedside , she found the young lady leaning back against the pillows , enveloped in a garment which suggested a garden party , rather than a night-gown , wide awake , and ready for conversation .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 54]: Really a most affable young lady , who instead of vouchsafing a cool good-morning , launched out into quite a confidential talk , inquiring after the different members of Mary 's family , their names , ages , and occupations , and showing a most sympathetic interest in the girl 's own future .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 12]: `` I guess you are going to be married pretty soon !
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 8]: You 've got a marrying face ! ''
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 30]: she said shrewdly , whereupon Mary , blushing , acknowledged that she _ had _ a friend , and that he _ did _ speak of early next spring .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 6]: `` Told you so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 5]: cried Cornelia , dimpling .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 29]: `` Well , Mury , see here , you nip round and wait upon me the best you know , and I 'll give you an elegant present !
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 20]: I wear muslins most all the time in summer , and I ca n't endoor to have them mussed .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 20]: You keep carrying them away and ironing them out nice and smooth , without bothering me to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 2]: See !
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 23]: I need lots of attention ; there 's no getting away from that , but I 'll make it worth your while .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 19]: You just put your mind to it , and I guess you 'll make a tip-top maid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 11]: Mary was at least prepared to perish in the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 33]: She related the conversation downstairs , with the natural result that each of the other three maids registered a vow to be second to none in her attentions to the young visitor .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 37]: The breakfast-gong rang at eight o'clock , but it was a good ten minutes later before Cornelia came sauntering downstairs , singing an unknown ditty at the pitch of a sweet , if somewhat nasal voice .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 26]: She was dressed in white of the most elaborate simplicity , and her shaded hair looked even more crisply conspicuous than on the night before .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 52]: The last line of the song did not come to an end until she was half-way across the dining-room floor , and so far from being dismayed by her aunt 's stare of disapproval , she only laughed , waved her hands , and threw an extra flourish into the rallentando .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 46]: Then she swooped down upon the stiff figure , hugged it affectionately , and planted three kisses on the cold , grey face ; one on the lips , one on the brow , a third -- deliberately -- on the tip of the nose .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 5]: `` Cornelia , please !
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 6]: Recollect yourself , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 5]: Have a little respect .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 8]: You must never do that again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 18]: cried Miss Briskett , irritably , but the girl showed not the faintest sign of being awed .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 20]: `` It 's the nose of my father , and I 've just _ got _ to kiss it !
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 13]: It 's not a mite of use promising that I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 24]: I 've got to kiss it regularly every morning , and every night , until he comes over to be kissed himself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 23]: she announced calmly , seating herself at the opposite side of the square dining-table , and peering curiously at the various dishes .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 24]: `` Poppar says you never have anything for breakfast in England but bacon and eggs , but I do n't see any here .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 6]: What 's under this cover ?
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 4]: -- Fish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 14]: `` If you wait a few minutes your bacon will be brought in .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 19]: It had grown cold with waiting so long , so I sent it away to be kept hot .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 12]: The breakfast hour is eight ; not a quarter past . ''
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 13]: `` It 's not a mite of use telling me the hours .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 5]: I 'm always late !
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 26]: I do n't suppose I 've ever been down in time in my life , unless by a mistake , '' returned Cornelia , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 22]: `` I like to stay in bed and let the day get sorter warmed up and comfortable , before I begin .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 12]: What makes you want to get up so early , anyway ?
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 20]: I should have thought nine would have been heaps early enough , when you have nothing to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 10]: It was not a promising beginning to the day .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 22]: In her own household Miss Briskett was accustomed to an authority as complete as that of the general of an army .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 39]: She was just , and she was generous ; her servants were treated with kindness and consideration , but if they wished to retain their places , they had to learn the lesson of dumb , unquestioning obedience .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 21]: She might be right , she might be wrong , she might remember , she might forget -- no matter !
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 9]: it was not their business to enlighten her .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 10]: `` Theirs but to do , and die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 12]: She would not brook a question as to her own authority .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 34]: It was , therefore , a distinct blow to the good lady to find her decrees ignored by her young guest with a smiling good-nature , more baffling than the most determined opposition .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 36]: She remained stolidly silent throughout the meal , but Cornelia apparently regarded he attitude as a tactful abdication in her own favour , and kept up an incessant flow of conversation from start to finish .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 33]: When the bell was rung for prayers , she seated herself in a low chair , directly facing the servants ' seats , and smiled a dazzling greeting to each in turn .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 95]: They sat down in their usual positions , heads bent , hands folded on the middle of their clean white aprons ; feet tucked carefully out of sight ; there was no outward sign of irreverence or inattention in their demeanour , but Miss Briskett _ felt _ , that every single woman of them was absorbed -- utterly , consumedly absorbed -- in casting sly glances at that distracting white vision in the easy chair ; at the dully glowing hair , the floating folds of white , the tiny , extended feet .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 41]: She might have read a page of the dictionary , and they would not have noticed ; even Heap , who was old enough to know better , was edging sideways in her chair , to get a better view !
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 35]: When the four stiffly-starched dresses had rustled out of the room , Cornelia yawned , and stretched herself like a sleepy , luxurious kitten , then snoodled down once more in her comfortable chair .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 69]: Her eyes were fixed upon her aunt 's face , while that good lady bustled about the room , folding the newspaper into an accurate square , and putting it away in a brass-bound cage ; collecting scattered envelopes and putting them in the waste-paper basket , moving the flower-vases on the chimney-piece , so that they should stand at mathematically the same distance from the central clock .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 20]: At every movement she waited to hear the expected , `` Can I help you , Aunt Sophia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 35]: which right feeling would surely prompt in any well-principled damsel , and though her reply would of a certainty have been in the negative , she felt aggrieved that the opportunity was not vouchsafed .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 44]: She was determined not to look in the girl 's direction , nor to meet those watching eyes , but presently , in spite of herself , she felt a magnetic compulsion to turn her head to answer the bright , expectant glance .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 5]: queried Cornelia , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 8]: `` Well what , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 12]: `` How are you going to amuse me this forenoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 16]: Miss Briskett sat down suddenly in the nearest chair , and suffered a mental collapse .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 15]: Positively this view of the situation had never once dawned upon her unimaginative brain !
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 25]: Mrs Ramsden had dimly wrestled with the problem , solving it at last with an easy , `` She can talk to Elma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 22]: but the aunt and hostess had been too much occupied with consideration for her own comfort to think of anyone else .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 77]: It had crossed her mind that the girl might tire her , bore her , worry her , or humiliate her before the neighbours ; in an occasional giddy flight of fancy she had even supposed it possible that Cornelia might amuse her , and make life more agreeable , but never for the fraction of a second had she realised that she herself was fated either to bore , or to amuse Cornelia in return !
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 6]: The discovery was a shock .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 45]: Being a just woman , Miss Briskett was forced to the conclusion that she had been selfish and self-engrossed ; but such self-revelations do not as a rule soften our hearts towards the fellow - creature who has been the means of our enlightenment .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 27]: Miss Briskett was annoyed with herself , but she was much more annoyed with Cornelia , and considered that she had good reason to be so .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 16]: `` I have no time to think of frivolities in the morning , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 8]: I am too busy with household duties .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 42]: I am now going to the kitchen to interview my cook , then to the store-room to give out what is needed for the day , and when that is accomplished I shall go to the shops to give my orders .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 14]: If you wish , I shall be pleased to have your company ! ''
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 5]: `` Right oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 5]: cried Cornelia , nodding .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 14]: `` It will be a lesson in your silly old pounds and pence .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 11]: What do you keep in your store-room , Aunt Soph ?
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 3]: Nice things ?
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 2]: Fruits ?
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 2]: Candy ?
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 2]: Cake ?
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 16]: I would n't mind giving out the stores for a spell , now and again .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 21]: ... I 'll just mouch round , and be ready for you when you set out for your walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 49]: Miss Briskett left the room , in blissful ignorance of what `` mouch '' might mean , and much too dignified to inquire , but by the time that ten o'clock had struck , she had learnt to connect the expression with all that was irritating and presumptuous .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 43]: In the midst of her discussion with the cook , for instance , the sound of music burst upon her ears ; the echo of that disused piano which had almost forgotten to be anything but a stand for ornaments and lamps .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 47]: Bang went the bass , crash went the treble , the tune a well-known dance , played with a dash and a spirt , a rollicking marking of time irresistible to any human creature under forty , who did not suffer from corns on their toes .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 12]: In the recesses of the scullery a subdued scuffling was heard .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 34]: Tweeny was stepping it to and fro , saucepans in hand ; from the dining-room overhead , where Mason was clearing away the breakfast dishes , came a succession of mysterious bumping sounds .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 44]: Heap stood stolid as a rock , but her eyes -- her small , pale , querulous eyes -- danced a deliberate waltz round the table and back ... `` I must request Cornelia not to play the piano in the morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 6]: said Miss Briskett to herself .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 57]: From the store-room upstairs a sound of talking and laughing was heard from within the visitor 's bedroom , where sat that young lady in state , issuing orders to Mary , who was blissfully employed in unpacking the contents of one of the big dress boxes , and hanging up skirts in the mahogany wardrobe .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 18]: `` I must beg Cornelia not to interfere with the servants ' work in the morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 6]: said Miss Briskett once more .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 35]: At half-past ten silence reigned , and she went downstairs , equipped in her black silk mantle and her third best bonnet , to announce her readiness to start on the usual morning round .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 32]: Cornelia was not in the morning-room ; she was not in the drawing-room , though abundant signs of her recent presence were visible in the littered ornaments on the open piano .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 15]: `` I must beg Cornelia to put things back in their proper places ! ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 15]: said Miss Briskett a third time as she crossed the hall to the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 44]: This room also was empty , but even as she grasped the fact , Miss Briskett started with dismay to behold a bareheaded figure leaning over the garden gate , elbows propped on the topmost bar , and chin supported on clasped hands .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 30]: This time she did not pause to determine what commands she should issue in the future , but stepped hastily down the path to take immediate and peremptory measures .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 4]: `` My dear !
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 14]: in the front garden -- without a hat -- leaning over the gate !
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 7]: What can you be thinking of ?
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 7]: The neighbours might see you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 6]: Cornelia turned in lazy amusement .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 27]: `` Well , if it 's going to be a shock to them , they might as well begin early , and get it over . ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 12]: She ran a surprised eye over her aunt 's severe attire .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 13]: `` My , Aunt Soph , you look too good to live !
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 11]: I 'm ` most frightened of you in that bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 21]: If you 'd given a hoot from the window I 'd have hustled up , and not kept you waiting .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 11]: Just hang on two shakes while I get my hat .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 8]: I wo n't stay to prink ! ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 20]: `` I am not accustomed -- '' began Miss Briskett , automatically , but she spoke to thin air .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 18]: Cornelia had flown up the path in a cloud of swirling skirts ; cries of `` Mury !
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 3]: Mury ! ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 32]: sounded from within , and the mistress of the house slowly retraced her steps and seated herself to await the next appearance of the whirlwind with what patience she could command .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 6]: It was long in coming .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 29]: The clock ticked a slow quarter of an hour , and was approaching twenty minutes , when footsteps sounded once more , and Cornelia appeared in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 61]: She had not changed her dress , she had not donned her jacket ; her long , white gloves dangled from her hand ; to judge from appearances she had spent a solid twenty minutes in putting on a tip-tilted hat which had been trimmed with bows of dainty flowered ribbon , on the principle of the more the merrier .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 7]: Miss Briskett disapproved of the hat .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 34]: It dipped over the forehead , giving an obviously artificial air of demureness to the features ; it tilted up at the back , revealing the objectionable hair in all its wanton profusion .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 32]: It looked -- _ odd _ , and if there was one thing more than another to which Norton objected , it was a garment which differentiated itself from its fellows .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 31]: Aunt and niece walked down the path together in the direction of the South Lodge , the latter putting innumerable questions , to which the former replied in shocked surprise .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 10]: `` What were those gardens across the road ? ''
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 11]: -- They were private property of householders in the Park .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 14]: -- `` Did they have fine jinks over there in summer time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 18]: -- The householders in the park never , under any circumstances , indulged in `` jinks . ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 14]: They disapproved thoroughly , and on principle , of anything connected with jinks !
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 13]: -- `` Think of that now -- the poor , deluded creatures !
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 11]: What did they use the gardens for , anyway ? ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 29]: -- The gardens were used for an occasional promenade ; and were also valuable as forming a screen between the Park and the houses on the Western Road .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 14]: -- `` What was wrong with the houses on the Western Road ? ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 11]: -- There was nothing wrong with the houses in question .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 23]: The residents in the Park objected to see , or to be seen by , _ any _ houses , however desirable .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 12]: They wished to ensure for themselves an unbroken and uninterrupted privacy .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 6]: -- `` My gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 33]: Mrs Phipps , the dragon of the South Lodge , came out to the doorstep , and bobbed respectfully as Miss Briskett passed by , but curiosity was rampant upon her features .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 25]: Cornelia smiled radiantly upon her ; she smiled upon everyone she met , and threw bright , curious glances to right and to left .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 3]: `` My !
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 7]: is n't it _ green _ ?
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 2]: My !
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 5]: is n't it still ?
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 8]: Where _ is _ everyone , anyway ?
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 9]: Have they got a funeral in every house ?
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 12]: Seems kind of unsociable , muffling themselves up behind these hedgerows !
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 22]: Over with us , if we 've got a good thing , we 're not so eager to hide it away .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 14]: You can walk along the sidewalk and see everything that 's going on .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 11]: In the towns the families camp out on the doorsteps .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 7]: It 's real lively and sociable .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 6]: ... Are these your stores ?
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 14]: They look as if they 'd been made in the year one . ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 48]: They were , in truth , a quaint little row -- butcher , grocer , greengrocer , and linen-draper , all nestled into a little angle between two long , outstanding buildings , which seemed threatening at every moment to fall down and crush them to atoms .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 23]: The windows were small , and the space inside decidedly limited , and this morning there was an unusual rush of customers .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 31]: It seemed as if every housewife in the neighbourhood had sallied forth to make her purchases at the exact hour when Miss Briskett was known to do her daily shopping .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 16]: At the grocer 's counter Cornelia was introduced to Mrs Beaumont , of The Croft .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 8]: `` My niece , Miss Cornelia Briskett .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 8]: Mrs Beaumont , '' murmured Miss Briskett .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 6]: `` Mrs Beau_mont _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 26]: repeated Cornelia , loudly , with a gracious , sidelong observance , at which unusual manner of receiving an introduction both ladies stared in surprise .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 14]: Presently Mrs Beaumont recovered herself sufficiently to put an all - important question .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 8]: `` How do you like England ? ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 11]: `` I think it 's lovely , '' said Cornelia .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 35]: In the fishmonger 's shop Mrs Rhodes and Mrs Muir came up in their turn , and opened wide eyes of surprise as the strange girl again repeated their names in her high monotone .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 7]: Evidently this was an American custom .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 6]: Strange people , the Americans !
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 18]: The ladies simpered , and put the inevitable query : `` How do you like England ? ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 11]: `` I think it 's sweet , '' said Cornelia .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 11]: The draper 's shop was a revelation of old-world methods .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 28]: One anaemic - looking assistant endeavoured to attend to three counters and half a dozen customers , with an unruffled calm which they vainly strove to emulate .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 14]: Miss Briskett produced a pattern of grey ribbon which she wished to match .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 41]: Four different boxes were lifted down from the wall , and their contents ransacked in vain , while the patient waiters received small sops in the shape of cases and trays , shoved along to their corner of the counter .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 29]: When persuasion failed to convince Miss Briskett that an elephant grey exactly matched her silvery fragment -- `` I 'll see if we have it in stock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 12]: cried the damsel , hopefully , and promptly disappeared into space .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 27]: The minutes passed by ; Cornelia frowned and fidgeted , was introduced to a fourth dame , and declared that England was '' ` cute . ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 33]: Weary waiters for flannel and small-wares looked at their watches , and fidgeted restlessly , but no one rebelled , nor showed any inclination to walk out of the shop in disgust .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 31]: At length the assistant reappeared , flushed and panting , to regret that they were `` sold out , '' and `` What is your next pleasure , madam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 17]: Madam 's next pleasure was a skein of wool , which investigation again failed to produce .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 24]: `` But we have a very nice line in kid gloves ; can I show you something in that line this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 21]: Miss Briskett refused to be tempted , and produced a coin from her purse in payment of a small account .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 29]: Cornelia was interested to be introduced to `` hef-a-crown , '' and tried to calculate what would be left after the subtraction of a mysterious `` seven-three . ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 35]: She had abundant time to calculate , for , to the suspicious mind , it might really appear as if the assistant had emigrated to foreign climes with the half-crown as capital in hand .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 27]: The little shop was dull and stuffy ; an odour of flannel filled the air ; the faces of the patient waiters were colourless and depressed .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 12]: Cornelia flounced on her seat , and curled her beautiful lips .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 7]: `` My stars and stripes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 4]: she cried aloud .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 12]: `` I 'll take root if I sit here much longer .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 14]: Seems as that change wo n't be ready till the last trump ! ''
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 56]: She sprang from her chair as she spoke , too much absorbed in her own impatience to note the petrifaction of horror on the faces of the waiters at the counter , and in the doorway came face to face with a plump , dignified little lady , accompanied by a girl in navy blue .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 9]: `` How do you do , my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 21]: I am Mrs Ramsden , '' said the stoat lady , holding out her hand with a very pleasant friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 23]: `` As the niece of my dear friend and neighbour , allow me to give you a hearty welcome to our shores .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 17]: This is my daughter , Elma , with whom I hope you will be great friends .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 13]: I will leave you to talk together while I make my purchases .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 9]: Young people always get on better alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 49]: She smiled , a kind , motherly smile , nodding her head the while , until the upright feather quivered on its stem , then disappeared through the dingy portals , leaving the two girls on the narrow pavement staring at each other with bright , curious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 10]: `` How -- how do you like England ? ''
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 38]: queried Elma , shyly , and Cornelia answered with a happy laugh -- `` I 've been asked that question hef a dozen times already , and I only set foot on these shores day before yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 20]: I think it seems a real good place for a nerve rest , but if you want to hustle !
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 13]: -- '' She shrugged expressively , and Elma smiled with quick understanding .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 11]: `` Ah , you have been shopping at Willcox 's !
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 29]: But Willcox 's is not England -- Norton is not England ; it 's just a sleepy little backwater , shut away from the great current of life .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 10]: Do n't judge England by what you see here .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 17]: You 'd like the _ real _ England -- you could n't help liking that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 8]: `` I like _ you _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 5]: said Cornelia , bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 21]: She held out her hand with a gesture of frank camaraderie , and Elma clasped it , thrilling with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 16]: A happy conviction assured her that she had found a friend after her own heart .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 42]: By the time that Cornelia had been a week in residence at The Nook , she had become the one absorbing topic of Norton conversation , and her aunt 's attitude towards her was an odd mingling of shame and pride .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 62]: On principle the spinster disapproved of almost everything that the girl did or said , and suffered every day a succession of electric shocks -- but , as we all know , such shocks are guaranteed to exercise a bracing influence on the constitution , and Miss Briskett was conscious of feeling brighter and more alert than for many years past .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 11]: She no longer reigned as monarch over all she surveyed .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 54]: A Czar of Russia , suddenly confronted by a Duma of Radical principles and audacious energy , could not feel more proudly aggrieved and antagonistic , but it is conceivable that a Czar might cherish a secret affection for the leader of an opposition who showed himself honest , clever , and affectionate .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 38]: In conclave with her own heart , Miss Briskett acknowledged that she cherished a distinct partiality for her niece , but in view of the said niece 's tendency to conceit , the partiality was rigorously concealed .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 64]: As for Norton society , it welcomed Cornelia with open arms ; that is to say , all the old ladies of Miss Briskett 's acquaintance called upon her , inquired if she liked England , and sent their maids round the following day with neat little notes inviting aunt and niece to take tea on a certain afternoon at half-past four o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 25]: These tea-drinkings soon became a daily occurrence , and Cornelia 's attitude towards them was one of consecutive anticipation , amusement , and ennui .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 27]: You dressed up in your best clothes ; you sat in rows round a stuffy room ; you drank stewed tea , and ate buttered cakes .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 28]: You met every day the same -- everlastingly the same ladies , dressed in the same garments , and listened every day to the same futile talk .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 34]: From the older ladies , criticisms of last Sunday 's sermon , and details of household grievances ; from the younger , '' _ Have _ you seen Miss Horby 's new hat ?
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 11]: _ Did _ you hear the latest about the Briggs ?
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 28]: ... I 'm going to have blue , with lace insertions ... '' Cornelia bore it meekly for a week on end , and then she struck .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 15]: Two notes were discovered lying upon the breakfast-table containing invitations to two more tea-parties .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 6]: `` So kind of them !
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 14]: You will like to go , wo n't you , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 8]: said Miss Briskett , pouring out coffee .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 10]: `` No , I sha n't , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 7]: answered Cornelia , ladling out bacon .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 15]: Her curling lips were pressed together , her flexible eyebrows wrinkled towards the nose .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 16]: If Edward B Briskett had been present he would have recognised signals of breakers ahead !
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 11]: `` I guess I 'm about full up of tea-parties .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 13]: I 'm not going to any more , this side Jordan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 8]: `` Not going , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 9]: Miss Briskett choked with mingled amazement and dismay .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 8]: `` Why not , if you please ?
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 6]: You have no other engagements .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 10]: My friends pay you the honour of an invitation .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 8]: It is my wish that you accept .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 11]: You surely can not mean what you are saying ! ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 32]: She stared across the table in her most dignified and awe-inspiring fashion , but Cornelia refused to meet her eyes , devoting her entire attention to the consumption of her breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 7]: `` You bet I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 17]: `` Cornelia , how often must I beg you not to use that exceedingly objectionable expression ?
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 13]: I ask you a simple question ; please answer it without exaggeration .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 13]: Why do you object to accompany me to these two parties ? ''
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 9]: `` Because it 's a waste of time .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 15]: It 's against my principles to have the same tooth drawn six times over .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 22]: I know all I want to about tea-parties in England , and I 'm ready to pass on to something fresh .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 16]: I 'd go clean crazed if I 'd to sit through that performance again . ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 10]: `` I am sorry you have been so bored .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 30]: I hoped you had enjoyed yourself , '' said Miss Briskett , stiffly , but with an underlying disappointment in her tone , which Cornelia was quick to recognise .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 26]: The imps of temper and obstinacy which had peeped out of her golden eyes suddenly disappeared from view , and she nodded a cheery reassurement .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 11]: `` I was n't a mite bored at the start .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 40]: I loved going round with you and seeing your friends , but I _ have _ seen them , and they 've seen me , and we said all we want to , so that trick is played out .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 19]: You ca n't go on drinking tea with the same old ladies all the days of your life ?
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 10]: Why ca n't they hit on something fresh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 6]: Miss Briskett did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 9]: She was indeed too much upset for words .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 23]: Tea-drinking was the only form of dissipation in which she and her friends indulged , or had indulged for many years past .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 31]: In more energetic days an occasional dinner had varied the monotony , but as time crept on there seemed a dozen reasons for dropping the more elaborate form of entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 42]: A dinner-party upset the servants ; it necessitated the resurrection of the best dinner-service from the china cupboard , and the best silver from the safe ; it entailed late hours , a sense of responsibility , the exertion of entertaining .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 46]: How much simpler to buy a sixpenny jar of cream and a few shillings worth of cake welcome your friends at half-past four , and be free at half-past five to lie down on the sofa , and have a nap before dressing for dinner !
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 37]: Miss Briskett had counted on a protracted orgy of tea-parties in her niece 's honour , and had already planned a return bout on her own accord , to set the ball rolling a second time .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 26]: Her wildest flight of fancy had not soared beyond tea , and here was Cornelia showing signs of rebellion at the end of a fortnight !
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 30]: It said much for the impression which that young lady had made that there was a note of actual entreaty in the voice in which her aunt addressed her .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 11]: `` I think you must reconsider your decision , Cornelia .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 20]: I strongly wish you to accept these invitations , and my friends will be much disappointed if you refuse .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 30]: When you understand the position , I feel sure you will put your own wishes on one side , and consent to do what is right and fitting . ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 18]: But Miss Cornelia tossed her head , and the impish light flashed back into her golden eyes .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 13]: `` I ke n't break my word , '' she said bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 47]: In moments of friction her American accent was even more strongly marked than usual , which fact was not calculated to soften her aunt 's irritation , `` Poppar had me taught to say a thing and stick to it , no matter how I suffered .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 34]: I 've _ said _ I wo n't go , and I _ wo n't _ -- not if all the old ladies in Christendom were to come and howl at the door !
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 22]: You ken tell 'em I 've come out in spots , and you reckon I 'm going down with small-pox . ''
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 8]: `` That would not be true . ''
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 6]: `` Oh , shucks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 3]: shrugged Cornelia .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 38]: `` Troth is a fine institootion , but , like most old things , it gives out at times , and then there 's nothing for it but to fall back upon good , new-fashioned imagination . ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 12]: Miss Briskett rose majestically from her seat and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 30]: Cornelia lifted the remnant of bread which lay beside her plate , raised it high above her head , and deliberately pitched it to the end of the room .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 17]: It hit against the wall , and fell over the carpet in a shower of crumbs .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 20]: She chuckled malevolently , gave the table a vicious shove on one side , and rose in her turn .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 52]: On one of the tables by the window stood a neat little pile of books ; she lifted the topmost , and thrusting it under her arm , marched deliberately down the garden path to the front gate , and thence across the road towards the gate leading into the plantation .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 28]: It was a hot , sunny day , and half-way up the green knoll stood an oak tree , whose spreading branches made delightful dapplings of shade .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 28]: Here also a gentle breeze rustled the leaves to and fro , while in the stuffy paths below the air itself seemed exhausted and bereft of life .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 42]: Cornelia lifted her white skirts , with a display of slim brown ankles which would have scandalised the Norton worthies , stepped neatly and cleanly over the wire arches , and made a bee-line across the grass for the forbidden spot .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 25]: She was in the mood when it seemed an absolute necessity to defy somebody , and even a printed notice was better than nothing .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 36]: She seated herself aggressively in the most conspicuous position , on the side of the tree facing the houses , spread wide her skirts on either side , folded her arms , and awaited developments .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 19]: `` I hope they 'll _ all _ look out and see me sitting on their old grass !
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 31]: I hope they 'll come over , and stand in _ rows _ on the path , telling me that nice young girls never sat on the grass in England .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 12]: ... Then I 'll tell 'em what _ I _ think .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 11]: ... I 'm just in the mood to do it .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 13]: Seems as if I had n't drawn a free breath for weeks .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 8]: ` Cornelia , _ do n't _ !
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 7]: Cornelia , _ do _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 30]: ` In this country we always -- ' ` In this country we never -- ' My stars and stripes ; why did I leave my happy home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 33]: Round the corner of the path there came into view the figure of Morris , keeper of the South Lodge , sweeping the gravel path , his head bent over his task .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 11]: Cornelia 's naughty eyes sent out a flash of delight .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 20]: She cleared her throat in a deliberate `` hem , '' cleared it again , and coughed in conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 22]: Morris leant on his broom , surveyed the landscape o'er , and visibly reeled at the sight of such barefaced trespassing .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 23]: The broom was hoisted against a tree , while he himself mounted the sloping path , shading his eyes from the sun .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 38]: At the first glance he had recognised the '' ` Merican young lady , '' whose doings and clothings -- particularly clothings -- had formed the unvarying theme of his wife 's conversation for the last fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 41]: He had committed himself so far as to say that he rather fancied the looks of her , but in the depths of his heart the feeling lingered that for a born lady she was a trifle `` free . ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 28]: Morris was a survival of the old feudal type who `` knew his place , '' and enjoyed being trampled under foot by his `` betters . ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 18]: If an employer addressed him in terms of kindly consideration , his gratitude was tinged with contempt .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 18]: These were not the manners of the good old gentry in whose service he had been trained !
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 16]: Opposite the oak tree he came to a stand , and assumed his official manner .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 15]: `` Beg pardon , miss ; visitors his not permitted on the graws . ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 11]: `` For the land 's sake , why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 10]: `` It 's against the rules , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 5]: `` Suppose it is !
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 9]: What will happen if I break 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 23]: Morris looked discomfited , pushed his hat from his forehead , and murmured vaguely that he ` sposed she 'd be punished .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 4]: `` Who by ?
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 10]: Who does the grass belong to , anyhow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 19]: `` To yer Rant , miss , and the hother ladies and gentlemen that owns the park . ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 12]: `` Well , and what could _ they _ do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 11]: Morris , still vague and uncomfortable , murmured concerning prosecution .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 6]: `` What 's prosecution ? ''
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 3]: queried Cornelia .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 6]: `` Sounds exciting , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 10]: Much more exciting than sitting on the gravel paths .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 12]: Guess I 'll stay where I am , and find out .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 26]: You get on with your work , and keep calm , and when the fun begins you can waltz in , and play your part .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 15]: It 's no use _ one _ officer trying to arrest me , though !
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 16]: You 'll need a _ posse _ , for I 'll fight to the death !
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 8]: You might give them the tip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 19]: Morris walked down hill in stunned surprise , leaving Cornelia to chuckle to herself in restored good humour .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 36]: Her impulses towards rebellion and repentance were alike swift and speedy , but between the two lay a span of licence , when she revelled in revolt , and felt the tingling of riotous success .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 28]: Such a moment was the present as she watched Morris 's dumb retreat , and cast her dancing eyes around , in search of the next victim .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 38]: For the moment no living creature was in sight , but the scene was sufficiently entrancing to justify the statement that there is no country in the world so charming as England on a fine June day .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 40]: It was hot , but not too hot to be exhausting ; little fleecy white clouds flecked the blue dome overhead ; the air was sweet with the odour of flowering trees now in the height of their beauty .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 23]: The gardener who had planted them had possessed a nice eye for colour , and much skill in gaining the desired effects .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 64]: The golden rain of laburnum , and deep rich red of hawthorn , were thrown up against the dark lustre of copper-beech , or the misty green of a graceful fir tree ; white and purple lilac were divided by a light pink thorn , and on the tall chestnuts the red and white blossoms shone like candles on a giant Christmas tree .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 41]: It was the one , all-wonderful week , when everything seems in bloom at the same time ; the week which presages the end of spring , more beautiful than summer , as promise is ever more perfect than fulfilment .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 17]: Even the stiff crescent of houses looked picturesque , viewed through the softening screen of green .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 11]: Cornelia scanned the row of upper windows with smiling curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 41]: No one was visible ; no one ever _ was _ visible at a window at Norton Park ; but discreetly hidden by the lace curtains , half a dozen be-capped heads might even now be nodding in her direction .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 17]: -- `` My dear , _ what _ is that white figure under the oak tree ?
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 20]: I thought at first it must be a sheep , but it is evidently a female of some description .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 24]: It looks exceedingly like -- but it could not be , it could not _ possibly _ be , Miss Briskett 's niece !
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 19]: ... '' Miss Briskett 's niece chuckled , and turned her head to look up the sloping path .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 32]: Her choice of position had been largely decided by the fact that Elma Ramsden was due to return by this route from a weekly music lesson somewhere about the present time .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 79]: In the course of the past week the two girls had drunk tea in the same houses every afternoon , and exchanged sympathetic glances across a phalanx of elderly ladies , but the chances for _ tete-a-tete _ conversations had been disappointingly few , and this morning Cornelia had a craving for a companion young enough to encourage her in her rebellion , or at least to understand the pent-up vitality which had brought it to a head .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 13]: She watched eagerly for the advent of the tall , blue-robed figure .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 10]: Elma always wore dark blue cambric on ordinary occasions .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 5]: `` So useful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 15]: said her mother , `` and such a saving in the washing bill . ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 29]: Mother and daughter ran up the plain breadths in the sewing machine , and the only fitting in the body was compassed by a draw-string at the waist .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 29]: It did not seem a matter of moment to Mrs Ramsden whether the said string was an inch higher or lower , and Elma was economical in belts .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 25]: Cornelia 's expression was eloquent as she viewed the outline of the English girl 's figure as she slowly approached down the narrow path .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 9]: So far Elma had not noticed her presence .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 10]: She was too much buried in her own dreams .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 4]: Poor pretty thing !
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 16]: That was all that was left to her -- to take it out in dreams .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 9]: She had not yet begun to be awake !
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 24]: Twenty yards farther Elma came to a halt , eyes and lips opened wide in gaping astonishment at the sight of the trespasser .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 3]: `` Cornelia !
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 8]: You are sitting on the grass . ''
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 5]: `` That 's so !
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 12]: Why should n't I , if I 've a mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 6]: `` It 's forbidden ! ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 6]: `` Oh , shucks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 5]: cried Cornelia , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 5]: `` Who by ? ''
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 11]: Elma waved her hand vaguely towards the crescent of houses .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 7]: `` Everybody -- all of them !
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 5]: It 's a rule .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 5]: They all agreed . ''
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 5]: `` Suppose they did !
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 18]: I guess it would take more than ten old ladies to prevent me doing what I want .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 16]: What 's the good of grass , anyway , if you ca n't enjoy it ?
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 6]: It 's lovely up here .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 8]: I 'm as cool as an otter .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 8]: You look pretty warm after your walk .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 11]: Step over , and come right here by me . ''
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 15]: She patted the ground beside her , and smiled in her most irresistible fashion .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 16]: `` We 'll have the loveliest talk -- '' Elma hesitated , fascinated but dismayed .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 5]: `` I dare n't .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 6]: It 's breaking the rules .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 6]: What would they say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 11]: `` That 's what we 've got to find out .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 18]: They ca n't kill us , anyway , and we 'll have had a good time first .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 12]: You 've got to pay your bills in this wicked world .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 7]: Now , then -- hustle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 6]: `` I ca n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 18]: faltered Elma , and lifted one foot over the wire arch , `` I dare n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 11]: and stepped completely over , lifting her skirt behind her .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 5]: The deed was done !
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 28]: A tingle of excitement ran through her veins , she reared her head and laughed aloud , looking with bright , unashamed eyes at the curtained windows .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 31]: The moment of revolt had come ; a moment long desired in the depths of a meek , long-suffering heart , and prepared for by many a seething inward struggle .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 11]: Cornelia had applied the match , and the tow blazed .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 11]: Elma laughed again , and seated herself beneath the tree .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 21]: Cornelia had tossed her hat on the ground and clasped her hands round her knees in comfortable , inelegant position .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 27]: Elma did the same , and the American girl , watching her , was at a loss to account for the reckless radiance of her smile .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 42]: The sunshine flickered down between the branches on the sweet pink and white face , the pansy blue eyes , and long slender throat ; it shone alike on the ill-fitting gown , the clumsy shoes , the carelessly arranged hair .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 19]: Cornelia 's golden eyes travelled up and down , down and up , in earnest , scrutinising fashion .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 17]: She met Elma 's glance with a shake of the head , forbearing , yet reproachful .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 3]: `` Say !
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 12]: You do n't know how to prink , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 4]: `` Prink ? ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 12]: Elma was doubtful even as to the meaning of the word .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 12]: She arched her brows in inquiry , whereat Cornelia laughed aloud .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 8]: `` You are real , genuine English !
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 33]: You make me think of roses , and cream , and honey , and mountain dew , and everything that 's sweet and wholesome , and takes no thought of the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 57]: If you lived over with us , we 'd fix you up so your own mother would n't know you , and there 'd be paragraphs about you in the papers every single day , saying what you did , and what you were wearing , and how you looked when you wore it . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 23]: ` Miss Elma Ramsden sat on the grass , attired in a blue rag , with freckles on her nose . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 6]: `` My , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 3]: Cornelia chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 11]: `` They spread it pretty thick when they once begin .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 12]: You 'd have every adjective in the dictionary emptied over you .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 19]: ` The irresistible Elma , ' ` Radiant Miss Ramsden , ' ` The beauteous English Rose . '
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 18]: Half the time it 's only bluff , but with you it would be a true bill .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 6]: You _ are _ beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 6]: Do you know it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 10]: The pink flush deepened in Elma 's delicate face .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 5]: `` Am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 4]: she asked wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 3]: `` Really ?
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 8]: Oh , I hope you are right .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 22]: I should be so happy if it were true , but -- but , I 'm afraid it ca n't be .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 15]: No one notices me ; no one seems to think I am -- nice !
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 19]: I 'm only just Elma Ramsden -- not radiant , nor irresistible , nor anything of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 17]: Plain Elma Ramsden , as much a matter of course as the trees in the park .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 28]: Since you came here , in one fortnight , you 've had more attention than I 've had in the whole course of my life . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 5]: _ Attention _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 13]: echoed Cornelia , shrilly , and rolled her eyes to the firmament .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 3]: `` Attention ?
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 28]: You ken sit there and look me in the face , and talk about the ` attention ' that 's been paid me the last two weeks !
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 4]: You 're crazed !
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 12]: Where does the attention come in , I want to know ?
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 14]: I have n't spoken to a single man since the day I arrived .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 17]: You do n't call a dozen old ladies clucking round _ attention _ , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 11]: Where _ are _ all the young men , anyhow ?
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 21]: I have been used to a heap of men 's society , and I 'm kind of lost without it .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 19]: I call attention having half a dozen nice boys to play about , and do whatever I want .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 15]: Do n't you ever have any nice young men to take you round ? ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 28]: Elma 's dissent was tinged with shocked surprise , for she had been educated in the theory that it was unmaidenly to think about the opposite sex .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 73]: True , experience had proved that this was an impossibility , for thoughts took wing and flew where they would , and dreams grew of themselves -- dreams of someone big , and strong , and tender ; someone who would _ understand _ , and fill the void in one 's heart which ached sometimes , and called for more , more ; refusing to be satisfied with food and raiment .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 53]: Sometimes the dream took a definite shape , insisted on the possession of grey eyes and wide square shoulders , associating itself with the personality of a certain young squire of racing , bridge-playing tendencies , at whom all Park dwellers glanced askance , refusing to him the honour of their hospitality !
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 30]: There remained , however , certain functions at which this outlaw must annually be encountered ; functions when one was thrillingly conscious of being signalled out for unusual attention .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 50]: One remembered , for example , being escorted to eat ices , under the shade of an arbour of crimson ramblers ; of talking with tongues about the weather , and the flowers , and the music ; while grey eyes looked into blue , and said unutterable things .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 13]: Oh , the beauty of the sky seen through those rosy branches !
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 8]: Oh , the glory of the sun !
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 10]: There had never been such a summer day before .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 15]: ... Elma trembled at the remembrance , and then blushed at her own audacity .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 23]: It was terrible to have to acknowledge such things to one 's inmost heart , but to put them into words -- !
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 16]: She pursed her lips , and looked demurely scandalised by her companion 's plain speaking .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 45]: `` Do you know , Cornelia , '' -- she had been commanded to use the Christian name , but it still came with a certain amount of hesitation -- `` if I were you I would not talk like that before your aunt .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 10]: We -- we do n't do it over here !
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 17]: It is not considered -- nice -- for a girl to talk about young men . ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 4]: Cornelia smiled slowly .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 19]: Her beautiful lips curved upwards at the corner , giving an air of impish mischief to her face .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 17]: She nodded her head three times over , and hitched a shoulder under the muslin gown .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 4]: `` We-ell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 38]: she drawled in her most pronounced accent , `` if I 've got to think of 'em , I might as well talk of 'em , and I 'm _ bound _ to think of 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 24]: She relaxed the grasp of her knees , and lay back against the trunk of a tree , chuckling softly in retrospective triumph .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 9]: `` I 've had such heaps of fun !
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 23]: I just love to carry on , and have half-a-dozen boys quarrelling over me , and hustling to get the first chance .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 39]: I 've had as many as ten bouquets before a ball , and I wore an eleventh , which I 'd gotten for myself , and they were all clean crazed to find out who 'd sent it .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 20]: Poppar says I 'll be an old maid yet , but it wo n't be for want of asking .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 43]: There 's one young man who 's just daft about me -- he 's young , and he 's lovely , and he 's got ten million and a hef dollars , and I 've _ tried _ to love him . ''
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 4]: She sighed despairing .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 14]: `` I 've tried hard , but I _ ke n't _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 32]: Elm a struggled between disapproval , curiosity , and a shocking mingling of something else , which was not , could not possibly be , _ envy _ of such adventures !
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 11]: The lingering doubt served to add severity to her indictment .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 9]: `` It 's very wicked to flirt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 8]: Once again Cornelia flashed her impish smile .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 6]: `` It 's vurry nice !
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 19]: I do n't see a mite of use in being young if you ke n't have some fun .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 21]: You grow old fast enough , and then there 's nothing else to it but to sit round and preach .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 25]: Your mother and Aunt Soph have just _ got _ to preach , but I would n't start yet awhile if I were you .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 50]: You 'd be just the prettiest thing that was ever seen if you knew how to fix yourself up , but you _ do n't _ , and you seem to me to mope along the whole blessed time , without a bit of fun to perk you up .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 2]: Say !
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 11]: do n't you feel a bit tired of it sometimes ?
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 22]: Do n't you ever have a kind of feeling that you want to _ do _ something for a change ? ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 3]: `` Sometimes !
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 5]: Do I ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 8]: Elma echoed the words with startling emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 5]: `` Always , always !
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 55]: It is here , '' -- she pressed her hands on her breast -- `` stifled up here all the time -- a horrible , rebellious longing to get out ; to be free , to do -- I do n't know what -- really I do n't -- but something _ different _ !
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 15]: I 've lived in Norton all my life , and hardly ever been away .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 29]: Mother hates travelling in winter , and in the summer she hates to leave the garden , and I 'm so strong that I do n't need change .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 9]: I never went to school like other girls .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 12]: Mother disapproves of school influences , so I had governesses instead .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 26]: It 's awful to have a resident teacher in the house , and be an only pupil ; you feel governessed out of your life .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 26]: And now I have no friends to visit , or to visit me , only the Norton girls , for whom I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 20]: It seems ungrateful when I have so much to be thankful for , but I feel _ pent _ !
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 18]: Sometimes I get such a wicked feeling that I just long to snap and snarl at everybody .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 54]: I 'm ashamed all the time , and can _ see _ how horrid I am , but -- '' She broke off , sighing deeply , and Cornelia crouched forward , clasping her knees as before , and bending her chin to meet them , her eyes ashine with eagerness and curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 12]: `` Yes , I know ; I 've been there myself .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 10]: I was there this morning after just two weeks .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 21]: I do n't begin to have your endoorance , my dear , but you take a straight tip from me .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 51]: When you feel the symptoms coming on , do n't you go trying to be sweet and forbearing , and bottling up all the froth ; it 's not a mite of use , for it 's bound to rise to the top , and keeping do n't improve it .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 33]: Just let yourself go , and be right-down ugly to _ somebody _ -- anyone will do , the first that comes handy -- and you 'll feel a heap better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 16]: She sighed , and turned a roguish glance towards the shrouded windows of The Nook .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 13]: `` I was ugly to Aunt Soph before I came out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 35]: Already Elma had mastered the subtleties of Americanese sufficiently to understand that the terms `` lovely '' and `` ugly '' had no bearing on outward appearance , but were descriptive of character only .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 39]: Her eyes widened , partly in horrified surprise at listening to a doctrine so diametrically opposed to everything which she had previously heard , and partly in pure , unadulterated curiosity to know the cause of the rebellion .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 5]: `` To Miss Briskett ?
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 8]: Oh , how had you the courage ?
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 8]: I should never have _ dared _ .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 6]: What was it about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 4]: `` Teas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 5]: replied Cornelia , shortly .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 27]: `` I 've attended tea-parties regularly for the last ten days , and met the same people every single time , and now I 've struck .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 31]: I 've had about enough teas to last the rest of my natural life , but Aunt Soph seemed to think I was bound to go wherever I was asked .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 9]: Two more old ladies sent invitations to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 7]: `` I know -- at lunch-time .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 6]: We got ours , too .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 15]: You ca n't refuse , Cornelia , if you have n't another engagement . ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 6]: `` Ca n't I just ?
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 5]: You bet I can .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 14]: Besides , what 's to hinder having an engagement if I want to ?
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 2]: Say !
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 8]: let 's fix one up right here .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 26]: I 'd be delighted to have you come a drive with me to show me the country , Thursday afternoon at a quarter after four .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 23]: We could hire something , I suppose , to drive in , and find a place to have tea on the way .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 23]: We 'd have a high old talk , and you 'd enjoy it a heap more than the tea - party . ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 25]: `` Oh , I know that , but I do n't know if I ought , -- Mrs Nevins ' invitation came first . ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 4]: `` Shucks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 20]: cried Cornelia , `` you 've got too much conscience -- that 's what 's the matter with you .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 22]: You 'll never have much of a time in this world if you do n't take the pick of a choice .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 7]: What 's two hours , anyway ?
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 22]: You go right home , and write nice and pretty to say you 're real sorry you 've got another engagement .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 9]: Your mother can trot along with Aunt Soph .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 20]: They 'll enjoy themselves a heap better sitting round without us , talking over the perversities of the young .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 21]: They were all tame angels when they were girls , and never did anything they ought not to have done .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 3]: My ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 12]: She twisted her saucy nose , and rolled her eyes heavenwards .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 10]: `` I 'm thankful I struck a livelier time !
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 27]: As for you , Elma Ramsden , you 're going to be equal to any one of them , if nothing happens to shake you up .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 20]: I guess it 's my mission to do the shaking , so we 'll start fair from now on .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 8]: You 're engaged to me Thursday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 3]: D'you understand ?
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 18]: I guess we 'd better go home and break the news before the answers are written . ''
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 23]: She rose to her feet , and Elma followed her example , shaking her skirts and fastening on the shady mushroom hat .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 35]: No further protestations rose to her lips , so it might be taken for granted that silence gave consent , but half-way down the path she spoke again , in tentative , hesitating fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 9]: `` I do n't mind about Mrs Nevins .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 17]: She is rich and strong , and enjoys her life ; but Miss Nesbitt is different .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 9]: She 's an old maid , and poor .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 30]: She belongs to a good family , so she is asked out with the rest , but she hardly ever gives a tea -- not once in a year .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 37]: It will be a great event to her ; she 'll be beginning to make preparations even now ; baking cakes , and cleaning the silver , and taking off the covers of the drawing-room chairs .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 7]: It is all in your honour .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 11]: She 'll be disappointed if you do n't go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 10]: Cornelia turned upon her with a flash of reproof .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 15]: `` Why could n't you tell me that before , I want to know ?
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 15]: Pretty mean I should have felt , backing out of a thing like that !
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 11]: I would n't disappoint the old dear for a fortune .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 18]: Is it the one with the flat hair , and the little ringlets dangling at the sides ?
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 11]: They are too ` cute for anything , those ringlets .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 17]: I guessed she was the one , for I noticed her clothes looked all used up .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 5]: Do n't you worry !
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 24]: I 'll take tea with Miss Nesbitt as often as she wants , and behave so pretty you 'll admire to see me .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 14]: That 's an olive branch to carry in to Aunt Soph -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 9]: I reckon she 'll be pretty dusty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 7]: `` I reckon she will . ''
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 13]: Elma glanced with a half-fearful smile at her companion 's unruffled face .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 13]: `` I would n't be in your shoes for a hundred pounds .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 17]: Miss Briskett is formidable enough when she is pleased ; but when she is angry -- !
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 8]: Cornelia , are n't you frightened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 31]: Cornelia 's joyous peal of laughter floated away on the air , and caught the ears of the industrious Morris , who was sweeping the path a hundred yards away .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 19]: He turned to lean on his brush and stare , while Elma glanced nervously at the curtained windows .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 26]: `` I never was scared in my life that I know of , and I 'm not going to begin with my very own aunt .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 14]: I rather like a fizzle now and then -- it freshens one up .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 7]: Do n't you worry about me !
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 11]: I 'm quite able to stand up for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 24]: She pushed open the gate of The Nook as she spoke and sauntered up the path ; laughing , bareheaded , radiantly unashamed .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 28]: Miss Briskett beheld her approach from her seat in the corner of the drawing-room , and two spots of colour shone dully on her thin cheek bones .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 21]: The hands which held her knitting trembled with indignation , and her eyes welcomed the culprit with a steely flash .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 20]: `` Cornelia , are you aware that you are forbidden to trespass on the grass of this park ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 6]: `` Yes , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 40]: `` You are also aware , I presume , that to wander alone bareheaded is not the habit of young ladies in this neighbourhood , and that it is intensely annoying to me that you should do so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 6]: `` Yes , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 7]: `` You _ do _ know !
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 8]: You are not ashamed to acknowledge it !
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 19]: Then may I inquire why you have deliberately chosen to do what you know to be wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 27]: Cornelia drew up a comfortable chair and seated herself by her aunt 's side , arranging her draperies with a succession of little pulls and pats .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 34]: She rested one elbow on the arm of the chair , and leant her chin upon the upraised palm , a pretty , thoughtful-looking pose into which she fell naturally in leisure moments .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 48]: The cat blinked at her through sleepy eyelids , then , deliberately ignoring the devotion of years , rose from its place by its mistress 's side , stretched itself with feline grace , and stalked majestically across the rug to nestle against the soft white skirts .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 12]: Miss Briskett eyed its desertion over the brim of her spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 3]: Poor lady !
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 19]: her measure of love received was so small , that she felt a distinct pang at the defection .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 10]: `` What explanation have you to offer , Cornelia ?
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 9]: You knew that you would annoy me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 8]: `` Why , yes , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 8]: That 's all there was to it !
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 23]: It did n't thrill me a mite to walk over a strip of lawn , without figging up in my best duds .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 22]: I can do that any day I want at home , but I just _ had _ to raise Cain somehow !
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 15]: It 's the only way I ken pull round again when I get mad .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 25]: I just go right away and do the ugliest thing I can strike , and then I feel all soothed , and calmed down .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 16]: You try it yourself , next time ; it beats knitting stockings all into fits !
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 21]: I 'm just as sweet as candy now , so you 've got to forgive me , and be friends .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 20]: I 'm sorry I acted so mean , but you were pretty nippy yourself , were n't you now ?
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 42]: I guess we 've both been used to take our own way without any fluster , and it comes pretty hard to be crossed , but now we 've had our fling , we 've got to kiss and make friends .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 9]: That 's so ; is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 23]: She bent forward , pouting her lips to receive the token of peace , but Miss Briskett drew back in chilly dignity .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 41]: For the past hour she had nourished a smouldering resentment , feeling herself the most ill-used of womenkind , and this calm inclusion of herself in the list of wrong-doers did not tend to pour oil on the troubled waters .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 30]: For Cornelia to acknowledge her deliberate intention to offend , and in the same breath to offer a kiss of reconciliation , showed a reprehensible lack of proper feeling .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 20]: Miss Briskett was a woman of high principles , and made a point of forgiving her enemies -- slowly !
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 30]: As a preliminary process she demanded an abject apology , and a period of waiting , during which the culprit was expected to be devoured by remorse and anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 14]: Then , bending from an impeccable height , she vouchsafed a mitigated pardon .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 12]: `` I forgive you , but I can never forget ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 32]: Some such absolution she would have been ready to bestow upon a tearful and dejected Cornelia , but the pink and white complaisance of the uplifted face steeled her heart afresh .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 12]: She shrank back in her chair , ignoring the outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 29]: `` Excuse me , my dear , but I do not care to kiss a person who has just acknowledged that she has deliberately tried to annoy me .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 26]: I was naturally displeased at your rejection of my friend 's hospitality , but it is exceedingly impertinent to compare my behaviour to your own .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 18]: You seem to forget that I am your hostess , and nearly three times your age . ''
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 15]: `` Then you ought to be three times better , ought n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 5]: retorted Cornelia , blandly .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 44]: `` Well , I 'll own up that I 'm sorry about Miss Nesbitt , and I 'll be pleased to take tea with her as often as she likes , but I regret that a previous engagement prevents my going Thursday also .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 46]: You tell the old lady from me that I 'm real sorry to miss the treat , and if it will ease her mind any to know that I do n't think England 's a patch on America , she 's welcome to the information .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 18]: Elma Ramsden and I have fixed up a drive to see the country , Thursday afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 8]: Miss Briskett 's knitting-needles clinked irritably together .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 27]: A half concession was little better than none , and the frivolous tone of Cornelia 's remarks spoke of something far removed from the ideal repentance .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 31]: Apart from the question of the tea-party , she disapproved of two young girls driving about the country unattended , but her courage shrank from the thought of another battle .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 27]: She dropped her eyelids , and replied icily -- `` As you have already made your arrangements it is useless for me to offer any objections .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 17]: You are evidently determined to take your own way in spite of anything I can say .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 14]: I can only trust that no harm may come of the experiment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 30]: On Thursday afternoon at three o'clock Cornelia retired to her bedroom , and with the help of the devoted Mary proceeded to make an elaborate toilette for the drive .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 28]: Those wonderful trunks seemed to contain garments suitable for every possible occasion which could arise ; for every fluctuation of weather , for every degree of festivity .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 56]: From one of the number out came a long driving coat , snowy white , light of texture , an ideal garment for a warm yet dusty summer 's day , which being fastened down the side by huge pearl buttons , displayed a degree of smartness nothing short of uncanny in an untrimmed garment .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 23]: To wear with the coat there was a jaunty cap , and a pair of driving gloves with wide , gauntleted cuffs .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 40]: Cornelia made faces at herself in the glass as her custom was the while she arranged the `` set '' of her hat , puffed out her shaded locks , and affably cross-questioned her attendant on her private affairs .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 9]: `` Mury , how 's your friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 18]: `` He is n't so well as he was , miss , thank you all the same .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 11]: He 's been a bit upset in his indigestion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 6]: `` Think of that now !
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 5]: Is n't that sad !
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 12]: You buy him a bottle of physic and send it along .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 4]: I 'll pay !
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 13]: It 's not a mite of use having a friend with indigestion .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 19]: He 'll be just as doleful , and you want him to give you a real good time .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 9]: ... How 's your mother getting along ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 8]: `` Nicely , thank you , miss .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 15]: She said she did n't know how to thank you enough for the shawl .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 24]: Her poor old bones have n't ached half so much since she 's had it to hap round her of a night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 6]: `` Is n't that sweet !
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 23]: Hustle up now with my high shoes , and do n't mind buttoning in bits of flesh as you did last time .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 9]: I 'd just as lief be left out .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 18]: See here , Mury , I want everything put back in its place after I 'm gone !
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 39]: I hate to find a muss when I get back , and that blue muslin has got to be pressed out for to-night , and those bits of lace washed , and the parcels changed at the shop .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 16]: Mind , it 's got to be all done by the time I am back .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 25]: And see here , next time you go out to meet your friend , there 's that taffetas waist you can have for yourself !
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 14]: You 'll look dandy in it , and he 'll be so proud .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 11]: Maybe it will help the indigestion better than physic . ''
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 42]: Mary was incoherent with delight , and promised ardently to execute all the young lady 's orders , knowing full well that it was the silver afternoon , and that her time should of rights be fully occupied with household duties .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 9]: She promised , and she intended to perform .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 48]: By dint of smiles , pleasant words , kindly interests in `` friends , '' and ceaseless doles of finery and physic , Cornelia had established such a hold upon the affections of the staff , that her wish already took precedent of her aunt 's law .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 25]: Mary mentally condemned half the contents of the silver cupboard to neglect , the while she ironed out foaming frills and floating sash ends .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 34]: Mrs Ramsden accompanied Elma to the gate of The Nook , and stood beside Miss Briskett looking on with dubious eyes , while the two girls took their places in the high dog-cart .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 34]: A groom had driven the horse from the livery stable , and both good ladies expected him to take possession of the back seat , in the double capacity of chaperon and guide .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 40]: It came , therefore , as a shock , when Cornelia dismissed the man with a smile , and a rain of silver dropped into an eager hand , but protestations , feeble and stern , were alike disregarded .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 29]: `` How do you suppose we are going to talk , with him perched there , with his ears sticking out , listening to every word we say ?
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 13]: We do n't want any men poking round , this journey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 18]: laughed Cornelia , settling herself in her seat , and taking the reins in her gauntleted hands .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 36]: Miss Briskett was dismayed to feel a thrill of pride mingling with her displeasure , for the girl looked so fresh , so trim , so sparklingly alive perched up on her high driving seat .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 16]: Elma Ramsden , for all her superior beauty , looked tame and insignificant beside her .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 39]: Although she would not condescend to look around , Miss Briskett divined that behind the curtains of the neighbouring houses the occupants were looking on with admiring curiosity , and noting every detail of the girl 's attire .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 20]: If Cornelia were self-willed and defiant , in appearance at least she was a worthy representative of her race .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 27]: The stern lines of the spinster 's mouth relaxed into an unwilling smile as she said urgently -- `` But , my dear , the horse !
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 7]: I am responsible for your safety .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 13]: Are you quite sure that you are capable of managing him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 9]: Cornelia 's ripple of amusement was sufficiently expressive .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 24]: `` One old mare in a hired trap , when I 've driven a four-in-hand over some of the wickedest roads in America !
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 21]: If we are smashed , Aunt Soph , you can lay it to providence , and not to my driving .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 10]: Do n't get to worrying if we are late .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 13]: If we 're killed you 'll hear all about it soon enough .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 21]: You can only die once , and a carriage spill is a good slick way of getting it over . ''
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 46]: `` Cornelia , I insist -- '' `` Miss Cornelia , I beg -- '' The cart dashed suddenly onward in response to a flip of the whip , leaving the two old ladies upon the roadway , the unfinished appeal frozen upon their lips .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 25]: Elma turned round to wave an abashed adieu , the long habit of servitude struggling with a delicious new sense of liberty and adventure .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 16]: `` Oh -- oh , Cornelia , if you could only _ see _ them !
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 9]: They are standing stock-still , staring after us .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 4]: They look petrified !
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 9]: ... It _ was _ naughty of you .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 8]: You frightened your aunt on purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 6]: `` That 's so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 5]: assented Cornelia , frankly .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 7]: `` I meant to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 64]: It 's going to hurt me a lot more than it does her , as the mommar said when she spanked the nipper , but she 's got just as set as a fossil , paddling along in this little backwater , and imagining it 's the whole big ocean , and there 's no one on hand to rouse her but myself .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 5]: It 's my mission .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 6]: Wake up , England ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 18]: and she flourished her whip dramatically as the mare trotted through the south gateway of the park .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 40]: Outside the gate lay a smooth wide road stretching uphill , and in response to a movement of Elma 's outstretched hand , Cornelia turned the mare in this direction , flashing a radiant smile into the pink-and-white face .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 5]: `` Well what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 7]: `` How do you feel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 3]: `` Excited !
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 10]: -- As if something were going to happen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 4]: Cornelia nodded sagely .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 10]: `` Perhaps it is ; there 's no saying .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 22]: I 've seen horses I 'd sooner trust in a scrimmage , but a little spill would do you no harm .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 7]: You 're skeery as a cat .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 10]: You want nerve , my dear , nerve ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 32]: Cornelia flicked her whip round the horse 's ears to give emphasis to her words , and chuckled with mischievous amusement as Elma clutched the seat , and gasped in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 9]: `` I call this crawling , not driving .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 42]: When we get out into the real country I 'll make her go , so we get some fresh air into our lungs , then you can hold on if you like , but do n't pay before the show begins .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 10]: Now , then -- where are we bound ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 12]: Elma cast down her eyes , faintly blushing beneath her hat .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 40]: Surely there was something infectiously electric in the air this afternoon , or why should her thoughts fly as an arrow from the bow to just that very spot which it should have been her maidenly duty to avoid ?
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 53]: She blushed at her own audacity ; telling herself sternly that she ought to be ashamed ; held the temptation afar off , looking at it , longing after it , regretfully deciding to cast it aside , then with a sudden impetuous change of front , hugged it to her breast .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 5]: Yes , she would !
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 24]: For one afternoon , one golden , glorious afternoon , she would send prudence to the winds , and follow her own instincts .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 6]: After all , why not ?
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 32]: Because a certain person happened to be squire of a certain district it did not follow that other people could not drive over his land without being suspected of personal designs .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 53]: It was to the last degree unlikely that one would happen to meet anyone one knew , but if one _ did _ -- Elma acknowledged to herself that a lift of the hat , a glance of pleased recognition , would remain in memory as the pleasantest episode of the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 33]: As a palliative to her conscience , Elma suggested a farther village as the termination to the drive , directing the course with a thrill of guilty triumph at each fresh turning .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 7]: `` Ai n't this dandy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 19]: cried Cornelia , preening her little head , and showing her white teeth in a smile of delight .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 22]: `` This England of yours is just a ` cute little garden , with the roads rolled out like gravel paths .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 11]: You 'd stare to see the roads about my home .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 9]: Over here it 's all grass and roses .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 21]: You are a rose , too -- a real , sweet garden rose , with the dewdrops on its leaves .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 42]: If I were an artist I 'd paint a picture of you on one panel , and Aunt Soph on the other , as two types of English life , and the people could look on , and learn a lesson .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 36]: It 's kinder sweet and touching to dream along so long as you 're young , but if you go on keeping your eyes shut , it do n't pan out well in old age .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 26]: It 's best to have 'em wide open , and realise that there are two or three more people in the world beside yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 8]: Elma smiled in vague , preoccupied fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 32]: Her own thoughts were all engrossing , and at every fresh winding of the road she held her breath in suspense , while the wild rose colour deepened in her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 7]: Suppose -- suppose they met him !
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 5]: How would he look ?
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 5]: What would he do ?
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 5]: What would he think ?
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 14]: Even the compliment to herself faded into insignificance beside such questions as these .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 72]: The mare was trotting briskly along a high level road , on the right side of which lay the boundary wall of a large estate -- _ the _ estate , every inch of which was thrilling with interest to one onlooker , at least ; to the right a bank of grass sloped gradually to a lower road , beneath which again could be seen a wide-stretched panorama of country .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 16]: Cornelia slackened the reins , and gave herself up to the enjoyment of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 33]: Up to now decorous toddles to and fro the outlying villas had been her only form of exercise , and she was amazed and delighted with the verdant beauty of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 57]: As Elma did not seem inclined for conversation she made no further remark , and for the next quarter of an hour the two girls drove onward in silence , each happy in her own thoughts , in the sunshine , in the sweet , balmy air , fragrant with the scent of the flowering trees .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 36]: Then of a sudden one of the lodges of the park came into view , and on the roadside beside the door a dazzling golden object , at sight of which Cornelia puckered puzzled brows .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 10]: `` What in the land 's name is that ?
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 11]: The sun dazzles so that I ca n't see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 11]: `` It 's a -- a cage , I think !
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 7]: I see something like bars . ''
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 23]: `` What fool-trick are they up to , then , putting a gilt cage on the high road in the blazing sunshine ?
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 10]: They might use the sense they were born with .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 8]: Steady , old lady , steady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 23]: cried Cornelia , soothingly , as the mare pricked up her ears and shied uneasily to the farther side of the road .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 16]: `` Yes , it 's a cage right enough , and a poll parrot inside .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 39]: Guess I 'll pull up at that house , and tell the inmates that it looks for all the world like a blazing firework on the side of the path ; enough to scare any horse in creation .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 11]: This old lady is as nervous as a cat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 40]: The fact was painfully apparent even to Elma 's inexperience , for the mare , refusing to be soothed by Cornelia 's cajoling words and chuckles , shied still nearer the opposite hedge , her ears cocked nervously erect .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 78]: Seen nearer at hand , and out of the direct dazzle of sunlight , the cage looked innocent enough with its grey inmate swinging solemnly to and fro on its perch , but as the cart swung rapidly past , Mistress Poll evidently felt that it was time to assert herself , and opened her mouth to emit a shrill , raucous cry , at the sound of which the mare bounded forward in a headlong gallop .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 6]: `` I knew it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 5]: cried Cornelia , shortly .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 11]: `` I just guessed that had to come next . ''
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 37]: She sat bolt upright , twisting the reins round her fingers , her lips pressed into a thin red line , her eyes ashine with an excitement in which was more than a spice of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 11]: She shook herself impatiently free from Elma 's frenzied grasp .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 9]: `` Now , then , none of that !
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 6]: You leave my arms alone .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 14]: I 'll need all my strength before we 're through with this trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 11]: My stars and stripes , how she does pull . ''
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 7]: `` Oh , oh , Cornelia !
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 5]: What shall we do ?
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 5]: What shall we do ?
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 5]: Shall we be thrown ?
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 6]: What 's going to happen ?
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 5]: _ Cornelia _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 19]: Not by a fraction of an inch did Cornelia turn her head in answer to this frenzied appeal .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 18]: Upright as a dart she sat in her seat , her slender wrists straining at the reins .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 6]: `` Do n't yelp ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 4]: she said shortly .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 8]: `` Keep that till you 're hurt .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 2]: Say !
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 11]: what happens to the road after the next turn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 8]: ... Oh , what shall we do ?
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 6]: Why did we ever come ?
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 10]: ... Cornelia , can you hold her back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 5]: ... `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 5]: snapped Cornelia , shortly .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 5]: `` I ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 11]: -- Not for many minutes longer , at this rate .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 9]: My wrists are about broken as it is .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 9]: What happens after this turning , I say ?
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 4]: You must know .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 19]: Use your brains , for goodness ' sake -- if you want any left to use another day .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 10]: Is it a good road -- better than this ?
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 12]: What 's on the sides -- hedgerows , walls , water ?
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 13]: For the land 's sake , child , sort your ideas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 13]: Thus admonished , Elma made a violent effort to pull herself together .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 36]: For reasons already mentioned , this particular bit of country was clearly imprinted on her memory , and she had but to collect her scattered wits to see a clear picture of the path ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 7]: `` The road is quite good .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 8]: There is a wall -- two walls .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 7]: Some farm buildings on the right .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 17]: At the end there is a hill ; it leads down into the next village . ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 17]: Cornelia 's nostrils dilated widely , and two spots of pink showed on her white cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 12]: `` Then I guess this is the end of the volume .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 14]: A grass bank is better than a wall any day of the week .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 24]: ... Now then , young woman , if you 've got any grit stowed away , get it out , and use it .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 6]: _ It 's coming _ !
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 5]: Are you ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 5]: shrieked Elma , wildly .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 23]: She clutched the seat with despairing hands , as with a sudden convulsive movement Cornelia switched the mare violently to the right .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 5]: `` Help , help !
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 49]: Oh , help -- '' The bank rose before her eyes in a sudden mountainous sweep ; the mare , instead of being in front , soared suddenly on the top of the trap ; the hinges creaked and strained ; and the seat assumed a perpendicular position .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 19]: It was all over in a couple of minutes , but to Elma it seemed as many hours .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 66]: She had time to hear the rush of approaching footsteps , to see over the top of the hedge three startled masculine faces ; to recognise the nearer of the three with a great throb of relief , and to stretch out her arms towards him with a shrill cry of appeal -- then the crash came , and she was shot headlong into space .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 2]: Fireworks !
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 6]: that was the first impression .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 22]: Little dots of flame flitting about before her eyes , forming into circles of light and whizzing rapidly round and round .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 22]: Then when her eyes were open , a heavy confused stupor , in which she saw , but refused to understand .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 14]: Why was she lying on the grass in the middle of the day ?
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 21]: Why did Cornelia look so queer , with her face stained with soil , and her hat on one side ?
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 9]: Why did they offer her things to drink ?
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 15]: She was n't thirsty ; the tea was bad ; it stung her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 13]: It was n't tea at all , but something hot and nasty .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 8]: It was brandy out of a flask !
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 34]: Elma lifted big , lovely eyes of a pansy blue , and stared vacantly into the face by her side , but at the sight of it memory came back in a rush .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 28]: She sat up stiffly , moving her limbs in nervous , tentative fashion -- gasped , sighed , and quavered out a tremulous -- `` What happened ?
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 5]: Is it all over ?
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 5]: Are we saved ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 15]: Cornelia loomed above her , alert even in this moment of shock and dishevelment .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 35]: One cheek was plastered with soil ; patches of green stain discoloured her coat , her hair hung rakishly askew , yet never had her manner been more composed nor complacently matter of fact .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 9]: `` We 've had a pretty lucky let-off .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 20]: You are alive all right , and I guess there 's not much the matter with you but nerves .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 10]: There 's nothing wrong with your lungs , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 25]: You scared the mare pretty near as much as the bird -- yelping like a crazed thing , and hanging on to my arm .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 6]: The grass is soft enough .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 7]: It has n't hurt you any .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 15]: You need n't worry feeling all over to see if there 's a break .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 11]: You 'd know it fast enough if there were . ''
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 7]: `` Miss Ramsden is feeling stunned .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 13]: I think it would be wiser to allow her to recover gradually .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 26]: It is a shock to -- er -- to most systems , to be shot out of a cart , however short the distance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 29]: The masculine voice was thunderous with indignation , and the arm which supported Elma 's back tightened its hold , as if to protect her against the world .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 47]: Cornelia turned aside , her red lips twisted into a smile , and walked along the bank to where the other two men were unharnessing the mare , which lay on her side trembling with fright , the blood oozing from several ugly-looking cuts and scratches .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 52]: As Cornelia walked she held her right wrist tightly with her left hand , as if she still felt the strain of that wrestle with the reins , but there was no flinching in voice or manner as she stood over the men , issuing instructions in brisk , incisive tones .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 34]: The nearer of the two was impressed to the extent of ceasing work to touch his cap ; the second darted one contemptuous glance in her direction , and placidly continued to disobey .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 36]: Cornelia promptly knelt on the grass by his side , with intent to demonstrate her own greater efficiency , but the first movement of the strained wrist brought a flush of pain to her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 25]: She sat back , pursing her lips together to restrain an involuntary groan , while the stranger flashed a second look in her direction .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 35]: He was a tall , lean , somewhat cadaverous -- looking man , with steel-like eyes shaded by haughty eyelids , perpetually adroop as though no object on earth were worthy of his regard .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 22]: Cornelia took him in in a swift , comprehensive glance , and with youthful ardour decided that she loathed the creature .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 5]: `` Hurt yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 7]: `` Not a bit , thanks .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 43]: I guess there 's enough of you to do the work without me , but I 'm used to seeing things done in a hurry , and you seemed pretty deliberate -- '' `` A little caution is not thrown away sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 17]: What induced you to come out driving alone if you could not manage a horse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 40]: There being no reply to this question , and the last buckle of the harness being unstrapped , the speaker turned an inquiring glance over his shoulder , to behold a rigid figure and a face ablaze with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 45]: There was something in the girl 's face at that moment so vital , so bizarre and arresting , that so long as Rupert Guest lived , it remained with him as one of the most striking pictures in his mental picture - gallery .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 56]: He had but to pass a high green hedge in the June sunshine , to catch the fragrance of the honeysuckle and roses , and it rose up before him again -- the white , furious face , with the red , roughened locks , and the gleam of white teeth through the scarlet lips .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 37]: There was no admiration in his thoughts ; this was not at all the type of girl whom he admired , but she was a being by herself , different from anyone whom he had met .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 8]: He stared at her with curious attention .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 38]: `` Do you mean , '' said Cornelia , in the slow , even tones of intense anger , `` that you think this was my doing -- that I upset the cart by my bad driving ?
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 14]: If that 's so , you are a little out in your reckoning .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 22]: If I had n't been used to horses all my days we might have been in kingdom come by this time .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 14]: I _ pulled _ her into the bank before worse things happened ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 12]: `` Then what sent her off in the first instance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 31]: `` A poll parrot , screeching in its cage , set right out in the roadway by some fool owner , who ought to be had up for murder . ''
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 53]: The stranger pursed up his lips in an expressive whistle , then suddenly sprang upwards as the mare , freed from her harness , rolled on her side and struggled to her feet , where she stood shivering and tossing her head , displaying fresh cuts and bruises in her dusty coat .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 26]: The labourer put his hand on her neck , soothing her with gentle words and touches , while his master surveyed her with kindly concern .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 4]: `` Poor brute !
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 16]: Better take her to the stables , James , and send off for a vet .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 15]: Mrs Greville can no doubt spare a carriage to take these ladies home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 19]: He turned towards Cornelia with an impulse of provocation which seemed to spring from some source outside himself .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 26]: As a rule he was chivalrous where women were concerned , but there was something in the personality of this girl which aroused his antagonism .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 36]: It seemed almost a personal offence that she should be so alert and composed while the mare bled and trembled , and that pale , lovely thing lay like a broken snowdrop on the bank .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 20]: He felt a growing desire to annoy , to wound , to break down this armour of complacent vanity .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 13]: `` So you could not hold her till she tired herself out ?
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 17]: the experiment seems to have answered less successfully from her point of view than your own .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 19]: She 'll need a considerable time to recover her nerves and give these scratches time to heal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 5]: `` Skin deep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 10]: sneered Cornelia , with a curl of the lip .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 28]: `` I 'll drive her back in a day or two ; and up and down this road until she learns not to play that trick again .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 23]: I 've never given in to a horse yet , and I 'm not going to begin with a hack mare ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 8]: The stranger eyed her with cold disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 15]: `` Perhaps her owner may refuse to allow her to be experimented upon again .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 7]: I should , in his place !
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 26]: It may be foolish , but I hate to see a brute suffer , even for the noble purpose of proving my own superiority . ''
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 19]: He swung away as he spoke , thus failing to see the stunned blankness of Cornelia 's expression .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 30]: Straight as a dart she stood , with head thrown back , scarlet lips pressed tightly together , and dark brows knitted above the wounded tragedy of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 15]: The labourer standing by the mare 's side looked towards her with honest sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 24]: He had had personal experience of the `` length of the Captain 's tongue , '' and was correspondingly sympathetic towards another sufferer .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 29]: A tender of dumb animals , he was quick to understand the expression on the girl 's face , and to know that she had been wrongfully accused .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 10]: `` Do n't you take on , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 20]: he said , touching his cap with the unashamed servility at which the American girl never ceased to wonder .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 28]: `` I 'll look after her meself , and if the dirt is washed out of the sores at once , she 'll come to no harm .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 18]: Likely as not there 'll be nothing for the vet to do by the time he arrives .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 11]: At the worst it 'll be only a few stitches .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 8]: She 'll soon get over that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 11]: Cornelia shivered , and bit hard on her lower lip .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 29]: She slipped her hand into an inside pocket of the white coat , and , coming a step nearer , dropped a coin into the man 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 14]: He cast down his eyes , started , and flushed a deep red .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 6]: `` Thank you , miss .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 11]: Beg pardon , but you 've made a mistake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 43]: A sovereign lay brightly on his grimy palm ; he stared at it with respectful awe , scarcely regretful , since it did not enter his mind to conceive that such a munificent gift could seriously have been offered for his acceptance .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 48]: It had seldom happened that he had had the handling of such a fortune , since his whole weekly earnings reached a total of eighteen shillings , but Cornelia in her turn looked abashed and discomfited , thrusting her hand once again into the tightly-buttoned little pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 5]: `` I 'm sorry !
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 11]: I ke n't get used to your money over here .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 7]: Will that make it enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 19]: To the man 's utter stupefaction she placed a second sovereign beside the first in his outstretched palm .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 30]: He stared at it with distended eyes , thrilled by the discovery that she _ had _ meant it after all , awed by the revelation of such munificence .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 26]: `` Beg pardon , miss , I was thinking as you 'd mistook it for a shilling , not making so bold as to complain .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 6]: I thank your ladyship kindly !
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 50]: I 'm sure I ca n't rightly say what I ought -- '' He stuttered , incoherent with excitement , but even as he spoke he held out the second sovereign , and Cornelia understood that his good feeling permitted him to accept only what had been originally offered .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 23]: She would have felt the same in his place , and realising as much , took back the coin without a demur .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 21]: it 's waiting for you next time I come , if you 've done your duty by that mare . ''
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 24]: She turned , and walked slowly back to where the two men were standing talking together , some eight or ten yards away .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 24]: Their backs were turned towards her , and her assailant of a few minutes past was evidently answering an appeal from his friend .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 23]: She caught the last words as she drew near : `` I will go to the stable and look after the mare .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 13]: ... You can take them up to the house without my help .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 27]: I ca n't stand any more of that girl -- '' He wheeled round as he spoke , and found himself face to face with Cornelia .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 18]: They stared each other full in the eyes , like two combatants measuring strength before a battle .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 18]: To Elma it was still a dream , but a dream growing momentarily more wonderful and thrilling .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 20]: The stupor in her head was passing away , and there was nothing painful in the lassitude which remained .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 45]: She was just weak and languid , content to lie still in the sunshine , her head resting on one of the cushions from the overturned cart , her eyes turning instinctively to the bronzed face which bent over her with such tender solicitude .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 31]: As for Geoffrey Greville , he was realising with a curious mingling of dismay and elation that the moment was fated to be historic in the story of his life .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 29]: For the last two years he had been haunted by the vision of Elma Ramsden 's flower-like face at odd , but by no means inconsequent , moments .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 102]: When , for instance , his mother expatiated on the duty of marriage for a man in his position , and extolled the fascinations of certain youthful members of county society ; when he walked down the long picture-gallery , and regarded the space on the wall where his wife 's portrait might some day hang beside his own ; when he sat at the head of his table , and looked across at the opposite space ; why was it that in such moments as these the face of this one girl flashed forward , and persistently blocked the way ?
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 3]: Elma Ramsden !
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 23]: -- just a little , insignificant girl , whom he had met at half a dozen garden parties , and at homes .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 36]: She did not even belong to the county set , but was the daughter of a funny , dumpy little mother , who disapproved on principle of everything smart and up-to-date -- himself emphatically included .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 24]: The good lady evidently regarded him as a wicked , fox-like creature , whose society was fraught with danger to her tender bantling .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 17]: He had seen her clucking with agitation as he had sat with Elma beneath the trees .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 36]: Mrs Greville had a calling acquaintance with the Park ladies , and occasionally referred with a blighting toleration to `` Goody Ramsden , '' but she never by any chance mentioned Mrs Ramsden 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 13]: Geoffrey was doubtful whether she realised the fact of Elma 's existence .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 32]: Up till now he himself had drifted along in the easy-going manner of bachelors approaching their thirtieth birthday before the crucial moment arrives which acts as a spark to smouldering flames .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 44]: He had indulged in lazy day-dreams in which Elma played the part of heroine ; had thoroughly enjoyed her society when fate placed her in his way , without , however , exerting himself to take any active steps to secure additional meetings .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 33]: This afternoon as he walked across the meadow with his friend , he would have indignantly denied the accusation that he was in love , but the historic moment was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 34]: A cry for help rang in his ears ; above the hedge he caught a glimpse of a white , frenzied face , and saw two hands held out towards him in appeal .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 34]: The anguished grip of the heart with which he realised at once Elma 's identity , and her peril , was a revelation of his own feelings which could not be reasoned away .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 34]: As he knelt by her side in those first anxious moments he was perhaps almost as much stunned as herself , for in the flash of an eye his whole life had altered .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 41]: Where he had doubted , he was now convinced ; where he had frivoled , he was in deep , intense earnest ; the fact that there would be certain difficulties to overcome only seemed to strengthen the inward determination .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 19]: If Elma would accept him , she should be his wife though the whole world were against them !
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 38]: And Elma lay and looked at him with her dazed , lovely eyes , allowing him to arrange the cushions under her head with a simple acquiescence which seemed to him the sweetest thing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 30]: Now that the first dread was relieved , he felt a guilty satisfaction in the knowledge of her prostration , and of the damage done to horse and cart .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 36]: It was impossible that she could drive back to Norton without some hours ' rest , and a special providence seemed to have arranged that the accident should take place close to his own gates .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 41]: He was too much engrossed in his own interests to notice the look which was exchanged between his friend and Cornelia , and as the Captain turned , away discomfited , Geoffrey eagerly addressing his remarks to the girl herself .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 12]: `` I want to get Miss Ramsden up to the house .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 29]: She must rest and be looked after , and my mother will be delighted -- I mean , she 'd be awfully distressed if you did n't come .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 14]: It 's not far -- only a few hundred yards up the avenue .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 14]: I could carry her easily if she ca n't manage to walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 17]: But at that Elma sat up , a spot of colour shining on her white cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 11]: `` Ah , but I can ; I 'm better !
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 6]: I 'm really quite well .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 8]: But it 's giving so much trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 20]: I could wait in the lodge ... '' `` Indeed you could n't ; I would n't allow it !
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 13]: There 's no accommodation there , and the children would annoy you .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 8]: Take my arm and lean on me .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 15]: Miss -- er -- your friend will support you on the other side . ''
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 4]: `` Briskett ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 10]: volunteered Cornelia , bowing towards him in gracious acknowledgment .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 10]: `` Now then , Elma , up with you !
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 12]: Guess you 're about sick of that bank by this time .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 22]: There 's nothing to it but nerves , and that wo n't prevent you walking with a prospect of tea ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 13]: You 're not half as bad as you think you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 9]: Elma thought she was a good deal worse !
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 40]: The sudden rise to her feet , drawn by two strong hands , brought with it a return of the faintness , and for a moment it seemed as if Geoffrey would have to carry out his first proposition .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 35]: She struggled bravely , however , and Cornelia forcibly ducked her head forward -- a sensible , though on the face of it , rather a callous remedy , of which Geoffrey plainly disapproved .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 34]: He drew the little hand through his arm , pressing it close to his side , and thus linked together the three made their way to the lodge-gate and up the winding avenue .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 50]: As they went Cornelia kept casting quick , scrutinising glances at her companions , her brain busily at work trying to place this stranger , whose name had never been mentioned in her hearing , but who yet appeared to take such a deep interest in Elma 's welfare .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 26]: Once , with a sigh , the girl had regretted that her mother disapproved of `` some of the nicest people in the neighbourhood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 12]: Was Geoffrey Greville to be regarded as representing that vague quantity ?
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 26]: Again , with a second sigh , Elma had confessed that the county people on their side showed no desire to cultivate her own acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 27]: This afternoon , with a blush , she had maintained that the best road lay through Steadway , though a signpost persistently pointed in another direction .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 7]: Two sighs , and a blush !
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 42]: In the court of love such evidence is weighty , while of still greater import was the manner in which Elma clung for support to the arm on the right , leaving only the gentlest pressure on that to the left .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 21]: As for the man himself , there could be no doubt that he had reached the stage of entire subjugation .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 37]: His whole bearing was instinct with possessive pride , his strong , bronzed features softened into a beautiful tenderness as he watched the flickering colour in Elma 's cheeks , and smiled encouragement into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 31]: He had a good face ; a trifle arrogant and self-satisfied , no doubt , but these were failings which would be mitigated by the power of an honest love .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 14]: For the rest , he looked strong , and brave , and true .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 11]: Cornelia 's frown gave way to a smile of approval .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 26]: `` I guess it 's just about as ` cute a little romance as you can read for a dollar , and just as English !
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 44]: Her mommar do n't approve of him , 'cause he 's smart and worldly ; and _ his _ mommar do n't approve of _ her _ , 'cause she lives in a row , and do n't mix with the tip-top set .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 44]: She sits still and mopes , and he sets to and kills the first thing that comes handy , to distract his thoughts , and they 're going to stick right there till the door 's closed , and the lamps give out .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 12]: This is where _ you _ step in , Cornelia Briskett !
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 17]: You 've got to waltz round and fix up this business while you 've a chance .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 11]: -- I guess I 've been a bit too bracing .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 14]: I 'd better begin to feel a bit scared about Elma 's health .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 32]: ... Seems to me she 's had a pretty bad shock and wants to settle right in , and not risk another move for the next three or four days ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 16]: ... The scarlet lips twisted whimsically , and a dimple dipped in the white cheek .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 48]: If there was one thing Cornelia loved above another , it was to feel herself a kind of _ Deus ex machina _ , and she experienced a malicious satisfaction in ranging herself on the side of the lovers , in the battle between youth and age .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 36]: Presently a curve in the road brought the house into view , and the sight of its mullioned windows and old grey stone gables brought with it a sudden remembrance of her own dishevelled condition .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 33]: The disengaged hand darted up to her head to set the cap at the correct angle , and from thence continued a patting , smoothing-out excursion , productive of distinctly smartening results .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 28]: Fortunately the long coat had sheltered the dress from harm , so that on reaching the house she could shed it and look `` just so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 35]: As for Elma , it was a comfort to see her a little `` mussed , '' for in her conscientious adherence to order she sacrificed much of the picturesque nature of her beauty .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 8]: The great oak door stood hospitably open .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 43]: At the inner glass door an old butler appeared , and was immediately despatched by the Squire to find his mistress , and inform her that her son had brought home two ladies who had experienced a carriage accident at the gates .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 36]: Meantime Geoffrey led the way into the drawing-room , and while Elma rested thankfully against the cushions on her chair , Cornelia enjoyed her first view of a room in a typical English country house .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 20]: It fascinated her by its very difference from the gorgeous apartments which took its place in her own country .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 12]: Space , daintiness , simplicity -- these were the first impressions .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 30]: Long French windows standing open to a velvet stretch of lawn ; deep chairs and couches covered with chintz ; pale green walls and the fragrance of many flowers .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 21]: A closer inspection showed the intrinsic value and beauty of each detail which went to make up the charming whole .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 88]: Sheraton cabinets holding specimens of rare old china ; ivory miniatures of Grevilles , dead and gone , simpering in pink-and-white beauty in the velvet cases on the walls ; water-colours signed by world - famed artists ; wonderful old sconces holding altar-like lines of candles ; everywhere the eye turned , something beautiful , rare and interesting , and through it all an unobtrusive good taste , which placed the most precious articles in quiet corners , and filled the foreground with a bower of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 8]: `` It 's just -- gaudy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 15]: said Cornelia to herself , using her favourite superlative with sublime disregard of suitability .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 19]: She looked across the room to where Elma sat , resting her head against a brocaded blue cushion .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 34]: One of the half-dozen cases of miniatures hung just behind the chair , and it was impossible not to notice the likeness between the living face and those portrayed on the ivory backgrounds .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 32]: Actual similarity of feature might not exist , but the delicate colouring , the fine lines of the features , the loosened cloud of hair , made the resemblance striking enough .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 33]: If some day Elma 's own miniature should be added to the number , it would fully sustain the reputation for the beauty so long enjoyed by the women of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 24]: Coming back from the voyage of comparison , Cornelia 's eyes met those of the Squire fixed upon her in a questioning fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 37]: He averted them instantly , but all his determination could not restrain the mantling blush which dyed his cheek , and she had little doubt that his own thoughts had been a duplicate of her own .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 19]: Before the silence was broken , however , the door opened , and Mrs Greville entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 38]: It was Mrs Greville 's pleasure to be addressed as `` Madame '' by the members of her household , and the name had spread until it was now adopted as a sobriquet by the entire neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 46]: The tradesmen instructed their underlings to pay implicit attention to `` Madame 's '' orders ; the townsfolk discussed `` Madame 's '' clothes and manner , alternately aggrieved and elated , as she smiled upon them , or stared them haughtily in the face .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 20]: Her friends adopted it for ease , and Mrs Greville herself was well pleased that it should be so .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 43]: She would have disdained a cheap title , but it seemed fitting that she should be known by a more distinguished and exclusive designation than the vulgar `` Mrs '' , which was equally the property of the meanest of her dependants .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 19]: She was a graceful woman , with a narrow face , aquiline features , and a society smile .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 42]: She dressed perfectly , in soft satins and brocades ; not black , but of rich , subdued colours , softened by fichus of lace , while her wonderfully silky white hair was dressed in the latest and most elaborate fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 54]: To-day , her dress was of a dull heliotrope , a bunch of Parma violets was fastened in the folds of the fichu at the breast , ruffles of old point d'Alencon lace fell back from her wrists , and as she moved there came the glint of diamonds , discreetly hidden away .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 32]: Elma recalled her mother 's afternoon costume of black cashmere , with prickly jet edging on the cuffs , and felt several degrees more faint and weary from pure nervous collapse .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 6]: Cornelia beamed in artistic satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 8]: `` Mother , you know Mrs Ramsden !
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 15]: This is her daughter , and her friend , Miss -- er -- Briskett .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 13]: I happened to be behind a hedge just as their cart overturned .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 38]: It was all the fault of that lunatic , Mrs Moss -- what must she do but stick her blessed parrot cage on the side of the road , to frighten stray horses out of their wits !
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 10]: It 's a mercy they were not all killed .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 9]: Miss Ramsden has had a severe shock . ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 4]: `` Poor dear !
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 6]: How trying for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 9]: ejaculated Madame , in gushing tones of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 13]: -LRB- What she _ really _ said was `` Paw dar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 27]: as Cornelia was quick to note ; storing up the fact , to produce next time she herself was accused of murdering the English language ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 9]: `` How quite too senseless of Mrs Moss !
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 11]: She really is an impossible woman -- but so clean !
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 15]: One ca n't expect brains , can one , in persons of that class ?
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 19]: So sweet of you to come up , and let us do what we can to comfort you .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 10]: It is really our fault , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 13]: Employers ' liability , you know , and that kind of thing !
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 5]: Is the horse hurt ?
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 12]: Your hands are hot , dear , but you look white .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 7]: Now what is it to be ?
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 2]: Tea ?
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 2]: Wine ?
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 3]: Sal volatile ?
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 12]: Tell me just what you think would help you most ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 28]: She held Elma 's hand in her own , and stretched out the other towards Cornelia , thus making both girls feel the warmth of her welcome .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 17]: Elma smiled her pretty , shy smile , but left it to her friend to reply .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 15]: She was considerably astonished at the sudden development of anxiety which the answer displayed .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 20]: `` I guess , if you do n't mind , Miss Ramsden had better lie right-down for a spell .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 26]: She 's had some brandy , and a cup of tea would be pretty comforting , but it 's rest she needs most of all .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 18]: It 's a pretty hard strain sitting by , and watching someone else driving straight to glory .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 17]: When you 've got something to do , there 's not so much time to think .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 20]: The spill was bound to come , so it was up to me to choose the softest place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 14]: Mrs Greville stared , in obvious disregard of the meaning of the words .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 7]: `` Why , you are American !
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 3]: How odd !
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 20]: I 've never met an American in Norton before , in all the years I have lived here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 9]: `` I 'm not a mite surprised ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 15]: replied Cornelia , with a depth of meaning which her hearers failed to fathom .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 66]: They imagined that she was humbly appreciative of her own good fortune in visiting a neighbourhood as yet preserved from the desecration of the American tourists , whereas she was mentally reviewing the sleepy shops where the assistants took a solid five minutes to procure twopence change , the broken-down flies which crawled to and from the station ; the tortoise-like round of village life .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 40]: `` If Providence had sent over half a dozen more like me a dozen years ago , there 's no saying but they might be rubbing their knuckles into their eyes by now , and beginning to wake up !
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 23]: I 've got to butt right in , if I 'm to make any mark by the end of three months ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 23]: Such were the young woman 's mental reflections , while Geoffrey rang the bell and anticipated his mother 's order for tea .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 32]: He was anxious that Elma should lie down then and there , but she refused to do so , with a glance from the delicate cushions to her own dusty boots .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 42]: Cornelia 's openly expressed solicitude had had the not unnatural result of increasing her feeling of exhaustion , and the colour flamed and faded in her cheeks as she endeavoured to drink tea and take part in the conversation which ensued .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 40]: Mother and son watched her continuously , the one with unconcealed anxiety , the other with a wholly impersonal admiration , as though the girl were a new article of furniture , which fitted unusually well into its niche .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 13]: Her air was kindly enough , but too dispassionate to be sympathetic .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 35]: Elma Ramsden hardly counted as an independent human being in the estimation of Madame Greville , but she was a lovely piece of flesh and blood , at whom it was pleasant to look .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 12]: It would be a thousand pities if her beauty were marred .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 26]: It was more in a spirit of a connoisseur than a friend that she made the inquiry which her son was already longing to prompt .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 10]: `` My dear child , you look very ill !
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 9]: How are we going to get you home ?
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 9]: Your own cart is injured , you say .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 17]: I think you had better have the brougham , where you can rest against the cushions .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 9]: You shall have our horses , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 20]: They wo n't run away with you , though I do n't say they have never done it before !
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 28]: I like a horse with a spirit of its own , but these two have been out to-day , so they ought to be pretty quiet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 26]: At this reassuring speech Elma turned white to the lips , and for a moment swayed in her seat , as if about to faint .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 28]: Cornelia sprang to her side , while Geoffrey whispered to his mother in urgent tones , to which she listened with lifted brows , half-petulant , half-amused .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 21]: A final nod and shrug proved her consent , and she turned to Elma with a gracious air of hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 15]: Madame could never be less than gracious to a guest in her own house !
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 8]: `` My dear child , forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 9]: I did not realise how unnerved you were .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 12]: Of course , you must not dream of returning home to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 19]: Your mother and I are old friends , and she will trust me to take care of you .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 18]: Your friend will tell her that you are going to rest quietly here until you are better .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 13]: Quite a charity , I assure you , to keep me company !
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 23]: It will remind me of the days before my own Carol deserted me for that monster , and went off to India .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 14]: Only daughters should not be allowed to marry in their mother 's lifetime .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 7]: Remember that when your time comes !
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 16]: You wo n't , of course , but it 's horribly ungrateful all the same .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 5]: Now that 's settled !
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 19]: To-morrow they can send you out some things , but for to-night I can supply all you need .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 23]: A tea-gown fits anyone , and I 've a dream which has just come home , that will suit you to distraction .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 14]: Do n't worry any more , dear -- it 's all settled ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 7]: But Elma was palpitating with agitation .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 29]: That she , Elma Ramsden , should be invited to spend several days at Norton Manor seemed altogether too unlooked for and extraordinary a happening to be realised .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 21]: She was overcome with gratitude , with regret , with incredulity , for of course it was impossible to accept .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 7]: Madame could not be in earnest !
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 10]: The invitation was merely a polite form of speech !
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 46]: Even if she did mean it , her own mother would strongly disapprove , for did she not consider Madame a hopeless worldling , and her son a wolf in sheep 's clothing , a type of everything that a young man should not be ?
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 4]: Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 30]: it was quite , quite impossible , all the more so that she longed , longed intensely ; longed from the very bottom of her heart , to accept !
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 31]: Elma straightened herself in her chair , protesting , explaining , thanking , and refusing in confused broken sentences , to which none of her hearers paid the least attention .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 28]: Mrs Greville and her son waived objections aside with the easy certainty of victory , while Cornelia cried briskly -- `` You do n't hev a choice !
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 38]: I undertook to bring you out , but I wo n't take you back if I know it , until you ken sit behind a horse without going off into hysterics every time he tosses his mane .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 36]: Your mother 'd be a heap more scared to see you coming back looking like a death 's head , than to hear that you were comfortably located with a friend till you pulled round .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 31]: I guess there 's nothing for you to do but to say ` Thank you , ' as prettily as you know how , and settle down to be comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 6]: Why make a fuss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 6]: That last exhortation was decisive !
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 41]: Elma blushingly subsided into the silence which gives consent , and was forthwith escorted to the room which was to be given over to her use , there to rest quietly until it should be time to dress for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 12]: `` Unless she would like to go to bed at once .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 11]: Do you think that would be the better plan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 37]: Madame asked Cornelia in a whispered aside , but that young lady was quick to veto a retirement which would be so detrimental to the progress of the `` cure '' which she had at heart .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 7]: `` Why , no , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 28]: To be left alone to worry herself ill , brooding over the whole affair , is about the worst thing that could happen to her just now .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 21]: It was only a play-baby spill , but it seems the worst accident that the world ever knew to her .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 7]: She 's got to be roused !
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 39]: I 'll sit up here and see that she rests quietly for an hour , and then I 'll fix her up for the evening , so she can lie on a sofa and listen while you talk .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 13]: I must get home by seven o'clock to soothe the old ladies .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 15]: It would be real sweet if you 'd lend something to take me back !
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 12]: I 'm afraid I ke n't walk all the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 4]: Madame laughed pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 28]: `` I wish we could keep you , too , but it would not be kind to Mrs Ramsden to leave her with only a message to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 10]: I must hope to have the pleasure another time .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 16]: You American girls are so bright and amusing , and I love to be amused .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 43]: My son wishes me to have a companion , but a well-conducted young woman who knew her place would exasperate me to distraction , and I should kill anyone who took liberties , so the situation is a little hard to fill .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 7]: Do tell me who you are ?
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 17]: Where are you staying in Norton , and how long have you been in England ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 40]: `` Just over three weeks , and I like it pretty well , thank you , '' returned Cornelia , anticipating the inevitable question , `` though I guess I 've not struck the liveliest spot in the land .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 28]: I 'm located with my aunt , Miss Briskett , in the Park , and my poppar 's coming over to fetch me in the fall . ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 8]: Madame 's interest waned with surprising suddenness .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 36]: Of an American girl , almost more than any other , is that worldly adage true that it is wise to treat her politely , since there is no knowing whom she may ultimately marry .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 24]: A girl of such striking appearance and obvious affluence might belong to anyone , or become anything in these radical , topsy-turvy days .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 56]: The mother of a son with broad acres and small income could not but remember that a large proportion of present-day duchesses hail from across the water , but it was a very different matter when the young woman suddenly assumed the personality of the niece of a middle-class spinster resident at the Manor gates .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 21]: To Mrs Greville , Miss Briskett stood as a type of all that was narrow , conventional , and depressing .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 34]: As much as she could trouble herself to dislike any woman outside her own world , she disliked the rigid , strait-laced spinster , and was fully aware that the dislike was returned .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 37]: Miss Briskett invariably declined the yearly invitations which were doled out to her in company with the other townsfolk , satisfied that in so doing she proclaimed a dignified disapproval of the frivolities of the Manor .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 12]: `` Thank goodness , that old cat 's not coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 32]: was Madame 's invariable reception of the refusals , but at the bottom of her heart she resented the fact that so insignificant a person should dare to reject her hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 6]: `` Miss Briskett 's niece .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 2]: Really !
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 5]: How ver-ry interesting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 13]: she drawled , in a tone eloquent of the most superlative indifference .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 18]: Her easy graciousness of manner became suddenly instinct with patronage , her eyelids drooped with languid disdain .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 38]: She sauntered round the room , giving a touch here and there , turned over the garments which her maid had laid on the bed ready for Elma 's use , and finally sailed towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 17]: `` We will leave you to rest , then , as long as you think fit .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 8]: Pray ring for anything you require ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 56]: The door closed , leaving Elma to snoodle down on her pillows , with a sigh of relief , while Cornelia lifted her skirt in both hands and danced a pas seul , bowing low towards the doorway , blowing kisses from her finger-tips the while , after the manner of riders in a circus .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 12]: She pranced and pirouetted , while Elma protested in shocked surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 28]: It struck her that Cornelia 's anxiety as to her own condition had died a remarkably sudden death with the disappearance of Mrs Greville from the room .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 31]: A pantomimic display was not the best way to ensure quiet and repose , nor was there much sympathy to be read in the expression of the twinkling golden eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 14]: Elma found herself blushing before their gaze , and guiltily drooping her lashes .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 9]: `` Cornelia , what do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 18]: `` Columns , my dear , which sweet little buds like you ought to know nothing about !
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 23]: You lie still , and look pretty , and ask no questions ; that 's _ your _ part in the play !
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 21]: You 've got to remember that you 've had a shock , and your nervous system 's all to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 51]: You do n't have no pain , nor suffering , and anyone to look at you might think you were quite robust ; but just as soon as you make the least exertion , you 're all of a flop , and have to be waited on hand and foot !
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 11]: -- That 's so , is n't it now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 25]: Elma 's delicate brows were furrowed in her attempt to make out what Cornelia _ did _ mean , and what she did n't !
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 26]: There was a note in her voice which did not ring true -- a good-naturedly mocking note , which accorded ill with the words themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 14]: She blushed still deeper , and put on an air of wounded dignity .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 9]: `` I certainly am very far from well .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 8]: My head feels so light and swimming .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 13]: I should be very sorry to have to walk far at present .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 9]: Coming upstairs just now tried me horribly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 7]: Cornelia clapped her hands in approval .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 3]: `` Capital !
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 2]: capital !
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 12]: Keep it at that , and you ca n't do better .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 14]: Go slow , and do n't try to mend all of a sudden .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 35]: Even when you _ do _ begin to buck up , in a day or two 's time , the very sight of a horse will set you palpitating for all you 're worth .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 26]: You 'll kind-er feel as if you 'd rather crawl home on all fours than sit behind the steadiest old nag that was ever raised .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 32]: It 's three or four miles from home , is n't it , or maybe more -- much too far for an invalid to attempt , for a week at least .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 30]: Just a little saunter in the grounds will be all you 're fit for this side Sunday , _ with someone to support you carefully as you go _ !
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 14]: ... You 'll be apt to turn giddy if you go about alone .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 23]: ... Have you gotten that nicely off by heart now , so you wo n't go forgetting at the wrong moments ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 6]: `` Why should I forget ?
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 11]: Surely my own feelings will be my best guide ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 7]: `` Yes , ` um ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 5]: said Cornelia , demurely .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 54]: She let her lids droop over her tell-tale eyes , and stood beside the couch for a long , eloquent moment , during which the flickering colour deepened on Elma 's cheek ; then turned aside , took down a book from a shelf , and settled herself comfortably on a wicker chair .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 17]: `` I guess we understand one another , and there 's no more to be said .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 17]: Now for one hour by the clock you 've to shut your eyes and be quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 7]: Go to sleep if you can !
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 12]: I 'll wake you up in time for the prinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 13]: Elma buried her head in the cushions and shed a silent tear .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 13]: Cornelia was laughing at her , and she could not bear it .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 61]: Her mind , trained to habits of introspection , began at once to wonder if she were _ really _ pretending , as the other seemed to think ; if the agitation which she felt was not so much the result of the accident , as caused by the excitement of seeing Geoffrey Greville , and meeting his ardent glances .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 40]: The prospect of remaining in the same house and of meeting him from hour to hour was incredible but delightful , yet Elma would give it up a hundred times over , rather than accept hospitality under false pretences .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 10]: Was it her duty to insist upon returning home ?
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 28]: Should she announce that she felt so much refreshed by her rest that there was no longer any reason why she should be treated as an invalid ?
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 17]: The sinking feeling of disappointment which followed this inspiration was easily mistaken for a physical symptom .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 6]: She _ was _ ill !
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 9]: It was quite true that she felt faint .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 16]: Surreptitiously she felt her own pulse , and was convinced that its beat had increased .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 27]: She thought of the expression of Geoffrey 's eyes as he lifted her from the ground -- blushed , and felt certain that she was feverish .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 6]: Yes , she would stay !
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 9]: It would be foolish and ungrateful to refuse .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 25]: Mother had always warned her not to run risks where health was concerned ... A soft little sigh of contentment sounded through the room .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 67]: If Elma had been fifteen years younger this was the moment at which a warm , sticky little thumb would have crept into her mouth , as a sign that earthly cares were swept aside , and that she had resigned herself to slumber ; being a young woman of sweet and twenty , she snoodled her head into the pillow , and fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 29]: For over an hour she slept , and woke to find Cornelia leaning back in her chair watching her , while the book lay closed on her lap .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 31]: For a moment she hardly recognised the face which she had always seen animated , self-confident , and defiant , but which was now softened into so sweet a tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 32]: A lightning thought flashed through her mind that it was thus Cornelia would look , if ever in the time to come she watched by the bedside of her own child .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 11]: She smiled lazily , and stretched out a caressing hand .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 14]: `` Why , Cornelia , have you been sitting there all the time ?
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 5]: How dull for you !
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 8]: How long have I been asleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 33]: `` It 's half after five , so we must be lively , if I am to get back in time to settle the old ladies , and get ready for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 3]: Hustle now !
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 18]: I 'll help you to shed your own duds , and then pipe up for the transformation !
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 6]: That tea-gown 's the limit !
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 35]: I thought I knew the last thing there was to learn about clothes , but I would n't be above going in for a course of too-ition from the woman who fixed those frills !
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 14]: This is going to be an historic occasion for you , my friend .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 22]: Your sinful nature is kinder dead to the joys of frillies , but there 's going to be a big awakening !
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 20]: The woman is n't born who could come out of that gown the same as she went in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 20]: She lifted the blue serge skirt over Elma 's head , and surveyed the plain hem with tragic eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 32]: `` It 's pretty hard luck to be born a woman instead of a man , but it softens it some to have a swirl of frills round one 's ankles !
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 16]: If I 'd to poke around with a hem , I 'd give up altogether .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 17]: -- Now , then , sit still where you are , while I fix your hair !
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 23]: I 'm going to do it a way of my own , that will be more comfy for leaning up against cushions .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 18]: If you do n't like it you can say so , but I guess you will . ''
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 24]: She brushed the soft light tresses to the top of Elma 's head , and arranged them skilfully in massed-up curls and loops .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 31]: From time to time she retreated a step or two as if to study the effect , returning to heighten a curl , or loosen the sweep over the forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 37]: In reality she was reproducing , as nearly as possible , the coiffure of one of the beauties in miniature hanging on the drawing-room walls behind the couch on which Elma would probably pass the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 32]: It might chance that the eyes of mother or son would observe the likeness between the two girlish faces , a fact which could not but score in Elma 's favour !
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 38]: When the dainty white robe was fastened , and each ribbon and lace patted into its place by skilful fingers , then , and not till then , Elma was allowed to regard herself in the glass .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 21]: It was a startling revelation of her own beauty , but the predominant feeling was not elation , but distress .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 19]: Accustomed as she was to a puritan-like simplicity , Elma felt almost shocked at her own changed appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 41]: The sweeping folds of the gown gave additional height to her figure , her neck looked like a round white pillar above the square of lace ; the quaintly arranged tresses gave a touch of piquancy to her gentle features .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 12]: An involuntary and quite impersonal admiration was followed by quick repentance .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 7]: `` Cornelia , I ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 8]: I ca n't go down like this !
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 6]: I dare n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 10]: I look like an actress -- so dressed up !
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 12]: Just as if I _ wanted _ to look nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 4]: Cornelia sniffed eloquently .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 8]: `` Well -- do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 19]: `` Yes , but -- but I do n't like to _ look _ as if I did !
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 22]: Oh , Cornelia , could n't I put on my own dress again , and do my hair the old way ?
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 8]: I 'd be so much happier ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 6]: `` The Grevilles would n't !
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 27]: You 've got to remember that they are used to finery , and not to having young women sitting round in blue serge in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 23]: It seems gaudy to you , but it 's just dead , everyday-level to them , and wo n't raise a ripple .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 38]: You look a Daisy , and I 'm proud of you , and if you had a mite of feeling you 'd say ` Thank you , ' instead of finding fault after all my work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 17]: Elma wheeled round ; surprised another glance of tender admiration , and held out impulsive hands .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 7]: `` Cornelia , you are good !
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 28]: I _ do _ thank you ; I know quite well that you -- you are trying -- I _ do _ love you , Cornelia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 6]: `` Oh , shucks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 5]: cried Cornelia , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 9]: `` Do n't gush ; I hate gush !
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 9]: Take my arm , and come along downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 8]: Lean on it pretty heavily , mind .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 21]: Your spirit 's too much for your strength , and you are apt to forget that you are an invalid .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 32]: You 've got to keep a check on yourself , my dear , and remember that a nervous shock 's a ticklish thing , and needs a lot of tending ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 34]: Elma 's head drooped ; she twisted her fingers together , and glanced beneath the lashes at her friend 's face -- glanced timidly , questioningly , as it were , in dread .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 7]: Cornelia deliberately -- _ winked _ !
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 16]: Geoffrey was lounging about in the hall as the two girls descended the wide staircase .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 43]: His attitude gave the impression that he had been impatiently awaiting their advent , and , as he took in Elma 's changed looks in one comprehensive sweep , his eyes brightened with an expression before which her lids drooped in embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 38]: He came forward eagerly to lead the way into the drawing-room , where Madame sat reading by an open window , and a sofa had been pulled forward and banked with cushions in readiness for the invalid .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 45]: She smiled a welcome as the little procession entered the room , and looked on with an amused scrutiny while Cornelia shook out the cushions , skilfully altering their position so that the blue brocade should form the background for Elma 's fair head .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 19]: She did not attempt to rise , but her words were kindly enough , if a trifle patronising .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 14]: `` Well , dear , and how are you now after your rest ?
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 14]: We must take care of you , and not let you get overtired .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 5]: Sure you are comfortable ?
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 8]: You look too sweet in that gown !
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 12]: I shall never have the heart to wear it after you .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 18]: Is n't it wicked that a woman is obliged to live on after her complexion has faded ?
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 14]: I could bear any affliction better than watching myself growing uglier every day .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 12]: ... I should have a little pillow tucked into your back .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 9]: ... Sure you wo n't feel the draught ?
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 4]: That 's right !
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 10]: And you really must leave us , Miss Briskett ?
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 7]: Could n't possibly stay to dinner ?
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 9]: I suppose it _ would _ be unkind !
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 7]: The dog-cart is waiting for you .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 10]: I told them to have it round by seven .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 9]: Geoffrey will drive you home , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 17]: After your adventure this afternoon we should not be happy to leave you to a groom .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 19]: He 'll see you safely to the door , and report to us on your safe arrival . ''
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 6]: Geoffrey 's face clouded involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 42]: He had mapped out a much more interesting programme for himself , deciding to slip upstairs and dress for dinner so early that he should be able to descend the moment that his mother was securely shut into her own room .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 41]: Madame 's evening toilette was a matter of three-quarters of an hour at least , during which time he would have Elma all to himself -- to speak to , to look at , to make her look at him .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 3]: Lovely creature !
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 19]: He had not realised how beautiful she was , and so sweet , and gentle , and shy .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 21]: What a marvel to meet a _ shy _ girl in these days of loud-voiced , smoking , tailor-made women !
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 31]: A man may appreciate the society of a twentieth-century damsel whom he designates as a `` rattling good sort , '' but he wants a womanly woman for his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 27]: Elma was womanliness personified -- a sweet pink-and - white , softly-curved creature , whose eyes regarded the masculine creature with an unspoken tribute of homage .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 7]: `` You are so big ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 11]: they seemed to say ; `` I am so little !
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 9]: Oh , please be kind to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 15]: Inspired by that look , Geoffrey was capable of fighting dragons on her behalf !
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 24]: And now he was consigned to drive home a tiresome American girl , who was remarkably well able to take care of herself !
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 22]: Mentally he fumed ; outwardly , being a man of the world , he smiled , and murmured `` Delighted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 11]: with an imitation of enthusiasm which won Cornelia 's admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 8]: `` One to you , Mr Greville !
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 28]: You played up real well , '' was the mental comment , as she dropped a kiss on Elma 's brow and listened to her anxious messages .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 8]: `` Tell mother not to be anxious .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 13]: Tell her I 'm not really ill -- only silly and nervous .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 18]: Tell her I shall soon be well -- '' `` That 's all right , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 7]: I 'll cool her fevered brow .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 12]: ... Your mother 'll be a circumstance compared with Aunt Soph !
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 20]: I 'll have to promise never to look at a horse again while I 'm in this country . ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 9]: She turned towards Mrs Greville with easy self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 20]: `` It 's real good of you to send me back , and take such care of us both .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 2]: Good-afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 8]: So pleased to have met you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 13]: Madame extended her thin , ringed hand , laughing softly the while .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 21]: As she had said , she loved to be amused , and this American girl was quite too ridiculously audacious !
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 16]: Actually one might have supposed that she believed herself to be speaking to an equal !
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 41]: Cornelia and Geoffrey Greville passed along the hall , with its great oak fireplace filled in with branches of spreading beech , its decorations of tapestry , of armour , of stags ' heads , of cases of stuffed birds .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 27]: The ceiling was beamed with oak , the floor was polished to a dangerous brightness , and covered in the centre by an ancient Persian rug .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 16]: Cornelia had never seen such an interior except as it is imitated on the stage .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 51]: Her own tessellated , be-fountained entrance hall in New York was as far removed from it on the one side , as on the other was the square of oil-cloth , decorated with a hat-stand and two mahogany chairs , which at The Nook was dignified by the same title .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 8]: She admired , but admired with reservations .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 5]: `` Kinder mouldy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 6]: summoned up the ultimate verdict .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 7]: Geoffrey moved moodily towards the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 28]: Though bitterly annoyed at his mother 's interference , he was too much of a gentleman to wreak his vengeance on the innocent cause of his exile .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 46]: As a mitigation of the penance , it occurred to him that he might occupy the time of absence by talking of Elma since he might not talk to her ; but Providence was merciful , and came to his aid at the eleventh hour .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 38]: The inner door opened , and Captain Guest appeared upon the threshold , cap in hand , evidently returning from a solitary ramble , and by no means overjoyed to have arrived at such an inopportune moment .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 21]: He bowed , murmured some inarticulate greeting , and would have passed by had not Geoffrey eagerly blocked the way .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 38]: For the moment the claims of friendship were non - existent ; he did not care whether Guest were pleased or annoyed ; he was simply a means of escape , to be seized on without compunction .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 7]: `` Halloa , here you are !
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 11]: Just the man I wanted , '' he cried genially .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 12]: `` You shall have the privilege of driving Miss Briskett home .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 46]: I was going to take her myself , but I 've got some rather -- er -- pressing business to attend to before dinner '' -- he chuckled mentally over the application of the words -- `` so I 'll stand aside in your favour .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 22]: We are not going to trust her out of our sight until she is delivered safely into her aunt 's keeping .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 12]: Awfully sorry , Miss Briskett , but we shall meet again !
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 13]: You 'll come up to see Miss Ramsden , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 3]: Do come !
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 22]: Come on Saturday -- we could make up a game of tennis if she is fit enough by that time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 19]: He helped Cornelia to her seat courteously , yet with an underlying haste which could not be concealed .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 22]: Captain Guest gave him one look -- a murderous look -- and murmured , `` Delighted , I 'm shaw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 5]: in tones of ice .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 19]: Cornelia felt `` ugly , '' and looked delightful ; head erect , lips pursed , eyes a-flash .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 26]: `` Just as mad as he can be , to be obliged to be civil to ` the girl ' for a short half hour !
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 23]: Guess there 's one or two , several sizes bigger than him , who would cross the ocean to-morrow for the chance !
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 7]: He 's English -- real English !
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 26]: -- the sort that 's fixed up with liquid prejudice for blood , and eye-glasses made to see nothing on earth but the British Empire .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 23]: Rather skeery at the present moment at being set down beside a bold American hussy , with only a groom as chaperon !
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 3]: ... Well !
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 5]: I always was tender-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 16]: I 'll pile it on all I know , to fix him in his opinions .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 17]: I 'm made so 's I ke n't endoore to disappoint anyone in his expectations ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 13]: She turned deliberately to stare at the silent figure by her side .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 10]: Certainly he was a fine figure of a man !
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 35]: Her own countrymen who would have travelled so far as to take his place , would have to be giants if the `` several sizes '' bigger were to be taken in literal earnest .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 36]: The lean cheek showed the square formation of the jaw , the lips were clean shaven , the eyes dark , deep-set , thickly lashed and browed , the only handsome feature in the face .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 24]: Cornelia mentally pulled herself together , as Guest turned his head , and cast a fleeting glance at her beneath his drooping lids .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 16]: `` I was sorry to hear that your friend is too ill to be moved .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 14]: I imagined at the time that she was worse than you realised . ''
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 29]: `` She _ thinks _ she is , anyhow , and that 's about as good as the real thing -- perhaps better , where health 's concerned .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 14]: Some people do n't need much to upset 'em -- Elma 's one !
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 11]: I guess there 's never much snap to her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 6]: The dark brows arched expressively .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 3]: `` Really !
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 13]: I am afraid I hardly -- er -- understand the expression ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 6]: `` You would n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 5]: returned Cornelia , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 14]: `` It do n't seem to flourish in this part of the country .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 15]: At home we reckon no one _ is _ much use without it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 7]: `` So I have heard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 18]: Captain Guest 's understanding of the term seemed to have been more complete than he would acknowledge .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 7]: `` Our standards differ , however .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 22]: ` Snap ' may be a useful commodity in the business world , but one resents its intrusion into private life .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 20]: The very name is objectionable in connection with a girl like Miss Ramsden -- with any English girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 6]: Cornelia curled her red lips .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 12]: `` Yes , they flop ; and you like 'em floppy !
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 15]: Kind of ivy round a stalwart oak , or a sweet , wayside rose .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 5]: A m-o-oss rose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 16]: No amount of description could convey the intonation which she threw into that short word .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 29]: The `` o '' was lengthened indefinitely , giving a quaint , un-English effect to the word , which sounded at the same time incredibly full of suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 13]: Guest flushed with annoyed understanding , even before Cornelia proceeded to enlarge .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 21]: `` The m-o-oss makes a nice , soft wadding all round , to keep the little buds safe and hidden .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 13]: We use it quite a good deal at home for packing curios .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 5]: _ Dried _ moss !
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 17]: It 's apt to get a bit stale with keeping , do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 14]: `` No doubt ; but even so it retains some of its fragrance .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 39]: In its worst state I should be sorry to exchange it for '' -- it was now the Captain 's turn to throw all his power of expression into one short word -- '' _ snap _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 12]: Cornelia 's laugh held a curious mingling of irritation and pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 29]: It was poor fun having a quarrel all to herself , and it whetted her appetite to find a combatant who was capable of `` hitting back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 29]: She sat up very straight in her seat , tossing her head backward in quick , assertive little jerks , and clasping her bare hands on her lap .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 14]: Guest glanced at her curiously from his point of vantage in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 36]: She was like no other girl whom he had met , but somewhere , in pictured form , he must surely have seen such a face , for it struck some sleeping chord of memory .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 38]: A fantasy perhaps of some Norse goddess or Flame Deity ; a wild , weird head , painted in reds and whites , with wonderful shaded locks , and small white face aglow with the fire within .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 8]: His lips twisted in an involuntary smile .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 18]: Could anything be more aggressively unlike `` the sweet m-o-oss rose '' of which she had spoken ?
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 29]: `` I guess if you go to the root of things , a man 's picture of a woman is cut out to fit into his own niche !
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 38]: If he 's very big himself , there 's only a little corner left for her -- a nookey little corner where the moss can grow , but the plant do n't have much scope to spread .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 22]: If he do n't take much stock of himself , he kind-er stands back , and gives her the front place .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 11]: Then she gets her chance , and shoots ahead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 19]: Guest laughed in his turn ; an exasperating little laugh , eloquent of an immense superiority and disdain .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 15]: `` You speak in an allegory -- an allegory of English and American life .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 55]: I am quite aware that with you the sexes have reversed positions , that the man has sunk into a money-making machine , who slaves so that his wife may spend , while the woman devotes her whole life to dress and frivolity -- '' `` Have you ever been in my country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 12]: Cornelia was brought up short and sharp by an unexpected assent .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 23]: To disparage America was an unforgivable offence , and she was prepared to denounce the judgment of ignorance in words of flame .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 50]: Her anger was not abated , but merely turned in another direction , by the discovery that it was not ignorance , but blindness which she had now to denounce -- the blindness of the obtuse Englishman who had been granted a privilege which he was incapable of appreciating .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 27]: `` Some people travel about with such a heap of prejudice as baggage that they might as well stay at home and be done with it .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 35]: Englishmen pride themselves on being conservative , and if they 've once gotten an idea into their heads , it takes more 'n they 'll ever see with their eyes to get it out .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 21]: I guess you spent your time in my country seeing just exactly what you 'd calculated on from the start .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 17]: It 's big enough to rear all sorts , and enlightened enough to hold 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 18]: `` It is certainly very big , '' assented Guest , in a tone of colourless civility .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 14]: Cornelia hated him for his indifference , his patronage , his thinly-veiled antagonism .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 20]: She was accustomed to a surfeit of masculine attention , and cherished a complacent faith in her own fascinations .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 31]: It was a new and disagreeable experience to meet a man who , so far from exhibiting the well-known symptoms of subjugation , was honestly anxious to avoid her society .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 43]: To feel herself disliked ; to be a bore to two men -- the one eager to hand her over to his friend , the other furious at being so trapped -- can the world contain a deeper degradation for feminine three-and-twenty ?
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 7]: Cornelia 's mood changed before it .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 25]: The excitement which had tided her over the events of the afternoon died away , to be succeeded by a wave of sickening home-sickness .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 9]: She was lonesome -- she wanted her poppar !
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 11]: She hated this pokey place , and everyone in it .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 16]: She guessed she 'd take a cabin in the first boat and sail away home .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 15]: ... Her lips quivered , and she blinked rapidly to suppress a threatening tear .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 47]: She would rather shoot herself than cry before this patronising Englishman , but it was almost past endurance to play second fiddle all the afternoon , be snubbed on the way home , and look forward to an evening spent in propitiating two nervous old ladies !
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 12]: `` I do n't get any bou-quets in this play ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 6]: soliloquised Cornelia , sadly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 46]: ` Far 's I can see , there is n't a soul in Great Britain that cares a dump about me at the present moment , except , maybe , Aunt Soph , and she 'd like me a heap better at a distance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 36]: She sighed involuntarily , and Captain Guest , watching her from beneath his lowered lids , was visited by an uncomfortable suspicion that while criticising another , his own behaviour had not been above reproach .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 23]: Now that the girl had lost her aggressive air , and looked tired and sad , the feminine element made its appeal .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 10]: Arrogance gave place to sympathy , prejudice to self-reproach .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 17]: ... She was only a little thing after all , and as slim as a reed .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 23]: Rapidly reviewing the incidents of the afternoon , he was as much surprised as shocked at the recollection of his own discourtesy .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 34]: This stranger had overheard his frank declaration of dislike , had probably also seen the glance of reproach which he had cast upon Greville in the porch before starting out on this drive .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 31]: Twice in a few hours had he overstepped the bounds of politeness , he , who flattered himself on presenting an unimpeachable exterior , whatever might be the inward emotions !
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 17]: The explanation of the lapse was a suddenly conceived prejudice at the moment of first meeting .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 23]: The girl 's jaunty self - possession had struck a false note , and he had labelled her as callous and selfish .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 20]: Now , looking at her afresh , he realised that this was not the face of a cold-hearted woman .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 7]: This girl could _ fed _ !
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 11]: She was feeling now -- feeling something painful , depressing .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 53]: His eyes fell once more on her ungloved hands ; he noticed that she held the right wrist tightly grasped , and even as he did so memory flashed back a picture of her as she had stood above him on the bank , her hands held in the same strained position .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 21]: Afterwards he marvelled at the accuracy of that brain picture , but for the moment concern overwhelmed every other feeling .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 17]: The inquiry came in quick , almost boyish tones , strangely different from his previous utterances .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 4]: `` I say !
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 6]: have you hurt your wrist ?
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 11]: You are holding it as if it were painful . ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 25]: Cornelia turned to see a face as altered as the voice , elevated her brows in involuntary surprise , and drawled an indifferent assent .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 13]: `` I guess I ricked it , hanging on to those reins .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 10]: It was pulled half out of the sockets . ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 14]: `` Did n't you have anything done for it at the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 8]: `` Or tell anyone about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 6]: `` But why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 6]: `` I never yelp ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 5]: said Cornelia , proudly .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 14]: She tilted her chin , and her eyes sent out a golden flash .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 16]: `` There was enough of that business going on without my joining in the chorus .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 17]: If you 're hurt , it do n't mend it any to make a fuss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 6]: Guest looked at her curiously .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 7]: `` You certainly did not yelp !
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 20]: I thought you had escaped entirely , and that your friend had come in for all the knocking about .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 5]: I 'm awfully sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 5]: Sprains are beastly things .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 20]: Look here , if you do n't want to be crippled , it ought to be massaged at once !
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 6]: I 'm knowing about sprains .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 27]: Had an ankle cured in a couple of days by a Swedish fellow , which would have laid me up for weeks on the old methods .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 14]: The great point is to keep the blood from congealing in the veins .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 21]: Of course , it must be done in the right way , or it will do more harm than good .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 11]: You set to work directly _ above _ the joint .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 7]: Er -- would you allow me ?
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 11]: -- might I show you for just a moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 40]: The horse was ambling peacefully along a quiet lane , and as he spoke Captain Guest twisted the reins loosely round his own wrist and half held out his hands , then drew them back again in obvious embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 21]: The shyness was all on his own side , however , for Cornelia cried , `` Why , suttenly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 19]: in frank response , and pulled back the loose lawn sleeve to leave her wrist more fully exposed .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 25]: She watched with keen interest while he rubbed upward with gentle pressure , increased gradually as she showed no sign of pain or shrinking .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 11]: `` That 's the way -- upward , always upward .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 12]: Follow the line of the blood vessels -- you see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 33]: He traced a fine blue line with the end of a big finger , while the groom rolled curious eyes from behind , rehearsing a dramatic recital in the servants ' hall .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 24]: `` After that has been done once or twice , tackle the joint itself , and you 'll be astonished at the effect .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 13]: Is there anyone in the house who can do it for you ?
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 20]: You could do a good deal for yourself , you know , if the worst comes to the worst .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 22]: Like this -- give me the left hand , and I 'll show you how to work the joint itself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 26]: Cornelia edged round in her seat to adopt a more convenient position , and laid her hand in his with the simplicity of a child .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 31]: Such a slip of a thing it looked lying on his big brown paw , soft and white , with carefully manicured nails -- almond-shaped , transparent , faintly pink .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 18]: Guest loved a pretty hand , and held theories of its value as an exponent of character .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 34]: The future Mrs Guest might or might not be handsome , as Fate decreed , but it was inconceivable that he could ever marry a woman with red fingers , or bitten nails .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 34]: A pure artistic delight possessed him at the sight of Cornelia 's little hand , but the soft confident touch of it against his palm brought with it a thrill of something deeper .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 31]: He gave his demonstration with a touch of awkwardness , but the girl herself was as placidly self-possessed as if he had been a maiden aunt buttoning up a glove .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 30]: She put question after question , requested him to `` show her again , '' and gripped his own wrist to prove that she had mastered the desired movements .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 10]: A more business-like manner it was impossible to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 18]: Guest doubted if another girl of his acquaintance would have shown such an utter absence of self-consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 28]: It was admirable , of course , quite admirable , but -- He took up the reins with a little rankle of disappointment mingling with his approval .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 43]: Barely a mile now remained to be traversed , as the horse was trotting up the long hill into Norton ; at the top was the High Road , at the end of the High Road the gates leading into the park .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 25]: If anything remained to be said , it would be wise to say it now , but Cornelia seemed to have nothing to say .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 33]: She sat in erect , straight-backed fashion , her right hand lying on her knee , the fingers of the left rubbing softly up the arm , serenely oblivious of his presence .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 23]: Guest cleared his throat once , cleared it again , cleared it a third time , but the words would not come .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 23]: They passed through the lodge-gates and drew up before The Holt , where the groom stood ready to assist Cornelia to alight .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 23]: Before Guest could throw down the reins she had jumped to the ground , and was standing facing him on the curb .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 44]: The slanting rays of the afternoon sun fell on her as she stood , a slim white slip of a girl whom he could lift with one hand -- a spirit as of tempered steel , which might bend , but never break .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 9]: `` I thank you for your courtesy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 18]: said Cornelia , clearly , as she inclined her head towards him in formal , old-world fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 17]: Captain Guest watched her progress up the narrow path , biting hard at his lower lip .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 2]: Courtesy !
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 4]: The word stung .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 16]: The big man felt uncommonly small as he turned his horse and drove slowly home .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 20]: At the first shock of hearing of the accident , Mrs Ramsden 's motherly anxiety swamped all other feeling .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 40]: She forgot to disapprove of a woman who at sixty still wore a pad on her uncapped head , and lacy frills on her petticoat , in gratitude to the hostess who had extended hospitality to her ewe lamb .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 28]: For the moment also , Geoffrey himself ceased to be a dangerous roue , and became a gallant rescuer , miraculously appearing on the scene of danger .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 41]: She cried , and wanted to know how Elma looked ; what Elma said ; how Elma felt ; what Elma had had to eat ; if Elma 's sheets had been aired ; if Elma cried -- poor darling !
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 5]: at being left behind ?
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 40]: And Cornelia answered fully on all these points , not always , it is to be feared , with a strict regard to veracity , but with a praiseworthy desire to soothe , which was blessed with wonderful success .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 28]: Mrs Ramsden dried her eyes , and opined that life was full of blessings , and that she ought to be thankful that things were no worse !
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 33]: There was a sweet young girl whom she had once known , who had both legs amputated , and died of gangrene , a month before she was to have been married .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 32]: It was caused by a carriage accident , too , and now she came to think of it , the poor dear had just the same pink-and-white complexion as Elma herself .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 17]: `` Well , I guess there 's not much stump about Elma , this journey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 5]: returned Cornelia , cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 14]: `` There 's nothing to it but a little shock to the constitootion .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 6]: Elma 's constitootion is nervy .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 6]: What she needs is re-pose .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 3]: Perfect re-pose !
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 19]: If I were you , I 'd send up a note to-morrow , and stay quietly at home .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 19]: It would naturally upset her some to see you , and she 'd recuperate quicker by herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 13]: But at this Mrs Ramsden drew herself up with a chilly dignity .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 7]: She must certainly see her child .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 12]: It was her duty to see for herself how matters progressed .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 15]: In the matter of removal , she must be guided by what she saw .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 8]: ... `` Yes , ` um ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 5]: assented Cornelia , meekly .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 21]: She had said her say , and felt confident that Geoffrey Greville might now be trusted to play his part .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 36]: As she walked along the few yards which separated The Holt from The Nook , she congratulated herself that the worst half of her explanations were over ; but in this reckoning she was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 45]: Miss Briskett 's displeasure was unsoftened by anxiety , and was , moreover , accentuated by the remembrance that all this trouble would have been averted if Cornelia had consented to accept Mrs Nevins ' invitation to tea in a reasonable and respectful manner .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 49]: The girl had refused to make herself amiable , had insisted upon driving a strange horse over strange roads , in the face of expressed disapproval , and had contrived to come to grief outside the very house of all others which she was most desired to avoid !
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 36]: Cornelia was flighty enough already ; the only chance of keeping her in order was by introducing her to friends who , by their quiet decorum , would exercise a restraining effect on her demeanour .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 36]: Symptoms of dissatisfaction had already set in -- witness that same rejected tea -- and this afternoon 's experience had established a certain amount of intimacy , which would entail endless difficulties in the future .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 10]: Poor Miss Briskett , she was indeed sorely tried !
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 63]: With her own eyes she had beheld Cornelia driven up to the gate by a man who was even more dangerous than the young Squire himself , inasmuch as he was often a visitor in the Park for weeks at a time ; his aunt being the proud possessor of The Towers , the largest and most imposing of the crescent houses .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 33]: On the afternoon on which Cornelia 's coming had first been discussed , she herself had remarked to Mrs Ramsden that the girl must be protected from an acquaintance with Captain Guest !
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 25]: It seemed almost too exasperating to be borne that she should have effected an introduction for herself within three short weeks of her arrival !
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 23]: The spinster 's sharp nose looked sharper than ever , her thin lips thinner , her grey eyes more cold and colourless .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 25]: Cornelia looked from them to the steel trimmings on her dress -- really and truly , one looked about as human as the other !
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 31]: The `` lonesome '' feeling gripped once more , and her thoughts flew longingly to `` Poppar , '' away at the other side of two thousand miles of ocean .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 9]: `` I feel kinder _ left _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 34]: was the expressive mental comment as the maid swept away the crumbs , placed the two fruit dishes and the decanter of port before her mistress , and noiselessly retired from the room .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 34]: Miss Briskett had been clearing her throat in ominous fashion for the last ten minutes , and now that Mary 's restraining presence was removed , she wasted no further time in preliminaries .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 23]: `` I think it is time that we came to an understanding , Cornelia , '' she began , in ice-cold accents .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 25]: `` If you remain under my roof you must give me your word to indulge in no more escapades like that of this afternoon !
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 41]: I gave my consent with much reluctance ; or , perhaps , it would be more correct to say that I was not asked for my consent at all ; and now you see what the consequences have been ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 23]: `` I promise faithfully , Aunt Soph , that I 'll never have a smash again , if I can help it !
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 33]: I 'm not a bit more set on them than you are yourself , and I guess the mare was as innocent as a babe , so far 's you 're concerned .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 16]: She was n't deliberately setting out to annoy you , as you seem to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 10]: I guess she needs more sympathy than blame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 11]: `` Do n't fence with words , Cornelia , please .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 22]: I was not referring to the horse , and I have no intention of allowing you to run any more risks .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 14]: I distinctly forbid you to take more carriage expeditions without a competent driver .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 26]: I am responsible for your safety , and your father would blame me , if any harm happened to you while you are my guest .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 21]: I acted against my judgment in allowing you to go alone to-day , but I shall not do so again .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 6]: Do you clearly understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 9]: Cornelia 's golden eyes stared at her thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 29]: An inherent sense of justice made her conscious that her aunt had right on her side , though she might have worded her decree in more conciliatory fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 11]: The reference to her father also had a softening effect .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 18]: Poppar 'd go crazy if he heard that his daughter had been in any sort of danger !
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 9]: ... `` Well -- '' she said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 11]: `` It 's a ` got-to , ' I suppose !
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 31]: It would be playing it pretty low down , to land you with the worry of nursing me , and keeping Poppar quiet at the other end of the world .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 30]: But you would n't expect me to drive about with one of those fool-creatures from the livery stable taking care of me , as if I were a kiddy ?
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 4]: No , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 15]: I do n't see myself coming down to _ that _ level yet awhile !
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 16]: We 'd best get up some driving parties , with those men at the Manor .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 35]: They seem to have lots of horses and carts and things hanging round , and I do n't see as they could employ themselves better than in giving Elma and me a good time .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 13]: I 'll air the subject when I go up to inquire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 12]: Miss Briskett fairly leapt on her seat with horror and indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 28]: She began to speak , and spoke rapidly for the next three minutes , laying down a series of commandments to which Cornelia listened with bated breath .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 30]: Thou shalt not hold any communication with the Manor , nor with the people inhabiting the Manor ; nor with the guest sojourning beneath the roof of the Manor .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 16]: Thou shalt not associate with any men outside the circle of thy aunt 's acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 29]: Thou shalt walk abroad by thine aunt 's side , on thine own legs , and comport thyself discreetly , as behoves a young gentlewoman of good family .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 32]: Thou shalt remember that thou art a self-invited guest , and conform to the rules of the establishment , or else shalt promptly return to the place from whence thou camest .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 39]: ... In a word , Miss Briskett lost her temper , and when a woman of mature years and grey hairs loses control of herself , and lets her tongue run amuck , it is a sorry spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 19]: The flush on Cornelia 's cheeks was not for her own humiliation , but for her aunt 's .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 15]: She lowered her lids , ashamed to look into the angry , twisted face .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 18]: `` Yes , I understand , '' she replied quietly , in answer to the final question .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 10]: `` I guess I understand quite a lot . ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 8]: `` And you mean to obey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 19]: There was a moment 's hesitation , and then -- `` No , '' drawled Cornelia , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 9]: `` I ca n't say as I do !
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 18]: Those people have been polite to me , and I 'm bound to be civil in return .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 40]: I never ran after any man that I know of , and I do n't intend to begin , but when I _ do _ meet 'em , I 'm going to be as pleasant as I know how .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 15]: It 's a pity , Aunt Soph , but you do n't understand girls !
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 27]: I 've not been reared on tea-parties and cribbage , and I tell you straight that I 've just _ got _ to have a vent !
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 22]: You be wise not to try to shut me up , for I get pretty reckless if I 'm thwarted . ''
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 11]: `` Cornelia , do you dare to threaten me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 6]: `` No , Aunt Soph .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 14]: I 'm kind enough to warn you before it is too late ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 44]: Cornelia rose as she spoke , and walked upstairs to the square , prosaic room , which seemed the only bit of `` home '' she possessed in the whole big map of Europe ; sat herself down , and reviewed the situation .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 7]: Aunt Soph had not wanted her !
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 24]: The longing for a real heart-to-heart friendship had been on one side only ; that was the first , and most petrifying revelation .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 34]: She had travelled two thousand sea-sick miles to find herself an unwelcome guest , imprisoned within the four square walls of a nook-less Nook ; bound fast in the trammels of old-world conventions .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 15]: `` My country , 't is of thee , sw-e-et land of libertee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 9]: murmured Cornelia , mournfully , beneath her breath .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 14]: Two big tears rose in her golden eyes , and her lips quivered .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 11]: Should she pack up , and sail for home forthwith ?
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 14]: For a moment the temptation seemed irresistible , but only for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 38]: Poppar would feel badly if his two nearest relations came to an open rupture ; and besides , `` When I make up my mind to do a thing , I get there -- ev-er-y time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 6]: said the girl , staunchly .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 29]: `` I guess it 'll take more than four weeks of this country to daunt Cornelia E Briskett , if she 's got her head set to stay .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 32]: For one thing , I 've taken in hand to start Elma Ramsden on the road to liberty , and there 's going to be a fight before she 's through .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 14]: I 'll have to stand by , and be ready with the drill .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 37]: As for Aunt Soph , she 's acted pretty meanly , letting me come along when she hated to have me , but for Poppar 's sake I 'll be as meek as I know how .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 39]: I thought we were going to be friends , but she 's such a back number she do n't even remember how it felt to be a girl , and it 's not a mite of use arguing .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 10]: She thinks she knows better than I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 5]: Cornelia gurgled amused incredulity .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 40]: `` Well , it 's as easy as pie to hev a little prank on my own account , and prank I _ must _ , if I 'm to last out another three months in this secluded seminary .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 7]: My constitootion 's fed on excitement !
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 7]: I should wilt away without it .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 10]: Poppar would n't like to have me wilt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 24]: ... She sat gazing out of the window ; gazing -- gazing , while a slow smile curled the corners of her lips .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 4]: Two golden days !
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 32]: Summer sunshine , roses , lounging chairs set behind sheltering trees , grey eyes eloquent with unspoken vows ; on every side beauty , and luxury , and sweet fostering care .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 21]: Elma felt as if she had fallen asleep , and awakened in a fairyland more wonderful than her wildest dreams !
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 30]: On the morning after the accident , Mrs Ramsden had duly chartered a fly , and driven to the Manor with intent to bring her daughter home without delay .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 24]: During the night watches old dreads had revived ; she shuddered at the thought of Elma left alone -- poor , innocent darling !
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 33]: -- with that terrible young man ; pursed her lips at the recollection of Madame 's frivolities , and decided that nothing but grimmest necessity should induce her to prolong the danger .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 55]: She entered the Manor , a Spartan matron prepared to fight to the death for the rescue of her child , but behold , instead of a battlefield , there stretched before her eye a scene of pastoral simplicity , in which the most Puritan of critics could not have discovered an objectionable detail .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 44]: A wide , velvet lawn , shaded by a belt of grand old beeches ; a deck chair placed in the most sheltered nook , on which Elma reclined against a bank of cushions , while beside her -- marvellous and confounding sight !
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 22]: -- sat Madame herself , turning the heel of a common domestic stocking , a mushroom hat hiding the objectionable pompadour .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 28]: So far as the eye could reach there was not a man in sight , not so much as a whiff of tobacco smoke in the air !
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 44]: As the round black figure waddled across the lawn , Madame rose in gracious welcome , while Elma -- Elma 's heart began to beat with sickening rapidity , a mist swam before her eyes , and a lump swelled in her throat .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 15]: She could not speak ; her cheeks turned first red , and then white .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 18]: She shook her head in response to her mother 's greeting , and gasped as for breath .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 37]: The good lady was distracted at beholding such symptoms of collapse in her quiet , well-disciplined daughter , and Madame reproached herself in the conviction that the child was really much worse than she had imagined .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 24]: As a matter of fact , the disease from which Elma was suffering was nothing more nor less than pure , unadulterated fright !
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 44]: Fright lest her mother should insist upon taking her home ; lest she should be compelled to leave the Manor before Geoffrey returned from an excursion carefully timed to end just as his mother drove out to keep an appointment in the town !
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 7]: She was literally paralysed with fear .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 16]: It seemed as if life itself hung on the issue of the next few moments .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 19]: She shut her eyes and listened , with palpitating breath , to the conversation between the two ladies .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 6]: `` Do n't be alarmed !
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 10]: It is just seeing you that has upset her .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 9]: A few minutes ago she was quite gay .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 7]: Were n't you gay , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 10]: We have had such a happy little morning together .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 12]: So long as she is absolutely quiet she seems quite well .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 17]: But as you see , any excitement -- '' Madame gesticulated eloquently behind Elma 's back .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 11]: `` Excitement prostrates you , does n't it , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 14]: We must keep you quite a prisoner for the next few days ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 22]: Mrs Ramsden sat down heavily on a wicker chair , folded her hands on her sloping lap , and sighed resignedly .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 16]: Hardly a moment had elapsed since her arrival , but already her cause was lost .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 36]: To subject Elma to the fatigue of returning home would be madness , when even an ordinary meeting had so disastrous effect ; to refuse hospitality so charmingly offered would be ungracious in the extreme .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 44]: There was nothing for it but to submit with a good grace , and submit she did , arranging to send up a box of clothing later in the afternoon , and promising to drive up again in a few days ' time .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 6]: `` A few days ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 38]: She wanted to come every single morning , but Madame sweetly ignored her hints , and Elma , brightening into something wonderfully like her old self , declared that there was not the slightest cause for anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 13]: `` I shall be _ quite _ well , mother dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 26]: she murmured affectionately as the poor lady stooped to kiss her before hurrying away , carefully mindful of the fare of the waiting fly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 10]: _ Quite _ well , and -- happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 17]: The pink flamed again at that last word , and Madame stroked the soft cheek caressingly .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 7]: `` That child is a picture !
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 20]: I love to look at her , '' she said gushingly , as the two ladies recrossed the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 15]: `` How cruel of you to have kept her to yourself all this time .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 17]: Really , do you know , I hardly realised that you _ had _ a daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 13]: But we are going to alter all that , are n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 11]: So sweet of you to trust her to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 19]: Madame 's conversation was a mixture of questions and exclamations , but she rarely paused for a reply .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 20]: She prattled unceasingly as she saw her guest into her fly , and watched her drive down the avenue .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 12]: Poor old Goody Ramsden ; she was a worthy old dear !
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 18]: Wrapped up in that child ; terrified to move her , yet terrified to leave her behind !
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 12]: Madame smiled in amused understanding of the good lady 's scruples .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 14]: What duckings and cacklings would go on in the parlours of the Park !
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 19]: What fears and forebodings would be experienced for the safety of the dove in the eagle 's nest !
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 32]: Out of a pure spirit of bravado she was inclined to keep the child as long as possible ; and the fact of Geoffrey 's obvious admiration only strengthened her determination .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 15]: It was dull for a young man with only his mother in the house .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 9]: Let him amuse himself with this pretty girl .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 20]: A few days flirtation would put him in good humour , and there was no danger of anything serious .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 7]: Geoffrey never _ was _ serious .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 19]: His flirtations could be counted by the score , but they held no connection with his future marriage .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 33]: That must be a serious business arrangement , involving a name , a fortune , possibly a title ; many tangible qualities would be demanded from the future mistress of the Manor .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 23]: Madame went through life regarding every person and thing from her own personal standpoint ; apart from herself they ceased to interest .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 35]: She would be affectionate and gushing to Elma Ramsden so long as the girl remained a guest under her roof ; when she returned to The Holt she would promptly fade out of recollection .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 28]: That a broken heart might be among the impedimenta which she would carry away with her , was a possibility which never once entered into the calculation .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 5]: A typical Society woman !
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 13]: Verily , Goody Ramsden 's fears were not built without a foundation !
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 25]: An hour later Madame was driving out of her own gates , while Geoffrey was installed on her seat by the invalid 's couch .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 32]: A whole hour and a half still remained before the gong would sound the summons to luncheon ; an hour and a half of solitude beneath the shadow of the trees !
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 47]: Last night there had been another _ tete-a-tete _ while Madame and Captain Guest played piquet at the end of the room ; this morning there had been yet another , when Elma was first installed in the garden , and Madame was interviewing her staff .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 12]: Astonishing how intimate two people can become in two long conversations !
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 10]: Marvellous in what unison two separate minds may move !
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 36]: Geoffrey and Elma seemed constantly to be discovering fresh subjects on which they thought alike , longed alike , hoped , grieved , joyed , failed and fought , in precisely the same interesting fashion !
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 11]: Each discovery was a fresh joy , a fresh surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 6]: `` Do you really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 8]: `` Why , so do I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 7]: `` How strange it seems ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 12]: In the garden of Eden these surprises grow on every bush !
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 17]: Elma 's heart was hopelessly out of keeping , but conscience still fought feebly against temptation .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 47]: She had been trained to consider no man worthy of her regard who did not attend Saint Nathaniel 's Parish Church , eschew amusements , wear a blue ribbon in his coat , belong to the Anti- Tobacco League , and vote with the Conservative Party !
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 46]: In the watches of the night she had decided that it was her duty to use her influence to lead this dear worldling into better ways , and , to his credit be it said , the dear worldling appeared most eager to be reformed .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 48]: He besought Miss Ramsden to `` pitch into him '' ; declared that he knew , do n't you know , that he was an `` awful rotter '' ; but represented himself as waiting eagerly to be guided in the way in which he should go .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 6]: How was he to begin ?
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 6]: Elma puckered her delicate eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 45]: She was wearing no hat , as it was more comfortable to recline against the cushions with uncovered head , but a fluffy white parasol belonging to her hostess was placed by her side , in case an obtrusive sunbeam penetrated the branches overhead .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 13]: `` I never know where the sun is going to move next .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 8]: Men always do , do n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 10]: I think it is so clever of them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 14]: Madame had declared in her charming , inconsequent fashion as she fluttered away .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 24]: Elma did not need the parasol as a shade , but it came in very usefully as a plaything in moments of embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 33]: There was one all-important subject weighing on her mind ; she made a desperate plunge , and put it into words -- `` You -- you do n't go to church ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 8]: `` Not very often , I admit .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 12]: I 'm afraid it is not much in my line . ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 10]: `` Do n't you -- believe in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 8]: The vague question was yet sufficiently explicit .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 19]: The Squire leant forward , his hands clasped between his knees , his forehead knitted into thoughtful lines .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 5]: `` Er -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 11]: As a matter of fact , I _ do _ !
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 4]: Did n't once !
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 19]: At college , you know ; got into a free-thinking set , and chucked the whole thing aside .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 9]: But I 've been about a good bit .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 16]: I 've seen countries where they go on that tack and it does n't pay .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 7]: The old way is the best .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 9]: I know I 'm a bit careless still .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 15]: Men are , Miss Ramsden , when they have only themselves to think of .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 29]: They get into the way of leaving that sort of thing to their mothers and sisters , but when a fellow starts for himself , it 's different !
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 20]: I 'm the master here , in name , but virtually it 's my mother who runs the house .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 23]: I do n't interfere with her ways , but when I -- er -- _ marry _ , it will be different !
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 7]: Then I shall make a stand .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 14]: Family prayers , and that sort of thing , do n't you know .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 8]: A man ought to set an example .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 10]: You are quite right ; you are always right !
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 27]: Bit shy at first , you know , and that sort of thing , but I 'd do it ; I promise you , I would !
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 9]: Turn up at church regularly every Sunday ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 13]: `` It would be your duty , '' said Elma , primly .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 36]: She twirled the handle of the sunshade round and round , and strove womanfully to keep her thoughts fixed on the subject on hand , and away from that thrilling `` when I marry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 18]: `` But it is n't only _ form _ , you know , '' she added anxiously !
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 18]: `` It 's caring for it most of all , and putting it before everything else ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 10]: Geoffrey gazed at her in a rapture of admiration .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 10]: He loved her simplicity ; he adored her earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 20]: In his eyes she was a shining white angel sent down from heaven to be his guide through life .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 32]: It needed all his self-control to keep back the words which were struggling for utterance , but the fear of frightening Elma by a premature declaration gave him strength to resist .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 20]: They turned instead into a prayer , a sincere yet bargain-making prayer , like that of Jacob of old .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 7]: `` Give me this woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 28]: cried the inner voice : `` this one woman out of all the world , and I will vow in return my faith , my allegiance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 27]: The most earnest vows are often offered in the least conventional language , and Geoffrey Greville was not a man to promise without intending to perform .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 8]: There was a long , pregnant silence .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 19]: Elma felt the presence of electricity in the air , and forced herself to return to the attack .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 7]: `` And there are other things !
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 12]: ... You play bridge -- '' `` Certainly I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 5]: `` For money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 5]: `` Shilling points . ''
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 8]: `` What are ` points ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 4]: Geoffrey laughed happily .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 9]: This innocence sounded fascinating in his infatuated ears .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 23]: `` That 's a little difficult to explain , is n't it , if you do n't know anything about the game ?
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 9]: Do n't you play cards at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 10]: `` Mother wo n't have them in the house .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 11]: We have ` Quartettes , ' but they are different .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 10]: ... Can you lose much at shilling points ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 18]: `` A fair amount , if you 're unlucky , but you can win it , too !
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 12]: I generally do win , as a matter of fact ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 13]: `` What is the most you ever lost in a night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 4]: Geoffrey grimaced expressively .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 27]: `` Sixty pounds ; but I was a fool , and doubled no trumps on a risky hand , on the chance of making the rubber .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 8]: That was quite an exceptional drop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 9]: `` I should hope so , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 7]: Elma 's horror was genuinely unassumed .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 4]: `` Sixty pounds !
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 19]: Why , it 's more than many a poor family has to live on all the year round !
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 12]: Think of all the good you could do with sixty pounds !
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 13]: It seems awful to lose it on cards in one evening ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 17]: `` The next sixty pounds I win , I 'll give to a workmen 's charity !
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 8]: Will that wipe away my offence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 10]: Elma was not at all sure that it would .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 20]: Money won in unworthy fashion could never bring with it a blessing , according to Mrs Ramsden 's theories .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 11]: She shook her head sadly , and ventured another question .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 13]: `` You go to races , too , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 8]: `` Whenever I get the chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 8]: `` You _ like _ going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 4]: `` Love it !
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 5]: Why should n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 12]: Finest thing in the world to see a good hard race !
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 8]: Wish I could keep a stud myself .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 9]: I would , if I had the money .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 17]: I must tell you the truth , you see , even if you are shocked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 8]: `` Racecourses are very wicked places . ''
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 6]: `` Ever seen one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 12]: They looked at each other and simultaneously burst into a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 27]: They were young and in love ; it was delightful to brush aside problematical difficulties , and give themselves over to enjoyment of the golden present .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 19]: Elma forgot her usual somewhat prim reserve , and her laughter was like a chime of silver bells .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 11]: It is a rare thing to bear a musical laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 13]: Geoffrey longed for nothing so much as to make her laugh again .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 18]: `` I 'm a born sportsman , Miss Ramsden , and I 'll never be anything else .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 21]: I 'd like to give up everything you dislike , but it 's no use swearing against one 's convictions .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 42]: It 's not honest , and it does n't last , but I can promise you always to play straight , and to keep down the stakes so that I shall never run the risk of losing so much again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 17]: `` Why ca n't you play for nothing but just the fun of the game ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 8]: `` We call that playing for love !
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 11]: It 's rather dull -- _ in cards _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 11]: Elma twirled her parasol , and blushed to the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 47]: Mrs Ramsden sent up a box to the Manor that same afternoon , containing a dark linen dress , a blue blouse , and black skirt for evening wear ; a supply of underclothing , a grey Shetland shawl , and a flannel dressing - gown .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 23]: An hour later , conveyed by special messenger , came a second box , accompanied by a note in Cornelia 's handwriting .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 10]: Elma was resting in her bedroom when it arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 61]: She opened it , and read as follows : -- `` Dear Moss Rose , -- I guess tight gowns are a bit worrying in hot weather , so I 've gotten together a few waists and skirts that may aid your recovery , and send them along with my love , wishing you many happy returns of the day .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 15]: If it is n't the right day , it ought to be , anyway !
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 17]: I always calculated to be here for your birthday , and I 'm about tired waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 28]: If you send them back , I 'll burn them , as sure as taxes , but I reckon you 're too sweet to hurt my feelings .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 8]: Put on the one with the ruckings !
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 17]: It 's the duty of every woman to look her best in the eyes of -- .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 9]: What wonderful weather for the time of year !
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 7]: -- Your friend , Cornelia . ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 14]: _ PS _ -- There 's quite a gale blowing round this corner !
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 28]: ... '' `` It _ is _ sweet of her , but I must n't , I ca n't , I really _ could n't _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 12]: was Elma 's comment as she flushed with surprise and embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 27]: It was quite certain that she could not accept the gift , but there was no harm in just looking to see what the box contained !
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 40]: She crossed the room , cut the string , and unfolded the brown papers which covered the cardboard box ; lifted fold after fold of tissue papers , and gasped in admiration of each treasure as it was revealed .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 33]: The daintiest of white lawn morning blouses , with skirt to match ; a skirt and bodice of cream net marvellously rucked with ribbons ; a blue muslin , afoam with flounces .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 33]: All were fresh from the maker 's hands , and , as Elma divined , had been selected from Cornelia 's storehouse of garments , with careful regard to her own requirements .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 25]: The `` waists '' would fit easily enough ; the skirts -- she shook out the muslin and held it against her own dress .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 16]: Just a trifle short , perhaps , but not sufficiently so to spoil the effect .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 8]: It was a _ lovely _ skirt !
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 25]: Elma edged away from the glass with a little jerk of the figure calculated to send the flounces in a swirl round her feet .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 24]: For three-and-twenty years she had gone through life wearing plain hems , and as Cornelia predicted , the flounces went to her brain .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 15]: After all , would it not be ungracious to reject so kindly a gift ?
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 27]: Her real birthday fell in the middle of July , and Cornelia , being rich and generous , would naturally offer a gift on the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 12]: To keep the blue muslin would be only anticipating the remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 23]: she _ would _ keep it , and return the other dresses , explaining that she really could not accept so much .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 17]: But on second thoughts Cornelia had specially desired her to wear the net with the ruckings .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 28]: ... Elma dropped the muslin on the bed , lifted the net blouse carefully from its wrappings , and held it before her to view the effect .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 36]: Had mortal hands fashioned it , or had it dropped down ready-made from a fairyland where good spirits gathered pieces of cloud and sea-foam , and blew them together for the benefit of happy girlhood !
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 29]: Elma looked at herself in the glass ; looked back at the blue glace silk and black surah on the bed , and thanked Heaven for Cornelia Briskett !
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 41]: Indeed and indeed she would wear the `` rucked net to-night , and look her best in the eyes of ... '' And she would send back the white lawn , and say -- _ What _ should she say ?
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 24]: Perhaps , after all , it would seem rather queer to keep the two more elaborate gowns , and send back the simplest .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 14]: It might appear as if she did not consider it worthy of acceptance .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 53]: She would keep them all ; wear them all ; enjoy them all ; and oh , dear , sweet , kind , and most understanding Cornelia , if ever , ever , the time arrived when the gift could be returned , with what a full heart should it be offered !
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 12]: Pen , ink , and paper lay ready on the writing-table .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 43]: Elma seated herself , and wrote her thanks : -- `` You dear Fairy-Godmother , -- At first I thought I could n't , but I 've tried on all three , and I simply _ ca n't _ part from them .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 18]: I do n't know what mother will say , but I 'm living just for the hour .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 30]: I 'm going to wear the net to-night , and if I look my best it will be _ your _ doing , and I 'll never forget it !
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 21]: It 's just wonderful up here , but I feel wicked , for really and truly I 'm not ill ?
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 22]: Captain Guest asked me a hundred questions about you last night , and I told him such nice things , Cornelia !
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 26]: I wonder sometimes whether you are a witch , and upset the cart on purpose , but of course there _ was _ the parrot !
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 23]: Madame is most kind , but I do n't really _ know _ her a scrap better than the moment we arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 5]: She wears lovely clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 27]: If it were not for you I should have to go downstairs to-night in an odd blouse and skirt , and feel a _ worm _ !
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 9]: I hope you 'll come up to inquire .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 3]: Come soon !
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 7]: Everyone wants to see you again .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 5]: With a hundred thanks .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 8]: -- Your loving friend , Elma . ''
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 11]: `` Why am I a ` Moss Rose ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 51]: The note was slipped into the letter-box in the hall , as Elma went down to dinner that night , lovely to behold in the `` rucked gown , '' and the perusal of it next morning was one of the pleasantest episodes which Cornelia had known since her arrival .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 46]: Truth to tell , she had felt many doubts as to the reception of her fineries , but the mental vision of Elma 's tasteless home-made garments , against the background of the beautiful old Manor , had been distressing enough to overcome her scruples .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 10]: She dimpled as she read , and laughed triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 19]: Things were going well ; excellently well , and those dresses ought to exercise a distinctly hurrying effect .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 9]: Four or five days -- maybe a week .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 4]: `` My ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 23]: soliloquised Cornelia , happily ; `` I recollect one little misery who proposed to me at the end of an afternoon picnic .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 43]: They 're slower over here , but Mr Greville was pretty well started before this spell began , and if he 's the man I take him for , he wo n't last out a whole week with Elma among the roses .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 6]: Then the fun will begin !
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 7]: Sakes alive , what a flare-up !
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 11]: And how will the ` Moss Rose ' stand pickling ?
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 10]: That 's where I come to a full stop .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 29]: I ca n't surmise one mite which way she 'll turn ; but she 's got to reckon with Cornelia E Briskett , if she caves in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 21]: Miss Briskett did not vouchsafe any inquiry as to the contents of the letter which had afforded such obvious satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 20]: She had probably recognised Elma 's writing on the envelope , but made no inquiries as to her progress .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 73]: Relationships between the aunt and niece were still a trifle strained ; that is to say , they were strained on Miss Briskett 's side ; Cornelia 's knack of relapsing into her natural manner on the very heels of a heated altercation seemed somehow an additional offence , since it placed one under the imputation of being sulky , whereas , of course , one was exhibiting only a dignified reserve !
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 53]: Miss Briskett set forth on her morning 's shopping expedition without requesting her niece to accompany her , an omission which she fondly hoped would be taken to heart ; but the hardened criminal , regarding the retreating figure from behind the curtains , simply ejaculated , `` Praise the Fates ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 26]: swung her feet on to the sofa , and settled herself to the enjoyment of a novel hired from the circulating library round the corner .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 26]: For a solid hour she read on undisturbed , then the door opened , and Mason entered , carrying a telegram upon a silver salver .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 6]: `` For you , miss .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 9]: The boy is waiting for an answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 36]: Cornelia tore open the envelope with the haste of one separated far from her dearest , took in the contents in a lightning glance , sighed with relief , and slowly broke into a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 5]: `` Well -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 9]: ... she drawled thoughtfully ; `` Well -- !
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 10]: ... Yes , there is an answer , Mason .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 9]: Give me a pencil from that rack ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 17]: She scribbled two or three words ; copied an address , and handed it back eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 23]: give that to the boy -- and see here , Mason , I shall want some lunch ready by half after twelve .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 8]: Send Mury right along to my room .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 6]: I 'm going away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 21]: Mason 's chin dropped in dismay , but she was too well-trained an automaton to put her feelings into words .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 24]: She rustled starchily from the room , to give the dread message to Mary , who promptly flew upstairs , voluble with distress .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 17]: `` You never mean to say that you are going to leave us , Miss Cornelia ?
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 8]: Why , you 've only just come !
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 13]: I thought it was to be three months , at the least .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 8]: You 're never going so soon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 7]: `` Only for a few days .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 17]: I 'll be back again , to plague you , by the end of next week .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 11]: Do n't you want me to go , Mury ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 6]: Mary shook her head vigourously .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 10]: `` I 'd like to keep you for ever !
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 11]: The house is n't the same place since you came .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 21]: I was saying to my friend only last Sunday that I could n't a bear to think of you leaving .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 17]: Could n't you find a nice young gentleman , and settle down in England for good ?
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 8]: I 'd come and live with you !
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 16]: I would n't ask anything better than to live with you all my days . ''
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 5]: `` Mury , Mury !
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 5]: what about the friend ?
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 9]: What would he say to such desertion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 13]: Mary 's grimace expressed a lively disregard of the friend 's sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 28]: `` I do n't know how it is , but I think a heap more of you nor I do of him , '' she confessed candidly .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 14]: `` I 'd come fast enough , if you gave me the chance .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 14]: There 's lots of good-looking young gentlemen in England , Miss Cornelia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 5]: `` Is that so ?
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 27]: I hope I 'll meet quite a number of them , then ; but I could n't settle down out of my own country , Mury !
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 15]: You 'll hev to cross the ocean if you want to tend my house .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 27]: We 'll speak about that another day ; just now we 've got to hustle round and get my clothes packed in the next hef hour .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 8]: Just the dandiest things I 've got .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 34]: I 'm going to have a real gay time in a hotel in London , Mury , with some friends from home , so I must be as smart as I know how .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 22]: ... Get out the big dress basket , and we 'll hold a Selection Committee right here on the bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 20]: Mary set to work , unable , despite depression , to restrain her interest in the work on hand .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 35]: The big boxes were dragged into the middle of the room ; bed , chairs , and sofas were strewn with garments , until the room presented the appearance of a general drapery establishment .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 20]: Cornelia selected and directed , Mary carefully folded up skirts , and laid them in the long shallow shelves .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 18]: In the height of the confusion the door opened , and Miss Briskett entered with hasty step .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 22]: Signs of agitation were visible on her features , an agitation which was increased by the sight of the dishevelled room .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 39]: In a lightning glance she took in the half-filled trunks , the trim travelling costume spread over the chair by the dressing-table , and a gleam of something strangely like fear shone out of the cold grey eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 9]: Cornelia had no difficulty in understanding that look .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 42]: Aunt Soph was afraid she had pulled the rope just a trifle too tight , and that it was snapping before her eyes ; she was picturing a flight back to America , and envisaging her brother 's disappointment and wrath .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 15]: Out of the abundance of her own content the girl vouchsafed a generous compassion .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 10]: `` Yes , I 'm off , Aunt Soph !
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 28]: My friends , the Moffatts , are putting up at the Ritz for a week , and want to have me come and fly round with them .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 20]: They are going to meet me at four o'clock this afternoon , to be ready for a theatre to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 9]: I 've got to be off at once .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 8]: Mason 's getting ready some lunch . ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 10]: Miss Briskett stood severely erect , considering the situation .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 13]: Now that the great anxiety was removed , the former irritation revived .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 9]: `` And pray , who are the Moffatts ?
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 18]: I must know something more about them before I can give my consent to this visit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 12]: Cornelia handed a pile of cardboard boxes into Mary 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 13]: `` Take that hat-box downstairs , and pack these on the tray .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 6]: Do n't muss them about !
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 10]: Then you can come back to finish off . ''
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 17]: She waited until the door was safely closed , then faced her aunt across the bed .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 15]: `` I 'm pleased to answer your questions as well as I know how .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 7]: The Moffatts are -- the Moffatts !
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 17]: I guess that 's about all their family history , so far as I 'm concerned .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 28]: They came over with me , and Mrs Moffatt was real kind looking after me when I first came on deck , and was feeling pretty cheap .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 28]: We saw quite a good deal of each other after that , and she said she 'd love to have me do the sights with her sometime .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 15]: She was going straight through to Paris , to get fixed up with clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 9]: Now it seems she 's back in London .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 14]: I gave her my address , and she wires me to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 9]: `` You spoke of ` the Moffatts . '
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 10]: Who are the other members of the party ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 22]: `` There 's a husband , of course , but he 's not much account , except to pay the bills .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 27]: He must be pretty cashy , for she has everything she wants , but it gets on her nerves having him poking round all the while .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 9]: That 's one reason why she wants me .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 8]: I could always keep him quiet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 19]: The complacent gurgle , the jaunty tilt of the head were as fuel to the spinster 's indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 12]: She pressed her lips tightly together before putting the final question .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 14]: `` And your father knows nothing -- nothing whatever of these people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 12]: `` Well , I guess I may have mentioned their names .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 11]: He did n't know anything about them before that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 19]: `` And you propose to stay at a London hotel with the casual acquaintances of a few days ?
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 4]: You are mad !
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 7]: I can not possibly allow it .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 15]: You must wire at once to say that you are unable to accept . ''
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 5]: Cornelia stood silently erect .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 38]: Her chief personal characteristic was that air of hot-house fragility so often seen in American girls , but in that silence her chin squared , her lips set , the delicate brows contracted in a beetling frown .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 44]: It was no longer the face of a girl of two-and-twenty which confronted the spinster across the bed ; it was the face of Edward B Briskett , the financier who had twice over piled up great fortunes by sheer force and determination .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 29]: `` Now see here , Aunt Soph , '' said Cornelia , clearly ; `` this is where you and I have got to come to an understanding .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 33]: I 've been used to going my own way ever since I was short-coated , and it was n't hankering to be put back into leading-strings that brought me across the ocean .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 11]: Poppar trusts me , and that 's enough for me .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 27]: You 've got a right to boss your own home , but where I 'm concerned your authority do n't spread one inch beyond the gate .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 29]: If I decide to accept an invitation , it 's on my own responsibility , and no matter what happens , _ you _ wo n't be blamed !
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 32]: I 've decided to leave this at one twenty-five , and I 'm _ going _ to leave , if I have to jump out of the window to get away !
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 14]: Now , that 's straight , and we know where we are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 23]: `` I shall write to your father to-night , and tell him that you have gone in defiance of my wishes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 12]: `` I guess it 's the best thing you can do .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 21]: Poppar 'll cable back : ` _ Give Corney her head ; It 's screwed on pretty straight _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 10]: and you 'll feel easier in your mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 12]: She paused a moment , her features softened into a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 19]: Despite the force of her words , there had throughout been no trace of ill-nature in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 19]: Now she drew slowly nearer her aunt , holding out her pretty , white hands in ingratiating appeal .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 12]: `` See here , Aunt Soph , do n't be mad !
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 41]: I 'm sorry you take it like this , for I 've a feeling that it 's just about the best thing that could happen to both of us , for me to clear out for a spell just now .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 30]: We 've been a bit fratchetty this last week ; gotten on each other 's nerves somehow -- but when I come back we can make a fresh start .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 26]: In America , girls have more liberty than over here ; but there 's not a mite of reason why we should quarrel over it .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 19]: You 're my own Poppar 's sister , and I came quite a good way to see you .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 17]: It 's a pity if we ke n't pull it off for the next few months .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 17]: Do n't you want to kiss me , and wish me a real good time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 22]: Miss Briskett drew back coldly , but the little hands clasped her shoulder , the young face pressed nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 59]: Looking down from her superior stature , the girl 's likeness to her father was once more strikingly apparent ; but it was not the man she recalled , but the dearer memory of the Baby Edward of long ago , whose clear child 's eyes had seen in `` Sister '' the most marvellous of created things .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 14]: As on a former occasion , the remembrance was more powerful than words .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 40]: Long years of solitary confinement had hardened the spinster 's heart beyond the possibility of a gracious capitulation , but at least she submitted to the girl 's embrace , and made no further objections to the proposed journey .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 13]: On the whole , Cornelia felt that she had scored a victory .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 33]: Cornelia booked a first-class return to town , scattered half-crowns broadcast among the astonished porters , ensconced herself in a corner of an empty carriage , and prepared to enjoy the journey .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 33]: She did not purchase any magazines at the bookstall ; the only child of a millionaire need not trouble about insurance coupons , and at two-and-twenty life is more interesting than fiction .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 23]: Cornelia guessed she 'd heaps more to think about than would occupy a pokey little journey of from two or three hours .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 11]: Just to think how things changed from day to day !
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 40]: Yesterday she had supposed herself dumped right-down in Norton Park for a solid three months , and to-day here she was full chase for London , with the prospect of a week , crammed full of frivolity and amusement !
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 8]: She gurgled to herself in much contentment .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 46]: Aunt Soph had kissed her , or , at least , submitted to be kissed ; Elma was engaged in playing the part of Eve in flounced blue muslin , to an Adam in a flannel suit , in a particularly well-mown Garden of Eden .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 30]: She could therefore be happy in her mind concerning those who were left behind , and she had never yet doubted her own ability to take care of herself .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 28]: She smoothed the wrinkles on her long suede gloves , flicked the dust off the ridiculous points of her `` high shoes , '' and sighed impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 8]: She and her baggage were safely aboard .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 11]: Why could n't that old engine hustle up and start ?
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 16]: Cornelia rose to her feet , and thrust her head out of the open window .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 51]: There was only one passenger approaching along the deserted platform , and as fate would have it , he had reached a spot but a couple of yards away , so that the sudden appearance of the girl 's head through the window was followed by simultaneous exclamations of astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 23]: Exclamations of recognition , too , for the new-comer was none other than Captain Guest himself , most obviously equipped for town .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 9]: `` Miss Briskett -- is that you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 10]: `` Mussy , what a turn you gave me !
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 10]: Who 'd have dreamt of meeting you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 9]: `` Are you going up to town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 4]: `` I am !
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 4]: Are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 4]: `` I am !
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 7]: Do you prefer to travel alone ?
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 9]: If not , may I come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 6]: `` Why , suttenly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 25]: Cornelia was not yet quite sure whether she were annoyed or pleased by the encounter , but on the whole the agreeable element predominated .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 20]: She was of a gregarious nature , and at any time preferred to talk , rather than remain silent .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 21]: After a month spent in a strictly feminine household , the society of a male man was an agreeable novelty .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 10]: Moreover -- sweet triumph to a daughter of Eve !
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 37]: -- half an hour 's _ tete-a-tete _ on the drive home from the Manor had apparently made short work of the Captain 's preconceived dislike , since he was so anxious to repeat the dose !
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 19]: Cornelia smiled ; the naughty , little smile of a spider who welcomes a fly into his net .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 31]: Another minute , and the train was movings lowly out of the station , while the two young people continued their cross-examination , confronting each other from their separate corners .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 11]: `` This is an unexpected visit , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 19]: I understood from Miss Ramsden that she expected you to call at the Manor to-day or to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 23]: -LRB- Cornelia scored a point against him , for his own desertion , in the face of so interesting a prospect ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 4]: `` Vury unexpected !
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 14]: I got a wire from a friend and came off within two hours .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 17]: I understood from Mrs Greville that _ you _ were making quite a good stay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 4]: Guest grimaced eloquently .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 10]: `` I was -- but -- circumstances alter cases !
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 30]: To tell you the honest truth , Miss Briskett , I 'm just a bit fed up with playing gooseberry by day , and piquet -LRB- with Madame ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 21]: by night , and the idea of spending a few days at the club presented itself as an agreeable novelty .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 19]: My friends are almost all in town just now , and there is a good deal going on .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 24]: I generally put in a week or so of the season , so I thought I might as well clear out at once .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 8]: They do n't want me here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 14]: `` I do n't know about that , '' returned Cornelia , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 5]: `` What about Madame ?
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 10]: _ Someone 's _ got to keep her occupied !
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 11]: What 's to happen to her in the evenings now ?
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 17]: There 'll be nothing for it but a three-handed game , and that 's the limit !
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 27]: If you 'd been a kind , self-sacrificing friend , you 'd have stayed on , and worked that piquet for all you were worth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 11]: `` But I 'm not self-sacrificing , you see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 13]: Captain Guest explained , and in truth he did not look it .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 30]: Cornelia 's glance took in the magnificent proportions of the man , the indefinable air of birth and breeding , the faultless toilette ; the strong , dark features .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 22]: To one and all she paid a tribute of admiration , but the expression on the face was of concentrated self-sufficiency .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 15]: At this point admiration stopped dead , to be replaced by an uneasy dread .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 30]: Was Geoffrey Greville , even as his friend , frankly indifferent to everything but his own amusement , and if so , what of poor Elma and her dream ?
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 22]: It was an awful reflection that in such a case she herself would be largely responsible for thrusting Elma into danger .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 14]: Her expression clouded , and she stared through the window with unseeing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 36]: Captain Guest 's words had been so exceedingly plain that she had not affected to misunderstand their meaning , and the ice once broken , she was glad of the opportunity of solving her doubts .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 8]: `` You know Mr Greville very well .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 7]: Is he -- a flirt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 14]: Captain Guest flashed a glance at her ; a rapid , understanding glance .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 10]: `` He has been , '' he replied quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 14]: `` A desperate flirt ; but -- he is not flirting now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 11]: `` You think -- '' `` I 'm sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 10]: Cornelia clasped her hands with a sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 5]: `` Then -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 5]: `` The Deluge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 6]: `` You mean -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 10]: `` He ca n't marry her , of course !
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 36]: She 's a lovely girl , and everything that 's nice , and good , and that kind of thing , but -- not at all the kind of girl he ought to marry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 14]: `` Ought he to marry someone hideous then , with an ugly temper ?
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 3]: Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 47]: `` There 's no necessity to be hideous , that I know of , though as a matter of fact he probably wo n't find a girl suitable as to means and position , who is anything like so attractive , personally , as Miss Ramsden .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 10]: Greville is hardly his own master , Miss Briskett .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 16]: He is not a rich man , and he has the place to think of .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 8]: Besides , there 's Madame to consider .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 16]: Madame belongs to a noble house , and has high ideas for her son . ''
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 18]: `` Is it the custom over here , for the mommas to choose wives for their sons ?
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 26]: I do n't know much about Mr Greville , but from the look of him I should n't suppose he was one of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 24]: He has a kind of an air as if he 'd want a lot of moving , once he got his head set !
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 11]: If he really cares -- '' Captain Guest shrugged expressively .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 59]: `` Oh , for the moment , of course , it 's a case of ` all for love , and the world well lost , ' but in a few days ' time Miss Ramsden will return home ; they will drop out of each other 's lives , and then prudence will come to the fore .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 21]: There 's a girl whom he has known for years , who is built for him all the way round .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 24]: I do n't say he 'll like it so much , but he 'll end by marrying her like a good boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 11]: `` By marrying her money , you mean to say ?
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 24]: I see , we Americans are n't the only mercenary nation in the world , though we get the credit for it sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 10]: I 'll wait a while , before I judge .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 33]: There comes a time in most men 's lives when they forget their fine principles , and see just one thing ahead , _ and they 've got to have it _ !
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 25]: Everything else goes down like ninepins , even if it 's a real stately old mother , with her hair fixed-up like Marie Antoinette .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 15]: We 'll wait and see if that time comes along for Mr Greville ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 7]: Guest 's lip twitched with amusement .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 12]: `` You seem to be very experienced on the subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 5]: `` I am so .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 22]: I 've seen quite a good deal of life , '' said Cornelia , with the air of a female Methuselah .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 26]: She did not smirk nor giggle at the insinuation , but accepted it placidly as a matter of course , an occurrence of everyday happening .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 13]: Guest studied her critically , as she gazed out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 7]: Was she plain , or beautiful ?
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 6]: It was difficult to say .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 24]: The colourless complexion , and sharply pointed nose were serious blemishes , but the mouth was exquisite , and the hair a marvel .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 21]: How Rossetti would have gloried in painting it , unbound , with the great red-gold waves floating over her shoulders !
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 20]: The eyes were good , too , despite their unusual colour -- the colour of a tawny old sherry !
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 23]: As though attracted by his scrutiny , Cornelia turned her head , and let the golden eyes dwell thoughtfully upon his face .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 8]: `` Does Mr Greville do anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 11]: `` Has he any sort of occupation in life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 22]: `` He has a certain amount of business in connection with the property , but the agent does most of that .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 21]: He hunts , of course , and shoots -- he 's a capital shot -- and fishes at odd times .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 10]: All the ordinary things that a man does . ''
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 5]: `` Is that so ?
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 8]: They would n't be ordinary with us .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 7]: I like a man to work .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 12]: _ You 've _ got to work hard , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 6]: You 're a soldier . ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 14]: The quick pucker of lips and brows were almost startlingly eloquent of pain .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 4]: `` Not now !
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 4]: I was . ''
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 5]: `` You retired ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 9]: Rupert Guest looked across the carriage in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 29]: At any time he was haughtily resentful of curiosity ; but on this subject most of all he could not endure to speak with his most intimate friends .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 24]: His first impulse was to ignore the question , but as he met Cornelia 's steady eyes that impulse underwent an extraordinary reversion .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 41]: Incredible as it might appear , he became conscious that it was not only possible that he could tell this girl , this stranger , the hidden sorrow of his life , but that he actually wished to tell it !
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 16]: He wanted to hear what she would say ; to see how she would look .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 17]: Those childlike eyes would look very beautiful , softened with the light of sympathy and consolation .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 11]: He wanted to see that light shining for his sake .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 38]: `` It 's a long story , '' he began slowly , `` I do n't talk of it more than I can help , but I 'll tell you , if you care to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 20]: I come of a race of soldiers : it never entered my head that I could be anything else .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 34]: My father was in the Lancers ; he died before I left Sandhurst , but my mother managed to allow me fifteen hundred a year , and I joined my father 's regiment .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 21]: I was lucky as things go ; went through two engagements before I was thirty ; gained distinction at Omdurman .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 14]: At home I had a nailing good time : Adjutant of the regiment .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 6]: We had the jolliest mess !
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 14]: I do n't think a man ever lived who enjoyed his life more .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 24]: There was lots of play , but I loved the work too , and studied hard , at every branch of the profession .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 17]: I had the credit of being one of the best all-round men in the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 11]: He laughed ; a hard , sore - hearted laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 16]: `` I can say that now without reproach , for it belongs to another life .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 7]: ... Then -- my mother died !
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 30]: She had been living beyond her income , and there were all the legal expenses to face ; selling up at a loss ; giving the girls their share .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 38]: She had made a special push to keep me in the old regiment ; but in the end it came down to this , that in all , there was barely five hundred a year for me .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 20]: It was a big blow , but there was nothing for it but to send in my resignation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 25]: `` One ca n't be an officer in a crack cavalry regiment with only five hundred a year beyond his pay , Miss Briskett .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 6]: It ca n't be done .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 16]: There was n't one of my subs , who had less than eight hundred . ''
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 15]: `` Do n't you get any pay at all in your army then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 18]: `` Certainly ; about enough to pay the mess bills , and perhaps the changes of kit .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 23]: The uniform costs several hundreds to start with , and those fools at the War Office are everlastingly ordering senseless alterations . ''
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 10]: `` Yes ; but -- I do n't understand !
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 21]: If the pay is enough for your keep , why do you need such a heap more to get along ?
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 9]: Where does all the expense come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 8]: Guest knitted his brows in momentary embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 22]: `` Well , of course , there are certain things that a man must do to live up to his position .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 13]: He must entertain ; he must hunt ; he must play polo .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 26]: It comes cheaper to him than ordinary men , for he has the use of the regimental stables ; but still , things run up .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 11]: It 's astonishing how they _ do _ run up !
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 23]: There are a hundred things that are _ expected _ of him , and there 's no getting away from them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 15]: `` Is n't he expected first thing of all to serve his country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 8]: `` That is , of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 6]: Guest raised his head proudly .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 14]: `` I have already explained that I _ had _ served her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 20]: `` Would n't they let you go on then , because you could n't cut a dash ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 5]: _ Let _ me !
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 17]: There was n't a man in the mess who did n't beg me to stay on !
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 13]: The Duke sent for me , and argued for half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 7]: He promised me a staff appointment .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 11]: He said some awfully decent things about my past services .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 44]: I was glad of that ... I said , ` It 's no good , sir , I ca n't face the prospect of being Colonel of the regiment , and not being able to afford as much as my own subs . '
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 36]: We went over it again and again , and he lost his temper at last and called me a fool , but I stuck to it -- '' Cornelia drew a sharp breath of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 10]: `` You _ did _ resign -- for money ?
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 5]: In spite of all !
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 5]: For only that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 13]: `` It 's a very big ` only , ' Miss Briskett .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 17]: You do n't know how it feels to have your income suddenly reduced by two-thirds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 8]: `` Oh , do n't I just !
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 12]: I know how it feels to have it wiped clean away .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 20]: I guess my Poppar 's dropped about as much in one slump as any man in the States ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 19]: cried Cornelia , with the true American 's pride in size , be it for good or ill .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 45]: She did not feel it necessary to state that the lost fortune had been more than retrieved , for one of the very few points on which she found herself in complete agreement with her aunt , was the suppression of her own wealth .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 23]: She had no wish to be judged from a monetary standpoint , and Poppar 's fame had not travelled across the ocean .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 35]: He was just an ordinary everyday millionaire , with a modest little income of from three to four hundred a day ; not a real , genuine high-flyer , with a thousand an hour !
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 24]: `` I had to give up my frills and fixings , but I held on like grim death to the things that mattered .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 28]: -- I guess there 's something wrong about your army , if a man 's got to have a fortune before he can be an officer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 23]: `` A good many people are with you there , Miss Briskett , but unfortunately that does not alter the fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 11]: `` Then -- what did you do after that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 4]: `` Cleared out !
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 9]: I sold my uniform for eighty pounds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 23]: -- he laughed again , the same sore laugh -- `` and gave my orderly about a dozen suits of ordinary clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 9]: The only thing I kept was my sword .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 23]: I had ten swords hung on my walls , used by ten generations in succession -- I could n't give that up .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 15]: ... An old chum was going out ranching to the wildest part of California .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 14]: He asked me to come with him , and I jumped at it .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 14]: I wanted to get out of the country -- away from it all .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 17]: If I 'd seen the regiment riding through the streets , I should have gone mad !
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 15]: ... We sailed within a few weeks ... '' '' _ California _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 8]: Cornelia 's face was eloquent with meaning .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 42]: She had seen a regiment of Lancers riding through the streets of London on the one day which she had spent in the metropolis ; had stood to stare open - mouthed , even as the crowd who thronged the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 41]: She recalled the figure of the officer , a gorgeous , mediaeval knight , impenetrably lifeless , sitting astride his high horse like a figure of bronze ; a glimpse of haughty , set features visible between cap and chin-strap .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 8]: Outwardly immovable , indifferent ; but within !
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 3]: -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 58]: within , beyond a doubt , a swelling pride in himself , in his men , in the noble animals which bore them ; in the consciousness that every day the pageant attracted the same meed of admiration ; pride in the consciousness that he represented his King , his Empire , the power of the sword !
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 38]: Cornelia , a stranger and a Republican , had thrilled at the sight of the gallant Lancers , and -- she had visited the wilds of California also , and had received hospitality at a lonely ranch !
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 13]: There was a husky note in her voice as she spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 8]: `` How long were you there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 5]: `` Three years . ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 10]: `` Did you -- hate it very much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 10]: The laugh this time was more strangled than before .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 12]: `` Twice over I came within an inch of shooting myself !
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 9]: We were twenty miles from the nearest neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 10]: My friend went his way ; I went mine .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 9]: For days together we hardly exchanged a word .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 17]: There was nothing but the great stretch of land , and the Rockies in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 26]: In time one gets to think them beautiful , but at first ... I used to sit and think of home , and the regiment .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 8]: It was _ always _ with me .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 33]: I used to say to myself : ` Now they are at mess -- Now the horses are coming out of the stables -- Now they are turning out for polo ! '
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 15]: I could hear the drum , and the reveille , and the last post .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 15]: ... As clearly as in the barracks at home , I heard them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 18]: ... He stopped short , turning his eyes from the window to look at Cornelia 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 25]: It was distorted , quivering , with emotion ; her hands were clasped together , and down her cheek rolled two tear-drops , unashamed .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 12]: He turned sharply aside , and for some moments neither spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 30]: Cornelia was seeing , as in a picture , the lonely ranch , with the solitary figure , sitting with his face towards the East , thinking , thinking .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 40]: ... Guest was reflecting with amaze on the strange antic of fate , which ordained that it should be in the eyes of this Yankee stranger that he should see the first woman 's tears shed on his behalf !
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 25]: She cried like a child ; simply , involuntarily , without thought of appearance ; the tears rising from a pure well of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 14]: To the end of his life he would bless her for those tears !
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 11]: The train slackened and drew up at a country station .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 25]: A stout , elderly lady approached the carriage , glanced from one to the other of the two occupants , and hastily moved on .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 11]: Cornelia smiled , with the tears wet on her lashes .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 19]: Again the wheels began to move , and Guest said shortly -- `` Thank you for your sympathy !
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 16]: I had a feeling that you would understand -- that 's why I told you .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 18]: It 's not a story that I often tell to strangers , as you may guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 15]: `` My , yes , I sympathise ; I should just think I do .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 27]: I know what even our own people suffer sometimes away out West ; but I do n't _ understand _ , '' said Cornelia , firmly .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 12]: `` I do n't understand -- one -- little -- bit !
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 23]: There 's more to soldiering than riding through the streets , looking fine and large , and gotten up like a show .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 6]: I love to see it .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 33]: We profess to laugh at forms and ceremonies , but we love them just the same as anybody else , but it was your _ country _ you 'd promise to serve !
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 13]: For better or worse you allowed you were sworn to serve her .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 16]: You had risked your life for her ; I reckon you had shed your blood .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 14]: There was just one thing you would n't sacrifice -- your own pride !
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 17]: You were thinking of _ yourself _ when you sent in that resignation , Captain Guest !
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 25]: You saw yourself sitting looking out of the window , and seeing the boys riding off to their sports , and leaving you behind .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 16]: You cared more for that , than the thought that England might need you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 9]: `` You hit hard , Miss Briskett . ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 5]: `` I hit straight .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 8]: I know just how you 've suffered .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 77]: Seems to me I 'm going to remember all my life how you sat in that ranch and heard the last post ; but if I 'd been in your place , if America had wanted me '' -- her small , white face lit up with a very ecstasy of emotion -- `` I 'd have stayed at my post , _ if I 'd had to sweep the floors to do it _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 11]: The moment of tension passed , and the strain relaxed .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 24]: Captain Guest stoutly defended his position , and Cornelia vouchsafed a generous sympathy , while not budging an inch from her ultimate decision .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 20]: She disapproved , but she had wept ; the tears had rolled unchecked down her cheeks on his behalf .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 12]: After that they could no longer be mere , casual acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 46]: By the end of the first hour they had left the personal element behind , and were chatting busily about a dozen varying subjects -- the English landscape ; Trusts ; Free Trade ; Miss Alice Roosevelt ; chafing dishes , and the London season .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 44]: Cornelia had a cut-and-dried opinion on each , and was satisfied that every one who did not agree with her was a `` back number , '' but her arguments and illustrations were so apt and humorous , that Guest was abundantly entertained .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 45]: Throughout the entire journey their _ tete-a-tete _ was uninterrupted , for though several passengers approached the carriage with intent to enter , one and all followed the example of the stout lady , and dropped the handle at sight of the two occupants .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 39]: The third time that this interesting little pantomime was enacted Cornelia laughed aloud , and cried serenely -- `` Guess they think we 're a honeymoon couple ; they 're so scared of getting in beside us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 11]: Her colour showed not the faintest variation as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 18]: It was Guest who grew hot and embarrassed , and was at a loss how to reply .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 41]: He need not have troubled himself , however , for Cornelia continued her exposition touching the superiority of American everything , over the miserable imitations of other countries , with hardly as much as a comma 's pause for breath .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 29]: Guest sat back in his corner , looking at her with every appearance of attention , but in reality his thoughts were engaged in following a bewildering suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 10]: `` They think we are a honeymoon couple . ''
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 21]: ... Suppose -- it was folly , of course , but for one moment , _ suppose they were _ !
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 8]: He would be looking at his wife !
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 16]: She would smile across at him , and call him fond , silly little names .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 12]: He would kiss her -- she had beautiful lips to kiss !
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 35]: and hold her hand -- it was a soft little hand to hold , and tease her about her shaded hair , and her sharp little nose , and her ridiculous , pointed shoes !
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 33]: They would get out at the terminus , but instead of bidding each other a polite good-bye , would drive off together in a fly , discussing joint plans for the evening .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 28]: Later on they would have dinner at a little table in the great dining-hall of the hotel , criticising their neighbours , and laughing at their peculiarities .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 34]: In the theatre they would whisper together , and when the curtain went up on the heels of a critical moment , he would see the tear-drops shining once more on her lashes .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 30]: -- It was a lonely business going off to a man 's club , where nobody wanted you , or cared a brass farthing whether you came or went .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 18]: Not that for a moment he wished to be married -- least of all to Cornelia Briskett .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 21]: There were a dozen things about her which jarred on his nerves , and offended his ideas of good taste .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 34]: He objected to her accent , her unconventional expressions , her little tricks of manner ; while on almost every subject her point of view appeared to be diametrically opposed to his own .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 24]: In her company he would be often jarred , annoyed , and discomfited , but of a certainty he would never be bored !
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 25]: Rapidly reviewing his life for the last few years , it appeared to Guest that he had existed in a chronic state of boredom .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 19]: If `` we were a honeymoon couple , '' that dreariness at least would come to an end !
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 40]: He looked at Cornelia 's ungloved left hand resting upon the dark cushions -- she wore a ring , a wide , flat band of gold , with one fine diamond standing far out , in a claw setting .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 22]: American ladies affect solitaire rings , as tokens of betrothal -- did this mean that the honeymooning question was already settled ?
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 61]: If it were so , the fact would account for the girl 's absence of embarrassment in his own company ; all the same , he did not believe it , for there was in her manner a calm , virginal composure , an absence of sentimentality , which seemed to denote that the citadel had not yet been stormed .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 13]: Cornelia noted his gaze , without in the least guessing its meaning .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 15]: `` It was the other wrist that was sprained -- The right one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 18]: she said , holding it up as she spoke , and carefully moving it to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 10]: `` It 's heaps better , thanks to you .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 17]: I set Mury to rub it , according to instructions , and -- there you are !
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 10]: It 's most as well as the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 9]: `` Ready to shake hands , now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 9]: `` Mentally , as well as physically ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 10]: The white teeth showed in a smile of comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 6]: `` I -- guess so !
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 9]: I never was one to harbour animosity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 7]: `` I am glad of that !
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 24]: You bade me such a frigid good-bye on Thursday afternoon that I was afraid you had taken a violent dislike to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 11]: `` My stars and stripes , that 's pretty calm !
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 12]: What about _ you _ , I beg to ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 9]: Cornelia rolled indignant eyes to the hanging lamp .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 24]: `` I did n't hev to think ; I _ heard _ from your own lips what you thought about _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 28]: I could n't rest easy in my bed , for fear you went home and did away with Mr Greville , for making you drive me home .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 34]: I never supposed I should live to endoor the degradation of having a man do things for me against his will , but I had to come to England to find my mistake .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 12]: And then you sit there and accuse me of disliking you !
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 19]: -- Well !!! '' Guest flushed with embarrassment ; with something deeper than embarrassment ; with honest shame .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 13]: He clasped his hands between his knees , and bent forward eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 16]: `` You are quite right , Miss Briskett , there is no excuse for me .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 6]: I behaved like a cad .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 9]: Things got me on the raw , somehow .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 12]: I imagined -- all sorts of things which were n't true !
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 8]: That 's no excuse , I know .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 7]: I should have controlled myself better .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 23]: But if I was annoyed at starting on that drive , I was far more so when it came to an end .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 5]: You had your revenge !
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 13]: And you do n't deny that you disliked me in return . ''
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 5]: `` I did so !
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 7]: I did heaps more than that .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 13]: I thought you just the hatefullest person I 'd ever met . ''
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 5]: `` And now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 4]: Cornelia laughed easily .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 18]: `` Oh , well -- we 've had a pretty good time together , have n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 7]: We can let bygones be bygones .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 17]: You 're English -- vurry , vurry English , but I guess you 're nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 9]: `` What do you mean by English ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 42]: But even as he put the question Captain Guest straightened himself , and reared his neck within his stiff , upstanding collar , with that air of ineffable superiority which marks the Englishman in his intercourse with `` inferior '' nations .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 9]: Cornelia laughed , a full-throated ha-ha of amusement .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 7]: `` It 's ` English ' !
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 8]: There 's no other word to it .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 19]: You are about as English at this moment as you 've been in the whole of your life .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 21]: -- I guess we must be getting pretty near London now , for I ken see nothing but smoke . ''
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 8]: `` Yes , we are nearly there .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 21]: Will you -- may I call at your hotel some day , on the chance of finding you in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 5]: `` Why , suttenly !
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 7]: I 'd love to have you .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 6]: You could take me round .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 22]: If the Moffatts have fixed-up a dinner for themselves , some night , we might go to a theatre together ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 6]: `` Um -- yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 7]: Guest surveyed her with doubtful eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 18]: `` I suppose it would be easy enough to find some other lady to play chaperon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 8]: `` I do n't want a chaperon .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 4]: Why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 17]: It 's no fun having her poking round , and listening to every word one says .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 9]: It 's ever so much nicer alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 22]: `` I do n't doubt it , but -- in Rome one must do as the Romans do , Miss Briskett !
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 14]: In England a man does not take a girl to a theatre unchaperoned .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 7]: It 's not the thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 8]: `` I do n't care a mite .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 23]: It 's the custom with us , anyway , and there 's no country in the world where women are more respected .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 11]: What 's the harm , I want to know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 6]: `` No harm at all .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 6]: That 's not the question .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 8]: It 's simply not the custom . ''
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 20]: `` Do you mean to say you refuse to take me alone , even if I ask you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 5]: `` I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 18]: `` Then you 're a mean old thing , and I sha n't go at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 16]: Guest laughed ; an amused little laugh , in which there was an unwonted softness .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 17]: Somehow , he quite enjoyed being called `` a mean old thing '' by Cornelia Briskett .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 15]: There was an intimacy in the sound , which more than nullified the disparagement .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 6]: `` I think you will !
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 16]: You are too ` straight ' to punish me for what is not my fault .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 29]: It would be much more amusing for me to take you about unattended , and so far as I 'm concerned , I can afford to ignore conventions .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 8]: A man can do as he likes .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 8]: It is you I am thinking of .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 32]: You may not approve of our ideas , but that does not alter their existence , or the fact that whip ; you are here you must be judged by them .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 13]: You would not like to be considered careless of your reputation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 16]: `` I do n't care a mite what the old fossils , think . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 22]: _ I _ do , then ; and I will take no part in putting you in a false position . ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 16]: Cornelia pouted , but in her heart admired his firmness , as any woman would .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 45]: She stared at the forest of chimney-tops without speaking , for several minutes , then suddenly turned towards him , speaking in what was evidently supposed to be a lifelike imitation of the English accent , as spoken by the Lady of the Manor .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 6]: `` Th-anks ; aw-fly tha-anks !
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 4]: How varry kind !
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 5]: I shall be charmed .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 13]: ... Too aw-fly sweet of you , do n't - cher-know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 7]: `` That 's all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 5]: laughed Guest , happily .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 11]: `` We 'll manage to enjoy ourselves , never fear !
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 19]: There 's such a thing as taking _ two _ chaperons and letting them play with each other .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 7]: ... Here we are at Paddington .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 9]: Are your friends coming to meet you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 4]: `` They are .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 10]: I guess they 'll be waiting on the platform .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 74]: She 's tall and fine-looking , and dresses fit to kill -- '' She paused with a sharp little intake of breath , for the train , as it snorted into the station , had passed by the figure of a woman standing conspicuously alone -- a tall woman , with hair of a violent peroxide gold , holding up an elaborate white gown , to display a petticoat of flounced pink silk .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 29]: It was Cornelia 's first introduction to Mrs Moffatt in `` shore clothes , '' and to an eye accustomed to Norton simplicity the vision was sufficiently startling .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 15]: Also -- it was hateful to think such things -- but , that hair !
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 11]: On the steamer it had been just an ordinary brown !
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 15]: Cornelia would have died rather than own it , but she felt a qualm .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 37]: On the platform she saw other ladies standing waiting the arrival of the train ; smart , well-dressed , even golden-headed ladies not a few , but none in the least resembling Mrs Silas P Moffatt .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 42]: A swift desire arose that Guest might depart before her hostess made her way through the crowd , followed by a resigned recollection that that would be of no avail , since the two were bound to meet sooner or later .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 40]: She stepped out of the carriage , keeping her head turned in an opposite direction , but almost immediately a crisp rustling of skirts , a strong odour of violette de parme , and a loud -- `` Say !
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 5]: is that you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 9]: proclaimed that the search was at an end .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 49]: Cornelia forced a smile to her lips , and acknowledged her identity in suitable terms , and Mrs Moffatt gushed over her , in a Yankee accent , strong enough to cut with a knife , casting the while , arch , questioning glances in Guest 's direction .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 6]: Cornelia suffered qualm number two .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 43]: Even to her ears , the tone of her friend 's voice sounded unduly loud and nasal , and looking from her to her late travelling companion , it appeared that to be `` English '' need not be invariably a disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 26]: Of course , Mrs Moffatt was not a good type of American ; she belonged to the class who brought that honourable title into disrepute .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 19]: How was it that she herself had hitherto been blind to peculiarities which now aroused an instant prejudice ?
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 14]: `` Do n't you want to introduce me to your friend , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 8]: I never came across such a girl .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 10]: Someone flying around after you wherever you go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 20]: cried Mrs Moffatt , genially , and Cornelia mumbled the necessary words , with an unusual display of embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 26]: She dared not look at the expression of Guest 's face , and his cool , easy voice gave no hint of his real feelings .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 24]: She turned aside to give instructions to a porter , while her ears strained to catch every word which passed between her companions .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 15]: Mrs Moffatt was talking about her , gushing over her , in fulsome phrases .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 3]: Cornelia this !
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 3]: Cornelia that !
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 11]: What business had she to use that name , anyway ?
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 9]: She had never received permission to do so .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 11]: It was impertinent to assume such an air of familiarity !
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 30]: The three made their way together towards the luggage van , where Cornelia claimed her two big boxes , and saw them hoisted on the top of a four-wheeler .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 19]: The elation of ten minutes back had died a sudden death , and she felt depressed and lonesome .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 31]: Among all the crowd no one seemed a greater stranger than this woman by her side ; in comparison with her , Captain Guest appeared an old and proven friend .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 33]: She raised her eyes to his , as the cabman busily strapped the last box to the roof , and found his eyes fixed on her face with a very grave scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 47]: She did not know how pale and dejected was her own appearance , how different from the jaunty self-confidence of an hour before ; but Guest had been keen to notice the quickly succeeding expressions , and was saying to himself : `` She is upset .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 8]: Something is different from what she expected .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 21]: It 's a bad lookout for her with that terrible woman , but she must have known her before . ''
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 19]: ... Mrs Moffatt glanced from one to the other , giggled meaningly , and stepped into the cab .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 25]: They were alone ; as much alone in the midst of the noise and confusion , as in the quiet of the railway carriage .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 17]: `` Well , '' said Guest , regretfully ; `` I suppose I must say good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 23]: I 'll come round soon to see how you are getting along , and -- Miss Briskett , here is my card .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 9]: -- It gives the address of my club .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 16]: If you should need me for anything , at any time , ring me up !
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 8]: You will promise , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 11]: I could be with you in a few minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 4]: Cornelia smiled faintly .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 14]: `` Oh , thanks ; I do n't know about _ needing _ .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 29]: Mr Moffatt will be round to look after us , but -- Norton 's my only home over here , and you seem like a bit of it !
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 10]: I 'll be real glad to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 34]: She held out her hand to him ; he held it for a moment in a tight , protective grasp , then took off his hat to Mrs Moffatt , and turned away .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 37]: Twenty yards farther on the cab passed him , and he caught another glimpse of the two faces ; one small and white , the other heavy in outline , and suspiciously blue-pink as to cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 9]: `` Thank heaven , I came up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 6]: said Captain Guest to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 56]: Cornelia was surprised to find that her friends were not already housed at the Ritz , but had been staying at a private hotel , in a dull side street , where the cab called on the way from the station , to take up a pile of luggage lying ready packed in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 17]: `` The fashionable hotels are all crowded out in the season , '' Mrs Moffatt explained .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 23]: `` We 've had our names down for ages at the Ritz , but it was impossible to get in before to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 22]: I do n't know as we should have managed even now , if it had n't been for you , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 14]: It worked wonders when we said you would be one of the party .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 12]: You do n't mind having your name mentioned , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 32]: You 've just got to play up to these managers , if you do n't want to be put off for ever , or poked away in a back room . ''
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 14]: `` Oh , I do n't mind , '' said Cornelia , easily .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 17]: `` If my name is of any use , use it for all you 're worth .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 12]: I should n't have supposed anyone would know it over here .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 7]: They do n't in Norton . ''
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 32]: `` My dear , the hotel is crammed full of Americans , and any one of them would say it was poor business to refuse the daughter of Edward B Briskett .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 18]: The connection might be worth a heap , if you went home and allowed you were satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 12]: Silas do n't count for anything -- he 's no push !
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 15]: We might have waited for ever if it had been left to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 41]: To judge by the hangdog expression of the said Silas as he came forward to greet his guest at the door of the Ritz , the success attending his wife 's manoeuvres had not inspired him with any particular joy .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 34]: Cornelia thought he looked more henpecked than ever , but he received her warmly , and hovered round to assist with the smaller impedimenta , while his wife hurried forward into the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 57]: Inside all was brightness and gaiety ; little parties of visitors grouped here and there about the large , light hall ; obsequious clerks bowing before one , hoping that the rooms reserved might give satisfaction ; begging to be informed if any comfort were lacking ; summoning waiters to show the way to the lift .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 34]: Cornelia was annoyed to notice that most of these attentions were directed towards herself , but as Mrs Moffatt did not appear to take umbrage , it seemed wisest to make no protest .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 28]: The mistake was not likely to occur again , for with so many guests in the house , individual attention could not extend beyond the arrival civilities .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 43]: Tea was served in the Empire suite , which had been reserved for the party , and Cornelia hated herself for feeling so little in sympathy with a host and hostess whose one anxiety seemed to be to provide for her enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 44]: From a printed list of amusements , she was bidden to make her choice for every evening in the week ; for the afternoons , river - picnics were suggested , coaching expeditions to outlying scenes of interest , drives in the Park .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 25]: For the mornings -- well , naturally , there was just one thing to be done in the morning , and that was shopping !
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 14]: `` I hope you 've brought up heaps of money , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 5]: You 'll need it .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 9]: The things are just heavenly this season ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 9]: Mrs Moffatt declared , but Cornelia remained unfired .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 28]: `` I 've a circular note ; it 's all right so far as that goes , but I sha n't want any more clothes for ages !
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 22]: I brought over a whole trousseau , and so far as I can see , the half will go back unpacked .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 13]: They do n't dress down at Norton -- they _ clothe _ !
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 33]: You 've got to be covered right up to the chin , and to work in all the blue serge you can , and that 's about all there is to it .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 19]: If you fixed-up like we do at home , you 'd make as much stir as the fire-engine .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 30]: I 'd like to mail a few presents , if I saw anything really new and snappy , but I sha n't go near a store for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 7]: `` I shall , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 6]: cried Mrs Moffatt , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 9]: `` I got next to nothing in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 22]: The shops over there are n't a patch on London , in my opinion , and the language puts one off .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 27]: I ca n't get the hang of it , and it gets on my nerves fitting on clothes , and not being able to find fault .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 11]: You 'll have to come round with me , Cornelia .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 15]: I 've been waiting till you came , to decide on heaps of things .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 7]: You 've got such lovely taste .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 30]: Silas wants to give me some furs , and I 've seen an emerald necklace that I 'm bound to have if I 'm to know another happy moment .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 19]: I 've been in twice to see it , and I guess the man 's beginning to weaken .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 20]: It would pay him to let me have it at a reduction , rather than keep it lying idle .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 26]: You shall come with me , and say what you think it 's worth ; but mind , I 'm to have the first chance !
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 9]: You must n't try to snap it up .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 33]: A few hundred dollars do n't matter to you one way or the other , but I 've got to worry round to make the money go as far as it will .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 29]: It 's not that Silas wants to stint me ; he 's not that sort , but he has n't the balance behind him your father has ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 48]: Silas smiled in sickly acknowledgment of his wife 's consideration , fidgeted in his seat , and finally took himself downstairs , to see about securing theatre tickets , whereupon his wife heaved a sigh of relief , and helped herself to a fresh cup of tea .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 4]: `` Thank goodness !
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 9]: I ke n't stand men in the daytime .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 24]: They do n't take any interest in clothes or parcels , or trying-on , but kinder hang round , looking bored and superior !
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 6]: It gets on my nerves .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 15]: ... That was a real smart-looking man you had with you to-day , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 2]: Guest ?
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 7]: did you say -- Captain Guest ?
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 6]: English , is n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 15]: Acts as though he 'd got the patent , and everybody else was imitation .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 21]: I rather like it myself , I do n't think anything of a man who takes a back seat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 17]: The short , impatient little sigh was evidently dedicated to the memory of the absent Silas .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 11]: ... `` Where did you pick him up , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 5]: He seems very devoted .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 7]: Anything coming on between you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 6]: Cornelia 's `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 21]: made the listener start in her seat , so loud was it , so stern , so eloquent of displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 22]: She herself was astonished at the white heat of anger which possessed her as she listened to Mrs Moffatt 's questionings .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 8]: `` Picked him up , '' indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 6]: What insolence ; what vulgarity !
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 11]: What an indignity to speak of him in such words .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 14]: Her indignation seemed almost as much on Guest 's account as her own .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 34]: A vision of his face rose before her , she seemed to see the curl of the lip , the droop of the eyelid with which he would have greeted such an expression .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 3]: Suttenly not !
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 6]: He is the merest acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 10]: There is not even an ordinary friendship between us .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 10]: I may very probably never meet him again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 6]: `` Is that so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 6]: queried Mrs Moffatt , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 45]: As the Captain had himself announced his intention of calling at the hotel , the only effect of Cornelia 's violence was to deepen the impression that there was `` something in it , '' but she was too diplomatic to pursue the subject .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 22]: Instead , she prattled on about a dozen inconsequent topics , and finally suggested a drive in the Park before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 23]: `` It will freshen you up after your journey , and there 's nothing else to do for the next two hours .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 22]: Just ring , will you , dear , and make arrangements , while I write a few notes in my room .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 16]: A victoria , or a motor , whichever you prefer , and in about half-an-hour .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 9]: That will give us time to prink . ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 27]: She rustled out of the room , and Cornelia rang and gave the order , only too thankful to avoid a prolonged _ tete-a-tete _ indoors .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 30]: Once again she wondered how it had come to pass that she had become on intimate terms with this woman , who now jarred upon her at every turn .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 93]: On board the steamer her own friends had scarcely left their state-rooms during the voyage , and Mrs Moffatt , in a neat tweed costume , and an enveloping blue veil , had played the part of ministering angel with much devotion , during three dreary days , when she herself had lain on a chair in a sheltered corner of the deck ; had read aloud , repeated amusing little anecdotes about the passengers , taken her for constitutionals up and down , and even helped her to bed at night .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 17]: When Liverpool was reached , it seemed as if they had known one another for years .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 18]: They had kissed at parting , and mutually agreed to meet , and have a good time .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 4]: `` Shucks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 5]: cried Cornelia , mentally .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 7]: `` It 's that old Norton !
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 21]: I 've gotten so used to dowds , that the sight of a Paris gown scares me all into fits .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 28]: I 've looked forward to coming to London all my life , and now I 'm here , I 'm going to enjoy myself all I know .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 7]: Now then , for the Park !
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 29]: I guess that grey crepe , and the hat with the white feathers , will be about the best I can do for the honour of the flag .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 30]: You 've got to strike a balance , my dear , and plump for neutral colours as long as you run in harness with Mrs Silas P Moffatt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 27]: That first drive in Hyde Park was a pleasant experience , though the trees looked grey and dusty , after the fresh green of the country .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 33]: Cornelia , like most of her sisters , had , as a first object , to see the people , not the Park itself , and certainly they were worth the seeing .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 28]: There is no place in the world where finer specimens of humanity can be seen than in Hyde Park on the afternoon of a bright June day .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 22]: Cornelia admired the tall , immaculately-groomed men , the dainty , high-bred looking women , with their air of indolent grace .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 33]: They did not look as if they were enjoying themselves particularly , but she enjoyed , looking at them , and honestly acknowledged the presence of a certain quality unowned by herself .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 33]: `` They 've got a far-off look , as if they could n't see anything nearer than a hundred miles , and were scared to laugh , in case they might break !
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 14]: ... I guess it 's what they call ` _ breed _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 8]: Captain Guest 's got it , too .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 18]: We 've not much use for that kind of thing at home , but it -- counts !
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 40]: If you 'd been used to it all your life , it would be a jar to step down ... '' Mrs Moffatt knew a great many people by sight , and pointed them out as they drove by .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 30]: Lady this , the Countess of that , Mrs Blank , who wrote society novels , and was noted for her taste in dress , the beautiful Miss Dash .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 13]: -- `` Not that I can see much beauty in her myself .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 15]: She 's not a patch on you , when you 're in form ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 20]: Cornelia felt a girl 's natural pleasure in the compliment , in the truth of which she complacently agreed .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 34]: She did not envy Miss Dash her looks , but she did emphatically envy her her friends , particularly her male friends , who clustered around her carriage , eager for a word .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 34]: One felt decidedly out of it , driving through a crowd of strangers , not one of whom turned a welcoming smile in your direction , nor cared whether you came or went .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 29]: At home , Cornelia was accustomed to be in the midst of all that was going on , a central figure , round which all the rest revolved .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 23]: She did not at all appreciate being relegated to the position of regarding the fray from the vantage of a hired vehicle !
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 19]: Cornelia craned her head to right and to left , scanning the passing crowd for a familiar face .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 63]: It seemed impossible that among hundreds of people there should not be someone whom she recognised , and her faith was justified , for just at the bend near the Marble Arch , she had a passing glimpse of Guest 's tall figure , standing talking to two ladies , one middle-aged , the other young , and graceful , and smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 41]: They were quietly , even simply , attired , but their whole air and carriage breathed that indefinable something which she had just struggled to define : something diametrically different from the ostentatious display of the woman by her side .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 30]: Theoretically , Cornelia was thankful to escape observation ; in reality she felt an absurd pang of loneliness and disappointment , as the carriage bore her out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 38]: The evening was spent at a theatre , and by eleven o'clock next morning both ladies had started forth on one of the shopping expeditions , which seemed to constitute Mrs Moffatt 's chief pleasure in life .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 38]: They drove first of all to the jeweller 's , where Cornelia was shown the emerald necklace , a wonderful collection of stones , in an antique setting , with which she herself promptly fell in love .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 38]: The price was excessive , even for her own deep purse , and she concluded that Mr Moffatt 's means must be even larger than she had imagined , since his wife seriously contemplated such a purchase .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 56]: There was a good deal of bargaining , half-serious , half-joking , between Mrs Moffatt and the very imposing - looking personage behind the counter , but fortified by the advent of another possible purchaser , the latter steadily refused to reduce his price , and once again Mrs Moffatt retired discomfited from the struggle .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 37]: `` I know just how it will be , '' she cried , `` I 'll have to give it up , and then you 'll step in , and carry it off before my eyes !
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 19]: But you 've got to wait a bit , till I see what I can do with Silas .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 11]: I 'm not going to give up yet awhile . ''
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 4]: Cornelia laughed easily .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 8]: `` Oh , I 'll play fair .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 16]: If you give up the idea , I daresay Poppar 'd let me have it .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 26]: He says emeralds suit me better than any other stones ; but I sha n't break my heart , one way or the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 19]: ... Then addressing the shopman : `` Have you got anything really new and tasty for little presents ?
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 12]: I might as well look round while I 'm here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 76]: Then followed a delightful hour , from the shopkeeper 's point of view , at least , when Cornelia examined the contents of tray after tray , and selected `` little presents '' to the value of a cool hundred pounds : an old pearl and enamel solitaire stud for her father ; a hat-pin composed of a big turquoise , and a selection of dainty , jewelled brooches and bangles for special girl friends .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 17]: `` I 'll give you the addresses , and you 'd better mail them from here .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 25]: I do n't know how you fix up things to travel safely from this side , but you can do all that 's necessary .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 22]: I 'll give you a cheque and you need n't send them out till you see that it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 28]: I 'm a stranger to you , and ca n't expect you to trust me right away , but you 'll find the money 's there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 12]: `` Well , I should think your name 's good enough !
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 16]: No one need fear trusting your father 's daughter for a few hundred dollars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 12]: Mrs Moffatt protested , while the shopman waxed eloquent in protestation .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 32]: Cornelia continued to write addresses on the various boxes , without troubling to answer , for the assiduous manner in which her friend advertised her parentage was already beginning to jar .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 20]: First to the hotel officials ; then to casual acquaintances during the evening , and now to this tradesman !
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 30]: It was a disagreeable change from Norton , where the subject of money was never mentioned , and no one seemed to care whether you were rich or poor .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 35]: The whole morning was devoted to shopping ; in the afternoon the two ladies went out driving , and returned to the hotel , to find Captain Guest 's card on the sitting-room table .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 10]: `` He has lost no time , anyhow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 6]: said Mrs Moffatt , meaningly .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 8]: `` He has done the polite thing .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 12]: Now he need not trouble any more , '' Cornelia replied .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 14]: On the whole , she was not sorry to have missed the call .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 16]: Conversation , with Mrs Moffatt as audience , would have been somewhat of a strain !
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 22]: The Moffatts appeared to have few private friends in London , and to show no anxiety to add to their number .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 48]: Though they displayed an insatiable curiosity about everything which concerned their guest , they volunteered very little information in return , and after three days spent entirely in their society , Cornelia knew little more about them than on the first day of their meeting on shipboard .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 40]: A mushroom city of the West figured as `` home , '' in occasional references ; but the wife frankly declared a hatred of domesticity , while the husband regretted that constant travel was a necessity in his business .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 47]: Evidently the present period was one of holiday-making , for Mr Moffatt seemed to do nothing but hang about the hotel , playing odd games of bridge or billiards with stray loafers like himself , and being correspondingly elated or depressed as he won or lost .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 12]: On the whole , Cornelia preferred him when he was depressed .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 14]: Exuberance of spirits is apt to wax offensive when divorced from good taste .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 46]: At times she frankly disliked both husband and wife , and meditated an immediate return to Norton ; but as a rule she was absorbed in the interest and charm of the grey old city , which was so unlike anything she had yet visited .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 51]: It was like turning back a page of history , to see with her own eyes those historical landmarks , of which she had read since childhood ; to drive about looking at the names of the streets , the monuments at the corners , the great , inky buildings .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 34]: Visitors from sunnier lands often take away from our capital an impression of gloom and ugliness , but Cornelia 's artistic sense realised a picturesque element which rose superior to smoke and grime .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 24]: She loved the narrow , irregular streets , the Turneresque haze which hung over the sky , even in this fine summer weather .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 22]: The City was a solemn land of work , but the West End was a fairy realm of luxury and pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 28]: Flowers everywhere , stacked up in great piles at the corners of the streets ; hanging from window-boxes ; massed together in the beds of the parks .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 33]: The carriages blocked one another in the narrow roads ; the balconies were draped with awnings ; gorgeously - clad flunkeys stood upon the doorsteps , ushering in long streams of visitors .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 28]: In the City men worked for money ; in the West End they threw it away , carelessly , heedlessly , as if it had been dross .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 40]: The great hotels sheltered hives of strangers , who admired and criticised , envied and scoffed , and flitted industriously about on the edge of the feast ; on the edge , but never actually passing over the border !
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 29]: On the fourth morning of her stay in town , a note , addressed in a strange handwriting , was brought to Cornelia , with her morning tea .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 26]: She guessed at its authorship before opening the envelope , and reading the name `` Rupert Guest , '' at the end of the letter .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 4]: `` Rupert ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 8]: A good name , an appropriate name !
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 14]: Strong and manly , with an old-world echo of dignity in the sound .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 11]: One could not associate this man with abbreviations or nicknames .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 21]: At work and at play , at home and abroad , he would remain plain , unabbreviated `` Rupert . ''
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 12]: One doubted if even his own mother ventured on a familiarity !
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 32]: Cornelia read the few lines with lively curiosity : -- `` Dear Miss Briskett , -- I was disappointed to miss seeing you when I called at your hotel on Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 32]: My aunt , Lady Seymour , is giving a reception to-morrow afternoon , and would be delighted to see you and your friends , if you have nothing better on hand .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 9]: There ought to be some pretty good music .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 17]: I will call at three o'clock , on the chance that you may care to come .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 8]: -- Yours faithfully , Rupert Guest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 24]: Enclosed was a formal card of invitation , dated from Grosvenor Gate , `` Miss Briskett and party '' written on the corner .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 31]: Cornelia sat banked up against her pillows , her ruddy locks framing her little face in a glory of rippling curls and waves , her lips pursed in slow reflection .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 3]: `` No-o !
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 10]: I guess Miss Briskett and party would rather not !
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 33]: I do n't see the fun of squeezing in among a lot of grandees , who do n't want anything of us but just to quiz and stare , and make remarks .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 61]: If he 'd asked me alone , I 'd have risked it , just to see how they manage their shows over here ; but he 's too proper to take me without a chaperon , and ... Well , anyway , the Moffatts are right-down good to me , and I 'll have no hand in having them snubbed !
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 27]: Miss Briskett will politely refuse , and the party wo n't have a chance of accepting , for they wo n't be told anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 6]: I hate a fuss . ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 61]: Cornelia went downstairs , deciding to write a letter before going out , and post it to the club ; but during breakfast Mrs Moffatt announced with profuse apologies that she and her husband were obliged to devote the afternoon to visiting a friend living at some distance from town , and must therefore leave her to her own resources .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 23]: Perhaps she would like to do a little shopping on her own account , take a drive , or visit a gallery !
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 30]: Cornelia , with a sudden rising of spirits , guessed she could find a dozen things to do , and bade her friends feel no anxiety on her score .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 53]: She wrote no letters that morning , but sallied forth on the inevitable shopping excursion , with a particularly gay and jaunty air , and an inclination to bubble into laughter on the slightest provocation , at which Mrs Moffatt exclaimed in envy -- `` My , what spirits you do enjoy !
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 8]: I wish I could laugh like that .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 8]: Some people have all the luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 22]: She sighed as she spoke , and Cornelia , glancing at her , caught a haggard look beneath the white veil .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 16]: It occurred to her for the first time that her hostess was no longer young .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 20]: She wondered how she would look at night , denuded of powder and rouge , and luxuriant golden locks ?
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 18]: An elderly woman , thin and worn , with the crow 's feet deepening round her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 26]: A woman whose life was spent in the pursuit of personal gain , and who reaped in return the inevitable harvest of weariness and satiety .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 9]: Cornelia was too happy to judge her harshly .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 37]: She was sorry for her and made a point of being unusually amiable during the long hours of trailing about from shop to shop , which were beginning to be a severe tax on her patience .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 57]: Mrs Moffatt never seemed to make a purchase outright , but preferred to pay half a dozen visits to a shop , trying on garment or ornament , as the case might be , haggling over the price , and throwing small sops to the vendor , in the shape of the purchase of insignificant trifles .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 50]: Cornelia herself was tempted to buy a number of articles which she neither needed nor knew exactly how to use , partly from want of something to do while her companion was occupied , and partly from a sense of shame , at giving so much trouble for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 34]: Every day , also , boxes of fineries were sent `` on approval , '' to the hotel , so that one seemed to live in a constant atmosphere of milliner 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 11]: Cornelia wondered to what purpose was this everlasting dressing up .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 37]: The dejected Silas could hardly count as an audience , since he was the most indifferent of husbands , and it seemed a poor reward for so much trouble to receive the passing glances of strangers .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 17]: `` I hope when I settle down , I 'll have some real interest in life .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 10]: I 'll take care that I have , too !
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 54]: I 'd go crazed if there was nothing more to it than hanging round stores all the time , '' said Cornelia to herself , as she bade farewell to her friends after lunch , and settled herself with a book in the corner of the lounge , to await Guest 's arrival .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 28]: She was pleased at the prospect of meeting him again ; mischievously amused at the anticipation of his embarrassment when he found that her chaperons had fled .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 55]: It would be a delightful change to chat with him for half an hour , and when he departed to listen to the `` pretty good music , '' she herself would get into a hansom and drive to Saint Paul 's to listen to the wonderful boys ' voices chanting the evening service .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 32]: Cathedrals were not included in the London known to Mrs Silas P Moffatt , but Cornelia was determined not to leave the metropolis without visiting the great temple of the East .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 16]: After four days of pure , undiluted Moffatt , she felt mentally and spiritually starved .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 51]: It would be good to leave the world and sit apart awhile beneath the great dome ... At five minutes past three by the clock , Guest appeared in the doorway of the hotel , made an inquiry of the porter , and was directed to Cornelia 's sheltered seat .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 25]: She saw him cast a glance over her neat , walking costume , as he approached , and naughtily determined to prolong his uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 34]: On her own side , she honestly admired his appearance ; compared him to his advantage with the other men in the hall , and was proud to welcome him as her friend .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 20]: Her little , white face was sparkling with animation , as she held out her hand to greet him .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 8]: `` How d'you do , Captain Guest ?
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 12]: It 's real good of you to come again so soon .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 10]: I was sorry to miss you Saturday afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 18]: `` So was I. '' Guest seated himself , and deposited his hat carefully by his side .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 21]: `` I waited half an hour , and then gave it up , and went to loaf in the Park .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 11]: It 's the only thing to do before dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 35]: `` I saw you there , standing on the sidewalk talking to two ladies , an old one , and a young one , as pretty as -- '' `` A moss rose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 12]: he suggested quickly , and they laughed together over the remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 5]: `` Were you driving ?
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 7]: I wish I had seen you !
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 10]: Is -- er -- Mrs Moffatt quite well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 12]: `` Puffectly , thank you , '' said Cornelia , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 29]: She noted the quick glance around , and wondered if he felt it compromising to sit with her alone , even in the publicity of a hotel lounge .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 14]: `` We drive most afternoons , and go to the theatre every evening .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 20]: I 'm having a giddy time -- just about as different from Norton as it 's possible to imagine !
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 8]: Have you heard anything from the Manor ?
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 25]: That wretched girl has never sent me as much as a postal , and I 'm dying to hear what 's going on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 5]: I 've heard nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 10]: I never for a moment expected that I should .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 7]: Greville is too much engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 18]: Guest knitted his brows , bitched his trousers at the knee , and cleared his throat uncertainly .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 31]: Cornelia divined that he was waiting for her to refer to his aunt 's invitation , and feeling somewhat at a loss to account for the severity of her costume .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 8]: At last the question came out suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 9]: `` Er -- you got my note ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 4]: `` I did !
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 6]: I thank you for it .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 11]: It was real kind of good to take the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 13]: I suppose you had to go and ask for those invitations ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 16]: `` I asked , of course , but my aunt was delighted to give them .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 20]: It will be quite worth going to , I think -- good music , and something of a function !
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 7]: You would enjoy seeing the people .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 15]: I hope you are not going to say that you ca n't come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 10]: `` What makes you think that , I wonder ?
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 7]: Do n't I look smart enough ?
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 12]: I 'm sorry you do n't approve of my costume ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 48]: She sat up straight in her seat ; a smart little hat perched on the top of shaded locks ; a neat little stock beneath the rolled-back collar of her coat ; minute little shoes , with ridiculous points , appearing beneath the hem of her skirt .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 16]: Guest looked her over deliberately , his dark face softening into a very charming smile .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 4]: `` I do !
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 5]: Very much indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 17]: `` Maybe it 's a trifle homely , but it 's best to strike a balance .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 14]: Mrs Moffatt 's apt to be a bit gaudy on these occasions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 13]: `` It is very good of her to take so much trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 14]: Is -- er -- is she nearly ready , do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 46]: Cornelia had been narrowly on the watch for the flicker of dismay on Guest 's face ; it came surely enough , but was suppressed by such a gallant effort that , to use her own vernacular , she `` weakened '' at the sight .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 25]: The impish light died out of her eyes , and she said frankly -- `` I guess I 've been jollying all the time !
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 28]: Mrs Moffatt 's gone with her husband to visit a friend who lives quite a good way out , and she wo n't be back before seven .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 22]: I did n't tell her of your invitation , as her plans were made , so it was n't worth while .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 11]: I 'm ` alone in London ' for the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 17]: Sounds kinder pathetic , do n't it ; but I 'm enjoying it very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 17]: `` Then -- er -- am I to have the pleasure of taking you alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 9]: Cornelia threw him a glance of tragic reproach .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 4]: `` Captain Guest !
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 4]: I 'm surpr-iz-ed !
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 16]: How dare you take advantage of my unprotected position , to make such a suggestion ?
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 20]: In England young girls -- _ nice _ young girls , do not go about with young gentlemen unchaperoned .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 6]: I 'm shocked at you !
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 12]: I should have believed you would have been more considerate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 6]: `` We could start early .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 8]: I could introduce you to my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 16]: She would find some ladies , with whom you could sit during the concert . ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 10]: Cornelia made a grimace , the reverse of appreciative .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 10]: `` No , thank you ; I guess not !
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 19]: I 'm not over-fond of sitting with ladies at any time , but strange ones are the limit .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 25]: You tell your aunt that it 's real kind of her , and I vury much regret that I do n't want to go .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 13]: I 've fixed-up just how I 'm going to spend the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 46]: First , I 'm going to give you some coffee -- the waiter 's bringing it along -- then , when you go off to your crush , I shall get into a hansom and drive away into the City , to Saint Paul 's .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 6]: The service is at four .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 24]: I 'll sit right by myself , and listen till that 's over , then I 'll go round and see the tombs .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 15]: Quite a number of big people are buried there , I 'm told . ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 6]: `` Saint Paul 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 8]: Guest 's tone was eloquent of amazement .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 13]: `` But why Saint Paul 's , of all places on earth ?
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 13]: Why not hit on something livelier , while you are about it ?
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 32]: There 's a splendid exhibition of paintings in Bond Street , and the Academy , of course , and the Wallace Collection -- half a dozen shows which are worth seeing .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 12]: Why go into the City on a day like this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 6]: `` Because I want to !
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 39]: I 've had four days cram full of -- '' She hesitated , seeking for a word that would not incriminate her hosts -- `` of _ fuss _ , and I want something else for a change .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 19]: From all I hear , Saint Paul 's is a kinder big , and soothing , and empty .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 16]: You can sit and think without being jostled up against someone else all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 39]: I do n't suppose there 's a more sociable creature on earth than I am myself , but every now and then I 've just _ got _ to get away and have things out by myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 24]: Guest sipped his coffee in thoughtful silence , glancing at Cornelia from time to time , with eyes full of a new diffidence .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 18]: An impulse gripped him , an impulse so extraordinary that he hesitated to put it into words .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 56]: He wanted to go to Saint Paul 's too ; to drive beside Cornelia through the streets , to see her face as she sat in the dim old cathedral ; that softened , tremulous face , of which he had caught a glimpse once before , the memory of which lived with him still .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 42]: When the service was over , he wanted to be her guide , to climb with her the tortuous staircase , and look down on the ant-like figures in the streets below ; to descend with her to the subterranean vaults .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 34]: ... He , Rupert Guest , wished to visit Saint Paul 's on a grilling June afternoon , in preference to attending a fashionable rendezvous -- what madness was this which possessed him ?
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 16]: It was rank folly ; he would be ashamed to put the request into words .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 2]: Pshaw !
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 17]: it was only the impulse of a moment -- he would never think of it again .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 24]: Then he looked at Cornelia once more , and heard himself say , in deliberate tones -- `` May I come with you ?
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 5]: I should not interrupt .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 21]: If you prefer , I could sit in another place during the service , but I 'd like to come .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 7]: Afterwards we could go round together .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 13]: It would be good of you to give me the chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 7]: `` But -- the reception ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 7]: `` Oh , hang the reception !
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 12]: I 'm not sure that I should go in any ease .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 8]: Do let me come , Miss Briskett .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 4]: I want to .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 3]: Badly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 10]: Cornelia hesitated , staring at him with puzzled eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 22]: `` You seemed to think Saint Paul 's a pretty queer choice when I mentioned it a few minutes back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 19]: `` I did ; more shame to me , I suppose ; but then you explained your reasons .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 32]: -- I do n't pretend that I should care to go by myself , but if you take me as your companion , it might be good for me , too .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 11]: ... Would it disturb you to have me there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 9]: `` No-o , '' said Cornelia , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 11]: `` I 'd as lief you were there as not !
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 9]: I feel differently since I heard that story .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 8]: ... You must need heartening up sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 31]: Let 's go right along then , and see if we ke n't lay in a store of good thoughts , that will help us along for quite a while .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 7]: Will you order a cab ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 12]: ... Guest walked in silence to the door of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 17]: By his own request he was going to attend a church afternoon service with Cornelia Briskett !
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 9]: The thing seemed too extraordinary to be believed !
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 14]: He took his seat in the hansom in a kind of stunned surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 22]: Truly , every man was a stranger to himself , and there was no foretelling what an hour might bring forth !
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 20]: Cornelia turned to survey herself in the slip of mirror , and carefully adjusted the set of her hat .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 4]: `` Say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 12]: she cried , laughingly , `` we 've forgotten that chaperon !
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 12]: Suppose you think one 's not needed in a cathedral . ''
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 6]: She paused , dimpling mischievously .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 8]: that 's just as you 're made .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 19]: I guess if I were set on it , I could flirt in a _ crypt _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 36]: Captain Guest could not flatter himself that Cornelia was in anyway `` set on '' flirting with himself , since nothing could have been further removed from that attitude than her behaviour during the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 43]: She displayed a keen interest in her first view of the Strand and Fleet Street , and though her criticisms of those ancient thoroughfares were the reverse of complimentary , she was evidently impressed by the vast solemnity of the cathedral itself .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 51]: The usual congregation of stragglers were dotted about on the chairs in the nave ; dreary-looking derelicts from God knows where , who drift in through the open doorways seeking refuge from heat in summer , and cold in winter , and listen with apathetic indifference to the passing services .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 38]: Guest seated himself by Cornelia 's side at the end of an unoccupied row , but for all the notice she paid him , he might as well have been at his aunt 's reception miles away .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 48]: Only once , as the boys ' voices soared upwards in a strain of almost unearthly sweetness , did she turn her face towards him , in involuntary appeal for sympathy , and at that moment there could no longer be any doubt as to her looks .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 20]: She was beautiful ; so beautiful that Guest was dazzled by the sight of the white , kindled face .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 34]: The service was an unmitigated success ; an hour to cherish in memory , but in the sight-seeing expedition which followed , there was no denying the fact that Cornelia _ jarred _ !
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 71]: Even the most phlegmatic of Englishmen must be roused to a feeling of pride by such a review of the deeds of his countrymen as is set forth in a national cathedral ; it may be even conceded that his attitude may be a trifle irritating to strangers from distant lands ; be that as it may Guest and Cornelia seemed fated to view everything from different points of view .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 60]: Where he waxed enthusiastic , she displayed cool commonsense ; when he stood dumb , she criticised the design of the sculpture , and speculated as to the cost ; she guessed it was `` playing it pretty low down on Wellington to stow him away in a cellar , '' and made scathing remarks by Gordon 's memorial .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 8]: `` You muffed it badly that time !
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 19]: Guess if he 'd belonged to _ us _ , he 'd have been hopping round still ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 50]: Guest was thankful to mount the narrow staircase leading to the golden gallery , for Cornelia was so essentially a creature of to-day that he felt more in sympathy with her in the air and the sunshine , with the echo of the great city rising to their ears .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 20]: They stood side by side , while the breeze blew elf-like tendrils of hair round the girl 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 33]: The gentle expression of half an hour ago had departed , and she looked a creature of steel and flame ; a vital , indomitable being , tingling with energy and joy .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 31]: At sight of the forest of chimney pots stretching away into the horizon , her eyes shone with an enthusiasm which the wonders of the cathedral had failed to inspire .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 37]: To Guest the outlook was dreariness personified ; the vastness which so impressed his companion conveyed to him only a realisation of work and struggle ; of a pent-house in which human creatures struggled for existence .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 35]: He stood in silence , while Cornelia exhausted her supply of adjectives , brooding on the difference in the standpoints from which each regarded life , until presently she interrupted with a personal question .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 13]: `` You have never told me where you live , Captain Guest !
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 11]: London is not your real home , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 6]: `` Thank goodness , no !
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 8]: I could never live in a city .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 9]: My home is in the country -- Staffordshire .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 29]: It was a valuable property fifty or sixty years ago , but the factories have crept nearer and nearer , and , of course , that depreciates values .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 6]: It is let at present .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 17]: I hope to save enough money to go back in time to end my days there .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 18]: It 's a fine old place , but its value is bound to go on dropping . ''
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 16]: `` Could n't you pull it down , and build small property on the site ?
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 12]: If there are factories about it might pay vury well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 28]: Guest 's look of stupefaction , incredulity , of horror , could scarcely have been greater if Cornelia had suggested a leap down to the street beneath .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 4]: `` Good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 4]: what an idea !
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 13]: You ca n't realise what you are talking about , Miss Briskett .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 18]: That house has been in the possession of my family since the time of the Tudors ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 5]: Cornelia elevated indifferent eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 19]: `` I do n't know as that 's any reason why you should drop money on it now !
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 13]: I would n't take any stock of Toodors beside my own convenience .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 27]: It 's better to own a house you ken live in , than the Garden of Eden , and be obliged to rent it out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 22]: `` There is such a thing as sentiment , Miss Briskett , though you do n't seem to realise it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 10]: `` Do n't you make any mistake about that !
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 6]: I realise it right enough .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 25]: I 'm death on sentiment in its right place , but it takes a back seat when daily bread comes into the question . ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 43]: `` And if I told you that I 'd rather starve than desecrate the home of my ancestors -- that I 'd sooner end my days in a London garret than level a single wall for my own benefit -- what then ?
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 13]: Would you put me down as a madman for my pains ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 30]: Guest spoke with unwonted passion , staring down into the girl 's face with challenging eyes , but Cornelia preserved her attitude of complacent , albeit commiserating , superiority .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 32]: `` My Poppar 'd say it was sheer wickedness to see a chance of making money , and letting it slide , but I do n't go so far as that .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 21]: Everyone has a right to be miserable in his own way , but -- I prefer to be comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 12]: Her ripple of laughter struck a chill to Guest 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 9]: He looked at her moodily beneath knitted brows .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 13]: `` How is it that we always _ do _ feel differently ?
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 6]: We seem never to agree .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 9]: What is the explanation , I wonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 8]: `` We _ are _ different ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 5]: returned Cornelia , simply .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 13]: `` The difference is deep down beneath all we say or do .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 10]: We 're _ made _ differently from the start .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 15]: You felt it the first moment we met , and I did the same .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 11]: We kinder hated each other , and wanted to scratch !
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 4]: That was instinct !
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 10]: You do n't get behind instinct in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 21]: Later on other things come in and muddle one up , but just in the first moment one sees clearly .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 31]: You thought Elma Ramsden the sweetest thing , and were all fired up to help her , but when you looked at me you were bursting with pride and prejudice .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 10]: Why was that , I want to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 6]: `` You have answered yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 29]: Prejudice -- a blind , ignorant prejudice , of which I am ashamed ; and pride -- wounded pride , because you attempted to lay down the law !
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 12]: Do n't judge me by that unfortunate beginning , Miss Briskett .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 9]: I have repented sufficiently to deserve forgiveness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 18]: Cornelia rested her chin on her clasped hands , and stared thoughtfully over the forest of chimney-tops .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 31]: `` You are sorry because I 'm a girl , and we 've had some pretty good times together ; but that do n't alter the position of the case .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 13]: I guess we are each pretty good types of our different nationalities .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 33]: We ke n't blame ourselves for that ; if the truth 's told , I expect we are proud of it , but it makes it impossible to feel the same way .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 18]: We 're bound to jolt up against each other every time we dip below the surface . ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 15]: `` You find it impossible then to think of me as a friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 16]: To his own amazement there was a touch of genuine anxiety in Guest 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 49]: It seemed to matter a great deal whether this girl of the ruddy locks and curling lips accepted his friendship , or deliberately put it aside ; to matter none the less that she had jarred upon a dozen prejudices during the course of the last half hour !
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 15]: He knew the tension of suspense before he met her radiant , answering smile .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 13]: `` Oh , my , no , we 're friends right enough !
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 21]: If you have n't to live with people all the time , it 's easy enough to avoid the rubs .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 18]: I guess we can agree to differ for the few times we 're likely to meet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 14]: ... She buried her face in her hand , to suppress a yawn .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 9]: `` Those steps have just about finished me !
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 6]: I 'm all used up .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 10]: Do n't you want to give me some tea ?
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 15]: I noticed one of those Fuller stores in the Strand as we came along .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 11]: Let 's go right back and have a rest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 11]: Guest led the way downwards , feeling but indifferently consoled .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 24]: An uncomfortable depression weighed on him as he walked through the streets , and sat with Cornelia in a corner of the tea-shop .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 49]: It was the first meal of which he had partaken in her company , and it gave a feeling of intimacy to face each other across the daintily-spread table , to watch her pour out tea with the pretty white hands on which the diamond solitaire twinkled meaningly .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 29]: She seemed really tired , and for once was content to be silent while she drank boiling tea and munched rich cakes , with supreme disregard of digestion .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 59]: As for Guest , two phrases rang in his ears , to the exclusion of other thoughts -- `` The few times we are likely to meet '' -- `` We might be a honeymoon couple ... '' Two suggestions , far apart as the poles , yet each bringing within it a thrill of something like fear .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 35]: He did not wish to find himself in the position of bridegroom to this Yankee stranger ; the thought was absurd , nevertheless it was distinctly unpleasant to picture anyone else occupying the position !
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 27]: It was worse than unpleasant , it was actually painful to think that the newly-formed friendship might be interrupted by a separation of three thousand miles !
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 39]: He sat , staring at his companion with the intensity which accompanies a preoccupied mind , until presently Cornelia began to arch her eyebrows , purse up her lips , and crane her head from side to side .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 6]: `` I beg your pardon !
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 21]: If I was to get up and stand on that bench , do you think it would aid your scrutiny ?
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 7]: What 's the verdict , please ?
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 17]: It 's the least you can do to tell me , after quizzing all this time !
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 9]: ... What do you think of my looks ?
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 8]: Honestly , mind , without any bunkum !
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 7]: I 'm crazy to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 11]: `` I think -- sometimes -- you are beautiful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 3]: `` Seriously ?
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 5]: You mean it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 5]: `` I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 21]: The golden eyes met his with a flash of delight , and an arm was stretched impetuously across the table .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 4]: `` Shake hands !
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 7]: You 're just the nicest thing !
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 35]: To be puffectly candid , I 've thought the same once or twice when I 've caught sight of myself in a mirror at a big moment , when I was all worked up !
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 63]: -- Big moments are vury suiting , but on ordinary days '' -LRB- Cornelia put a strong accent on the penultimate -RRB- , `` my nose , '' she closed one eye to regard with the other the sharp little tip of the member in question , `` there 's no getting away from it , that my nose is a set-back !
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 13]: It 's a mean little thing , without a mite of dignity .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 12]: And I 'm kinder washed-out and pasty by your English roses !
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 17]: Do you think I should look better if my cheeks were pink like Elma 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 49]: She looked at him with arch inquiry , and even as she did so , either as the result of something which she read in the watching eyes , or by the action of some mysterious mental power , the pink flamed in her cheek , and lo !
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 18]: she was a rose herself ; a wonderful , exotic rose , flaming from red to gold !
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 15]: Guest looked at her for a moment , and then hastily dropped his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 36]: He was not by nature an impetuous man , but he had a conviction that if he looked at Cornelia any longer at this moment , he might say something which he should afterwards regret .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 5]: He did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 6]: It seemed unnecessary to answer .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 13]: His eyes had done that eloquently enough in that moment of meeting .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 41]: There was a long silence , while Guest mentally pulled himself together , calling himself a fool for his pains ; recalling the fact that by her own confession Cornelia was an accomplished flirt ; steeling himself against her blandishments .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 20]: When presently he heard his name pronounced in dulcet tones , he looked up with his most unapproachable air .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 25]: Cornelia was holding her plate towards him with one hand , while with the other she held a fragment of cake to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 7]: `` Another piece , please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 3]: she commanded .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 30]: `` It 's the best thing I 've struck since I 've been this side , and I 'm going to wolf into it for all I 'm worth !
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 22]: Ordinary meals bore the life out of me , but I 'm just wicked when I get started on sweets ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 20]: Guest signalled to a damsel in attendance , and saw her eyes widen in amazement at the renewed order .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 22]: She walked away suppressing a smile , and could be observed obviously retailing the incident to a companion behind the counter .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 33]: It detracted woefully from the romance of the situation to be pointed out as a couple who had demolished a large plateful of cakes , and sent out an order for more !
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 52]: Before parting from Cornelia at the hotel , Guest made a point of finding out her programme of amusements for the next few days , as a consequence of which he called at a theatrical depot on his way to his club , and secured an odd stall for either night .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 49]: He had already more social engagements than he could keep , but it occurred to him that it would be possible to run into the theatre for an odd half hour , and chat with Cornelia during an interval , on his way from one place to another .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 44]: He assured himself with much solemnity that it was his duty to look after the girl , since she had told him that he seemed to her like a bit of home , and he had the poorest possible opinion of her hosts .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 23]: As for Cornelia , she ran gaily upstairs to her room , disdaining the lift , and all a-sparkle with pleasurable excitement .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 50]: From her point of view the afternoon had been an unmitigated success ; she had been conscious of no jar , being blandly indifferent to every opinion but her own , and was now as whole-hearted in appreciation of her companion as she had previously been violent in denunciation .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 23]: He was just the sweetest thing , and she was going to see him again to-morrow ; maybe , to - night .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 15]: It felt like being at home again to have a nice man hopping around !
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 28]: She threw open the door of her room , and started with surprise to meet Mrs Moffatt on the threshold , her arms piled high with parcels .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 37]: A long , narrow box lay on the top , and she had an impression of seeing her own name written on the cover , before Mrs Moffatt hurried past , speaking rapidly over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 9]: `` Why , Cornelia , is that you ?
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 12]: Excuse me , wo n't you , coming into your room ?
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 11]: The stupid things have gotten the parcels all mixed up .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 9]: These are the things I ordered this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 8]: Come into the parlour before you change .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 7]: I want you a moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 28]: She bustled down the passage towards her own room , deposited her bundles , then crossed the corridor to the sitting-room , where Cornelia was already seated .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 30]: She looked up as the elder woman entered , and thought she had never seen her look so worn and tired ; so old , despite the artificial colouring .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 12]: `` I 'm afraid you 've not had a good time .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 6]: You look all used up !
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 11]: Was n't the visit as nice as you expected ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 14]: Mrs Moffatt threw herself down on a chair with a sigh of impatience .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 11]: `` Oh , my dear , I am so rattled !
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 11]: Every mortal thing 's gone wrong from start to finish .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 15]: Do n't ask me about it , for it do n't bear speaking of .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 49]: My head aches fit to split , and now Silas has taken the huff and marched off goodness knows where , and there 's a man sitting down in the hall refusing to go away until he gets his money , and disgracing me before the whole hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 13]: It 's for those furs I had sent in the other day .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 20]: I decided to keep them , and mailed them to a friend in the country to house for me .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 23]: I ca n't be worried with a lot of goods in a hotel , so she gives me store-room until we sail .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 10]: That 's where I 'm fixed-up , you see .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 27]: I ca n't give him either the goods or the money , and when Silas turns ugly , goodness only knows when he may come back .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 7]: Maybe not till late at night .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 13]: I 'm so mortified I do n't know what to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 4]: Cornelia laughed easily .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 6]: `` Do n't you worry .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 7]: It 's as easy as pie .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 18]: I 'll give you a cheque , and Mr Moffatt can pay me back in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 11]: I 'll go and write it out for you now .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 6]: What 's the damage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 9]: `` Two hundred pounds ; Fredburg and Company .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 7]: You are an angel , Cornelia !
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 9]: I ke n't begin to thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 7]: `` Do n't try , please !
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 10]: What does it matter for a few hours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 5]: cried Cornelia , brightly .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 39]: She went into her own room , made out the cheque , and handed it to her friend , who promptly carried it away , to return at the expiration of five minutes with a sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 7]: `` That was one for him .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 13]: He looked kinder small when he saw your name on the cheque .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 23]: It 's real sweet of you , dear , and Silas will pay up like a lamb when you are the creditor .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 15]: He wo n't show his temper to you , as he would to me .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 16]: You are a stranger , you see , and I 'm only his wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 28]: There was an accent of bitterness in the speaker 's voice , and she leant her head on her hands , in an attitude of profound dejection .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 27]: Cornelia had never before been the witness of so abandoned a mood , but her ideas of loyalty were too much outraged to permit of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 14]: She held her head erect , and her voice sounded cold and distant .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 20]: `` I 'd just as soon not hear any more about Mr Moffatt , if you do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 18]: He 's been very kind to me , and it 's not my business how he behaves .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 22]: I guess a good many men get crusty when the bills come in , and you 're a pretty expensive wife .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 14]: I should think you 'd get tired of prowling about those stores ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 26]: Mrs Moffatt flushed , and bit her lower lip , not attempting to defend herself , but staring before her with weary , vacant eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 37]: It was a welcome diversion when a waiter entered the room carrying a tray with tea and refreshments , and Cornelia waited on her hostess with an attention which was intended to mitigate her late severity .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 38]: Although a fuller acquaintance of Mrs Moffatt had increased neither liking nor respect , it had developed a sincere pity for a woman whose life was barren of purpose , of interest , apparently of love also .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 40]: It was not in Cornelia 's nature to see anyone suffer and not try to help , and if it had been her own mother on whom she was waiting she could not have shown more care and consideration .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 42]: A table was placed by Mrs Moffatt 's side , tea was made with exact remembrance of her preferences ; a cushion was brought from a sofa to put behind her back , and a footstool placed ready for her feet .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 21]: It was while she still knelt to put the stool in position that the elder woman at length broke silence .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 7]: `` See here , Cornelia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 29]: she cried suddenly , `` I may n't have another chance of talking to you quietly before you go , and there 's something I want to say .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 26]: ... You are young , and rich , and pretty , and strong , and you 've had a good time all the way through .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 23]: Your Poppar spoils you , and you 've got just to wish for a thing , and it 's there right along .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 28]: I 'm glad of it , for you 're a real sweet girl , but , _ do n't come down too hard on other people _ !
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 17]: ... It 's a pretty queer world when you compare one person 's luck with another !
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 21]: I 'm not going to tell you all I 've come through , but it 's not been too easy .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 15]: At times I 've been to blame , and at times I have n't .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 17]: I do n't know as it makes much difference anyway -- the end 's the same .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 33]: Seems to you I 'm a pretty poor thing , but you do n't know how you 'd have been yourself , Cornelia , if you 'd come along the same road .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 12]: You 've got to remember that , before you judge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 6]: `` That 's so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 5]: assented Cornelia , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 51]: She was too `` straight '' to deny an insinuation which was all too true , but at the same time she felt an acute regret and embarrassment in the thought that a woman so much older than herself should feel it necessary to make such a confession of unworthiness .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 25]: `` I ought to be a heap better than I am , for there is n't anyone living that 's had a better time .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 35]: We 've had spells when Poppar 's had bad luck , and the money 's been short , but we were as happy as grigs planning out how we 'd spend the next pile .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 37]: So long as you can get along , it does n't matter much about the extras , when you 're as happy together as we are , Poppar and I. '' Mrs Moffatt sighed once more .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 7]: `` I never knew my parents .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 27]: They died when I was a baby , and I was raised among strangers , who put up with me for the sake of the pay .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 8]: Love never came my way , somehow .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 12]: I suppose some folks would say that was my own fault .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 34]: There was a man I could have cared for , but he did n't want me , and I married Silas for a change ; to get away from the dull old life .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 10]: ... You be careful who you marry , Cornelia !
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 22]: You 're the sort of girl who does things pretty thoroughly either way ; there 's no middle course for you .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 10]: You 're bound to be either blissful or wretched .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 16]: You 've got enough money of your own , so you can afford to choose .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 3]: Lucky girl !
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 11]: -- Is it going to be that Captain Guest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 5]: `` Suttenly not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 27]: Cornelia rose to her feet , and walked back to the tea - table , very stiff in the back , and pink in the cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 18]: She was angry with herself for blushing , and the fact naturally made her blush the more .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 27]: `` I told you before that we have only met once or twice , and more 'n half the time has been taken up in quarrelling .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 13]: We are too different ever to run together in double harness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 7]: `` Well -- I 'm sorry !
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 17]: He 's got lots of frills , but he looks the right sort all the same .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 4]: I 'm sorry .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 11]: You ought to have a good man , Cornelia . ''
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 17]: Mrs Moffatt pushed aside her half-finished cup of tea , and rose wearily to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 11]: `` Well , I guess I 'll go and dress .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 18]: We 'll have some champagne for dinner , and that will perk us up for the theatre .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 29]: They say it 's a real good play , and we shall only be together two more nights , so I want you to have a good time .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 18]: It seems mean not to ask you to stay on , but our plans are all uncertain .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 9]: We may be off ourselves any time now .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 12]: Silas never settles down for more than a few days . ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 11]: Cornelia gave the politely inaudible murmur usual on such occasions .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 23]: Much as she had enjoyed the stay in town , she could not pretend to regret the prospect of returning to Norton .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 39]: Later on she would make a longer visit to town , in Poppar 's company , but even if the invitation were given she could not consent to remain any longer the guest of Mrs Silas P Moffatt .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 23]: She was a woman whom it was impossible to respect , and to Cornelia , respect was a necessary foundation to friendship .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 5]: Silas did not count !
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 19]: He was `` a little misery , '' to be regarded only as an adjunct to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 14]: She was even surprised to hear that he was capable of exhibiting ill-temper .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 70]: In any case , it seemed to be short-lived , as dinner found him in his usual place , and then and throughout the evening he was , if anything , a trifle more animated than usual , thanking Cornelia warmly for helping his wife out of an awkward position , and regretting that in the rush to the theatre there was not time to discharge the debt forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 10]: `` But we must settle up after breakfast to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 7]: Short accounts make long friends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 14]: he declared smilingly , as he helped her to put on her cloak .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 36]: Cornelia had dressed with a vivid remembrance of the fact that Captain Guest had never seen her in evening attire , and a determination to secure `` a big moment , '' for his benefit .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 69]: When an hour or two later he stood at the entrance to the stalls , and caught sight of her seated in the centre of the front row , it seemed at first sight that she was clad entirely in black , but even as he was applauding the choice for the display of ruddy locks and snowy shoulders , she made a sudden movement , and lo !
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 10]: the black was transformed into vivid , glittering green .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 14]: Now she was conspicuous -- too conspicuous , to please his fastidious taste .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 21]: He could see opera-glasses levelled on her from the boxes overhead , and over the edge of the dress circle .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 24]: She sat well forward in her stall , with head thrown back , and eyes fixed upon the stage , in absorbed attention .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 54]: There was no doubting the unconsciousness of the pose ; she was as oblivious of the gaze of others as of his own presence , but he felt an irritated longing to muffle her in veils and wrappings ; to lift her up and transplant her to the back seat in a box .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 22]: What business had those idiots to stare at her , as if she were one of the actresses on the stage ?
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 18]: He branded the idiots with even stronger titles , the while he continued to follow their example .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 54]: Surely it was a forgivable sin to be conspicuously attractive ; to stand out , vivid and dazzling , from the surrounding throng , whose chief characteristics seemed to be a bleached inanity , and indifference ... Guest stood in the shadow , his deep-set eyes fixed on the girl with unblinking scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 41]: He remembered that such a gaze was said to demand a response where a certain amount of affinity existed between the people involved , and put out his strength to try the truth of the statement in his own case .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 7]: The proof came almost startlingly soon .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 18]: Cornelia 's head turned over her shoulder , and her eyes lightened with a flash of recognition .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 37]: She smiled at him , nodded her head , and arched her brows , signalling a message , which he could easily divine to be an invitation to come to speak to her between the acts .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 41]: When the curtain fell , Mr Moffatt made an immediate rush for the door , and Guest took possession of his seat , devoutly thankful that it did not happen to adjoin that of the other lady of the party .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 10]: `` I 'm very pleased to meet you again !
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 15]: Seems quite a good time since we parted , '' said Cornelia , gaily .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 25]: Her hair stood out round her head like a halo of gold , her eyes shone like stars , her cheeks were softly pink .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 10]: Guest was dazzled by the bizarre beauty of her .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 34]: She wore no jewels , not so much as a chain round her neck , and the dress by some witchery was black once more , a thin black gauze , heavily jetted .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 9]: He pointed at it with a curious finger .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 11]: `` I could have sworn it was green over there !
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 10]: What has happened to turn it into black ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 4]: Cornelia laughed complacently .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 7]: `` It 's meant to change !
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 24]: There are skirts and skirts : ever so many of them , on top of each other , and each one is different .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 8]: They all get a chance at times .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 7]: It 's the vury latest craze .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 11]: Mrs Moffatt nearly killed me when she saw it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 5]: `` A chameleon effect .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 3]: I see !
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 8]: Is it supposed to be symbolic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 4]: `` Of me ?
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 4]: I guess not !
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 13]: When I 've made up my mind , I _ stick _ !
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 10]: There 's no chopping about for this child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 18]: It was extraordinary how illusion vanished at the sound of the high - pitched , nasal voice .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 21]: The fairy princess vanished , and in her place sat a flesh-and-blood damsel , composed , complacent , and matter-of-fact .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 10]: Guest felt again the intrusion of a jarring note .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 31]: He would have liked Cornelia to welcome him with a flutter of embarrassment , to have seen her eyes droop before his , and hear a quiver in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 54]: He wanted to realise that he was the natural head and protector , and she the woman , the weak , clinging creature , whose happy destiny it was to be the helpmeet of man ; but as Cornelia herself would have phrased it , there was `` no cling to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 18]: It seemed ridiculous to think of protection in connection with a creature so jauntily self-satisfied and independent .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 54]: He sat by her side until the conclusion of the interval , but the conversation was forced and uninteresting , and he rose to depart with the depressing consciousness that the interview had been a failure , since it left him less in sympathy with Cornelia than he had been in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 37]: On his way to the door , Guest 's eyes caught the signal of a warning fan , and he looked up to see one of the boxes occupied by a party of his own friends .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 30]: He had been too much occupied with Cornelia to look around the audience , but now it was impossible to leave the theatre without going upstairs a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 27]: After the ordinary greetings , complaints of the heat , and comparisons of engagements , followed the inevitable question -- `` Who is Miss Rossetti ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 7]: `` I beg your pardon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 7]: `` Your friend in the stalls .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 8]: The girl with the wonderful hair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 10]: `` She 's an American -- a Miss Briskett .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 9]: Over from the States on a short visit .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 24]: I met her lately down in the country , and we happened to strike the same week for a visit to town . ''
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 5]: `` Lucky for you !
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 8]: I 've been admiring her all night .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 11]: That hair and skin , and the glittering black-green frock !
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 3]: Quite bewitching !
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 6]: Where is she staying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 13]: `` At the Ritz , with some people she met coming over .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 8]: She knows no one over here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 21]: The good lady 's interest appeased , she turned back to the stage , fluttering her fan to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 28]: Attracted by its movement , or by the glances focussed upon her , Cornelia tilted her head upwards , recognised Guest , and whispered to her companion .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 24]: Mr Moffatt 's eyes travelled obediently towards the box , to fasten , not on Guest but on the man by his side .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 25]: For a moment they widened in unmistakable recognition , before , of set purpose , as it were , they grew blank and lifeless .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 13]: He bowed slightly to Guest , and turned back to the stage .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 17]: The man by Guest 's side laughed drily , and followed him out into the corridor .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 45]: `` Look here , Guest , '' he said shortly , `` if that girl is a friend of yours , and is staying in a hotel here with those people , you 'd better advise her to get away as soon as possible !
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 7]: That man 's a bad egg .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 10]: I ran up against him in Marienbad last year .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 20]: He and his wife made the hotel too hot to hold them , and were politely requested to leave .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 15]: There was nothing definite proved , but too many shady things to be pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 35]: He had an extraordinary facility for winning at cards , and the fair Mrs Schuter -- by the way her hair was brown at that time -- '' `` These people are called Moffatt !
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 10]: Perhaps you are mistaking them for somebody else ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 18]: Guest interrupted eagerly : but he knew the futility of his hope before he heard the reply .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 10]: `` No doubt they have half a dozen aliases !
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 11]: What does it matter what they choose to call themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 12]: You saw for yourself that the man recognised me just now .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 28]: Sorry to interfere , you know , and all that , but I 'd be nailing sorry to leave any girl I knew in such a caravansary .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 8]: Thought I ought to tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 5]: `` Thanks very much !
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 5]: You are perfectly right .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 15]: I 'll send her off to - morrow , '' said Guest , firmly .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 39]: As he walked down the steps again he was smouldering with fury , with an impulse to walk into the theatre , denounce the adventurers to their faces , and bear Cornelia away to a place of safety .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 26]: For all her assurance , events had proved that she was neither capable of taking care of herself , nor of choosing her own companions .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 37]: She had been led away by impulse , like other girls ; he liked her the more , not the less , for the discovery , and his heart softened at the thought of her disillusion .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 9]: No use to worry her to - night !
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 54]: Let her have a good night 's rest , and to-morrow morning , bright and early , he would go round to the hotel , when Mr and Mrs Schuter , or Moffatt , or whatever their name happened to be , would once more find their quarters too hot to hold them !
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 46]: On returning to the hotel that evening , Mr Moffatt announced that he and his wife had business on hand next morning , which would necessitate an early breakfast , and that once again they would be obliged to leave Cornelia to her own resources .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 31]: He suggested , however , that they should all meet at Paddington Station at two o'clock , whence they could take train to Maidenhead for an afternoon on the river .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 30]: Cornelia hailed the prospect with delight , and mentally dedicated the morning to doing a picture-gallery , and to choosing a suitable present for her aunt and Elma Ramsden .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 34]: Aunt Soph should have lace ; something soft , and smooth , and womanly , to take the place of the prickly steel trimmings which seemed to constitute her one idea of adornment .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 12]: Elma , dear thing , what should be chosen for her ?
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 45]: Not clothes ; it would not be good taste to offer another gift of the kind ; a piece of jewellery would be best ; something good and quiet , and unobtrusive , suitable for the wear of `` a nice young girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 27]: Cornelia chuckled to herself in prospective enjoyment next morning , as she repaired to the private sitting-room of the suite , where breakfast was invariably served .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 16]: Her host and hostess had already risen from the table and were dressed for walking .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 18]: Mrs Moffatt stood before the window looking down into the street with a pale and worried expression .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 27]: Her husband was scribbling at a side table , but jumped up at Cornelia 's entrance , as if he had been anxiously awaiting her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 8]: `` Ah , good-morning , Miss Briskett !
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 15]: We are just off , but I wanted to settle up with you first .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 9]: Here 's the cheque , with many thanks !
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 16]: Perhaps you will kindly look over it , to see it is all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 17]: `` Oh , Mr Moffatt , you should not have troubled when you were so hustled .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 8]: It 's too good of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 27]: cried Cornelia , eagerly , her heart warming to the little man for a promptitude in money matters which reminded her of her own beloved Poppar .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 9]: `` Of course it 's all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 16]: She cast a casual glance over the cheque , and broke into a surprised laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 7]: `` It is n't , though !
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 7]: You 've paid me too much !
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 16]: I guess I 'm not a usurer , to want interest for a single night .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 10]: It was only two hundred that I lent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 8]: Mr Moffatt gave an exclamation of irritation .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 13]: `` And I have made it out for two hundred and fifty !
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 4]: How very annoying !
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 16]: I have advised it to the bank , too , and sent off the letter .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 14]: I wanted to get through with as much business as possible this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 7]: The more hurry the less speed !
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 15]: Why on earth could you not give me the right figures , Gertrude ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 21]: He turned upon his wife with an expression of querulous anger , which she treated with her usual cool disdain .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 24]: `` I _ did _ tell you , Silas -- but , for the land 's sake , do n't make a fuss !
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 30]: It 's simple enough , Cornelia can give me the change in notes , and it will do to pay up one or two odd accounts before we leave .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 15]: You wo n't mind , dear , I know ; and , see here !
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 16]: I 'm fairly rattled this morning , and I want you to help me through .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 25]: I 've written out a list of errands that ought to be done right away , as soon as you 've gotten through breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 16]: The particulars are down on this list , and I 'd be for ever obliged .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 26]: You ought to get through before one , if you start soon , so meet me at Buzzard 's and we 'll have lunch together .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 27]: In case I should be late , do n't wait , but just order for yourself , and allow half an hour to get to Paddington .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 21]: If I 'm delayed , I 'll go straight there , and look out for you on our platform . ''
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 7]: `` That 'll be all right .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 11]: I 'll stay till you come , '' Cornelia assented .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 22]: She had already opened the gold chain bag which hung by her side , and was smoothing-out a roll of notes .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 18]: `` Two fives , two tens ; I guess that 's all I can do this morning !
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 9]: I 'll give you the rest to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 12]: `` Oh , my , yes ; there 's no hurry .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 9]: Thank you , dear ; much obliged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 14]: said Mrs Moffatt , lightly , but her expression altered as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 11]: Cornelia wondered if she were imagining a look of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 31]: It _ must _ be imagination , for of what importance were a trumpery hundred dollars to a woman who daily squandered many times the amount on her own adornment !
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 32]: After the Moffatts had departed , Cornelia ate her breakfast , and set out in a hansom to accomplish Mrs Moffatt 's commissions before proceeding to shop on her own account .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 63]: She handed the driver the list of addresses which she was asked to visit in town , and wondered at his expression of astonishment ; but she wondered no longer as they traversed mile after mile of dreary roadways , to find on arriving at the first destination that as great a distance still separated it from the second on the list .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 70]: The commissions themselves were trivial and unimportant , at which Cornelia was not surprised after her personal experience of Mrs Moffatt 's shopping eccentricities , but when she had wasted a couple of hours driving to and fro for no tangible result , she waxed impatient , determined that she had done enough for the honour of friendship , and that Mrs Moffatt could herself finish the remaining transactions .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 42]: She therefore directed the driver to take her to the jeweller 's shop in Bond Street where she had made her previous purchases , and anticipated a pleasant half hour choosing an ornament which would commend itself to Elma 's approval .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 27]: The partner in the firm welcomed her with his usual empressement , mingled with a certain surprise for which she was at a loss to account .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 46]: Although a keen tradesman , pearl brooches and bangles seemed this morning too trivial matters to engross his attention ; he had the air of waiting momentarily to discuss a more important subject , and presently introduced it himself , unable to be longer silent .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 16]: `` I despatched a messenger to the hotel an hour ago with the emerald necklace !
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 23]: Mrs Moffatt informed him that you were not in at the moment , but would be able to see him at tea-time .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 12]: She was probably unaware that you intended to call yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 6]: `` Yes , she was .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 7]: It does n't matter a mite .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 24]: So long as she was there , it 's all right , '' Cornelia replied , turning over the tray of ornaments absently .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 39]: It seemed odd that Mrs Moffatt should have returned to the hotel after representing that she was obliged to be absent all morning , but no doubt some engagement had fallen through which she had intended to keep .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 27]: She had lifted a brooch in her hands and turned towards the window to examine the colour of the pearls , when the jeweller spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 42]: `` We were delighted to receive your agreement to take the necklace , for , as Mrs Moffatt had definitely decided that it was beyond her figure , we were on the point of sending it over to our Paris house .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 20]: I am sure Mr Briskett will not regret this purchase when he sees the quality of the stones . ''
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 38]: Cornelia stood stock-still , staring hard at the little pearl brooch , a hundred vague doubts and dreads which had previously been resolutely thrust aside , darting back into her mind with a new and terrible significance .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 16]: She felt stunned and bewildered , but the predominant sensation was the necessity for caution .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 14]: She must be certain of what had happened before she presumed to judge .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 35]: She rallied all her self - possession , and was surprised at the natural sound of her own voice as she replied -- `` What makes you speak of my father , Mr Marchant ?
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 16]: Did I mention to you at any time that he was fond of emeralds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 22]: `` I believe you did on one occasion , but it was your reference this morning to which I alluded . ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 14]: Mr Marchant drew out his pocket-book and selected one letter from the contents .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 8]: `` This is it , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 27]: You say -- ` I have just received a cable permission from my father , Mr Edward B Briskett , to purchase the emerald necklace . '
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 14]: I was referring to this quotation , rather than any casual remark . ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 29]: Cornelia leant over the counter and read the words with her own eyes ; saw the signature of her own name written below in Mrs Moffatt 's handwriting .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 6]: `` Why , of course !
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 3]: I forgot .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 13]: I never do remember what I write , '' she said calmly .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 14]: She was sure now ; there was no longer any reason for doubt !
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 44]: The everlasting shopping expeditions ; the purchase of a succession of worthless trifles ; the exploiting of her own wealth , had all been designed to create a confidence which would prepare the way for such a _ coup _ as the present .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 23]: And this morning she had been deliberately decoyed out of the way , while the last scene of the comedy was enacted .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 27]: The messages were plainly a ruse , while the different rendezvous would have provided a further detention , allowing the conspirators plenty of time to decamp .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 10]: Once opened , Cornelia 's eyes were wonderfully keen .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 28]: She understood now why the goods which it was inconvenient to harbour in a hotel had been constantly despatched to the keeping of `` a friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 32]: She realised that she had been cheated -- doubly cheated -- in first giving a cheque for two hundred pounds , and afterwards in counting out change for a worthless return .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 10]: `` I need never fancy myself again after this !
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 11]: I 'm just the greenest peach on the wall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 23]: she told herself furiously , but through all the anger and shock , the necessity for caution remained predominant in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 10]: Mr Marchant must not suspect that anything was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 14]: Even now , at the eleventh hour , the fraud might be prevented .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 30]: She must get back to the hotel at once ; see Mrs Moffatt and reason with her , argue with her , command her to hand over the jewels !
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 15]: The woman was not all bad , and life had gone hardly with her .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 6]: She should have another chance !
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 41]: Cornelia waived aside all thought of responsibility toward the jeweller himself , by the easy decision to pay for the necklace if necessary , but a sudden feeling of helplessness weighed upon her at the prospect of the interview ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 11]: Suppose Mr Moffatt were at the hotel with his wife !
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 39]: Then there would be two to one , and once the outer veneer was broken through , there was no saying to what extremes of abuse , of threatening , even of violence itself , they might descend .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 28]: Cornelia recalled the two faces ; the woman 's hard , sullen , coarse ; the man 's mean and crafty , and shuddered at the prospect .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 18]: All at once the thought of Guest occurred , to bring with it a wave of relief .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 29]: Guest had begged her to summon him if at any time he should be needed ; now the need had arisen , and he should help her through .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 16]: She hastily selected a pearl bangle and laid it on one side on the counter .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 7]: `` I will decide on that !
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 17]: Let your man bring it round at five o'clock , and ask to see me personally .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 19]: He can bring a bill made out for all I owe , and I 'll settle at once .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 12]: And , Mr Marchant , I want to use your telephone !
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 16]: Can you ring and have me switched on to the Army and Navy Club ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 37]: While the preliminary operations were going on at the telephone , Cornelia racked her brain to think of a suitable rendezvous , and failing a better suggestion , decided on a tea-shop exactly across the road .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 48]: To her immense relief , Guest was found at his club , and announced that he would be with her in ten minutes ' time , so that there was nothing to do but to dismiss the hansom , and secure a table in a quiet corner .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 22]: The time seemed long , but in reality it was less than ten minutes before Guest seated himself by her side .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 29]: He looked grave and stern ; preoccupied almost to the point of discourtesy , for the ordinary greetings were exchanged for a succession of short , eager questions .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 9]: `` Where have you been all the morning ?
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 8]: Have you been back to the hotel ?
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 7]: Did you get my message ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 5]: `` I did not !
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 9]: I 've been out since about half-past nine .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 6]: What was the message about ?
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 4]: Anything important ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 13]: `` Tell me first what you wanted me for just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 10]: Cornelia paused for a moment and her lips trembled .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 18]: She clasped her hands together and leant across the little table , staring earnestly into his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 9]: `` Captain Guest , I 'm in trouble !
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 22]: I 've a pretty good opinion of myself as a rule , but -- I ke n't see it through alone !
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 15]: ... It 's going to be one of the meanest businesses you ever touched .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 7]: ... Will you help me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 5]: `` I will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 5]: said Guest , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 7]: `` Thank you for asking me .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 16]: Is it -- excuse my asking -- anything in connection with Mr and Mrs Moffatt ?
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 3]: Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 23]: as the girl exclaimed in sharp surprise , `` I fancied that last night 's meeting might bring things to a crisis .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 23]: Now , I 'll tell you just what happened in that box , and then you must tell me your story . ''
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 19]: For the next ten minutes they sat with heads bent close together , exchanging confidences of grave import .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 17]: Cornelia kept nothing back , and as he listened , Guest 's face grew momentarily sterner .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 22]: The hastily ordered meal lay neglected on the table while they faced the desperate situation with which they had to deal .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 54]: Guest took a man 's cut-and-dried view of the case , and was strongly in favour of apprising Mr Marchant of what had happened and returning to the hotel , supported not only by him , but by a police officer into the bargain , but Cornelia would not be induced to agree .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 40]: `` She 's done wrong , and she forged my name for her own purposes -- there 's no getting away from that , but there may be some explanation which will make it look a little less black .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 26]: Anyway , I 'm going to hear it before I judge , and if she 'll make things good I 'll give her another chance .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 11]: You do n't know what 's come before this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 16]: `` I should have little difficulty in guessing , however , '' Guest said drily .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 83]: He thought of the hotel in Marienbad ; of the changed name ; the dyed hair ; and mentally conjured up the dreary life of plotting and scheming , of constant danger , and miserable success , which constitutes the life of the professional adventurer , but Cornelia saw only the haggard face which had looked at her in the sitting-room of the hotel , the face of the woman whose childhood had known no home , whom love had passed by .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 34]: She heard again the hopeless intonation of the voice which had reminded her -- `` You 'd have to tread the same road yourself , before you could judge me , Cornelia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 35]: Her chin squared with the look of stubborn determination which her aunt already knew so well , and she said firmly -- `` Well , anyway , I 've got to see her first !
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 22]: If you do n't approve , I 'll go alone , but I 'd like best to have you there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 7]: `` Of course I 'll come .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 7]: There 's no question about that .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 26]: We had better get off at once , then , and not waste any more time , but first you must have something to eat !
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 14]: You 've been driving about all morning , and there 's trouble ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 9]: I 'll ring for something hot and tempting .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 7]: What would you like best ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 14]: `` I could n't swallow a bite if you paid me for it .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 8]: It would stick in my throat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 9]: `` Have a glass of wine , then !
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 11]: I 'm not going to stir till you have something .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 6]: You look tired out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 6]: `` I never touch wine .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 10]: I think perhaps I could drink some cor-fee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 15]: Cornelia said doubtfully , and Guest 's stern face suddenly lightened into a smile .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 3]: `` Coffee !
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 8]: The worst thing possible for your nerves .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 5]: You funny little girl !
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 17]: You have not the smallest glimmering of an idea how to take care of yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 22]: To his surprise and alarm , two big tears brimmed up suddenly in Cornelia 's eyes , and her lips quivered .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 9]: `` Do n't be good to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 5]: she whispered sharply . ''
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 5]: _ Do n't _ !
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 7]: For two straws I 'll howl !
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 6]: I 'm all worked up .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 18]: Take me out , out into the street , quick , before I make a scene ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 6]: Guest needed no second bidding .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 41]: In an incredibly short time the untasted meal was paid for , a hansom summoned , and he was driving once more through the streets by Cornelia 's side , while she mopped her eyes with a minute pocket-handkerchief . ''
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 14]: _ You _ have n't lived with her for days at a time .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 13]: ... _ You _ have n't thought of her as a friend .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 16]: ... _ You _ have n't had her nurse you , when you were sick !
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 9]: ... '' `` Thank heaven for that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 5]: ejaculated Guest , devoutly .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 52]: It was ridiculous to indulge in sentiment in connection with a thief and a forger ; the woman deserved no mercy , and would receive none , if he had his way ; none the less was he charmed by Cornelia 's emotion , by her pity , her amazing inconsistency .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 37]: Gone were her airs of complacency and independence ; at the first threatening of danger the pretty pretence was broken up ; weak , trembling , tearful , she summoned her natural protector to her side !
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 10]: Guest 's heart swelled with a passion of tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 41]: In his immaculate frock-coat , freshly-creased trousers , and irreproachable silk hat , he was as truly a knight-errant at that moment as any mailed warrior of old , going forth to fight a tourney for his lady 's favour .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 6]: `` Do n't cry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 4]: he cried eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 23]: `` Look here , you know , if you want me to let her down lightly , you must pull yourself together .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 6]: I ca n't stand this .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 15]: If you cry any more -- I 'll -- _ kill her _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 11]: Cornelia swallowed dismally , blinking the tears from her eyelids .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 40]: `` I do n't know as it would n't be the best way out , as far as she 's concerned , but I 'd just as lief you did n't _ all _ turn criminals on my hands !
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 24]: I 'll pull myself up once we are there , but I 'm all of a flutter thinking it over in advance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 14]: `` We 'll be there soon now , '' Guest told her reassuringly .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 19]: They drove in silence down the length of Bond Street , and out into the whirl of Piccadilly .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 23]: Soon , almost too soon for Cornelia 's jangled nerves , they had drawn up before the great door of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 9]: Here nothing of a sensational nature had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 30]: The porter touched his cap to Cornelia with his usual stolid air , the clerk bowed with unruffled complacence -- no hint of trouble had come to their ears .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 11]: The lift was full of a laughing , chattering crowd .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 33]: It seemed to Cornelia almost incredible that these women were repairing to their rooms to deck themselves for fresh pleasures , while she was about to bring a prisoner to the bar .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 32]: She turned towards Guest , as he stood by her side , and felt a fresh sense of comfort in his nearness , his bigness , his air of quiet strength .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 46]: On the second floor the lift discharged half its occupants -- a merry flock for the most part , hurrying along the corridor , laughing and jesting as they went , while two followed gravely behind , looking to right and left with anxious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 10]: The door of Mrs Moffatt 's bedroom was closed .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 22]: Was it already deserted -- its drawers and wardrobes despoiled of their treasures ; a bundle of worthless trifles left behind ?
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 21]: -- Cornelia 's heart beat in sickening throbs ; she knew a coward wish that she might be too late .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 23]: To pay up and go quietly home seemed an easy way out of the difficulty into which she had walked so blindly !
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 19]: She drew a quick , frightened breath , and felt Guest 's hand press protectingly on her arm .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 14]: The sitting-room door opened , and side by side they entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 13]: Mrs Moffatt was standing before the table , tearing up old papers .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 51]: She looked up with a start , to see Guest and Cornelia standing before her in that eloquent , linked attitude , and over her features there passed that helpless , trapped expression of guilt discovered and brought to bay , which , once seen , can never be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 40]: The blood ebbed from her face , leaving it ashen white , except for two fixed spots of colour on either cheek ; her fingers relaxed their hold , and the fragments of paper fluttered downward to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 6]: There was a ghastly silence .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 44]: It was Guest who was the first to speak , standing straight and stern at the opposite side of the table , and at the sound of his opening words the wretched woman trembled violently , and sank on a chair for support .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 4]: `` Mrs Schuter !
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 28]: I have come here with Miss Briskett to ask your explanation of a letter sent in her name to Mr Marchant , the jeweller , this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 31]: She has seen the letter , with the forged signature at the end , and has heard that the necklace was brought to this hotel , and delivered to you .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 10]: May I trouble you to hand it over ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 21]: Each word was sharp and cutting as an icicle , and Guest 's steel-like eyes were alight with remorseless anger .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 13]: Cornelia turned her head aside , unable to endure the pitiful spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 8]: Mrs Moffatt stammered out a broken subterfuge .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 4]: `` What necklace ?
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 12]: I do n't know -- I do n't -- understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 30]: Even as she spoke , one trembling hand twitched upward , to be as quickly lowered , but not before Guest had pounced upon the clue with swift intuition .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 6]: `` You understand very well !
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 17]: As a matter of fact , you are wearing it at this moment beneath your dress .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 15]: Will you kindly take it off , and put it on the table ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 16]: He turned aside as he spoke , paying this small tribute to her womanly feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 45]: A strangled sob broke the silence ; the sound of laboured breathing , then a faint , clicking sound , and he looked round to see a dazzle of light on a corner of the table , where the sunbeams had found a plaything .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 17]: A bauble of green and white stones , for which a woman had sold her soul .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 14]: Cornelia was leaning against the mantelpiece , her face hidden in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 21]: Guest realised that it was her sob which he had heard , and the knowledge did not soften his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 5]: `` Thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 10]: he said in the same tone of cutting politeness .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 19]: `` That is so much to the good , but I shall have to trouble you still further .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 28]: There was two hundred pounds lent to you yesterday , ostensibly to be paid to a furrier , that , of course , was a mere excuse !
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 9]: -- and thirty pounds in bank-notes this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 38]: I fear the first sum is gone beyond recall , since your husband 's cheque is probably not worth the paper on which it is written , but I take it that the notes are still intact .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 19]: As you prefer someone else to pay your bills , you will have kept them for personal use .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 11]: They are probably in your pocket at this moment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 24]: `` I have not got the cheque -- I could not return it if I would , '' said Mrs Moffatt , hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 19]: `` My husband cashed it as soon as the bank was open , and left London shortly after .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 5]: He has the money .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 9]: I have not had a cent of it .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 7]: The notes are in my purse .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 13]: He left them so that I should be able to follow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 4]: `` Just so .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 20]: You will please return them to Miss Briskett , and we will deal with the other sum later on .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 32]: Your intention was to leave the hotel for good this morning , and you provided Miss Briskett with commissions to keep her out of the way while you made your preparations .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 10]: That is the case , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 31]: The woman did not answer , but looked across the room towards where Cornelia stood ; and Cornelia parted her hands and looked back at her in pitiful inquiry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 16]: _ Did _ you mean to run away , and leave me here alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 8]: Mrs Moffatt bent her head in shame .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 13]: Her face was not white now , but deep , burning red .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 14]: `` We knew -- after last night -- that the game was up .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 27]: We _ had _ to go , Cornelia -- or -- '' `` Be kind enough not to address Miss Briskett by her Christian name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 5]: interrupted Guest , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 23]: It seemed to him an impossible humiliation that this woman should still dare to address the girl in the language of friendship .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 11]: `` Let us get to the end of this business .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 25]: I presume there are other bills , which will come in , in due course ; bills for goods ordered in other forged notes .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 7]: Am I right in supposing this ?
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 11]: It is your best plan to speak the truth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 4]: `` Y-es ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 8]: `` There _ are _ more bills !
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 11]: Can you give me an approximate idea of their amount ?
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 9]: Fifty pounds , one hundred , two hundred ?
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 6]: What is the amount ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 7]: `` About -- one hundred . ''
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 6]: `` And the hotel expenses !
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 22]: Miss Briskett suspects from the manner of the officials that you were thoughtful enough to take these rooms in her name .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 11]: Again I ask you , is that the case ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 39]: A bend of the head gave assent , and Guest wheeled round with a gesture of intense indignation , took a few rapid strides up and down the room , then halted again by Mrs Moffatt 's side .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 31]: `` And , not content with cheating and plotting to desert this young girl , whom you professed to befriend , how many of her personal possessions have you stolen ?
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 26]: You had free access to her room -- have you taken advantage of her absence this morning to rob her of her private belongings ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 17]: Two exclamations , of denial , of dismay , and reproach , sounded in his ears .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 10]: Innocent and guilty alike regarded him with indignant eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 17]: To the mysterious feminine reasoning it appeared there were different degrees in the crime of theft .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 23]: To pay a debt by means of a worthless cheque was evidently less reprehensible than to pilfer a brooch from a dressing-table .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 11]: Guest knew himself condemned before he heard the simultaneous replies .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 10]: `` Captain Guest , how _ can _ you !
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 7]: She would never do that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 7]: `` Indeed , you are mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 14]: I 'm bad enough , but I have not fallen quite so low .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 8]: I have not touched a thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 7]: `` You must excuse my denseness .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 15]: I fail to see how one theft is so much worse than the other .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 34]: I am sorry to seem intrusive , Miss Briskett , but I have taken a certain responsibility upon myself , and I must be satisfied on this point before we go any further .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 23]: Will you take Mrs Schuter with you to your room while you carefully check your possessions , and get back your bank-notes .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 9]: I will wait here till you return . ''
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 32]: For a moment Cornelia appeared on the point of refusing , but she changed her mind , and without a word led the way down the corridor towards her own bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 49]: Her dressing-case stood on a table by the window ; she stood over it uncertainly , as if still debating with herself whether she should or should not obey Guest 's command , and as she did so Mrs Moffatt 's voice broke the silence -- `` Cornelia !
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 32]: -- there 's not a mite of reason why you should take my word , but I tell you straight I have n't laid a finger on one of your things .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 14]: You ken look as well as not , but it 's wasting time .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 14]: The thirty pounds is in my purse , ready for you to take .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 10]: When it comes to the last Silas takes fright .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 10]: There 's no need to tell any more lies .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 39]: We have lived by this sort of thing for years past , but as soon as he scents danger in the air , he makes off to a place of safety , and leaves me to finish up .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 17]: You wo n't find him , however hard you search , but I 'm right here .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 13]: ... What are you going to do with me , Cornelia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 8]: Cornelia drew a sharp , sobbing breath .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 10]: `` Oh , why did you do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 4]: she cried wildly .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 7]: `` Why did you do it ?
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 10]: You laid a plot for me from the start .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 61]: I was rich , and -- and _ green _ , so you fussed over me , and acted like a friend , and invited me up here , for nothing but to bleed me -- to get as much out of me as you could , and then leave me to face it out alone in a strange place .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 11]: I was your own countrywoman , and I trusted you .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 21]: Had n't you got a spark of loyalty left , that you could act so -- _ mean _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 9]: Mrs Moffatt put her hand to her throat .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 12]: Her voice seemed paralysed ; husky , disjointed , and feeble .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 13]: It 's all gone ; loyalty , faith , everything that matters .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 9]: There 's nothing left but _ this _ !
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 31]: You 'd not believe me if I said I was fond of you , Cornelia , but it 's the solid truth , though I robbed you all the same .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 12]: I _ plotted _ to rob you , as you say !
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 12]: You had plenty of money , and we were cleaned out .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 17]: I meant to get away with that necklace , and sell the stones on the Continent .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 11]: There are people there who will buy without asking questions .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 14]: I 've got to know them pretty well during the last few years .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 10]: ... Cornelia , what are you going to do ?
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 10]: Is Mr Marchant sending to arrest me here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 10]: `` He does n't know that anything is wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 16]: I managed to keep quiet , and let him believe I knew all about it .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 13]: To the last I kept hoping that there was some way out .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 17]: Captain Guest wanted to bring an officer along , but I would n't do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 6]: `` That was like you !
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 18]: You wanted I should have a chance , but it 's all true ; every one thing !
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 22]: There 's more true than you know of -- other bills to come in , a big sum run up here .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 19]: You can give back the necklace , but even so , it is going to be heavy enough .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 12]: ... Cornelia , _ what are you going to do _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 31]: I 'm a bad woman -- are you going to send me to prison , to have a chance of growing worse , among other bad women like myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 13]: Cornelia threw out her arms with a sudden , reckless gesture . ''
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 5]: _ No _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 9]: she cried strongly , `` I 'm not !
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 19]: I 'm going to let you go ; I 'm going to _ help _ you to go .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 18]: Captain Guest 's a pretty hard man ; I guess you 'd better not see him again .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 32]: Keep those notes -- you 'll need some money to help along , and march out of the hotel right now , and lose yourself as fast as ever you can .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 33]: You can have ten minutes to do it , while I wait here , and as much longer as I can keep him quiet ; but you 've got to be slippy .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 8]: ... You shall have your chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 18]: Mrs Moffatt gasped for breath , her face twitched convulsively , and she tottered as she stood .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 5]: `` You mean that ?
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 9]: Oh , God bless you , Cornelia Briskett !
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 19]: If there are any blessings going , there 's no one on earth deserves them more than you .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 7]: You 've saved me this time .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 14]: Whatever happens in the future , you 've given me a chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 19]: `` That 's so , but the question is , _ are you going to take it _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 3]: See here !
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 11]: let 's strike a bargain over this before you go !
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 22]: You are a clever woman , or you would n't have escaped so long , but the game is played out .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 22]: It is n't safe to go on , when any moment you may be recognised by people you have fooled before .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 20]: You 're bound to make a fresh start -- why should n't you try being straight for a change ?
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 11]: You 'd find it would pay better in the end .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 28]: You 've got to think , when you leave this to-day , that a girl 's whim is all there is between you and a prison cell .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 13]: That ought to be a pretty bracing remembrance , I should say .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 23]: ... Start away with the money you have in hand , and see if you ke n't make some more for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 5]: There 's another thing !
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 25]: You can write to me in a year from now , and tell me where you are , and what you have been about .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 31]: I 'll ferret into every single thing , and if it 's _ straight _ , I 'll help you again ; I 'll go _ on _ helping you !
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 14]: You need never say after this that you cheat because you 're obliged .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 19]: Live straight , and work hard , and I 'll see to it that you do n't want .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 6]: You 've got your chance !
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 9]: ... I guess you 'd better scoot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 16]: Mrs Moffatt stood before her , trembling and abject ; overcome with a pitiful emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 5]: `` I 'm going !
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 15]: Could you , could you kiss me , Cornelia , before I go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 6]: Cornelia drew herself up proudly .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 7]: `` No , I guess not !
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 9]: We 'll leave that over for another time .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 10]: Some day , perhaps , when you 're straight .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 16]: ... You 'd best not waste any more time ... '' `` I 'm going .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 6]: I ca n't thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 13]: I swear to you -- '' `` No , do n't swear !
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 7]: I do n't want any promises .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 11]: Promise _ yourself _ ; that 's the best thing .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 4]: ... Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 7]: `` Good-bye , Cornelia Briskett ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 7]: The door opened , and shut .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 15]: Cornelia listened with bated breath , but all was silent from the corridor without .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 16]: She leant her head on the dressing-table , and burst into a passion of tears .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 43]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Captain Guest paced up and down the sitting-room for a quarter of an hour , casting impatient glances at the clock , and pausing now and then to lift the emerald necklace from the table and examine it with wondering curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 30]: It was a pretty enough plaything , but from his point of view it seemed a preposterous waste of money to sink a cool thousand pounds on its purchase .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 27]: He mentally ran over the various necessary repairs on his own property , which could be completed for the sum , and shrugged his shoulders expressively .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 30]: Still , women liked such playthings , and if one were specially interested in a woman -LRB- a woman , say , to whom emeralds were specially becoming ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 15]: , there would be a certain satisfaction in seeing her wearing the pretty things .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 24]: It was conceivable that the pleasure so given might even be as keen as that derived from a new chimney-stack or a barn !
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 25]: A vision rose before him ; a vision of a ruddy head and snowy shoulders , on which the green light flashed and waned .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 30]: He saw Cornelia , as she had appeared , sitting in the front row of the stalls at the theatre , and mentally clasped the necklace round her throat .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 4]: The door opened .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 16]: He thrust the vision aside , and wheeled round quickly , reassuming his sternest expression .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 43]: A dejected little girl stood on the threshold , with dishevelled locks and tear-stained eyes , and as he stared in amazement , she quietly closed the door , and collapsed in a limp little heap on the corner of the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 8]: `` I 've -- come back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 7]: `` Where 's Mrs Moffatt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 19]: `` She 's '' -- the voice broke in a strangled sob -- '' _ gone _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 7]: `` Gone _ where _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 4]: `` Gone away .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 4]: Ten minutes ago .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 10]: She 's ever so far off by now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 10]: Guest stood still , transfixed with anger and astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 13]: `` Do you mean to say that she escaped before your eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 3]: What happened ?
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 10]: Did you leave her alone in your room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 9]: `` No ; I told her to go .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 5]: I sent her away .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 9]: It was my suggestion from the start . ''
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 11]: `` You -- told -- her -- to go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 10]: Guest 's face was a study of outraged wrath .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 40]: `` After all she has done ; after the deliberate way in which she has cheated and deceived you ; after the lies she has told ; after her thefts , -- hundreds of pounds still to pay up !
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 24]: after intending to desert you in this hotel , you mean to tell me seriously that you _ sent _ her away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 15]: The tousled head nodded dumbly ; two big tears trickled down the reddened cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 11]: `` Are you aware that you have compounded a felony ?
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 21]: If Mr Marchant heard what you had done , he could accuse you of being a partner in the crime .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 33]: Do you know that you have broken the law of the country , and that I could give you in charge at this moment , if I wished to do so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 7]: `` I guess that 's so .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 9]: -- Are you going to do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 5]: `` That 's ridiculous !
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 15]: You know it is , but -- '' `` Then you 're another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 8]: cried Cornelia , laughing through her tears .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 15]: `` You 're as bad as I am , so you ca n't preach !
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 13]: She 's gone anyway , and I 'm -- _ glad _ !
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 22]: We got the necklace , and for the rest , I 'll just have to pay up , and look pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 13]: Poppar says you 've got to pay for experience in this world .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 19]: I 'll tell him I concluded I 'd better learn it pretty thoroughly , once I 'd started .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 6]: He wo n't mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 24]: `` Your father must be a wealthy man if he can afford to lose four or five hundred pounds without feeling annoyed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 15]: Cornelia looked at him quickly , and replied in a tone of studied indifference .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 11]: `` Oh , he 's flush enough at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 9]: Likely enough we shall be paupers next year .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 10]: Do n't be angry with me , Captain Guest .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 11]: I simply _ had _ to give her a chance !
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 26]: I can afford to pay up , and if I 'd sent her to prison it would have killed the last little mite of self-respect .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 18]: I trusted her instead , and I believe that 's going to help more than any punishment .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 6]: It would _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 20]: She 's had a good old fright , and maybe this will be the turning-point in her life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 8]: Guest 's lips curled in eloquent disbelief .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 20]: He paced slowly up and down the room , then stationed himself once more in front of the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 16]: `` Did you look over your things to see that they were all right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 10]: ... She said she had n't touched them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 10]: `` Did you make her return the notes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 14]: `` No , I -- I guessed she 'd need them herself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 5]: `` How extremely considerate !
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 19]: Did n't you feel it necessary to offer her a little more , while you were about it ?
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 20]: To give her another twenty pounds , say , to make up the full change for the cheque ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 38]: The face that peered up at him was at once so abashed , so discomfited , so childlike in its humility , that his anger melted before it , and gave place to a wave of tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 9]: `` You ridiculous , high-flown , little girl !
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 14]: Who would have believed that all your shrewd commonsense would collapse like this !
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 12]: I 'm not angry , I sha n't scold any more .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 13]: The thing 's done now , and you 've had enough worry .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 13]: I 'm going to ring the bell , and order some luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 15]: We will have it here together , and comfort ourselves after all this excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 9]: I 'm hungry enough , whatever you are !
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 5]: What shall it be ?
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 17]: You are going to treat me , you know , so it must be something good .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 3]: Roast chicken !
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 14]: That 's what ladies generally prefer , and some sweets , and fruit .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 9]: Claret for me , and what for you ?
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 13]: Is it to be -- ` corfee ' -- once more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 33]: He went to the door to give the order to the waiter , accompanied by a tip which had the effect of producing the meal in an extraordinarily short space of time .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 37]: Cornelia 's appearance being still distinctly dishevelled , Guest dismissed the waiter and himself took the head of the table , carving the chicken , handing the vegetable dishes , and even pouring out the coffee .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 37]: If they had been a honeymoon couple the intimacy of the scene could not have been greater , but in that case he would have taken his wife in his arms and kissed away her tears .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 7]: Poor , little , red-eyed girl !
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 19]: There was precious little beauty about her at the moment , yet she had never appeared more attractive .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 9]: `` I ke n't eat a bite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 27]: was Cornelia 's first melancholy statement , but when one wing of the chicken had disappeared from her plate -- `` It 's mighty good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 12]: she said , and promptly set to work on a second .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 20]: She drank copious draughts of coffee , began to revive in spirits , and experience qualms concerning her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 3]: `` Say !
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 8]: do I look a perfect freak ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 12]: `` You look much better than you did ten minutes since .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 24]: In another ten minutes you will look quite like yourself , if you obey my orders , and eat a good meal . ''
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 4]: Cornelia shrugged expressively .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 7]: `` I know what that means !
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 9]: I guess I 'm ugly enough to kill .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 17]: That 's why I hate to cry -- it musses one up so for hours after .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 12]: ... Captain Guest , what am I going to do next ?
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 18]: Can I settle up , and get away to Norton this afternoon , do you suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 6]: `` I am afraid not .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 23]: The last train leaves at three o'clock , and that does not give enough time for all that has to be done .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 21]: I was wondering whether my aunt -- whether you would consent to sleep at her house to - night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 4]: `` Suttenly not !
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 4]: Why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 33]: It wo n't be the first time by a good many that I 've stayed a night by myself in a hotel , and there 's no reason why I should move .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 28]: I 'll have my meals up in this room , if it will ease you any , but I wo n't leave this place till to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 21]: Then I 'll go back , '' she laughed feebly , `` to The Nook , and humble pie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 21]: `` You need not tell your aunt what has happened , if you do n't choose to do so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 10]: `` Oh , yes ; I 'll own up !
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 11]: Aunt Soph will be pleased to feel she was right .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 14]: Maybe she 'll like me better when I 'm down on my luck .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 9]: ... What must I set about first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 34]: `` I shall interview the hotel manager , and tell him the whole story -- that 's due to him , you know , or there might be a repetition of the offence .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 20]: Then there 's the jeweller -- he must be warned in the same way , and the necklace returned .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 11]: I presume you do n't want to keep it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 3]: Cornelia shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 5]: `` Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 6]: I could never wear it .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 15]: But when Poppar comes over I 'll make him buy me something else instead .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 6]: Mr Marchant sha n't lose !
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 16]: I guess I 'd better drive there straight away , and then to the bank .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 11]: I 'll have to arrange for a pretty big draft .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 18]: ... You never know how things are going to pan out in this world , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 21]: I thought I was going to spend this afternoon on the river , gliding about so sweet and peaceful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 9]: Guest flushed , hesitated , and -- plunged !
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 10]: `` Why should n't we go all the same ?
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 10]: We can finish our business and still have time .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 22]: If you will allow me , I 'll take great care of you and bring you home before it 's dark .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 16]: It would be too dreary sitting up here by yourself , all the evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 12]: Cornelia sprang to her feet , clapping her hands with delight .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 4]: `` How lovely !
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 3]: How lovely !
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 7]: You 're just the nicest thing !
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 10]: It 's sweet of you to think of it !
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 34]: Go right away now , and get through with your interview , and I 'll join you in the lounge as soon as I 've prinked , and gotten my face into order .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 15]: I 'll hang my head out of the window , and massage my nose .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 15]: ... Let 's go and be happy , and forget all our woes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 19]: She ran to the door , waved her hand gaily over her shoulder , and disappeared from sight .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 43]: When Guest drove round to the hotel next morning to escort Cornelia to the station , she was surprised to see his own bag on the roof , and to hear that he intended to accompany her all the way to Norton .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 22]: `` I want to make sure that you are safely housed once more , '' he explained as they drove off .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 35]: `` I feel a certain responsibility for you , and I think perhaps your aunt would like to see me , and hear from a second person that everything is satisfactorily settled here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 23]: `` My aunt , '' said Cornelia , demurely , `` my aunt is n't a mite disposed to acknowledge your responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 8]: She thinks you 're ` dashing ' !
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 9]: She do n't approve of dashing young men .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 9]: She warned me specially to avoid you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 3]: `` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 5]: dashing , am I ?
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 14]: The word has an Early Victorian sound that suggests side-whiskers and leg-of-mutton trousers .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 12]: I 'm not at all sure that I 'm flattered ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 27]: returned Guest , as he alternately stared out of the window , and busied himself in arranging the bags on the front seat of the cab .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 31]: There was an air of embarrassment in his manner this morning , and he talked against time , as if anxious not to let the conversation come to a pause .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 31]: The afternoon on the river had been a delightful experience , abundantly proving the truth of his prophecy that it would be impossible to be bored in Cornelia 's society .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 56]: She had looked very sweet in her softened mood , and as they drifted down the stream together , had prattled away in simple , confiding fashion , telling him the story of her life ; of the ups and downs which she and her Poppar had known together ; of her own individual adventures .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 27]: He learnt that she was not engaged , and had never been in love , though there were always heaps of admirers `` prancing '' round .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 9]: She intended to marry some day , however .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 4]: Why , suttenly !
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 11]: Just as soon as ever the right man hove along .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 25]: What was the good of being a woman , if you did n't have your own home , and your own husband and children !
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 20]: Then she looked at him with her clear , golden eyes , and inquired how it was with himself .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 5]: Was he in love ?
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 19]: answered Guest , but , even as he spoke , he knew in his heart that he lied .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 29]: In the guise of a Yankee stranger , who embodied in herself all the traits which he most condemned , the one woman of his life had appeared .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 13]: He loved -- and the woman whom he loved was Cornelia Briskett !
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 6]: After that , conversation languished .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 32]: Guest was too much bewildered by the sudden realisation of his position to wish to talk , and Cornelia had developed a headache as a result of the morning 's emotion .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 26]: She was glad to be quiet ; to allow herself to be led about , and cared for , and told what she must do .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 11]: `` Just like a ` nice young girl ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 14]: she said , laughingly as they parted in the lounge of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 24]: `` If I lived over here long enough -- there 's no telling -- I might grow into a Moss Rose myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 6]: `` I wish you would !
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 5]: I wish you would !
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 6]: Wo n't you try ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 4]: Guest cried eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 27]: He , himself , did not know what he really meant by the inquiry , for the words had sprung to his lips almost without thought .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 15]: He was as much startled by the sound of them as was Cornelia herself .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 32]: He saw the dismay in her eyes , the dawning comprehension ; he saw something else also -- the first flicker of self-consciousness , the first tell-tale droop of the lids .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 24]: She put him off with a light answer , and he went out to pace the streets until the night closed around him .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 16]: ... What was this that had happened , and what was it going to mean ?
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 26]: One week -- a week to the day since he had first met this girl and conceived a violent dislike to her on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 42]: Voice , accent , and manner had alike jarred on his nerves : she had appeared in every respect the opposite to the decorous , soft-voiced , highly-bred , if somewhat inane , damsel who represented his ideal of feminine charm .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 4]: One week ago !
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 25]: What magic did she possess , this little red-haired , white-faced girl , to make such short work of the scruples of a lifetime ?
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 32]: What was this mysterious feminine charm which blinded his senses to everything but just herself , and the dearness of her , and the longing to have her for his own ?
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 25]: The jarring element had not disappeared , the difference of thought still existed , but for the moment he was oblivious of their existence .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 21]: For the first time in his three-and-thirty years he was in love , and had room for no other thought .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 6]: The morning brought colder reflections .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 22]: When -- supposing he ever married , it would be wormwood and gall to see his wife condemned by his friends !
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 56]: He had looked forward to espousing the daughter of some irreproachable county family , and returning to his old home to live in frugal state for the rest of his life ; driving to church in the old barouche , attending a succession of dull , country-house dinners ; taking the chair at village meetings .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 67]: He tried to imagine Cornelia spending long , peaceful years as the squire 's wife , contentedly pottering about the village , superintending Dorcas meetings , and finding recreation in occasional garden parties , where the same people met the same people , attired in the same frocks , and sat meekly in rows , drinking claret cup and sour lemonade , but the effort failed .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 9]: Cornelia obstinately refused to fit into the niche .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 38]: He could summon up a vision of her , indeed , but it was a disconcerting vision , in which she `` pranced round , '' while the neighbourhood turned its back , and pursed disapproving lips .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 41]: He was attracted by the girl -- seriously attracted , _ but _ -- It was a great big _ but _ , and he promised himself to be cautious , to think long and well before taking the plunge .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 14]: All the same , it seemed imperative that he should return to Norton .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 30]: His aunt was always delighted to put him up , and he could not be happy until he had satisfied himself that all was well with Cornelia once more .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 15]: Incidentally also , he was interested to know what was happening at the Manor .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 35]: On the journey to Norton the presence of fellow-travellers kept the conversation necessarily impersonal , and at the station Cornelia dismissed her escort , refusing point blank to drive with him to the Park .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 26]: `` I 'm going back as a sorrowing penitent , and it do n't suit the part to drive up with a dashing young man .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 17]: There are only two players in this act , and they are Aunt Soph and myself .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 15]: You come round in the evening , when I 've paved the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 7]: `` Till to-night , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 7]: said Guest , raising his hat .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 29]: Once again , as he looked at her through the window of the cab , the clear eyes wavered before his own ; once again his scruples vanished .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 13]: He loved , and the world held nothing but that glad fact .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 11]: Cornelia exhibited much diplomacy in her interview with her aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 33]: Seated at the good lady 's feet in an attitude of childlike humility , she related the story of her adventures in simple , unexaggerated language , without any attempt at self-justification .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 22]: `` I ought to have guessed from the start ; but it seems I 'm not as smart as I thought .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 9]: They had me , the whole way through .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 12]: You were right , you see , and I was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 7]: I should have taken your advice .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 10]: Guess it will be a lesson to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 11]: `` I trust it may prove so , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 8]: a dearly-bought , but invaluable lesson ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 6]: quoth Miss Briskett , blandly .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 35]: So far from being incensed , she actually purred with satisfaction , for had not the truant returned home in a humble and tractable spirit , ready to acknowledge and apologise for her error ?
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 23]: Her good humour was such that she bore the shock of hearing of Guest 's role in the drama with comparative composure .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 69]: `` He seems , '' she declared , `` to have comported himself with considerable judgment , but , my dear Cornelia , if anything more were needed to demonstrate the necessity for caution and restraint in the future , it must surely be the remembrance that you were driven into such intimate relationship with a man whose acquaintance you had made but a few short days before !
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 18]: It seems to me that the recollection must be painfully embarrassing to any nice young girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 7]: `` Yes , ` um ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 5]: said Cornelia , meekly .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 14]: She lowered her eyelids , and her cheeks flushed to a vivid pink .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 37]: Such a typical picture did she make of a modest and abashed young girl , that the spinster 's stern face relaxed into a smile , and she laid her hand affectionately upon the ruddy locks .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 2]: there !
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 36]: We will say no more about it -- '' ` Repentance is to leave The sins we loved before ; And show that we in earnest grieve By doing so _ no more _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 13]: `` Another time you will be guided by wiser counsels ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 16]: ... Have you missed me , Aunt Soph , while I 've been away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 17]: `` Er -- the house has seemed very quiet , '' replied Miss Briskett , truthfully .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 30]: `` I am sorry that I am obliged to leave you this afternoon , my dear , but I have promised to attend a committee meeting at four o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 22]: You will be glad to rest after your journey , and to unpack and get your things put neatly away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 7]: `` Has Elma come home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 6]: `` She returned yesterday morning .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 14]: I saw the dog-cart from the Manor waiting outside the gate this morning .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 16]: Mrs Ramsden told me the other day that Elma 's health was completely restored . ''
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 19]: Cornelia pondered over these scanty items of news as she sat at her solitary tea an hour later .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 9]: Elma was well ; Elma had returned home .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 18]: A dog-cart from the Manor had been observed waiting outside the gate of The Holt that morning .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 3]: A dog-cart !
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 19]: Imagination failed to picture the picturesque figure of Madame perched on the high seat of that undignified vehicle .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 21]: If the cart had not conveyed the mother , it must , in all probability , have conveyed the son .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 8]: The dog-cart had been _ waiting _ !
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 9]: The deduction was obvious to the meanest intellect .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 24]: Geoffrey Greville had driven down to see Elma the morning after her departure , and had spent a considerable time in her society !
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 33]: Suddenly Cornelia realised that her anxiety could brook no delay , and that it would be impossible to spend another night without discovering how the Moss Rose had fared during her absence .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 69]: She despatched Mary to The Holt with a verbal message to the effect that she had returned from town , and , if convenient , would much like to see Miss Ramsden for a few minutes before six o'clock , and while she was still at tea the answer was received ; a note this time , written in pencil , and bearing marks of haste and agitation .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 10]: `` Dearest Cornelia , -- Yes , of course !
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 9]: I _ am _ thankful you are back .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 7]: Come right up to my room .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 12]: It 's perfectly wretched here , but I 'm so happy !
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 3]: Elma . ''
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 15]: Cornelia rolled her eyes to the ceiling , and indulged in an expressive whistle .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 19]: Contradictory as Elma 's epistle might have appeared to an ordinary reader , she understood it readily enough .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 26]: It was Mrs Ramsden who was wretched , Elma who was happy -- '' _ so _ happy , '' despite the atmosphere of disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 5]: The crisis had arrived !
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 28]: In five minutes ' time , Cornelia was in her friend 's room , holding her hands , gazing into her face , kissing her flaming cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 8]: `` Elma , _ is _ it ?
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 3]: It is !
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 8]: I can see it in your face !
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 6]: Oh , you dear thing !
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 2]: When ?
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 2]: How ?
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 6]: I 'm crazy to know .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 7]: Tell me every single thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 11]: Elma laughed ; a delicious little laugh of conscious happiness .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 8]: `` Yes , yes , it is !
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 9]: Oh , Cornelia , is n't it wonderful ?
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 6]: I ca n't believe it !
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 34]: It 's partly your doing , you know , and I love you for that , but does n't it seem impossible that he can really care for -- _ me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 23]: She turned her exquisite , flower-like face towards her friend , with an expression of humility as sweet as it was sincere .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 15]: `` He might have had anybody , and he chooses -- _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 17]: Oh , Cornelia , I never knew that one could live , and be so happy !
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 7]: It seems like a dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 12]: `` Wake up , then , and get down to facts !
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 9]: I 'm crazy to hear all about it .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 6]: When was it settled ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 5]: `` This morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 5]: `` Only this morning !
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 11]: I calculated it would come off Monday at latest . ''
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 7]: `` No , it did n't .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 36]: Of course he was very -- I mean , I knew -- we both understood , but Geoffrey says he could n't possibly have spoken plainly while I was a guest under his own roof .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 9]: It would n't have been the right thing .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 11]: He was obliged to wait till I got home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 3]: `` My !
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 3]: how mediaeval .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 21]: I should have thought Geoffrey Greville had more snap to him , than to hang on to such worn-out notions .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 15]: Fancy letting you go away , and driving down in cold blood next morning !
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 7]: It 's the dullest thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 9]: `` It 's not dull at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 5]: contradicted Elma , hotly .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 11]: `` It 's noble , and manly , and self-sacrificing .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 26]: I love him for it -- '' ` I could not love thee , dear , so much Loved I not honour more ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 4]: `` Shucks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 5]: sniffed Cornelia , scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 18]: `` I 'd as lief have a little less high-falutin ' , and a lot more push .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 42]: I would n't mind if it was his house ten times over , I 'd want him to feel he could n't wait another five minutes , and settle it off , so 's we could have a good time together .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 29]: If he let me come away , not knowing if he were in fun or earnest , I 'd have led him a pretty dance for his pains .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 19]: But you 're so meek ; I bet you dropped into his mouth like a ripe plum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 9]: Elma drew herself up with a charming dignity .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 22]: `` I told him the truth without any pretences , if that is what you mean , '' she said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 22]: `` I am perfectly satisfied with Geoffrey 's behaviour , and I 'd rather not discuss it , Cornelia , please .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 32]: We may seem old - fashioned to you , but we understand each other , and there is not a thing -- not a single thing -- I would wish altered .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 8]: I am perfectly , utterly happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 20]: `` Bless you , you sweet thing , I see you are , and I 'm happy for you !
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 18]: Never mind how it happened ; it _ has _ happened , and that 's good enough .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 9]: ... How 's Mrs Ramsden bearing up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 5]: Elma 's face fell .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 18]: For a person who had just proclaimed herself completely happy , she looked astonishingly worried and perturbed .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 10]: `` Oh , my dear , such a scene !
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 28]: I took Geoffrey in to see her , and she could n't have been more horrified if he had been the most desperate character in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 8]: She refused to listen to a word .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 18]: You would not have recognised mother , she was so haughty and distant , and -- rude !
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 8]: Some things she said were horribly rude .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 7]: After he went , she cried !
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 7]: That was the worst of all .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 29]: She cried , and said she had given her whole life for me for twenty-three years , and was I going to break her heart as a reward ?
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 25]: I cried , too , and said , No , I should love her more , not less , but she would n't listen .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 26]: She said if I married Geoffrey it would be as bad as a public refutation of all the principles which I had professed since childhood .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 11]: Then she called him names , and I got angry .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 28]: We did n't speak a word all through lunch , and as soon as it was over she sent for a fly to drive to the Manor .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 6]: She 's there still ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 12]: `` Shut up with Madame , hatching the plan of campaign !
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 12]: Madame wo n't like it any better , I suppose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 4]: Elma flushed miserably .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 10]: `` No ; she 's against us , too !
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 16]: Geoffrey told her what he was coming for , and -- is n't it curious ?
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 6]: -- she was quite surprised !
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 16]: She had not suspected a bit , and I 'm afraid she was pretty cross .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 19]: Geoffrey would n't let me say it , but I know she does n't think me good enough .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 9]: I 'm not ; that 's quite true .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 20]: No one knows it better than I. '' `` If you say that again , I 'll shake you !
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 14]: You 're a heap too good for the best man that ever lived .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 17]: Mind now , Elma , do n't start out on this business by eating humble pie !
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 28]: You 've got to hold up your end of the stick for all you 're worth , and let them see you wo n't be sat upon .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 42]: When you feel redooced , go and sit in front of the glass for a spell , and ask yourself if he wo n't be a lucky man to have that vista across the table all the rest of his life .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 12]: Do n't be humble with _ him _ , whatever happens !
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 13]: Make him believe he 's got the pick of the bundle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 7]: `` He -- he does ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 7]: said Elma , and blushed again .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 21]: `` It makes me ashamed to hear him talk about me , for I know I am really so different .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 18]: He would not have thought me so sweet if he had heard me scolding mother this morning .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 3]: Poor mother !
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 8]: I 'm so terribly sorry for her .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 27]: It must be hard to care for a child for twenty-three years , as she says , and then have to step aside for a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 18]: I sympathised with every word she said , and knew that I should have felt the same .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 34]: My head was with her all the time , but my heart '' -- she clasped her hands to her side with the prettiest of gestures -- `` my heart was with Geoffrey !
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 17]: Reason 's not a bit of use , Cornelia , when you 're in love . ''
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 26]: said Cornelia , firmly , `` my heart 's got to wait and behave itself , until my head goes along at the same pace .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 19]: I 've not kept it in order for twenty-three years to have it weaken at the last moment .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 13]: I 'll stick to my guns , whatever it may cost . ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 8]: Elma looked at her with surprised curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 17]: `` Why , you talk as if , as if you were in love , too !
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 7]: I wish you _ were _ !
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 9]: We could sympathise with each other so beautifully .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 9]: _ Are _ you in love , Cornelia ?
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 7]: You never said so before . ''
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 16]: Cornelia turned to the window and gazed out on the forbidden grass of the Park .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 21]: Her face was hidden from view , and she answered by another question , put in slow , thoughtful tones .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 6]: -- `` What is love ?
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 13]: You seem to feel pretty certain that yours is the genuine article .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 5]: Define it for me !
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 14]: How do you feel when you are in dear Geoffrey 's society ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 3]: `` Happy !
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 11]: so wonderfully happy that I seem to walk on air .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 19]: Everything seems beautiful , and I love everybody , and long to make them as happy as myself .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 6]: Nothing troubles me any more .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 12]: It seems as if nothing could _ ever _ trouble me .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 4]: Geoffrey 's there !
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 17]: He is like a great big rock , which will shelter me all my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 51]: `` Do you feel one moment that it 's the cutest thing in the world to sit right there in the shade and be fussed over , and the next as if you wanted to knock the rock down _ flat _ , and march away down your own road ?
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 18]: Do you feel blissful one moment and the next all worked up , and fit to scratch ?
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 30]: When he 's kinder big and superior , and the natural protector , do you feel ugly ; or inclined to cave in , and honour and obey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 9]: Elma stared at her with shocked blue eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 9]: `` Of _ course _ I 'll obey !
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 7]: Geoffrey is so wise and clever .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 20]: He knows so much better than I. I 'm only too thankful to let him decide for us both .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 25]: You talk so strangely , Cornelia ; I do n't understand -- '' Cornelia swung round quickly , and kissed her upon the cheek .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 7]: `` Never mind , sweetling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 13]: she said fondly , `` do n't _ try _ to understand !
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 8]: You are better off as you are .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 20]: It is women like you who have the best time in the world , and are the most loved .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 20]: I wish I were like you , but I 'm not , so what 's the use of repining .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 9]: I am as I wor ' created ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 13]: She laughed , but the laugh had a forced , unnatural sound .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 13]: Elma saw with dismay a glimmer of tears in the golden eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 20]: For a whole week the battle raged ; the battle between youth and age , love and the world .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 72]: Elma pleaded for patience and self-restraint , Geoffrey urged defiance and independence ; Mrs Ramsden quoted Scripture , and made constant reference to serpents ' teeth , while Madame remained charmingly satirical , refusing to treat the matter otherwise than as a joke , laughing at Geoffrey 's rhapsodies , and assuring him that he was suffering from an attack of sun , from which recovery would be swift and certain .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 29]: Rupert Guest and Cornelia hurried to and fro on the outskirts of the fray , in the character of aides-de-camp carrying messages , and administering encouragement and consolation .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 25]: Every morning Cornelia sat in conclave with her friend in the prosaic Victorian drawing-room which took the place of the turret chamber of romance .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 50]: Elma would not condescend to hold stolen interviews with her lover , while both families so strongly opposed the engagement , so she shut herself up in the house , growing daily whiter and thinner , wandering aimlessly from room to room , and crying helplessly upon her bed .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 42]: It was as a breath of fresh mountain air when Cornelia appeared upon the scene , bearing always the same terse , practical advice -- `` Make sure of your own mind , and -- _ stick _ to it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 19]: The colour came back to Elma 's face as she listened , and hope revived in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 29]: She declared anew that nothing in the world should separate her from Geoffrey ; that she would be true to him to the last day of her life .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 42]: Cornelia repeated these touching vows in conclave with Guest behind the shrubbery of the Park , and then he went off post-haste to the Manor , to cheer Geoffrey with the news of the steadfast loyalty of his _ fiancee _ .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 39]: Second-hand assurances soon pall , however , on the youthful lover , and after a week had passed by , Geoffrey suddenly waxed desperate , and announced that he would not submit to the separation for another hour .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 23]: He was perfectly capable of choosing his own wife , Elma was of age , and at liberty to decide for herself .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 23]: He would go down to The Holt that very afternoon and have it out with the old lady , once for all .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 13]: If his mother liked to accompany him , so much the better .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 19]: She and Mrs Ramsden could each have their say , and then he and Elma would have theirs .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 27]: For his part he warned them that no arguments could move him from his point , but they might see what they would do with Elma !
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 10]: Perhaps they could persuade Elma to give him up !
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 39]: He smiled as he spoke , in proud , self-confident fashion , but Madame looked at him thoughtfully , smoothed the ruffles on her sleeves , and replied in her sweetest tones -- `` Dear boy , yes !
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 5]: quite a good idea .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 9]: Let us talk it over like sensible people .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 7]: Elma has such truly nice feelings .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 11]: -- I feel sure we may trust her decision ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 54]: Geoffrey sat him down forthwith to indite a letter to his love , warning her of the ordeal ahead in a couple of lines , and enlarging on his own devotion for the rest of the sheet , which missive was entrusted to Guest when he paid his daily visit to the Manor .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 21]: `` I mean to put an end to this nonsense , once for all , '' the Squire declared firmly .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 29]: `` You must be sick of trotting to and fro with these everlasting messages , but there wo n't be any more need for them after to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 17]: Guest expressed his gratification , and started forth on his return journey profoundly depressed in spirit .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 21]: With the end of the strife would end his daily meetings with Cornelia , which alone kept him in Norton .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 23]: Miss Briskett 's attitude on the occasion of his one call at The Nook had not encouraged him to repeat the experiment .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 82]: He smiled to himself whenever he recalled the picture of the heavily-furnished room , the sharp-faced spinster , with her stiff , repellent manner , and the slim figure of Cornelia sitting demurely in the background , drooping her eyes to the ground whenever her aunt looked in her direction , and wrinkling her nose at him in pert little grimaces when the good lady 's back was turned , so that he had had hard work to preserve his gravity .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 60]: Since that evening they had met daily in the shrubbery of the Park , though only for a few minutes at a time , for Cornelia steadily refused to sit down , or to linger by his side in a manner which would suggest that the assignation was on her behalf , as well as that of her friend .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 30]: Guest was always the first to arrive at the meeting-place , and was careful to remain standing in a position from which he could watch the girl 's approach .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 32]: In these bright summer days Cornelia was invariably dressed in white , her short skirts standing out above her feet in a manner peculiar to herself , and the fashion plates .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 26]: She wore shady hats which dipped over her face , and curved upward at the sides , showing the burnished waves of her wonderful hair .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 38]: At first sight she gave the impression of looking pale and ill , but invariably by the time she reached his side , her cheeks were pink , and he forgot his anxiety in delight and admiration .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 18]: To-day his manner was less buoyant than usual , as he delivered the note into her hands .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 6]: `` An ultimatum at last !
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 11]: Geoffrey and Madame propose to storm the citadel this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 5]: Quite time , too !
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 8]: I wonder he has waited so long .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 11]: I should have come to blows on the second day .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 19]: ... Fancy hanging about a whole week when a girl like that was waiting to see you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 17]: Cornelia turned the letter round and round , staring at it the while with absent eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 49]: `` You used to say that he would never marry her ... that she was not a suitable wife ... that it would be a great mistake if he did ... '' `` I used to say a great many foolish things , '' said Guest , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 14]: `` I did n't know what I was talking about , you see .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 4]: Now I do !
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 16]: If she is the woman he loves , all the little differences go for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 40]: I hope he will marry her , and I believe that they will be happy -- '' Cornelia twirled to and fro on the heels of her pointed shoes , and tilted her chin with a pretence at indifference .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 15]: I guess it wo n't help things on if I hang about gossiping here .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 19]: She ought to have this letter at once , to think out what she 's going to say .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 4]: Poor little Elma !
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 19]: She 'll have a rough time with those two mammas firing away at her at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 12]: Mrs Ramsden will plump for principle , and Madame for convention .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 15]: It does n't seem to either of _ them _ that love is enough !
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 20]: They both believe they know a heap better what 's good for the young people than they do themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 9]: _ And they 've been through it _ !
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 8]: You ca n't get away from that .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 38]: ... They 've been through it , and away at the other end they are going to do all they know to prevent their own son and their own daughter from the folly of marrying for love !
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 19]: ... '' `` People -- some people -- seem to keep no memory of youth in middle age !
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 11]: It 's a pity , for it destroys their influence .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 14]: In the end , however , it is the young people who decide .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 19]: ... These two ought to know their own minds , for it has not been a hurried affair .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 16]: They have known each other for years , and have been more and more attracted .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 31]: That is a duty which a man and a woman owe to each other in these circumstances -- to make sure that what they are offering is real and lasting !
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 8]: I suppose only time can prove this .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 10]: ... We shall see what this afternoon brings forth .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 9]: In any case I am needed no longer .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 16]: -- I thought of going north to-morrow morning to pay a couple of visits . ''
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 24]: The hand that was playing with the letter was still for a moment , and an almost imperceptible quiver straightened the white figure .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 30]: For a moment Guest saw , or imagined that he saw , a shadow flit across the girl 's face , but it passed as quickly as it came .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 16]: She tilted her head , and said calmly -- `` I guess you 're right !
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 16]: We 've done our turn , and now they 've got to fend for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 10]: I hope you 'll have a real good time .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 14]: ... Mr Greville will let you know when the wedding 's fixed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 27]: `` Oh , I shall be back at the end of three or four weeks , before there 's any talk of dates , I expect !
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 9]: I shall see you again in July . ''
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 11]: He paused , looking at her with sudden uneasy suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 8]: `` You will be here in July ?
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 14]: There is no chance that you may be away paying other visits ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 5]: Cornelia shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 9]: `` I have no other relations over here .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 21]: So far as I know at present , I shall stay on here until Poppar comes over to fetch me .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 16]: We 're going to fly round together for two or three months after that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 53]: Guest drew a sigh of relief , but as he took Cornelia 's outstretched hand in his own to say good-bye , he added a hesitating request -- `` If for any unexpected reason you should be leaving Norton during the next three or four weeks , will you let me know ?
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 10]: A line to my club will always be forwarded .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 26]: If there were any uncertainty about seeing you again , I -- '' his voice lost its level tone , and became husky and disconnected .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 7]: `` These visits do n't matter .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 7]: -- I could put them off .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 24]: -- I am _ making _ myself go , because ... '' His fingers tightened over hers in involuntary appeal , `` Cornelia !
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 12]: I wonder if you understand what is in my mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 12]: She looked into his kindled face with serious , unwavering eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 28]: For a moment it appeared as if she had some difficulty in managing her voice , but when she spoke it was calm and self-possessed as ever .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 40]: `` I understand that you 've been a real true friend to me , Captain Guest , and I 'm grateful for all the good times we 've had together ... That 's all we need worry about to-day .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 4]: Elma is waiting !
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 7]: I must n't keep her longer .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 4]: ... Good-bye again !
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 9]: I wish you a real pleasant time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 20]: She drew her hand from his , gently enough , yet with a determination which could not be opposed .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 34]: In her voice there was the same note of finality ; the composure of her pale , fixed look checked the words on Guest 's lips , and left him chilled and wondering .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 8]: `` For three weeks , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 12]: he murmured softly , but no echoing assurance came in reply .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 28]: Cornelia carried the all-important message to Elma in her den , cheered her with affectionate prophecies , and hurried back to the shelter of her own bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 32]: Safe behind locked doors she stood before the mirror on her dressing-table , staring at her own reflection with the implacable air of a judge regarding a prisoner at the bar .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 28]: The slight figure was held proudly erect , the lips set in a straight , hard line , but the eyes -- poor tell-tale woman 's eyes !
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 17]: -- the eyes wavered , and on the white cheeks flamed two patches of rosy red .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 30]: Cornelia turned on her heel , and , crossing the room to her writing-table , tore open a letter which lay there already addressed to her father in America .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 27]: It was a long , cheerfully-written epistle , containing constant references to his coming , and to the good time which they were to enjoy together .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 17]: With deliberate fingers she tore it in pieces and dropped the fragments into the waste-paper basket .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 22]: The missive , which was written in its stead was short , and to the point -- `` My old Poppar !
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 18]: -- This is just a business note that has got to be attended to in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 12]: Well-brought-up-parents do what they 're told , and ask no questions .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 7]: There are breakers ahead over here .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 23]: They do n't concern Aunt Soph ; I 've broken the back of that worry , and we get along a treat .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 5]: Heart trouble , daddy !
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 14]: Symptoms unfavourable , and ultimate collapse preventable only by speedy change of scene .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 22]: `` Sit down straight away and write a letter I can show round , summoning me home by the first boat !
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 10]: You can call it an ` urgent crisis . '
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 16]: It 's as true as taxes , though not in the way they take it .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 15]: I 've got to run , and that 's all there is to it .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 8]: Our jaunt must wait till another day .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 12]: You must comfort me , Poppar , -- you and America !
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 7]: -- Your lonesome , Cornelia . ''
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 33]: She did not pause to read over what she had written , but , fastening it in an envelope , pealed the bell , which brought Mary running blithely to her service .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 16]: For once , however , the devoted slave ventured to raise a feeble objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 7]: _ Now _ , Miss Cornelia ?
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 9]: I 'm in the middle of my silver .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 15]: It will go just as soon if it 's posted by half-past three ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 12]: Cornelia glanced at her with the air of an offended goddess .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 12]: `` I said now , and I _ mean _ now !
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 10]: This instant , before you touch another one thing .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 19]: Post it with your own hands , and come up here to tell me it 's done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 38]: Mary vanished in a whirl of starched cotton skirts , rushed to the pillar-box at the corner of the Park , and in five minutes ' time was back at the bedroom door to proclaim her obedience .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 11]: Cornelia was still standing in the middle of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 25]: It appeared to the maid that she had not altered her position by as much as an inch since she had seen her last .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 7]: Her expression was tense with expectation .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 7]: `` It 's gone , miss !
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 7]: I put it in myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 7]: The golden eyes regarded her strangely .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 7]: `` Did you , Mury ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 5]: said Cornelia , low .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 19]: She paused a moment as though to form some expression of acknowledgment , but it did not come .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 35]: `` Some time , '' she continued slowly , `` some time , Mury , I believe I 'm going to thank you very much , but to-day I do n't feel like gushing .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 10]: ... You can go back to your work . ''
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 10]: `` I suppose I must give them tea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 18]: was Mrs Ramsden 's comment upon hearing of the visit which had been planned for the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 27]: Her depression was broken by a struggling sense of elation , for it was not every day that Madame deigned to accept hospitality from her neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 57]: She despatched a messenger to the confectioner 's to purchase a pound of plum cake , a muffin , and half a pound of macaroons , the invariable preparations under such circumstances , and gave instructions that the best silver and china should be brought out of their hiding-places , with the finest tablecloth and d'oyleys .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 23]: At three o'clock Elma discovered her removing the covers from the drawing-room cushions , and folding them neatly away in the chiffonnier .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 31]: Something in the simple action touched the girl , and broke down the hard wall of reserve which had risen between her mother and herself during the past painful week .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 16]: She stretched out impulsive arms , and stooped her head to kiss the troubled face .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 6]: `` You funny little mother !
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 5]: What do cushions matter ?
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 42]: Geoffrey will never notice them , and Madame '' -- she hesitated , unwilling to hurt her mother 's feelings by hinting at Madame 's opinion of the satin splendours so carefully preserved from sight -- `` Madame wo n't care !
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 10]: ... She is not coming to admire fancy-work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 32]: Mrs Ramsden lifted a flushed , tear-stained face to look at her daughter standing before her , lovely and slender in the blue muslin gown which had been Cornelia 's gift .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 25]: The daintiness of the dress , its unaccustomed smartness and air of fashion , seemed at the moment a presage of the threatened separation .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 25]: At the sight , and the sound of the softened voice , the tears streamed afresh , and she cried brokenly -- `` Elma !
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 2]: Elma !
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 3]: My child !
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 10]: I beg you at the eleventh hour -- think !
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 2]: consider !
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 10]: remember all that I have striven to teach you !
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 27]: ... You have prayed to resist temptation -- what is the use of your prayers if they do n't avail you in your hour of need ?
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 9]: Elma , I know it will be hard !
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 16]: Do n't think I shall not suffer with you -- but if it is right .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 18]: ... There is no happiness , my child , if we depart from the right course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 13]: `` I know it , mother , '' said Elma , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 23]: `` If you or Madame can convince me that I should be doing wrong in marrying Geoffrey I will give him up !
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 30]: I promise you that , and you must promise me in return that you will try to see things from our point of view as well as your own .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 17]: Remember , it 's my life that is at stake , and I 'm so young !
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 10]: I may have such a long time to live .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 22]: Some girls have a dozen fancies before they are twenty - three , but I have never thought of anyone else .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 20]: ... From the first time that I met Geoffrey I knew that he was the one man for me .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 9]: You have been happily married yourself , mother !
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 9]: Could you bear to spoil our happiness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 28]: Mrs Ramsden winced at the sound of that significant little pronoun , which now , for the first time in twenty-three years , failed to include herself .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 46]: Now she was an outsider , for her child 's heart and life alike had passed from her keeping : It is a bitter moment for all mothers ; doubly bitter when , as to Mrs Ramsden , the supplanter seems unworthy of his trust .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 8]: `` Happiness is not everything , Elma !
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 23]: I hope , -- I hope I am strong enough to endure even to see you suffer for your ultimate good . ''
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 24]: She mopped her eyes with her handkerchief , while Elma turned aside , realising sadly that it was useless to prolong the discussion .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 15]: Presently Geoffrey and his mother would arrive and then they would all consult together .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 46]: Elma had not rehearsed her own share in the conversation ; the all-important decision was in the last issue to be left to herself , and she had spoken the simple truth in saying that she wished above all things to do what was right .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 22]: Her life 's training had instilled the conviction that no happiness was possible at the cost of a sacrifice of principle .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 44]: If she could be once convinced that it was wrong to marry Geoffrey Greville , she would give him up as unflinchingly as any martyr of old walked to the stake , but she must be convinced on the ground of principle alone !
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 24]: Pride , prejudice , convention , would pass her by , leaving her unshaken in her determination to marry the man she loved .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 49]: At four o'clock the great landau from the Manor drove up to the gate , and from within the shrouded windows mother and daughter watched the groom jump lightly from his seat , to shield the grey froth of Madame 's draperies as she stepped to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 74]: To Mrs Ramsden the scene was an eloquent illustration of the world , the flesh and the devil ; the world exemplified by the carriage with its handsome trappings , its valuable horses , and liveried attendants ; the flesh by Madame -- a picture of elegance in cloudy grey draperies , her silvery locks surmounted by a flower-wreathed toque , her cheeks faintly pink beneath the old lace veil -- the devil !
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 52]: -- it was a hard word to apply to the handsome , resolute young fellow who followed his mother up the gravel path , but at the moment Geoffrey Greville appeared in Mrs Ramsden 's eyes as the destroyer of her happiness , the serpent who had brought discord into Eden !
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 24]: She was in truth an honest little Puritan in whose sight the good things of the world were but as snares and pitfalls .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 54]: So far from feeling any pleasure in the thought that her daughter might one day reign as the great lady of the neighbourhood , the prospect filled her with unaffected dread , and the needle 's eye had been quoted almost as frequently as the serpent 's teeth , during the last week .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 12]: She turned away from the window with a shudder of distress .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 25]: The door opened , and Madame entered , bringing with her that faint , delicious fragrance of violets which seemed inseparable from her person .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 21]: Contrary to her hostess 's expectation , she was wreathed in smiles , and even more gracious than of yore .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 45]: She pressed the plump little hand extended towards her , kissed Elma on the cheek , exclaimed prettily upon the comfort of the chair to which she was escorted , and chatted about the weather as if her coming were an ordinary society call .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 36]: Mrs Ramsden , being unaccustomed to the ways of fashionable warfare , was flurried and thrown off her balance by so unexpected an opening to the fray , and had hard work to answer connectedly .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 36]: She was , moreover , keenly on the alert to watch the meeting between Elma and Geoffrey , whom she had not seen in each other 's company since the fatal visit to the Manor .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 31]: They shook hands without speaking a word , but their eyes met , and at the sight of that look , the onlooker thrilled with a memory of long ago .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 15]: That glance , that silent hand-grasp softened her heart more than a hundred arguments .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 14]: It was an ocular demonstration of what had until now been merely words !
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 23]: The trim maid brought in the tea-tray and proceeded to set it out on the little table in front of her mistress .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 44]: It was a good hour earlier than the time when the meal was served at the Manor , but the little business of handing round cups and cake broke the embarrassment of the first few minutes , and was therefore welcome to all .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 35]: Elma began as usual to wait upon her guests , but Geoffrey took the plates out of her hand with an air of gentle authority , which the elder ladies were quick to note .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 23]: It was the air of the master , the proprietor ; as significant in its way as was Elma 's blushing obedience .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 27]: Once again Mrs Ramsden felt a pang of remembrance , but Madame arched her eyebrows , and tapped her foot on the floor in noiseless irritation .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 11]: It was time that this nonsense came to an end !
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 18]: `` Well , dear people , '' she began airily , `` let us get to business !
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 17]: It 's so much wiser to talk things over quietly , when there is any misunderstanding .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 13]: I thought it was so clever of Geoffrey to suggest this meeting .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 5]: Letters are quite useless .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 34]: One always forgets the most important things , or , if one remembers , they look so horribly disagreeable in black and white , and people bring them up against one years afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 14]: Dear Elma , I 'm afraid you think me a cruel old woman !
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 40]: I am desolated to appear so unfeeling , especially as I should certainly have fallen in love with you in Geoffrey 's place , but it 's not always a question of doing what we like in this world .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 11]: I am sure your dear mother has taught you that .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 36]: I said to Geoffrey : ` Elma has such sweet , true feelings , I shall be quite satisfied to trust to her decision when the matter has been put fully before her ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 10]: `` Thank you , '' said Elma , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 20]: She had put down her cup , and now sat with her fingers clasped tightly together on her lap .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 52]: The two elder ladies faced her from the opposite side of the room ; Geoffrey fidgeted about , and finally seated himself -- not by her side , as had obviously been his first impulse -- but some little distance away , where he could watch the expression of her face .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 17]: Mrs Ramsden pushed the tea-table aside , and fidgeted with the jet trimming on her cuff .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 24]: `` I -- er , I think we should get on better if Mr Greville would -- would kindly leave us alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 4]: she said awkwardly .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 25]: `` We are well acquainted with his arguments , and as Elma is to decide , there seems no object in his staying on .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 16]: Elma will , no doubt , feel quieter and less restrained without his presence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 15]: Madame 's murmur of agreement was interrupted by a sharp exclamation from her son .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 24]: He looked flushed and angry , but Elma checked him in his turn , and answered herself , in clear , decided accents !
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 5]: `` No , mother !
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 10]: I shall feel much better if Geoffrey is here .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 8]: I do n't want him to go .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 20]: If I am persuaded to give him up , it is only right that he should know my reasons .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 30]: He will promise to listen quietly to what you have to say , as I am going to do , and not to interrupt until you have done . ''
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 10]: She turned towards her lover with a flickering smile .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 8]: `` Wo n't you , Geoffrey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 9]: Geoffrey bit his moustache , and scowled heavily .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 9]: `` I 'll -- do my best ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 4]: he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 10]: `` I 'm not going away in any case .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 18]: It 's preposterous to suppose that I could be absent while such a discussion was going on .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 14]: Elma knows that this is a matter of life and death to me .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 20]: If you persuade her to give me up , it will be sending me straight to the devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 8]: Mrs Ramsden 's eyes flashed with anger .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 36]: `` If an earthly love is the only incentive you have to follow the paths of righteousness , Mr Greville , that is a poor inducement to me to give my child into your care !
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 12]: I have brought her up to put principle first of all .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 18]: It is my chief objection to yourself that your character is not worthy of the trust ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 11]: `` My dear lady , he is not a pickpocket !
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 19]: You speak as if he were a hardened criminal , '' cried Madame , with an irritated laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 30]: `` Geoffrey may not be a saint , but I assure you that , considered as a young man of the world , he is quite a model specimen !
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 7]: He has been an excellent son .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 12]: There have been no debts ; no troubles of any kind .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 14]: Absolutely , at times I have accused him of being almost too staid .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 8]: ... One can only be young once !
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 22]: ... '' `` I think you and Mrs Ramsden have somewhat different standards , mother , '' put in Geoffrey quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 15]: He turned towards the last-mentioned lady , bending forward and speaking with deliberate emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 18]: `` I quite agree with you , Mrs Ramsden , that I am unworthy of your daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 12]: I wish I had been a better man for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 18]: With her to help me I hope I might become a man more after your own heart .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 44]: As my mother says , I have so far been a respectable member of society , for the things which you condemn in me are after all matters of opinion , but at this moment I stand at the parting of the ways .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 26]: If you give me Elma , I shall look upon her as a sacred trust , and shall be a better man for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 13]: I _ must _ be a better man with her beside me !
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 24]: ... If you refuse ; if she refuses '' -- he shrugged expressively -- `` you empty my life of all I value .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 9]: The responsibility will be upon your shoulders ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 6]: `` That is not true !
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 26]: You can depute to nobody the responsibility of your own soul , '' Mrs Ramsden began solemnly , but Madame interrupted with an impatient gesture .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 9]: `` I thought Geoffrey was not to interfere !
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 13]: For pity 's sake do n't let us waste time talking sentiment !
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 14]: We are here to discuss this matter in a sensible , business manner .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 12]: Let us begin at once , and not waste time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 11]: To her surprise Elma met her glance with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 16]: A happy , composed little smile , which brought the dimples into her soft cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 6]: Really the child was wonderful !
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 15]: Her quietness and self-possession were in delightful contrast with her mother 's flustered solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 17]: Madame returned the smile , with restored equanimity , and felt a thrill of artistic satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 20]: `` I am afraid Geoffrey and I hardly look at our engagement from a business point of view ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 5]: said Elma , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 29]: `` It _ is _ a matter of sentiment with us , and we are not a bit ashamed of it , but I must answer mother first .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 56]: ... Mother , dear , you are shocked because Geoffrey says he would not be good without me , but when _ you _ were young , when you were careless , and enjoyed things which you disapprove of now , was there no good influence in your life which helped you to be strong ?
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 33]: It may have been a companion , or a book , or a sermon -- one of a hundred things -- but when it came , were n't you thankful for it ?
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 14]: Did n't you hold close to it and fear lest it should go ?
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 6]: I am Geoffrey 's influence !
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 10]: I 'm glad and proud that it is so .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 23]: If I can help him in one little way , I 'd rather do it than anything else in all the world !
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 22]: When he feels like that about me , I should think it very , very wrong to give him up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 11]: `` Elma , my dear , these are specious arguments !
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 11]: You are deceiving yourself , and preparing a bitter awakening !
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 11]: Mr Greville does not even understand what he is promising .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 22]: His ideas and yours are different as night from day ; the same words convey different meanings to you and him .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 20]: You would find as you talked together that there was a gulf between you on every serious subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 12]: `` No , mother , dear , there is no gulf .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 7]: We agree -- we always agree !
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 16]: I am amazed to find how marvellously we agree , '' said Elma , simply .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 15]: Geoffrey 's eyes flashed a look at her ; a look of adoring triumph .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 18]: Madame screwed her lips on one side , and stared markedly at a corner of the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 8]: Mrs Ramsden wrung her hands in despair .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 25]: `` Elma , you pray every night to be delivered from temptation -- consider what your position would be if you married Mr Greville !
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 22]: Ask yourself if you are strong enough to resist pride and selfishness , and absorption in the things of this world .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 30]: Many would say that it was a great match for you , but I would rather see you settled in a cottage with enough money for your daily needs .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 12]: It is easier for a camel -- '' Elma interrupted quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 12]: `` I do n't think you need be afraid , mother .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 17]: I love beautiful things , but truly and honestly I believe they are good for me !
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 19]: It is a little difficult to explain , but ugly things -- inartistic things , _ jar _ !
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 14]: They make me feel cross and discontented , while beauty is a joy !
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 19]: I need not become proud and self-engrossed because the things around me are beautiful and rich with associations .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 11]: On the contrary , they ought to do me good .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 25]: I 'd _ love _ them so , and be so thankful , that I should want other people to enjoy them , too .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 20]: It is n't riches themselves that one cares for -- it is the things that riches can give ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 37]: Madame had been watching the girl 's face as she spoke , her own expression kindling in sympathy with views so entirely in accordance with her own , but at the last sentence her brows knitted .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 13]: `` It 's not a case of riches , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 4]: she said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 10]: `` I do n't think you understand the position .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 6]: Geoffrey is a poor man .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 35]: The estate brings in little more than half what it did in his father 's time , and the expense of keeping it up increases rather than diminishes , as the buildings grow older .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 6]: He ought to marry money .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 30]: All these years we have lived in the expectation of a marriage which would pay up old scores , and put things on a better basis for the future .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 18]: If he marries a girl without money he will have to face constant anxiety and trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 13]: Elma turned to her mother , her delicate brow puckered in anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 15]: `` I shall have _ some _ money , sha n't I , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 15]: You told me that father left some provision for me on my marriage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 17]: `` You are to have three thousand pounds paid down if you marry with my consent .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 28]: My income is largely derived from an annuity , Mrs Greville , but there will be about another five thousand to come to Elma after death . ''
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 8]: Madame bowed her head in gracious patronage .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 8]: `` Very nice , I 'm sure !
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 16]: A very nice little sum for pin money , but quite useless for our purposes .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 27]: Do n't hate me , Elma -- I am the most unmercenary of women -- Geoffrey will tell you that I am always getting into debt !
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 29]: -- but when a man is the owner of a property -- which has descended to him from generations of ancestors , his first duty is to it .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 5]: _ Noblesse oblige _ !
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 18]: It is not right to allow it to fall into disrepair for a matter of sentiment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 18]: Elma sat with downcast looks considering the point , while Geoffrey devoured her face with hungry eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 21]: Mrs Ramsden 's face had flushed to a painful red , and she passed her handkerchief nervously round her lips .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 24]: She could bear to torture her child herself , but not to sit by and hear another woman follow in her own footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 19]: The silence lasted for a long minute before Elma replied by asking a question on her own behalf .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 25]: `` Can it be right for a man to marry one woman for money , when he has given his heart to another ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 11]: Mrs Greville tossed her head with another impatient little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 4]: `` His heart !
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 14]: Ah , my dear , a man 's heart is an adaptable commodity !
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 20]: He ` gives it , ' as you say , many times over in the course of his life .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 30]: He is far more likely to love a wife whose money brings him ease and comfort , than one for whose pretty face he has sacrificed his peace ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 12]: Elma turned to her lover and looked deep into his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 23]: With a strong effort he had resisted breaking into the conversation before now , but his face was more eloquent than words .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 12]: She smiled at him , a tender little smile of encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 6]: `` I am very economical .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 7]: I would help Geoffrey to save .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 27]: I have not been accustomed to luxuries , so it would cost me nothing to do without them , and he says he does n't care .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 12]: Do n't think I am selfish , Mrs Greville , please !
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 45]: I am thinking of Geoffrey first , but I believe he would be happier living quietly with me , and looking after the estate himself , instead of paying an agent to do it , than if he sold himself for money and ease .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 7]: We love each other very much .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 11]: We need nothing more than just to be together . ''
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 10]: Geoffrey turned aside and stared out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 7]: The two mothers exchanged helpless glances .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 4]: `` Elma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 12]: said Mrs Ramsden , sharply , `` have you no pride ?
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 12]: It is hard enough for me to sit by and listen .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 16]: Are you not ashamed to force yourself upon a family where you are not wanted ?
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 22]: When I have looked forward to your marriage , I have always imagined that you would be welcomed with open arms .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 9]: For your own position you are well dowered .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 30]: I have been proud of you all your life -- too proud , perhaps -- it would be a bitter blow to me to see you married on sufferance .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 20]: If you have no other feeling in the matter , does not your pride come to your aid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 14]: `` Mother , I 'm going to marry Geoffrey , not his family !
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 9]: He can take care of his wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 7]: `` The child is right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 5]: said Madame , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 17]: `` Geoffrey 's wife , whoever she may be , will be treated with every respect .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 20]: It is not the judgment of others which she need dread , but the judgment of her own heart .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 6]: Listen to me , child !
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 17]: You are a sweet thing , and I love you for your devotion to my boy .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 30]: As I told you before , I should be in love with you in his place , but I 'm an old woman , and I know the world !
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 34]: Geoffrey is not used to work and economy ; for a little time , while the first glamour lasted , he might be contented enough , but he would weary in the end .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 13]: He would surely weary , and then -- how would you feel ?
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 26]: When you saw him restless and discontented ; longing to leave you and fly back to his old life , would you feel no remorse ?
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 15]: Love 's young dream does not last for ever , my pretty child . ''
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 22]: `` No , '' said Elma , quietly ; `` dreams do n't last , but sometimes the awakening is better !
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 32]: You have known Geoffrey all his life , Mrs Greville , and it seems presumptuous to pretend that I know him even better , but I can -- _ feel _ !
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 19]: You believe he would tire of me , and long to get back to his old luxurious life .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 35]: You think he would love me very much for a little time and then be indifferent and careless , and that I should feel it was my own fault ; but you are wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 8]: Indeed , indeed , you are wrong !
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 11]: He is your son -- has he ever failed you ?
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 11]: You say yourself that he has been good and true .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 9]: You would trust him for your own future .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 13]: Do you think he would be less loyal to his own wife ?
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 7]: I am not at all afraid .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 10]: I am like you -- I trust Geoffrey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 63]: As she finished speaking she turned towards her lover and held out her hand towards him , and in two strides Geoffrey was by her side ; was on his knees beside her , holding that little hand pressed between both his own , turning to look at his mother with triumphant eyes ; with eyes ashine with something deeper than triumph .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 5]: Geoffrey on his knees !
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 6]: Tears in Geoffrey 's eyes !
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 13]: Madame stared in amaze , then broke into a sudden excited laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 5]: `` Bravo , Elma !
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 4]: Bravo , Geoffrey !
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 5]: Congratulations , my dears .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 15]: Thank heaven you have a mother who knows when she is well beaten ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 15]: She rose from her seat and crossed the room to where the girl sat .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 6]: `` Bravo , little Elma !
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 9]: I like to see a good fighting spirit .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 18]: You will make Geoffrey a charming wife , and I shall be proud of my daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 60]: She took Elma 's disengaged hand and pressed it between her own , and the girl smiled a happy response , but Geoffrey was oblivious of her presence , his eyes fixed upon his love 's face , with the rapt , adoring gaze with which a knight of old may have gazed upon the vision of the grail .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 11]: His mother looked at him , and her lips quivered .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 16]: Artificial and frivolous though she was , her only son was dear to her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 20]: Since the hour of his birth he had been to her as a pivot round which the world revolved .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 20]: Her son -- the last of the Grevilles who had owned the Manor since the days of the Tudors .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 15]: To be alienated from him would be the bitterest grief which life could bring .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 9]: Her grip tightened on the girl 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 4]: `` Elma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 4]: she cried urgently .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 7]: `` I am Geoffrey 's mother .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 21]: He is yours now , and will be swayed by you , but he has been mine for thirty-three years .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 20]: If I have taken part against you , it has been because I believed it was best for him .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 9]: I have lost , and you have won .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 12]: You will be his wife , the mistress of the Manor .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 19]: I do n't grudge you your success , but do n't -- do n't bear me a grudge !
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 9]: Do n't turn my boy against me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 5]: `` Mrs Greville ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 5]: gasped Elma , breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 5]: `` Mrs Greville ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 16]: She pulled her hand from Geoffrey 's grasp , and rose swiftly to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 14]: `` Oh , please do n't think that I could be so mean !
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 11]: I want him to love you more , not less .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 10]: I want to be a _ real _ daughter !
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 15]: You must not think that I am going to drive you from your place .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 15]: You must stay on at the Manor , and let me learn from you .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 11]: There is so much that I shall have to learn .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 12]: I shall be quite satisfied to be allowed to help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 5]: `` Silly child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 5]: said Madame , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 17]: She lifted her delicate , ringed hand and stroked the girl 's cheeks with kindly patronage .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 25]: `` You do n't know what you are talking about , my dear , but I _ do _ -- fortunately for us all !
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 9]: Geoffrey 's wife must have no divided rule .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 10]: You need not trouble your pretty head about me .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 16]: Norton palls at times even to a Greville , and I shall enjoy my liberty .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 27]: I 'll go out and spend a cold weather with Carol ; I 'll have a cosy little flat in town , and do the theatres .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 40]: I 'll enjoy myself gadding about , and come down upon you now and then when I want a rest , but I 'll never _ live _ with you , my dear ; be sure of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 11]: `` It 's rather early to make plans , mater .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 5]: Things will arrange themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 17]: Elma and I will always try to make you happy , '' said Geoffrey , bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 37]: He , too , had risen , and stood by his mother 's side ; flushed , triumphant , a little shamefaced at the remembrance of his late emotion ; but transparently and most radiantly happy .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 28]: `` I 'll do all in my power to be a good son to you , and to Mrs Ramsden also if she will allow me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 58]: He was the first of the three to remember the existence of the little woman in the background ; the little woman who was sobbing into her handkerchief , shedding bitter tears because , forsooth , her daughter had secured the biggest match in the country-side , and was about to become a Greville of Norton Manor !
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 30]: The parental summons arrived ten days after the date of Elma 's formal engagement , and at the expiration of the seventh week of Cornelia 's sojourn in England .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 20]: There it was for all the world to see ; -- short , authoritative , and to the point .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 7]: Circumstances had altered Poppar 's plan .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 21]: His visit to Europe must be postponed , he desired his daughter to return home by the first possible boat .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 10]: Useless to exclaim , to argue , to condemn .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 11]: The command had gone forth ; implicit obedience must ensue .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 14]: `` Will you feel badly when I 'm gone , Aunt Soph ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 9]: Cornelia asked after the news had been broken .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 25]: She looked wistfully into the spinster 's face , and felt herself answered as she noted the involuntary momentary hesitation which preceded the reply .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 24]: `` It will naturally be a disappointment to me to miss seeing my brother , but I hope the pleasure is only deferred .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 24]: I am glad to have had an opportunity of making your acquaintance , my dear , though the time is so curtailed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 14]: `` Yes , I guess we 've fixed-up an acquaintance right enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 5]: said Cornelia , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 12]: Seven weeks , or seven years -- what did it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 9]: She and this woman could never become friends .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 10]: Time counts for nothing in the intercourse of souls .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 15]: An hour may reveal a kindred spirit ; no years can bridge some gaps .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 35]: Elma would remain a life-long friend , Guest a life-long memory , but her kinswoman , the nearest on earth with the one exception of her father , must for ever be a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 29]: Cornelia was sad at heart that day , and Elma was sad , too ; opening wide , startled eyes , and clasping her friend in jealous arms .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 8]: `` Cornelia , it is n't true !
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 8]: It _ ca n't _ be true !
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 8]: I ca n't spare you , dear .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 11]: Is it really impossible to stay on a little longer ?
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 10]: Geoffrey and I counted on you for our wedding .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 14]: It is fixed for October , and I wanted you for a bridesmaid .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 13]: I wanted you to pay me a visit in my own house !
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 19]: You have been such a friend to us both , that we _ need _ you , Cornelia !
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 7]: I shall miss you badly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 4]: `` Shucks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 5]: returned Cornelia , lightly .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 12]: `` You 'll forget there is such a creature in existence .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 28]: _ I _ should , in your place , and I do n't mind if you do , for I know you 'll remember again another day .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 12]: This is Geoffrey 's hour , and I wo n't interfere .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 23]: If I live , I 'll pay you that visit right enough , and maybe you 'll come over to see me .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 8]: I 'd give you a roaring time .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 13]: Tell Geoffrey he is bound to bring you over to see America .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 26]: I 'll think about you on your marriage-day , but I do n't know as I 'm sorry to do the thinking at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 13]: Wedding-days are n't the liveliest occasions in the world for the looker-on .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 34]: I guess I 'd feel pretty ` _ left _ , ' when you drove off from the gates , and I found myself all by my lonesome with the two old girls .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 33]: ... I 've wired to Liverpool about berths , and may have to start off at a day 's notice , so we 've got to make the most of the time .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 6]: Aunt Soph do n't care !
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 48]: She 's polite , of course , but right at the back of her mind I can see she 's planning to clean out my room , and thinking how good it will be to have the mats laid aside , and the shroudings over the tables !
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 23]: If it was n't for you , Moss Rose , I should feel I 'd done a fool-trick coming over at all !
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 18]: When all 's said and done it amounts to nothing but disappointment and heart - break . ''
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 18]: `` You mean , '' began Elma , `` you mean -- '' and then suddenly paused .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 7]: Why should Cornelia 's heart break ?
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 30]: Disappointment and disillusion would be natural enough in one who had experienced both coldness and deception within the last few weeks , but heart-break was too strong a term .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 28]: To Elma , with her mind full to overflowing of that beloved Geoffrey , it seemed as if nothing but love could count so seriously in life .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 58]: Her thoughts flew to Guest , recalling all she had heard of his knight - errantry in London ; of the long hours which the two had spent alone together ; and later on , of the daily meetings in the Park , planned for her own benefit , but none the less opportunities for fuller knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 27]: She fixed her blue eyes on Cornelia 's face , and asked a sudden question -- `` Does Captain Guest know that you are going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 6]: `` How should he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 5]: returned Cornelia , lightly .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 22]: Eyes and lips were unflinching , but all the will in the world could not keep the blood from her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 33]: `` He 's visiting somewhere at the other end of the country , with old friends who belong to his own world , and feel the same way about the same things .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 7]: Let him stay and be happy !
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 17]: I do n't want him to come worrying down here for the fun of saying good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 10]: Guess he 's had trouble enough about my affairs .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 12]: Mind now , Elma , you are not to tell him !
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 14]: This is my affair , and I wo n't have you interfere . ''
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 27]: Elma meekly disavowed any intention of communicating with Captain Guest , but like many other meek people she harboured a quiet reservation which annulled the promise .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 10]: She would not write , but -- Geoffrey could !
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 5]: Geoffrey _ should _ !
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 49]: That flame in Cornelia 's cheek satisfied her that the girl 's interest was deeper than she would admit , and if Guest returned the feeling , what joy , what rapture to have Cornelia settled in England ; to look forward to a life of constant intercourse !
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 17]: Cornelia had helped her ; according to her lights Elma was determined to help Cornelia also .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 46]: With disconcerting swiftness a return telegram arrived from Liverpool stating that owing to illness a passenger had been suddenly obliged to resign a state-room on the boat sailing on the following Saturday , and that the accommodation would be reserved pending Miss Briskett 's confirmation .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 6]: An immediate reply was requested .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 5]: Cornelia gasped and hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 3]: Four days !
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 15]: _ Only _ four days , and then farewell to England and English friends .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 10]: She had not expected anything so speedy as this .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 25]: During these summer months berths were engaged so long ahead that it was generally a most difficult thing to arrange for a speedy passage .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 39]: She had been told of this over and over again ; had known of her friends ' difficulties in such matters ; in the background of her mind had counted on a similar delay in her own case .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 15]: In a week or a fortnight much might happen , but in four days !
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 14]: She stood battling with temptation , while Mary watched her with anxious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 22]: No one but herself knew the purport of the message ; no one need know if the answer were a refusal .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 11]: Two or three scribbled words would give her a reprieve .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 4]: ... Poor Cornelia !
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 20]: She realised afresh how easy it was to be brave in anticipation , how bitterly hard in actual fact .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 24]: She was silent so long that Mary summoned up courage to ask a question -- `` Is it bad news , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 15]: Cornelia stared at her blankly for a moment , and valiantly forced a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 20]: `` I guess there 's two sides to it , as there are to most things in this world .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 15]: My Poppar 'll think it splendid , but you 'll hate it badly enough .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 8]: I 'm going pretty quick , Mury !
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 11]: You wo n't have me but four days more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 5]: The truth was out .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 11]: She had burned her boats , and made retreat impossible .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 21]: While Mary wept and lamented , Cornelia wrote the confirmatory wire , and sent it out to the waiting messenger .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 8]: Then Mary returned to continue her lamentations .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 14]: `` I wish I could marry him , and be done with it !
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 25]: I ca n't seem to face staying on here with no one but her in the house , nagging at us all the day .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 9]: I 'll have to make another move ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 4]: she proclaimed dismally .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 24]: In Mary 's converse the singular pronoun , when masculine , always applied to her friend ; when feminine , to her mistress .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 16]: Cornelia had grasped this fact , and had therefore no difficulty in understanding her meaning .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 19]: She sat down in a chair by the window , and stared at the maid with serious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 8]: `` Do you love him , Mury ?
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 19]: Enough to marry him , and live beside him every one day to the end of your life ?
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 12]: You think you would not get -- _ tired _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 8]: Mary hesitated , unwilling to commit herself .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 17]: `` I would n't like to go so far as that , '' she announced judicially .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 21]: `` He aggravates me at times something cruel , but I 'd sooner be aggravated by him nor anyone else .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 27]: They talk a lot of rubbish about love , Miss Cornelia , but that 's about the size of it when all 's said and done .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 32]: Some people suit you and others do n't , and all the lovey-doveying in the world wo n't make 'em -- '' `` Why , Mury , you are a philosopher !
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 18]: It 's the dead truth , Mury , but I guess you need n't rub it in .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 15]: -- If you 've made up your mind , why need you wait ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 5]: `` Furniture , miss !
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 20]: I 've told him I wo n't marry to go into rooms , not if it 's ever so .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 13]: I 'll wait till I get a ` ome of me own .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 20]: He 'd put by a goodish bit , and so had I , but things have been agen us .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 27]: He was out of work four months last winter , and mother 's legs are a awful drain -- liniments , and bandages , and what-not .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 14]: You ca n't see your own mother suffer , and not pay out .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 12]: We 've got to wait till we save up again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 17]: `` How much money does it take to furnish a cottage over here , Mury ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 9]: `` That depends on how it 's done .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 12]: You can do it ` an ` some for forty pounds .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 23]: I lived with a girl who did hers for twenty , but I would n't like to be as close as that .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 6]: I reckon about thirty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 4]: `` Thirty pounds !
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 7]: One hundred and fifty dollars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 11]: Cornelia gasped in astonishment at the smallness of the sum .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 47]: `` You ca n't mean that that includes everything -- chairs and tables , and carpets , and dishes , and beds , and bureaus , and brooms , and tins , and curtains , and fire-irons -- and all the fixing to put 'em up !
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 17]: It is n't possible you can get them all for a hundred and fifty dollars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 6]: `` You can , miss .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 29]: There 's a shop in the Fore Street where they do you everything complete for three rooms for thirty pounds , with a velvet suite for the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 23]: Lady 's chair , gent 's chair , sofa , and four uprights , with chiffonnier , and overmantel , and all .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 8]: You could n't wish for anything better .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 25]: The girl I lived with had only a few odd bits -- I 'd be ashamed to have such a poor sort of parlour .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 20]: -- In the kitchen they give you a dresser , and a flap-table , and linoleum on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 15]: Jim and me went to the shop one day to have a look round .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 12]: ... That was when he had a bit put by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 9]: Mary sighed , and flicked away a tear .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 8]: `` And now you 're going next !
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 14]: I 'm getting a bit sick of bad luck , I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 18]: Cornelia was bending forward in her seat , her chin supported in the palms of her hands .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 19]: Her expression was very grave and wistful , but in her eyes shone the light of awakened interest .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 3]: `` Mury !
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 11]: -- you 've been real good and attentive to me .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 12]: I guess I 've given you quite a heap of trouble .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 11]: I want to make you a present before I go .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 18]: Would you like it if I fixed-up that house so 's you could get married right away ?
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 31]: If you say so , you can go to that store and make your own bargains , and I 'll leave thirty pounds with Miss Ramsden to pay the bills .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 19]: I 'd like to feel I 'd helped you to a home of your own , Mury ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 31]: Mary clutched the back of a chair near to which she was standing ; her eyes protruded , her chin dropped , speech failed her in the excess of emotion .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 12]: She could only stare , and gasp , and stare again .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 5]: `` Poor Mury ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 5]: said Cornelia , softly .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 6]: `` Are you so pleased ?
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 7]: I want you should be pleased .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 24]: If I ken make someone happy to-day -- right-down , tearing happy , it 's going to help me more 'n you know .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 36]: ... Wo n't you enjoy going shopping with your friend , Mury , bossing round in that store , choosing the things you want , and putting on airs as if you owned the bank ?
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 8]: Mind you put on airs , Mury !
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 12]: Make 'em hop round , and get things to your taste .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 19]: They 'll think the more of you , and it 's not every day one furnishes a house .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 54]: ... I 'll send you my picture to stand on the mantelpiece in that parlour , and when you dust it in the mornings , you can send me a kind thought ` way over all those miles of ocean , and I 'll think of you sitting in the lady 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 15]: ... For the land 's sake , girl , do n't have a fit !
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 14]: You do n't need to have a thing unless you say so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 7]: `` Oh , Miss Cornelia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 5]: sobbed Mary , brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 25]: `` You 're too -- I 'm so -- you 're an _ angel _ , Miss Cornelia , that 's what you are !
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 12]: ... Jim will go off his head when he hears this .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 14]: -- It 's a sort of thing you ca n't seem to believe .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 46]: -- I loved to wait on you , miss ; if you 'd never given me a thing I 'd have loved it all the same -- you talked so kind , and took such an interest , and was always so lively and laughing .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 13]: It was n't for what I could get -- but the house !
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 27]: ... To have a house thrown at you , as you may say , at a moment 's notice -- it -- takes away my breath !
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 10]: I ca n't seem to take it in . ''
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 8]: `` But you are happy , Mury ?
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 9]: You feel happy to think of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 8]: `` I should think I do just .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 6]: Clean dazed with happiness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 5]: `` Poor Mury ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 5]: said Cornelia , again .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 22]: She looked across the room at the flushed , ecstatic face of the prospective bride , and smiled with tender sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 9]: `` I 'm real glad you 're pleased .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 19]: To-night , just as soon as dinner 's over , you must go out and tell your friend .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 9]: I 'll fix it up with Aunt Soph .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 11]: You 'll have a fine time , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 31]: He wo n't believe it 's true , but you 'll _ make _ him believe , and be as happy as grigs walking round and planning out that parlour .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 15]: Come into my room when you get back and tell me what he says .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 7]: I sha n't be asleep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 12]: There seemed no time for sleep during the next few days .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 86]: The mornings were devoted to packing , and to long confidential interviews with Elma ; the afternoons to a succession of tea-parties , to which every old lady in Norton was bidden in turns , to say the same things , and breathe the same pious good wishes ; the evenings to decorous cribbage matches with her aunt ; the nights -- the nights were Cornelia 's own secret , but they left a wan , heavy-eyed damsel to yawn at the breakfast-table each morning .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 76]: When the last hour arrived , the very last , Cornelia 's friends assembled at the station to bid her good-bye ; Miss Briskett , tall and angular in her new grey costume ; Mrs Ramsden with the black feather fiercely erect in the front of her bonnet ; lovely , blooming Elma attended by her swain , and in the background the faithful Mary , holding on to the dressing-bag , and sniffing dolorously .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 33]: Cornelia had refused to be escorted farther on the journey , and now that the hour had arrived , her one longing was to say her farewells and be left to herself .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 31]: She was eager to be off , yet , when the train steamed slowly out of the station , she was gripped by a strange , swift spasm of anguish .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 7]: Not on her friends ' behalf .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 12]: Aunt Soph had made no pretence of anything beyond polite regret .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 28]: Elma and Mary shared a personal happiness so deep , that , for the time at least , the departure of a friend held no lasting sting .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 39]: Cornelia could wave adieu to each , rejoicing in their joy , in the remembrance that she had had some small share in bringing it about ; yet the torturing pain continued , the desolating ache of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 9]: What was it for which she had waited ?
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 22]: What hope had lived persistent at the back of her mind , while she had pretended that she had no hope ?
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 33]: She knew now that , hour by hour , she had lived in the expectation of Guest 's return ; had felt an unreassuring conviction that he must come before she left !
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 18]: That she had done her utmost to prevent his coming had nothing to do with the case .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 33]: Surely , when she had so sternly followed the dictates of reason , there was all the more need for some good fairy to weave a miracle which should upset her plans .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 4]: Something must happen !
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 2]: Something !
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 12]: At sweet-and-twenty it is so difficult to believe in the irrevocable !
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 9]: The journey to London was alive with memories .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 24]: In this corner she had sat watching Guest 's face , listening to his voice as he told the story of his life .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 16]: At this landscape they had looked together , admiring , and comparing tastes and impressions .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 13]: At Paddington , Mrs Moffatt had stood in waiting upon the platform .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 16]: Cornelia was thankful to be safe inside the boat-mail , away from the pressing memories .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 7]: Here the atmosphere was of home .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 27]: Eye and ear caught on every side the familiar accent , the familiar phraseology ; the familiar tilt of the hat , and squaring of shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 19]: The passenger list included more than one well-known name , and once afloat she was sure of companionship .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 27]: She settled down in her corner , with a sigh of relief , as of one who has reached a haven after struggling in deep waters .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 7]: This was a foretaste of home !
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 18]: These people were her own kindred ; their ways were her ways , their thoughts her thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 23]: For the first time since her arrival on English soil she felt the rest of being in perfect accord with her surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 19]: With Cornelia America was a passion ; life away from her native land was only half a life .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 34]: Aboard the great steamer the passengers were rushing to and fro , searching for their state-rooms , and , when found , depositing their impedimenta on the tops of the narrow white bunks .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 24]: Cornelia walked to the quietest corner of the deck , dropped her bag on a seat , and leant idly over the rail .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 22]: She was in no hurry to go below , and held instinctively aloof from the groups of fellow-passengers and their friends .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 10]: She was alone , and her heart was sad .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 36]: Someone walking quickly along the deck caught sight of the solitary figure in the trim , dark-blue dress , and recognised its outline before a turn of the head revealed the glorious , flaming hair .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 41]: Someone with a grim face , pale beneath his tan , with haggard lines about the eyes and mouth ; a man whose looks betrayed the fact that he had been awake all night , face to face with calamity .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 17]: He walked straight to the girl 's side , and laid his hand upon her arm .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 4]: `` Cornelia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 39]: Cornelia turned swiftly , and a light leapt into her eyes ; a light of joy , so pure and involuntary that , at sight of it , the man 's face lost something of its grim tension .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 22]: He turned his back so as to screen the girl from the passers-by , and his hand tightened on her arm .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 11]: `` Cornelia , are you running away from me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 22]: She did not answer , but her silence gave assent -- her silence , and a quiet bend of the head .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 7]: `` I was -- afraid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 5]: breathed Cornelia , low .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 11]: Beneath the close-fitting cap Guest could see her lips tremble .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 8]: The little face looked white and tense .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 6]: She twisted her fingers nervously .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 9]: `` Afraid of me , and my love ?
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 10]: Afraid that I should come back to trouble you ?
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 8]: Afraid of my selfishness , Cornelia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 8]: The curling lips breathed a faint dissent .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 6]: `` Of what , then ?
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 8]: We have only a few minutes left .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 9]: You must tell me the truth now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 17]: She raised her eyes to his ; brave , pitiful eyes , mutely imploring for mercy .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 4]: `` Of myself !
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 5]: Of my own weakness !
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 13]: Afraid lest I might give way , and ruin two lives ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 29]: `` You knew that I loved you ; that I had gone away to prove my love , to see if it would stand the test of absence ?
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 23]: It was a serious matter for us both , and I would not let myself act on the spur of an impulse .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 16]: If I had , Cornelia , you know that I should have spoken long ago !
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 7]: -- that night on the river .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 7]: You knew it at the time .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 7]: I saw it in your eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 17]: -- I made you promise to let me know if you left Norton during my absence .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 9]: It was not fair to run away . ''
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 5]: `` I never promised !
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 4]: I never did !
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 10]: You asked me , but I did n't promise .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 11]: I felt at the time that I must leave . ''
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 23]: The words came in quick , gasping breaths , as a child might speak who tried to justify himself to his taskmaster .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 21]: Guest 's face softened at the sound , and his grasp of the girl 's arm turned into a caress .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 11]: `` Darling , do n't you see what that means ?
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 11]: You love me , or you would not be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 18]: Geoffrey wrote to me giving me warning , but the letter only reached me late yesterday night .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 7]: I have been travelling ever since .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 9]: I just managed to be here in time .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 13]: If I had missed the boat I should have come after you .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 17]: Do you think a few thousand miles are going to keep us apart , Cornelia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 6]: She shook her head sadly .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 22]: -- no distance in space , just the distance between our two selves ; the distance that ca n't be bridged !
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 17]: We belong to different worlds , you and I ; we could never be happy together .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 23]: You love forms and ceremonies , and conventions ; all the things that worry me most , and make me feel ugly .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 34]: It 's the height of your ambition to settle down in your old home , and to keep things rolling along in the same old ruts that they 've run in for centuries .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 12]: I want change and excitement , and the newest there is .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 10]: Your quiet English life would get on my nerves .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 18]: Poppar and I have had lots of ups and downs , and I 've never lost grit .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 23]: I ken bear a good big blow , but to stodge along every day the same dull round would drive me crazed !
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 13]: We live quickly over with us , and you 're so slow .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 13]: I do n't say that the advantage is all on our side .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 22]: I used to laugh at English girls , but I do n't any longer , since I 've known Elma Ramsden .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 17]: If I were a man , Elma 's the sort I 'd want for my wife .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 16]: You 'll find another like her some day , and be thankful you are free .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 30]: You love me now , but your love would not stand the strain of pulling separate ways all our lives -- '' Guest gazed at her with gloomy eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 16]: `` You do n't love me , or you would not think of anything else .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 21]: Whatever may be the differences between us , you are the one woman I have ever wanted for my wife .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 9]: I ca n't bear to let you go .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 14]: ... Do n't trifle with me for the few minutes that are left .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 7]: Tell me honestly how we stand .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 9]: ... Do you love me , Cornelia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 8]: `` I -- _ could _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 5]: answered Cornelia , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 17]: Her cheeks flushed beneath his gaze , and the white lids drooped over the honest eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 18]: `` It was just finding out how easy it would be , that sent me running home .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 26]: The people at Norton think it was Poppar 's doing , but I 'll tell you straight that I asked him to send for me .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 7]: ... Life 's a big chance .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 19]: We 've got to make the best we know out of it , for ourselves and other people .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 11]: I do n't mean to spoil things for us both .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 11]: ... You did n't _ want _ to love me !
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 20]: Right at the back of your mind you 've felt all the time that I was not your mate .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 33]: You went away to think it out ; perhaps , if the truth 's known , you were still undecided when the news of my sailing brought you up with a run .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 19]: When I am gone and you have had time to cool down , you 'll be glad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 9]: Guest repeated the word with bitter emphasis . ''
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 4]: _ Glad _ !
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 8]: I shall be glad , shall I ?
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 18]: At the present moment , in any case , I am the most miserable man on earth .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 7]: Have you no pity , Cornelia ?
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 5]: Will nothing move you ?
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 8]: Think how happy we have been together !
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 13]: If we loved each other , surely we could outlive the differences ?
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 14]: Can you bear to go away like this and leave me for ever ?
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 9]: Is it nothing to you how I suffer ?
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 10]: Do n't you _ care _ , Cornelia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 11]: `` Yes , I care , '' she answered simply .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 20]: `` It _ hurts _ , but it 's going to hurt a lot more if I stay behind .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 19]: If we lived together it would be like trying to piece together the bits of two different puzzles .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 6]: We do n't fit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 10]: The simple words expressed the truth with paralysing force .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 16]: Even at that bitter moment Guest recognised their truth , and was dumb before it .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 24]: He turned aside , his strong jaw working with emotion , powerless to fight any longer against the rock of Cornelia 's will .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 32]: Behind him lay the grey city wrapped in its veil of smoke , the tall spire of the old church rising in picturesque isolation above the line of the surrounding buildings .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 69]: It seemed at that moment to stand as a symbol of the life of the Mother Country , a life fenced in by convention , by forms and ceremonies sanctified to every Englishman by centuries of association ; forms at which he may at times smile or scoff , but which he would no sooner demolish than he would tear away the clustering ivy which clothes his walls .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 46]: Before him lay the broad river , its mouth widening to the sea : to that free , untrammelled waste of waters , which were a fit symbol of that land of the West , whose daughter could place her liberty even before her love !
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 8]: There came a sudden stir and movement .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 19]: A second time the bell clanged its warning , and the visitors began to stream towards the gangway .
