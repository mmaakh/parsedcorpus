Parsing [sent. 1 len. 51]: THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER BY MARK TWAIN -LRB- Samuel Langhorne Clemens -RRB- P R E F A C E MOST of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred ; one or two were experiences of my own , the rest those of boys who were schoolmates of mine .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 41]: Huck Finn is drawn from life ; Tom Sawyer also , but not from an individual -- he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom I knew , and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 33]: The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and slaves in the West at the period of this story -- that is to say , thirty or forty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 68]: Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls , I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account , for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what they once were themselves , and of how they felt and thought and talked , and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 3]: THE AUTHOR .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 4]: HARTFORD , 1876 .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 15]: T O M S A W Y E R CHAPTER I `` TOM ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 4]: `` TOM ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 11]: `` What 's gone with that boy , I wonder ?
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 4]: You TOM ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 26]: The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room ; then she put them up and looked out under them .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 52]: She seldom or never looked THROUGH them for so small a thing as a boy ; they were her state pair , the pride of her heart , and were built for `` style , '' not service -- she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 72]: She looked perplexed for a moment , and then said , not fiercely , but still loud enough for the furniture to hear : `` Well , I lay if I get hold of you I 'll -- '' She did not finish , for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom , and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 7]: She resurrected nothing but the cat .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 12]: `` I never did see the beat of that boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 27]: She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and `` jimpson '' weeds that constituted the garden .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 3]: No Tom .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 20]: So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted : `` Y-o-u-u TOM ! ''
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 29]: There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 10]: I might ` a ' thought of that closet .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 8]: What you been doing in there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 4]: `` Nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 3]: `` Nothing !
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 5]: Look at your hands .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 6]: And look at your mouth .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 6]: What IS that truck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 9]: `` I do n't know , aunt . ''
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 6]: `` Well , I know .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 10]: It 's jam -- that 's what it is .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 18]: Forty times I 've said if you did n't let that jam alone I 'd skin you .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 6]: Hand me that switch . ''
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 15]: The switch hovered in the air -- the peril was desperate -- `` My !
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 7]: Look behind you , aunt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 14]: The old lady whirled round , and snatched her skirts out of danger .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 18]: The lad fled on the instant , scrambled up the high board-fence , and disappeared over it .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 16]: His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment , and then broke into a gentle laugh .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 12]: `` Hang the boy , ca n't I never learn anything ?
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 21]: Ai n't he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time ?
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 10]: But old fools is the biggest fools there is .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 14]: Ca n't learn an old dog new tricks , as the saying is .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 24]: But my goodness , he never plays them alike , two days , and how is a body to know what 's coming ?
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 53]: He ` pears to know just how long he can torment me before I get my dander up , and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh , it 's all down again and I ca n't hit him a lick .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 21]: I ai n't doing my duty by that boy , and that 's the Lord 's truth , goodness knows .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 14]: Spare the rod and spile the child , as the Good Book says .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 15]: I 'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both , I know .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 11]: He 's full of the Old Scratch , but laws-a-me !
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 25]: he 's my own dead sister 's boy , poor thing , and I ai n't got the heart to lash him , somehow .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 26]: Every time I let him off , my conscience does hurt me so , and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 29]: Well-a-well , man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble , as the Scripture says , and I reckon it 's so .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 33]: He 'll play hookey this evening , * and -LSB- * Southwestern for `` afternoon '' -RSB- I 'll just be obleeged to make him work , to-morrow , to punish him .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 53]: It 's mighty hard to make him work Saturdays , when all the boys is having holiday , but he hates work more than he hates anything else , and I 've GOT to do some of my duty by him , or I 'll be the ruination of the child . ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 13]: Tom did play hookey , and he had a very good time .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 48]: He got back home barely in season to help Jim , the small colored boy , saw next-day 's wood and split the kindlings before supper -- at least he was there in time to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 40]: Tom 's younger brother -LRB- or rather half-brother -RRB- Sid was already through with his part of the work -LRB- picking up chips -RRB- , for he was a quiet boy , and had no adventurous , troublesome ways .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 39]: While Tom was eating his supper , and stealing sugar as opportunity offered , Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile , and very deep -- for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 40]: Like many other simple-hearted souls , it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy , and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 18]: Said she : `` Tom , it was middling warm in school , war n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 9]: `` Powerful warm , war n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 13]: `` Did n't you want to go in a-swimming , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 15]: A bit of a scare shot through Tom -- a touch of uncomfortable suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 13]: He searched Aunt Polly 's face , but it told him nothing .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 15]: So he said : `` No 'm -- well , not very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 28]: The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom 's shirt , and said : `` But you ai n't too warm now , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 28]: And it flattered her to reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 15]: But in spite of her , Tom knew where the wind lay , now .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 24]: So he forestalled what might be the next move : `` Some of us pumped on our heads -- mine 's damp yet .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 3]: See ? ''
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 20]: Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence , and missed a trick .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 33]: Then she had a new inspiration : `` Tom , you did n't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it , to pump on your head , did you ?
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 5]: Unbutton your jacket ! ''
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 9]: The trouble vanished out of Tom 's face .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 5]: He opened his jacket .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 7]: His shirt collar was securely sewed .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 3]: `` Bother !
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 8]: Well , go ` long with you .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 12]: I 'd made sure you 'd played hookey and been a-swimming .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 7]: But I forgive ye , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 21]: I reckon you 're a kind of a singed cat , as the saying is -- better 'n you look .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 4]: THIS time . ''
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 22]: She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried , and half glad that Tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 28]: But Sidney said : `` Well , now , if I did n't think you sewed his collar with white thread , but it 's black . ''
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 10]: `` Why , I did sew it with white !
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 3]: Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 9]: But Tom did not wait for the rest .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 21]: As he went out at the door he said : `` Siddy , I 'll lick you for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 36]: In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket , and had thread bound about them -- one needle carried white thread and the other black .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 16]: He said : `` She 'd never noticed if it had n't been for Sid .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 3]: Confound it !
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 15]: sometimes she sews it with white , and sometimes she sews it with black .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 23]: I wish to geeminy she 'd stick to one or t ` other -- I ca n't keep the run of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 11]: But I bet you I 'll lam Sid for that .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 6]: I 'll learn him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 10]: He was not the Model Boy of the village .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 13]: He knew the model boy very well though -- and loathed him .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 15]: Within two minutes , or even less , he had forgotten all his troubles .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 57]: Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man 's are to a man , but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the time -- just as men 's misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 28]: This new interest was a valued novelty in whistling , which he had just acquired from a negro , and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 52]: It consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn , a sort of liquid warble , produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music -- the reader probably remembers how to do it , if he has ever been a boy .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 30]: Diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it , and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 40]: He felt much as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet -- no doubt , as far as strong , deep , unalloyed pleasure is concerned , the advantage was with the boy , not the astronomer .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 6]: The summer evenings were long .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 7]: It was not dark , yet .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 6]: Presently Tom checked his whistle .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 14]: A stranger was before him -- a boy a shade larger than himself .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 22]: A new-comer of any age or either sex was an impressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 14]: This boy was well dressed , too -- well dressed on a week-day .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 5]: This was simply astounding .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 23]: His cap was a dainty thing , his close-buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty , and so were his pantaloons .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 11]: He had shoes on -- and it was only Friday .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 12]: He even wore a necktie , a bright bit of ribbon .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 14]: He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom 's vitals .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 33]: The more Tom stared at the splendid marvel , the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 4]: Neither boy spoke .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 29]: If one moved , the other moved -- but only sidewise , in a circle ; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the time .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 11]: Finally Tom said : `` I can lick you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 11]: `` I 'd like to see you try it . ''
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 9]: `` Well , I can do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 9]: `` No you ca n't , either . ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 6]: `` Yes I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 7]: `` No you ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 5]: `` I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 6]: `` You ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 4]: `` Can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 5]: `` Ca n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 4]: An uncomfortable pause .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 12]: Then Tom said : `` What 's your name ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 11]: 'T is n't any of your business , maybe . ''
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 13]: `` Well I ` low I 'll MAKE it my business . ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 8]: `` Well why do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 10]: `` If you say much , I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 7]: `` Much -- much -- MUCH .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 4]: There now . ''
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 14]: `` Oh , you think you 're mighty smart , DO N'T you ?
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 17]: I could lick you with one hand tied behind me , if I wanted to . ''
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 9]: `` Well why do n't you DO it ?
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 8]: You SAY you can do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 12]: `` Well I WILL , if you fool with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 15]: `` Oh yes -- I 've seen whole families in the same fix . ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 3]: `` Smarty !
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 12]: You think you 're SOME , now , DO N'T you ?
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 7]: Oh , what a hat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 13]: `` You can lump that hat if you do n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 20]: I dare you to knock it off -- and anybody that 'll take a dare will suck eggs . ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 7]: `` You 're a liar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 6]: `` You 're another . ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 14]: `` You 're a fighting liar and das n't take it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 8]: `` Aw -- take a walk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 25]: `` Say -- if you give me much more of your sass I 'll take and bounce a rock off 'n your head . ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 9]: `` Oh , of COURSE you will . ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 6]: `` Well I WILL . ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 10]: `` Well why do n't you DO it then ?
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 9]: What do you keep SAYING you will for ?
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 7]: Why do n't you DO it ?
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 8]: It 's because you 're afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 7]: `` I AI N'T afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 5]: `` You are . ''
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 6]: `` I ai n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 5]: `` You are . ''
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 12]: Another pause , and more eying and sidling around each other .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 7]: Presently they were shoulder to shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 10]: Tom said : `` Get away from here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 6]: `` Go away yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 6]: `` I wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 7]: `` I wo n't either . ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 32]: So they stood , each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace , and both shoving with might and main , and glowering at each other with hate .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 7]: But neither could get an advantage .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 30]: After struggling till both were hot and flushed , each relaxed his strain with watchful caution , and Tom said : `` You 're a coward and a pup .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 30]: I 'll tell my big brother on you , and he can thrash you with his little finger , and I 'll make him do it , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 10]: `` What do I care for your big brother ?
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 28]: I 've got a brother that 's bigger than he is -- and what 's more , he can throw him over that fence , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 7]: -LSB- Both brothers were imaginary . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 7]: `` That 's a lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 11]: `` YOUR saying so do n't make it so . ''
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 36]: Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe , and said : `` I dare you to step over that , and I 'll lick you till you ca n't stand up .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 11]: Anybody that 'll take a dare will steal sheep . ''
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 28]: The new boy stepped over promptly , and said : `` Now you said you 'd do it , now let 's see you do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 14]: `` Do n't you crowd me now ; you better look out . ''
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 18]: `` Well , you SAID you 'd do it -- why do n't you do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 4]: `` By jingo !
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 9]: for two cents I WILL do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 18]: The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out with derision .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 7]: Tom struck them to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 53]: In an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt , gripped together like cats ; and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other 's hair and clothes , punched and scratched each other 's nose , and covered themselves with dust and glory .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 28]: Presently the confusion took form , and through the fog of battle Tom appeared , seated astride the new boy , and pounding him with his fists .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 6]: `` Holler ` nuff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 8]: The boy only struggled to free himself .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 8]: He was crying -- mainly from rage .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 6]: `` Holler ` nuff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 7]: -- and the pounding went on .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 13]: At last the stranger got out a smothered '' ` Nuff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 15]: and Tom let him up and said : `` Now that 'll learn you .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 12]: Better look out who you 're fooling with next time . ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 42]: The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes , sobbing , snuffling , and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he would do to Tom the `` next time he caught him out . ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 48]: To which Tom responded with jeers , and started off in high feather , and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone , threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 14]: Tom chased the traitor home , and thus found out where he lived .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 33]: He then held a position at the gate for some time , daring the enemy to come outside , but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 24]: At last the enemy 's mother appeared , and called Tom a bad , vicious , vulgar child , and ordered him away .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 21]: So he went away ; but he said he '' ` lowed '' to `` lay '' for that boy .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 58]: He got home pretty late that night , and when he climbed cautiously in at the window , he uncovered an ambuscade , in the person of his aunt ; and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 22]: CHAPTER II SATURDAY morning was come , and all the summer world was bright and fresh , and brimming with life .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 21]: There was a song in every heart ; and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 13]: There was cheer in every face and a spring in every step .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 15]: The locust-trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 34]: Cardiff Hill , beyond the village and above it , was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable Land , dreamy , reposeful , and inviting .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 15]: Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 20]: He surveyed the fence , and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 9]: Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 12]: Life to him seemed hollow , and existence but a burden .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 43]: Sighing , he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank ; repeated the operation ; did it again ; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence , and sat down on a tree-box discouraged .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 17]: Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail , and singing Buffalo Gals .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 27]: Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom 's eyes , before , but now it did not strike him so .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 10]: He remembered that there was company at the pump .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 27]: White , mulatto , and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns , resting , trading playthings , quarrelling , fighting , skylarking .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 40]: And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off , Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hour -- and even then somebody generally had to go after him .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 20]: Tom said : `` Say , Jim , I 'll fetch the water if you 'll whitewash some . ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 14]: Jim shook his head and said : `` Ca n't , Mars Tom .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 26]: Ole missis , she tole me I got to go an ' git dis water an ' not stop foolin ' roun ' wid anybody .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 45]: She say she spec ' Mars Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash , an ' so she tole me go ` long an ' ` tend to my own business -- she ` lowed SHE 'D ` tend to de whitewashin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 12]: `` Oh , never you mind what she said , Jim .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 8]: That 's the way she always talks .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 15]: Gim me the bucket -- I wo n't be gone only a a minute .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 7]: SHE wo n't ever know . ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 10]: `` Oh , I das n't , Mars Tom .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 14]: Ole missis she 'd take an ' tar de head off 'n me .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 6]: ` Deed she would . ''
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 3]: `` SHE !
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 26]: She never licks anybody -- whacks 'em over the head with her thimble -- and who cares for that , I 'd like to know .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 20]: She talks awful , but talk do n't hurt -- anyways it do n't if she do n't cry .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 9]: Jim , I 'll give you a marvel .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 9]: I 'll give you a white alley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 5]: Jim began to waver .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 6]: `` White alley , Jim !
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 8]: And it 's a bully taw . ''
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 3]: `` My !
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 11]: Dat 's a mighty gay marvel , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 28]: But Mars Tom I 's powerful ` fraid ole missis -- '' `` And besides , if you will I 'll show you my sore toe . ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 13]: Jim was only human -- this attraction was too much for him .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 26]: He put down his pail , took the white alley , and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 43]: In another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear , Tom was whitewashing with vigor , and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 8]: But Tom 's energy did not last .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 19]: He began to think of the fun he had planned for this day , and his sorrows multiplied .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 40]: Soon the free boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions , and they would make a world of fun of him for having to work -- the very thought of it burnt him like fire .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 45]: He got out his worldly wealth and examined it -- bits of toys , marbles , and trash ; enough to buy an exchange of WORK , maybe , but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 22]: So he returned his straitened means to his pocket , and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 12]: At this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him !
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 9]: Nothing less than a great , magnificent inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 11]: He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 22]: Ben Rogers hove in sight presently -- the very boy , of all boys , whose ridicule he had been dreading .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 19]: Ben 's gait was the hop-skip-and-jump -- proof enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 32]: He was eating an apple , and giving a long , melodious whoop , at intervals , followed by a deep-toned ding-dong-dong , ding-dong-dong , for he was personating a steamboat .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 51]: As he drew near , he slackened speed , took the middle of the street , leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance -- for he was personating the Big Missouri , and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 33]: He was boat and captain and engine-bells combined , so he had to imagine himself standing on his own hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them : `` Stop her , sir !
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 3]: Ting-a-ling-ling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 15]: The headway ran almost out , and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 6]: `` Ship up to back !
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 3]: Ting-a-ling-ling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 9]: His arms straightened and stiffened down his sides .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 8]: `` Set her back on the stabboard !
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 2]: Ting-a-ling-ling !
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 2]: Chow !
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 2]: ch-chow-wow !
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 3]: Chow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 18]: His right hand , meantime , describing stately circles -- for it was representing a forty-foot wheel .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 9]: `` Let her go back on the labboard !
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 2]: Ting-a-lingling !
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 3]: Chow-ch-chow-chow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 8]: The left hand began to describe circles .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 5]: `` Stop the stabboard !
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 2]: Ting-a-ling-ling !
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 4]: Stop the labboard !
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 6]: Come ahead on the stabboard !
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 3]: Stop her !
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 7]: Let your outside turn over slow !
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 2]: Ting-a-ling-ling !
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 2]: Chow-ow-ow !
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 5]: Get out that head-line !
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 3]: LIVELY now !
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 13]: Come -- out with your spring-line -- what 're you about there !
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 12]: Take a turn round that stump with the bight of it !
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 11]: Stand by that stage , now -- let her go !
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 7]: Done with the engines , sir !
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 2]: Ting-a-ling-ling !
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 4]: SH ` T !
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 6]: S ` H ` T !
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 5]: SH ` T ! ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 6]: -LRB- trying the gauge-cocks -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 12]: Tom went on whitewashing -- paid no attention to the steamboat .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 11]: Ben stared a moment and then said : `` Hi-YI !
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 11]: YOU 'RE up a stump , ai n't you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 28]: Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist , then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result , as before .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 7]: Ben ranged up alongside of him .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 15]: Tom 's mouth watered for the apple , but he stuck to his work .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 17]: Ben said : `` Hello , old chap , you got to work , hey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 15]: Tom wheeled suddenly and said : `` Why , it 's you , Ben !
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 6]: I war n't noticing . ''
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 12]: `` Say -- I 'm going in a-swimming , I am .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 7]: Do n't you wish you could ?
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 12]: But of course you 'd druther WORK -- would n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 5]: Course you would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 18]: Tom contemplated the boy a bit , and said : `` What do you call work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 9]: `` Why , ai n't THAT work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 22]: Tom resumed his whitewashing , and answered carelessly : `` Well , maybe it is , and maybe it ai n't .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 12]: All I know , is , it suits Tom Sawyer . ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 19]: `` Oh come , now , you do n't mean to let on that you LIKE it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 6]: The brush continued to move .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 4]: `` Like it ?
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 14]: Well , I do n't see why I ought n't to like it .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 14]: Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 9]: That put the thing in a new light .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 6]: Ben stopped nibbling his apple .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 44]: Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth -- stepped back to note the effect -- added a touch here and there -- criticised the effect again -- Ben watching every move and getting more and more interested , more and more absorbed .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 16]: Presently he said : `` Say , Tom , let ME whitewash a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 29]: Tom considered , was about to consent ; but he altered his mind : `` No -- no -- I reckon it would n't hardly do , Ben .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 37]: You see , Aunt Polly 's awful particular about this fence -- right here on the street , you know -- but if it was the back fence I would n't mind and SHE would n't .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 48]: Yes , she 's awful particular about this fence ; it 's got to be done very careful ; I reckon there ai n't one boy in a thousand , maybe two thousand , that can do it the way it 's got to be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 7]: `` No -- is that so ?
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 10]: Oh come , now -- lem me just try .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 18]: Only just a little -- I 'd let YOU , if you was me , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 43]: `` Ben , I 'd like to , honest injun ; but Aunt Polly -- well , Jim wanted to do it , but she would n't let him ; Sid wanted to do it , and she would n't let Sid .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 10]: Now do n't you see how I 'm fixed ?
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 28]: If you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it -- '' `` Oh , shucks , I 'll be just as careful .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 5]: Now lem me try .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 13]: Say -- I 'll give you the core of my apple . ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 13]: `` Well , here -- No , Ben , now do n't .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 15]: I 'm afeard -- '' `` I 'll give you ALL of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 17]: Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face , but alacrity in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 43]: And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the sun , the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by , dangled his legs , munched his apple , and planned the slaughter of more innocents .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 24]: There was no lack of material ; boys happened along every little while ; they came to jeer , but remained to whitewash .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 59]: By the time Ben was fagged out , Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite , in good repair ; and when he played out , Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with -- and so on , and so on , hour after hour .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 26]: And when the middle of the afternoon came , from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning , Tom was literally rolling in wealth .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 97]: He had besides the things before mentioned , twelve marbles , part of a jews-harp , a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through , a spool cannon , a key that would n't unlock anything , a fragment of chalk , a glass stopper of a decanter , a tin soldier , a couple of tadpoles , six fire-crackers , a kitten with only one eye , a brass doorknob , a dog-collar -- but no dog -- the handle of a knife , four pieces of orange-peel , and a dilapidated old window sash .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 29]: He had had a nice , good , idle time all the while -- plenty of company -- and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it !
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 18]: If he had n't run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 16]: Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world , after all .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 42]: He had discovered a great law of human action , without knowing it -- namely , that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing , it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 48]: If he had been a great and wise philosopher , like the writer of this book , he would now have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is OBLIGED to do , and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 30]: And this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread-mill is work , while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 53]: There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line , in the summer , because the privilege costs them considerable money ; but if they were offered wages for the service , that would turn it into work and then they would resign .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 25]: The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place in his worldly circumstances , and then wended toward headquarters to report .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 35]: CHAPTER III TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly , who was sitting by an open window in a pleasant rearward apartment , which was bedroom , breakfast-room , dining-room , and library , combined .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 52]: The balmy summer air , the restful quiet , the odor of the flowers , and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect , and she was nodding over her knitting -- for she had no company but the cat , and it was asleep in her lap .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 12]: Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 29]: She had thought that of course Tom had deserted long ago , and she wondered at seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 15]: He said : `` May n't I go and play now , aunt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 7]: `` What , a ` ready ?
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 7]: How much have you done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 9]: `` It 's all done , aunt . ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 16]: `` Tom , do n't lie to me -- I ca n't bear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 13]: `` I ai n't , aunt ; it IS all done . ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 9]: Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 20]: She went out to see for herself ; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 6]: of Tom 's statement true .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 33]: When she found the entire fence whitewashed , and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated , and even a streak added to the ground , her astonishment was almost unspeakable .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 9]: She said : `` Well , I never !
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 20]: There 's no getting round it , you can work when you 're a mind to , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 27]: And then she diluted the compliment by adding , `` But it 's powerful seldom you 're a mind to , I 'm bound to say .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 26]: Well , go ` long and play ; but mind you get back some time in a week , or I 'll tan you . ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 53]: She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him , along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 17]: And while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish , he `` hooked '' a doughnut .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 25]: Then he skipped out , and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway that led to the back rooms on the second floor .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 14]: Clods were handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 41]: They raged around Sid like a hail-storm ; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue , six or seven clods had taken personal effect , and Tom was over the fence and gone .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 22]: There was a gate , but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 26]: His soul was at peace , now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 23]: Tom skirted the block , and came round into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunt 's cow-stable .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 40]: He presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment , and hastened toward the public square of the village , where two `` military '' companies of boys had met for conflict , according to previous appointment .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 21]: Tom was General of one of these armies , Joe Harper -LRB- a bosom friend -RRB- General of the other .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 39]: These two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person -- that being better suited to the still smaller fry -- but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 15]: Tom 's army won a great victory , after a long and hard-fought battle .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 44]: Then the dead were counted , prisoners exchanged , the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon , and the day for the necessary battle appointed ; after which the armies fell into line and marched away , and Tom turned homeward alone .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 41]: As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived , he saw a new girl in the garden -- a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow hair plaited into two long-tails , white summer frock and embroidered pantalettes .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 9]: The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 19]: A certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 28]: He had thought he loved her to distraction ; he had regarded his passion as adoration ; and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 55]: He had been months winning her ; she had confessed hardly a week ago ; he had been the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days , and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 51]: He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye , till he saw that she had discovered him ; then he pretended he did not know she was present , and began to `` show off '' in all sorts of absurd boyish ways , in order to win her admiration .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 42]: He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time ; but by-and-by , while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances , he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the house .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 22]: Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it , grieving , and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 14]: She halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 14]: Tom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 23]: But his face lit up , right away , for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 43]: The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower , and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 73]: Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose , with his head tilted far back ; and as he moved from side to side , in his efforts , he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy ; finally his bare foot rested upon it , his pliant toes closed upon it , and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 43]: But only for a minute -- only while he could button the flower inside his jacket , next his heart -- or next his stomach , possibly , for he was not much posted in anatomy , and not hypercritical , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 55]: He returned , now , and hung about the fence till nightfall , `` showing off , '' as before ; but the girl never exhibited herself again , though Tom comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some window , meantime , and been aware of his attentions .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 14]: Finally he strode home reluctantly , with his poor head full of visions .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 21]: All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered `` what had got into the child . ''
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 20]: He took a good scolding about clodding Sid , and did not seem to mind it in the least .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 20]: He tried to steal sugar under his aunt 's very nose , and got his knuckles rapped for it .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 17]: He said : `` Aunt , you do n't whack Sid when he takes it . ''
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 14]: `` Well , Sid do n't torment a body the way you do .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 15]: You 'd be always into that sugar if I war n't watching you . ''
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 31]: Presently she stepped into the kitchen , and Sid , happy in his immunity , reached for the sugar-bowl -- a sort of glorying over Tom which was wellnigh unbearable .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 12]: But Sid 's fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 5]: Tom was in ecstasies .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 13]: In such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 59]: He said to himself that he would not speak a word , even when his aunt came in , but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief ; and then he would tell , and there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model `` catch it . ''
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 32]: He was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 12]: He said to himself , `` Now it 's coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 11]: And the next instant he was sprawling on the floor !
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 27]: The potent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom cried out : `` Hold on , now , what ` er you belting ME for ?
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 6]: -- Sid broke it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 13]: Aunt Polly paused , perplexed , and Tom looked for healing pity .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 15]: But when she got her tongue again , she only said : `` Umf !
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 13]: Well , you did n't get a lick amiss , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 17]: You been into some other audacious mischief when I was n't around , like enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 40]: Then her conscience reproached her , and she yearned to say something kind and loving ; but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong , and discipline forbade that .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 15]: So she kept silence , and went about her affairs with a troubled heart .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 10]: Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 26]: He knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him , and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 14]: He would hang out no signals , he would take notice of none .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 27]: He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him , now and then , through a film of tears , but he refused recognition of it .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 36]: He pictured himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word , but he would turn his face to the wall , and die with that word unsaid .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 8]: Ah , how would she feel then ?
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 25]: And he pictured himself brought home from the river , dead , with his curls all wet , and his sore heart at rest .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 39]: How she would throw herself upon him , and how her tears would fall like rain , and her lips pray God to give her back her boy and she would never , never abuse him any more !
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 25]: But he would lie there cold and white and make no sign -- a poor little sufferer , whose griefs were at an end .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 55]: He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams , that he had to keep swallowing , he was so like to choke ; and his eyes swam in a blur of water , which overflowed when he winked , and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 95]: And such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows , that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it ; it was too sacred for such contact ; and so , presently , when his cousin Mary danced in , all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit of one week to the country , he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 22]: He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys , and sought desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 53]: A log raft in the river invited him , and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream , wishing , the while , that he could only be drowned , all at once and unconsciously , without undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 7]: Then he thought of his flower .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 17]: He got it out , rumpled and wilted , and it mightily increased his dismal felicity .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 11]: He wondered if she would pity him if she knew ?
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 22]: Would she cry , and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him ?
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 12]: Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world ?
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 36]: This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and varied lights , till he wore it threadbare .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 12]: At last he rose up sighing and departed in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 47]: About half-past nine or ten o'clock he came along the deserted street to where the Adored Unknown lived ; he paused a moment ; no sound fell upon his listening ear ; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain of a second-story window .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 6]: Was the sacred presence there ?
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 62]: He climbed the fence , threaded his stealthy way through the plants , till he stood under that window ; he looked up at it long , and with emotion ; then he laid him down on the ground under it , disposing himself upon his back , with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 45]: And thus he would die -- out in the cold world , with no shelter over his homeless head , no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow , no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 18]: And thus SHE would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning , and oh !
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 34]: would she drop one little tear upon his poor , lifeless form , would she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted , so untimely cut down ?
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 27]: The window went up , a maid-servant 's discordant voice profaned the holy calm , and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr 's remains !
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 10]: The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 45]: There was a whiz as of a missile in the air , mingled with the murmur of a curse , a sound as of shivering glass followed , and a small , vague form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 64]: Not long after , as Tom , all undressed for bed , was surveying his drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip , Sid woke up ; but if he had any dim idea of making any `` references to allusions , '' he thought better of it and held his peace , for there was danger in Tom 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 19]: Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers , and Sid made mental note of the omission .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 21]: CHAPTER IV THE sun rose upon a tranquil world , and beamed down upon the peaceful village like a benediction .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 55]: Breakfast over , Aunt Polly had family worship : it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid courses of Scriptural quotations , welded together with a thin mortar of originality ; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of the Mosaic Law , as from Sinai .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 22]: Then Tom girded up his loins , so to speak , and went to work to `` get his verses . ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 8]: Sid had learned his lesson days before .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 33]: Tom bent all his energies to the memorizing of five verses , and he chose part of the Sermon on the Mount , because he could find no verses that were shorter .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 42]: At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson , but no more , for his mind was traversing the whole field of human thought , and his hands were busy with distracting recreations .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 79]: Mary took his book to hear him recite , and he tried to find his way through the fog : `` Blessed are the -- a -- a -- '' `` Poor '' -- `` Yes -- poor ; blessed are the poor -- a -- a -- '' `` In spirit -- '' `` In spirit ; blessed are the poor in spirit , for they -- they -- '' `` THEIRS -- '' `` For THEIRS .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 15]: Blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 49]: Blessed are they that mourn , for they -- they -- '' `` Sh -- '' `` For they -- a -- '' `` S , H , A -- '' `` For they S , H -- Oh , I do n't know what it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 4]: `` SHALL ! ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 5]: `` Oh , SHALL !
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 44]: for they shall -- for they shall -- a -- a -- shall mourn -- a -- a -- blessed are they that shall -- they that -- a -- they that shall mourn , for they shall -- a -- shall WHAT ?
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 9]: Why do n't you tell me , Mary ?
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 12]: -- what do you want to be so mean for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 16]: `` Oh , Tom , you poor thick-headed thing , I 'm not teasing you .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 6]: I would n't do that .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 8]: You must go and learn it again .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 27]: Do n't you be discouraged , Tom , you 'll manage it -- and if you do , I 'll give you something ever so nice .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 11]: There , now , that 's a good boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 4]: `` All right !
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 13]: What is it , Mary , tell me what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 7]: `` Never you mind , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 14]: You know if I say it 's nice , it is nice . ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 10]: `` You bet you that 's so , Mary .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 10]: All right , I 'll tackle it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 32]: And he did `` tackle it again '' -- and under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a shining success .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 31]: Mary gave him a brand-new `` Barlow '' knife worth twelve and a half cents ; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system shook him to his foundations .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 58]: True , the knife would not cut anything , but it was a `` sure-enough '' Barlow , and there was inconceivable grandeur in that -- though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 28]: Tom contrived to scarify the cupboard with it , and was arranging to begin on the bureau , when he was called off to dress for Sunday-school .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 77]: Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap , and he went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there ; then he dipped the soap in the water and laid it down ; turned up his sleeves ; poured out the water on the ground , gently , and then entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 17]: But Mary removed the towel and said : `` Now ai n't you ashamed , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 7]: You must n't be so bad .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 7]: Water wo n't hurt you . ''
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 6]: Tom was a trifle disconcerted .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 27]: The basin was refilled , and this time he stood over it a little while , gathering resolution ; took in a big breath and began .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 33]: When he entered the kitchen presently , with both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands , an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 55]: But when he emerged from the towel , he was not yet satisfactory , for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws , like a mask ; below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 47]: Mary took him in hand , and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother , without distinction of color , and his saturated hair was neatly brushed , and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 41]: -LSB- He privately smoothed out the curls , with labor and difficulty , and plastered his hair close down to his head ; for he held curls to be effeminate , and his own filled his life with bitterness . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 42]: Then Mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years -- they were simply called his `` other clothes '' -- and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 46]: The girl `` put him to rights '' after he had dressed himself ; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin , turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders , brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 8]: He now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 23]: He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked ; for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 32]: He hoped that Mary would forget his shoes , but the hope was blighted ; she coated them thoroughly with tallow , as was the custom , and brought them out .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 21]: He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he did n't want to do .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 18]: But Mary said , persuasively : `` Please , Tom -- that 's a good boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 8]: So he got into the shoes snarling .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 33]: Mary was soon ready , and the three children set out for Sunday-school -- a place that Tom hated with his whole heart ; but Sid and Mary were fond of it .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 14]: Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten ; and then church service .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 22]: Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily , and the other always remained too -- for stronger reasons .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 39]: The church 's high-backed , uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons ; the edifice was but a small , plain affair , with a sort of pine board tree-box on top of it for a steeple .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 25]: At the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade : `` Say , Billy , got a yaller ticket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 9]: `` What 'll you take for her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 7]: `` What 'll you give ? ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 9]: `` Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook . ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 6]: `` Less see 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 3]: Tom exhibited .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 10]: They were satisfactory , and the property changed hands .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 26]: Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets , and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 22]: He waylaid other boys as they came , and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 34]: He entered the church , now , with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls , proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 60]: The teacher , a grave , elderly man , interfered ; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy 's hair in the next bench , and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around ; stuck a pin in another boy , presently , in order to hear him say `` Ouch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 9]: and got a new reprimand from his teacher .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 16]: Tom 's whole class were of a pattern -- restless , noisy , and troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 25]: When they came to recite their lessons , not one of them knew his verses perfectly , but had to be prompted all along .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 38]: However , they worried through , and each got his reward -- in small blue tickets , each with a passage of Scripture on it ; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 48]: Ten blue tickets equalled a red one , and could be exchanged for it ; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one ; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible -LRB- worth forty cents in those easy times -RRB- to the pupil .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 23]: How many of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses , even for a Dore Bible ?
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 32]: And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way -- it was the patient work of two years -- and a boy of German parentage had won four or five .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 69]: He once recited three thousand verses without stopping ; but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great , and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth -- a grievous misfortune for the school , for on great occasions , before company , the superintendent -LRB- as Tom expressed it -RRB- had always made this boy come out and `` spread himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 71]: Only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible , and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance ; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar 's heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 40]: It is possible that Tom 's mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes , but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 32]: In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit , with a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves , and commanded attention .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 69]: When a Sunday-school superintendent makes his customary little speech , a hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert -- though why , is a mystery : for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 131]: This superintendent was a slim creature of thirty-five , with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair ; he wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth -- a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead , and a turning of the whole body when a side view was required ; his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note , and had fringed ends ; his boot toes were turned sharply up , in the fashion of the day , like sleigh-runners -- an effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 54]: Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien , and very sincere and honest at heart ; and he held sacred things and places in such reverence , and so separated them from worldly matters , that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 38]: He began after this fashion : `` Now , children , I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 6]: There -- that is it .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 12]: That is the way good little boys and girls should do .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 39]: I see one little girl who is looking out of the window -- I am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere -- perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 5]: -LSB- Applausive titter . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 36]: I want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright , clean little faces assembled in a place like this , learning to do right and be good . ''
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 7]: And so forth and so on .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 13]: It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 19]: It was of a pattern which does not vary , and so it is familiar to us all .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 49]: The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys , and by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide , washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 31]: But now every sound ceased suddenly , with the subsidence of Mr. Walters ' voice , and the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 59]: A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more or less rare -- the entrance of visitors : lawyer Thatcher , accompanied by a very feeble and aged man ; a fine , portly , middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair ; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 7]: The lady was leading a child .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 32]: Tom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings ; conscience-smitten , too -- he could not meet Amy Lawrence 's eye , he could not brook her loving gaze .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 18]: But when he saw this small new-comer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 42]: The next moment he was `` showing off '' with all his might -- cuffing boys , pulling hair , making faces -- in a word , using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 40]: His exaltation had but one alloy -- the memory of his humiliation in this angel 's garden -- and that record in sand was fast washing out , under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 28]: The visitors were given the highest seat of honor , and as soon as Mr. Walters ' speech was finished , he introduced them to the school .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 62]: The middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage -- no less a one than the county judge -- altogether the most august creation these children had ever looked upon -- and they wondered what kind of material he was made of -- and they half wanted to hear him roar , and were half afraid he might , too .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 38]: He was from Constantinople , twelve miles away -- so he had travelled , and seen the world -- these very eyes had looked upon the county court-house -- which was said to have a tin roof .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 19]: The awe which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the ranks of staring eyes .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 13]: This was the great Judge Thatcher , brother of their own lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 20]: Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward , to be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 20]: It would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings : `` Look at him , Jim !
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 7]: He 's a going up there .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 4]: Say -- look !
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 17]: he 's a going to shake hands with him -- he IS shaking hands with him !
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 12]: By jings , do n't you wish you was Jeff ? ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 38]: Mr. Walters fell to `` showing off , '' with all sorts of official bustlings and activities , giving orders , delivering judgments , discharging directions here , there , everywhere that he could find a target .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 32]: The librarian `` showed off '' -- running hither and thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 33]: The young lady teachers `` showed off '' -- bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed , lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 67]: The young gentlemen teachers `` showed off '' with small scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to discipline -- and most of the teachers , of both sexes , found business up at the library , by the pulpit ; and it was business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times -LRB- with much seeming vexation -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 36]: The little girls `` showed off '' in various ways , and the little boys `` showed off '' with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 40]: And above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house , and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur -- for he was `` showing off , '' too .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 28]: There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters ' ecstasy complete , and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 23]: Several pupils had a few yellow tickets , but none had enough -- he had been around among the star pupils inquiring .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 20]: He would have given worlds , now , to have that German lad back again with a sound mind .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 34]: And now at this moment , when hope was dead , Tom Sawyer came forward with nine yellow tickets , nine red tickets , and ten blue ones , and demanded a Bible .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 10]: This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 15]: Walters was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten years .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 22]: But there was no getting around it -- here were the certified checks , and they were good for their face .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 24]: Tom was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other elect , and the great news was announced from headquarters .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 44]: It was the most stunning surprise of the decade , and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one 's altitude , and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of one .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 47]: The boys were all eaten up with envy -- but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 20]: These despised themselves , as being the dupes of a wily fraud , a guileful snake in the grass .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 83]: The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the superintendent could pump up under the circumstances ; but it lacked somewhat of the true gush , for the poor fellow 's instinct taught him that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light , perhaps ; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises -- a dozen would strain his capacity , without a doubt .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 25]: Amy Lawrence was proud and glad , and she tried to make Tom see it in her face -- but he would n't look .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 55]: She wondered ; then she was just a grain troubled ; next a dim suspicion came and went -- came again ; she watched ; a furtive glance told her worlds -- and then her heart broke , and she was jealous , and angry , and the tears came and she hated everybody .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 9]: Tom most of all -LRB- she thought -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 41]: Tom was introduced to the Judge ; but his tongue was tied , his breath would hardly come , his heart quaked -- partly because of the awful greatness of the man , but mainly because he was her parent .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 18]: He would have liked to fall down and worship him , if it were in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 25]: The Judge put his hand on Tom 's head and called him a fine little man , and asked him what his name was .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 15]: The boy stammered , gasped , and got it out : `` Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 16]: `` Oh , no , not Tom -- it is -- '' `` Thomas . ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 7]: `` Ah , that 's it .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 10]: I thought there was more to it , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 5]: That 's very well .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 21]: But you 've another one I daresay , and you 'll tell it to me , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 19]: `` Tell the gentleman your other name , Thomas , '' said Walters , `` and say sir .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 8]: You must n't forget your manners . ''
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 7]: `` Thomas Sawyer -- sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 5]: `` That 's it !
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 6]: That 's a good boy .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 3]: Fine boy .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 6]: Fine , manly little fellow .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 14]: Two thousand verses is a great many -- very , very great many .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 142]: And you never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them ; for knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world ; it 's what makes great men and good men ; you 'll be a great man and a good man yourself , some day , Thomas , and then you 'll look back and say , It 's all owing to the precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood -- it 's all owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn -- it 's all owing to the good superintendent , who encouraged me , and watched over me , and gave me a beautiful Bible -- a splendid elegant Bible -- to keep and have it all for my own , always -- it 's all owing to right bringing up !
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 28]: That is what you will say , Thomas -- and you would n't take any money for those two thousand verses -- no indeed you would n't .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 37]: And now you would n't mind telling me and this lady some of the things you 've learned -- no , I know you would n't -- for we are proud of little boys that learn .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 14]: Now , no doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 16]: Wo n't you tell us the names of the first two that were appointed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 10]: Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 10]: He blushed , now , and his eyes fell .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 8]: Mr. Walters ' heart sank within him .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 25]: He said to himself , it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest question -- why DID the Judge ask him ?
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 23]: Yet he felt obliged to speak up and say : `` Answer the gentleman , Thomas -- do n't be afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 5]: Tom still hung fire .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 14]: `` Now I know you 'll tell me , '' said the lady .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 17]: `` The names of the first two disciples were -- '' `` DAVID AND GOLIAH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 14]: Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 28]: CHAPTER V ABOUT half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring , and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 22]: The Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and occupied pews with their parents , so as to be under supervision .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 43]: Aunt Polly came , and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her -- Tom being placed next the aisle , in order that he might be as far away from the open window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 194]: The crowd filed up the aisles : the aged and needy postmaster , who had seen better days ; the mayor and his wife -- for they had a mayor there , among other unnecessaries ; the justice of the peace ; the widow Douglass , fair , smart , and forty , a generous , good-hearted soul and well-to-do , her hill mansion the only palace in the town , and the most hospitable and much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could boast ; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward ; lawyer Riverson , the new notable from a distance ; next the belle of the village , followed by a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers ; then all the young clerks in town in a body -- for they had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane-heads , a circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers , till the last girl had run their gantlet ; and last of all came the Model Boy , Willie Mufferson , taking as heedful care of his mother as if she were cut glass .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 17]: He always brought his mother to church , and was the pride of all the matrons .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 11]: The boys all hated him , he was so good .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 15]: And besides , he had been `` thrown up to them '' so much .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 18]: His white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind , as usual on Sundays -- accidentally .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 15]: Tom had no handkerchief , and he looked upon boys who had as snobs .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 45]: The congregation being fully assembled , now , the bell rang once more , to warn laggards and stragglers , and then a solemn hush fell upon the church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir in the gallery .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 10]: The choir always tittered and whispered all through service .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 21]: There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred , but I have forgotten where it was , now .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 27]: It was a great many years ago , and I can scarcely remember anything about it , but I think it was in some foreign country .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 30]: The minister gave out the hymn , and read it through with a relish , in a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 69]: His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a certain point , where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged down as if from a spring-board : Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies , on flow ` ry BEDS of ease , Whilst others fight to win the prize , and sail thro ' BLOODY seas ?
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 8]: He was regarded as a wonderful reader .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 74]: At church `` sociables '' he was always called upon to read poetry ; and when he was through , the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps , and `` wall '' their eyes , and shake their heads , as much as to say , `` Words can not express it ; it is too beautiful , TOO beautiful for this mortal earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 68]: After the hymn had been sung , the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a bulletin-board , and read off `` notices '' of meetings and societies and things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of doom -- a queer custom which is still kept up in America , even in cities , away here in this age of abundant newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 22]: Often , the less there is to justify a traditional custom , the harder it is to get rid of it .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 6]: And now the minister prayed .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 176]: A good , generous prayer it was , and went into details : it pleaded for the church , and the little children of the church ; for the other churches of the village ; for the village itself ; for the county ; for the State ; for the State officers ; for the United States ; for the churches of the United States ; for Congress ; for the President ; for the officers of the Government ; for poor sailors , tossed by stormy seas ; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of European monarchies and Oriental despotisms ; for such as have the light and the good tidings , and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal ; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea ; and closed with a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace and favor , and be as seed sown in fertile ground , yielding in time a grateful harvest of good .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 2]: Amen .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 14]: There was a rustling of dresses , and the standing congregation sat down .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 25]: The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer , he only endured it -- if he even did that much .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 72]: He was restive all through it ; he kept tally of the details of the prayer , unconsciously -- for he was not listening , but he knew the ground of old , and the clergyman 's regular route over it -- and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded , his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it ; he considered additions unfair , and scoundrelly .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 102]: In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together , embracing its head with its arms , and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body , and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view ; scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails ; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 43]: As indeed it was ; for as sorely as Tom 's hands itched to grab for it they did not dare -- he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 31]: But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward ; and the instant the `` Amen '' was out the fly was a prisoner of war .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 12]: His aunt detected the act and made him let it go .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 60]: The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod -- and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 30]: Tom counted the pages of the sermon ; after church he always knew how many pages there had been , but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 13]: However , this time he was really interested for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 38]: The minister made a grand and moving picture of the assembling together of the world 's hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead them .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 62]: But the pathos , the lesson , the moral of the great spectacle were lost upon the boy ; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the principal character before the on-looking nations ; his face lit with the thought , and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child , if it was a tame lion .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 14]: Now he lapsed into suffering again , as the dry argument was resumed .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 14]: Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 19]: It was a large black beetle with formidable jaws -- a `` pinchbug , '' he called it .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 7]: It was in a percussion-cap box .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 14]: The first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 29]: A natural fillip followed , the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back , and the hurt finger went into the boy 's mouth .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 14]: The beetle lay there working its helpless legs , unable to turn over .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 18]: Tom eyed it , and longed for it ; but it was safe out of his reach .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 18]: Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle , and they eyed it too .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 30]: Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling along , sad at heart , lazy with the summer softness and the quiet , weary of captivity , sighing for change .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 12]: He spied the beetle ; the drooping tail lifted and wagged .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 86]: He surveyed the prize ; walked around it ; smelt at it from a safe distance ; walked around it again ; grew bolder , and took a closer smell ; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it , just missing it ; made another , and another ; began to enjoy the diversion ; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws , and continued his experiments ; grew weary at last , and then indifferent and absent-minded .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 20]: His head nodded , and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy , who seized it .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 32]: There was a sharp yelp , a flirt of the poodle 's head , and the beetle fell a couple of yards away , and lit on its back once more .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 24]: The neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy , several faces went behind fans and handkerchiefs , and Tom was entirely happy .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 26]: The dog looked foolish , and probably felt so ; but there was resentment in his heart , too , and a craving for revenge .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 56]: So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again ; jumping at it from every point of a circle , lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the creature , making even closer snatches at it with his teeth , and jerking his head till his ears flapped again .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 57]: But he grew tired once more , after a while ; tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief ; followed an ant around , with his nose close to the floor , and quickly wearied of that ; yawned , sighed , forgot the beetle entirely , and sat down on it .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 84]: Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle ; the yelps continued , and so did the dog ; he crossed the house in front of the altar ; he flew down the other aisle ; he crossed before the doors ; he clamored up the home-stretch ; his anguish grew with his progress , till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 40]: At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course , and sprang into its master 's lap ; he flung it out of the window , and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 24]: By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with suppressed laughter , and the sermon had come to a dead standstill .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 58]: The discourse was resumed presently , but it went lame and halting , all possibility of impressiveness being at an end ; for even the gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth , under cover of some remote pew-back , as if the poor parson had said a rarely facetious thing .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 19]: It was a genuine relief to the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 28]: Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful , thinking to himself that there was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety in it .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 34]: He had but one marring thought ; he was willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug , but he did not think it was upright in him to carry it off .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 9]: CHAPTER VI MONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 18]: Monday morning always found him so -- because it began another week 's slow suffering in school .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 28]: He generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday , it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 4]: Tom lay thinking .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 20]: Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was sick ; then he could stay home from school .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 6]: Here was a vague possibility .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 5]: He canvassed his system .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 10]: No ailment was found , and he investigated again .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 20]: This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms , and he began to encourage them with considerable hope .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 12]: But they soon grew feeble , and presently died wholly away .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 4]: He reflected further .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 5]: Suddenly he discovered something .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 9]: One of his upper front teeth was loose .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 50]: This was lucky ; he was about to begin to groan , as a `` starter , '' as he called it , when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument , his aunt would pull it out , and that would hurt .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 18]: So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present , and seek further .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 38]: Nothing offered for some little time , and then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 19]: So the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 10]: But now he did not know the necessary symptoms .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 20]: However , it seemed well worth while to chance it , so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 6]: But Sid slept on unconscious .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 16]: Tom groaned louder , and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 5]: No result from Sid .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 10]: Tom was panting with his exertions by this time .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 17]: He took a rest and then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 4]: Sid snored on .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 4]: Tom was aggravated .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 9]: He said , `` Sid , Sid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 4]: and shook him .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 12]: This course worked well , and Tom began to groan again .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 23]: Sid yawned , stretched , then brought himself up on his elbow with a snort , and began to stare at Tom .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 5]: Tom went on groaning .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 6]: Sid said : `` Tom !
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 5]: Say , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 5]: -LSB- No response . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 5]: `` Here , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 2]: TOM !
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 8]: What is the matter , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 11]: And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 12]: Tom moaned out : `` Oh , do n't , Sid .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 6]: Do n't joggle me . ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 10]: `` Why , what 's the matter , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 6]: I must call auntie . ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 6]: `` No -- never mind .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 10]: It 'll be over by and by , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 6]: Do n't call anybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 5]: `` But I must !
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 11]: DO N'T groan so , Tom , it 's awful .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 8]: How long you been this way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 3]: `` Hours .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 2]: Ouch !
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 15]: Oh , do n't stir so , Sid , you 'll kill me . ''
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 11]: `` Tom , why did n't you wake me sooner ?
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 7]: Oh , Tom , DO N'T !
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 9]: It makes my flesh crawl to hear you .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 8]: Tom , what is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 8]: `` I forgive you everything , Sid .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 4]: -LSB- Groan . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 8]: Everything you 've ever done to me .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 19]: When I 'm gone -- '' `` Oh , Tom , you ai n't dying , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 10]: Do n't , Tom -- oh , do n't .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 10]: Maybe -- '' `` I forgive everybody , Sid .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 4]: -LSB- Groan . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 6]: Tell 'em so , Sid .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 37]: And Sid , you give my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that 's come to town , and tell her -- '' But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 26]: Tom was suffering in reality , now , so handsomely was his imagination working , and so his groans had gathered quite a genuine tone .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 14]: Sid flew down-stairs and said : `` Oh , Aunt Polly , come !
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 5]: Tom 's dying ! ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 4]: `` Dying ! ''
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 4]: `` Yes 'm .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 8]: Do n't wait -- come quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 3]: `` Rubbage !
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 7]: I do n't believe it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 15]: But she fled up-stairs , nevertheless , with Sid and Mary at her heels .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 13]: And her face grew white , too , and her lip trembled .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 14]: When she reached the bedside she gasped out : `` You , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 10]: Tom , what 's the matter with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 27]: `` Oh , auntie , I 'm -- '' `` What 's the matter with you -- what is the matter with you , child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 12]: `` Oh , auntie , my sore toe 's mortified ! ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 23]: The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little , then cried a little , then did both together .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 18]: This restored her and she said : `` Tom , what a turn you did give me .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 13]: Now you shut up that nonsense and climb out of this . ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 11]: The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 32]: The boy felt a little foolish , and he said : `` Aunt Polly , it SEEMED mortified , and it hurt so I never minded my tooth at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 6]: `` Your tooth , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 9]: What 's the matter with your tooth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 14]: `` One of them 's loose , and it aches perfectly awful . ''
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 14]: `` There , there , now , do n't begin that groaning again .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 4]: Open your mouth .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 17]: Well -- your tooth IS loose , but you 're not going to die about that .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 19]: Mary , get me a silk thread , and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen . ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 16]: Tom said : `` Oh , please , auntie , do n't pull it out .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 7]: It do n't hurt any more .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 10]: I wish I may never stir if it does .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 6]: Please do n't , auntie .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 11]: I do n't want to stay home from school . ''
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 11]: `` Oh , you do n't , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 20]: So all this row was because you thought you 'd get to stay home from school and go a-fishing ?
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 28]: Tom , Tom , I love you so , and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your outrageousness . ''
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 9]: By this time the dental instruments were ready .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 26]: The old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom 's tooth with a loop and tied the other to the bedpost .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 18]: Then she seized the chunk of fire and suddenly thrust it almost into the boy 's face .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 10]: The tooth hung dangling by the bedpost , now .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 7]: But all trials bring their compensations .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 37]: As Tom wended to school after breakfast , he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable way .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 47]: He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition ; and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and homage up to this time , now found himself suddenly without an adherent , and shorn of his glory .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 37]: His heart was heavy , and he said with a disdain which he did not feel that it was n't anything to spit like Tom Sawyer ; but another boy said , `` Sour grapes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 8]: and he wandered away a dismantled hero .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 20]: Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village , Huckleberry Finn , son of the town drunkard .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 50]: Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town , because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad -- and because all their children admired him so , and delighted in his forbidden society , and wished they dared to be like him .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 31]: Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys , in that he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition , and was under strict orders not to play with him .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 12]: So he played with him every time he got a chance .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 23]: Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown men , and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 69]: His hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim ; his coat , when he wore one , hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the back ; but one suspender supported his trousers ; the seat of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing , the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled up .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 11]: Huckleberry came and went , at his own free will .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 111]: He slept on doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet ; he did not have to go to school or to church , or call any being master or obey anybody ; he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose , and stay as long as it suited him ; nobody forbade him to fight ; he could sit up as late as he pleased ; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the fall ; he never had to wash , nor put on clean clothes ; he could swear wonderfully .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 15]: In a word , everything that goes to make life precious that boy had .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 13]: So thought every harassed , hampered , respectable boy in St. Petersburg .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 12]: Tom hailed the romantic outcast : `` Hello , Huckleberry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 12]: `` Hello yourself , and see how you like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 8]: `` What 's that you got ? ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 5]: `` Dead cat . ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 8]: `` Lem me see him , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 7]: My , he 's pretty stiff .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 7]: Where 'd you get him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 9]: `` Bought him off 'n a boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 7]: `` What did you give ? ''
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 17]: `` I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house . ''
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 10]: `` Where 'd you get the blue ticket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 15]: `` Bought it off 'n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick . ''
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 13]: `` Say -- what is dead cats good for , Huck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 4]: `` Good for ?
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 5]: Cure warts with . ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 4]: Is that so ?
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 8]: I know something that 's better . ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 7]: `` I bet you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 6]: `` Why , spunk-water . ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 3]: `` Spunk-water !
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 10]: I would n't give a dern for spunk-water . ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 9]: `` You would n't , would n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 6]: D'you ever try it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 7]: `` No , I hai n't .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 6]: But Bob Tanner did . ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 7]: `` Who told you so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 38]: `` Why , he told Jeff Thatcher , and Jeff told Johnny Baker , and Johnny told Jim Hollis , and Jim told Ben Rogers , and Ben told a nigger , and the nigger told me .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 4]: There now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 7]: `` Well , what of it ?
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 5]: They 'll all lie .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 6]: Leastways all but the nigger .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 6]: I do n't know HIM .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 11]: But I never see a nigger that WOULD N'T lie .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 2]: Shucks !
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 13]: Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it , Huck . ''
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 19]: `` Why , he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water was . ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 6]: `` In the daytime ? ''
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 4]: `` Certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 9]: `` With his face to the stump ? ''
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 6]: Least I reckon so . ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 7]: `` Did he say anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 8]: `` I do n't reckon he did .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 6]: I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 3]: `` Aha !
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 16]: Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool way as that !
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 11]: Why , that ai n't a-going to do any good .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 89]: You got to go all by yourself , to the middle of the woods , where you know there 's a spunk-water stump , and just as it 's midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say : ` Barley-corn , barley-corn , injun-meal shorts , Spunk-water , spunk-water , swaller these warts , ' and then walk away quick , eleven steps , with your eyes shut , and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 10]: Because if you speak the charm 's busted . ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 21]: `` Well , that sounds like a good way ; but that ai n't the way Bob Tanner done . ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 40]: `` No , sir , you can bet he did n't , becuz he 's the wartiest boy in this town ; and he would n't have a wart on him if he 'd knowed how to work spunk-water .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 16]: I 've took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 15]: I play with frogs so much that I 've always got considerable many warts .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 10]: Sometimes I take 'em off with a bean . ''
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 7]: `` Yes , bean 's good .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 6]: I 've done that . ''
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 4]: `` Have you ?
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 6]: What 's your way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 64]: `` You take and split the bean , and cut the wart so as to get some blood , and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury it ` bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the moon , and then you burn up the rest of the bean .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 45]: You see that piece that 's got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing , trying to fetch the other piece to it , and so that helps the blood to draw the wart , and pretty soon off she comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 37]: `` Yes , that 's it , Huck -- that 's it ; though when you 're burying it if you say ` Down bean ; off wart ; come no more to bother me ! '
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 4]: it 's better .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 19]: That 's the way Joe Harper does , and he 's been nearly to Coonville and most everywheres .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 13]: But say -- how do you cure 'em with dead cats ? ''
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 103]: `` Why , you take your cat and go and get in the graveyard ` long about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried ; and when it 's midnight a devil will come , or maybe two or three , but you ca n't see 'em , you can only hear something like the wind , or maybe hear 'em talk ; and when they 're taking that feller away , you heave your cat after 'em and say , ` Devil follow corpse , cat follow devil , warts follow cat , I 'm done with ye ! '
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 7]: That 'll fetch ANY wart . ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 4]: `` Sounds right .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 8]: D'you ever try it , Huck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 11]: `` No , but old Mother Hopkins told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 11]: `` Well , I reckon it 's so , then .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 9]: Becuz they say she 's a witch . ''
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 3]: `` Say !
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 9]: Why , Tom , I KNOW she is .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 4]: She witched pap .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 7]: Pap says so his own self .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 34]: He come along one day , and he see she was a-witching him , so he took up a rock , and if she had n't dodged , he 'd a got her .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 25]: Well , that very night he rolled off 'n a shed wher ' he was a layin drunk , and broke his arm . ''
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 7]: `` Why , that 's awful .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 10]: How did he know she was a-witching him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 9]: `` Lord , pap can tell , easy .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 16]: Pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy , they 're a-witching you .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 5]: Specially if they mumble .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 14]: Becuz when they mumble they 're saying the Lord 's Prayer backards . ''
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 14]: `` Say , Hucky , when you going to try the cat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 3]: `` To-night .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 12]: I reckon they 'll come after old Hoss Williams to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 7]: `` But they buried him Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 9]: Did n't they get him Saturday night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 7]: `` Why , how you talk !
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 8]: How could their charms work till midnight ?
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 7]: -- and THEN it 's Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 16]: Devils do n't slosh around much of a Sunday , I do n't reckon . ''
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 7]: `` I never thought of that .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 4]: That 's so .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 7]: Lem me go with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 11]: `` Of course -- if you ai n't afeard . ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 3]: `` Afeard !
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 5]: ` Tai n't likely .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 5]: Will you meow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 14]: `` Yes -- and you meow back , if you get a chance .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 26]: Last time , you kep ' me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says ` Dern that cat ! '
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 17]: and so I hove a brick through his window -- but do n't you tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 5]: `` I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 20]: I could n't meow that night , becuz auntie was watching me , but I 'll meow this time .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 7]: Say -- what 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 7]: `` Nothing but a tick . ''
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 8]: `` Where 'd you get him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 7]: `` Out in the woods . ''
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 9]: `` What 'll you take for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 9]: I do n't want to sell him . ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 10]: It 's a mighty small tick , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 16]: `` Oh , anybody can run a tick down that do n't belong to them .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 6]: I 'm satisfied with it .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 10]: It 's a good enough tick for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 9]: `` Sho , there 's ticks a plenty .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 13]: I could have a thousand of 'em if I wanted to . ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 8]: `` Well , why do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 9]: Becuz you know mighty well you ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 10]: This is a pretty early tick , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 12]: It 's the first one I 've seen this year . ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 15]: `` Say , Huck -- I 'll give you my tooth for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 6]: `` Less see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 12]: Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 5]: Huckleberry viewed it wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 6]: The temptation was very strong .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 11]: At last he said : `` Is it genuwyne ? ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 9]: Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 17]: `` Well , all right , '' said Huckleberry , `` it 's a trade . ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 28]: Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the pinchbug 's prison , and the boys separated , each feeling wealthier than before .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 27]: When Tom reached the little isolated frame schoolhouse , he strode in briskly , with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 17]: He hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like alacrity .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 23]: The master , throned on high in his great splint-bottom arm-chair , was dozing , lulled by the drowsy hum of study .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 5]: The interruption roused him .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 5]: `` Thomas Sawyer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 15]: Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full , it meant trouble .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 4]: `` Sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 5]: `` Come up here .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 14]: Now , sir , why are you late again , as usual ? ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 51]: Tom was about to take refuge in a lie , when he saw two long tails of yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy of love ; and by that form was THE ONLY VACANT PLACE on the girls ' side of the schoolhouse .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 14]: He instantly said : `` I STOPPED TO TALK WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 12]: The master 's pulse stood still , and he stared helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 6]: The buzz of study ceased .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 12]: The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his mind .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 12]: The master said : `` You -- you did what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 9]: `` Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn . ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 7]: There was no mistaking the words .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 16]: `` Thomas Sawyer , this is the most astounding confession I have ever listened to .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 9]: No mere ferule will answer for this offence .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 6]: Take off your jacket . ''
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 17]: The master 's arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches notably diminished .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 17]: Then the order followed : `` Now , sir , go and sit with the girls !
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 10]: And let this be a warning to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 42]: The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy , but in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good fortune .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 25]: He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 33]: Nudges and winks and whispers traversed the room , but Tom sat still , with his arms upon the long , low desk before him , and seemed to study his book .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 21]: By and by attention ceased from him , and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull air once more .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 12]: Presently the boy began to steal furtive glances at the girl .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 26]: She observed it , `` made a mouth '' at him and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 13]: When she cautiously faced around again , a peach lay before her .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 5]: She thrust it away .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 6]: Tom gently put it back .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 11]: She thrust it away again , but with less animosity .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 8]: Tom patiently returned it to its place .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 6]: Then she let it remain .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 16]: Tom scrawled on his slate , `` Please take it -- I got more . ''
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 12]: The girl glanced at the words , but made no sign .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 19]: Now the boy began to draw something on the slate , hiding his work with his left hand .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 23]: For a time the girl refused to notice ; but her human curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 8]: The boy worked on , apparently unconscious .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 24]: The girl made a sort of noncommittal attempt to see , but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 16]: At last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered : `` Let me see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 25]: Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 18]: Then the girl 's interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything else .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 23]: When it was finished , she gazed a moment , then whispered : `` It 's nice -- make a man . ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 15]: The artist erected a man in the front yard , that resembled a derrick .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 39]: He could have stepped over the house ; but the girl was not hypercritical ; she was satisfied with the monster , and whispered : `` It 's a beautiful man -- now make me coming along . ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 23]: Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 18]: The girl said : `` It 's ever so nice -- I wish I could draw . ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 16]: `` It 's easy , '' whispered Tom , `` I 'll learn you . ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 6]: `` Oh , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 3]: When ? ''
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 4]: `` At noon .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 8]: Do you go home to dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 9]: `` I 'll stay if you will . ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 8]: `` Good -- that 's a whack .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 6]: What 's your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 4]: `` Becky Thatcher .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 4]: What 's yours ?
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 5]: Oh , I know .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 6]: It 's Thomas Sawyer . ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 10]: `` That 's the name they lick me by .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 8]: I 'm Tom when I 'm good .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 9]: You call me Tom , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 17]: Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate , hiding the words from the girl .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 8]: But she was not backward this time .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 5]: She begged to see .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 12]: Tom said : `` Oh , it ai n't anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 6]: `` Yes it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 6]: `` No it ai n't .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 8]: You do n't want to see . ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 9]: `` Yes I do , indeed I do .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 5]: Please let me . ''
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 6]: `` You 'll tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 16]: `` No I wo n't -- deed and deed and double deed wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 9]: `` You wo n't tell anybody at all ?
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 9]: Ever , as long as you live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 10]: `` No , I wo n't ever tell ANYbody .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 5]: Now let me . ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 11]: `` Oh , YOU do n't want to see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 13]: `` Now that you treat me so , I WILL see . ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 39]: And she put her small hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued , Tom pretending to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were revealed : `` I LOVE YOU . ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 8]: `` Oh , you bad thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 17]: And she hit his hand a smart rap , but reddened and looked pleased , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 23]: Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow , fateful grip closing on his ear , and a steady lifting impulse .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 27]: In that wise he was borne across the house and deposited in his own seat , under a peppering fire of giggles from the whole school .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 24]: Then the master stood over him during a few awful moments , and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 12]: But although Tom 's ear tingled , his heart was jubilant .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 22]: As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study , but the turmoil within him was too great .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 86]: In turn he took his place in the reading class and made a botch of it ; then in the geography class and turned lakes into mountains , mountains into rivers , and rivers into continents , till chaos was come again ; then in the spelling class , and got `` turned down , '' by a succession of mere baby words , till he brought up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with ostentation for months .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 20]: CHAPTER VII THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book , the more his ideas wandered .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 16]: So at last , with a sigh and a yawn , he gave it up .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 12]: It seemed to him that the noon recess would never come .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 6]: The air was utterly dead .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 7]: There was not a breath stirring .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 8]: It was the sleepiest of sleepy days .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 24]: The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 55]: Away off in the flaming sunshine , Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat , tinted with the purple of distance ; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air ; no other living thing was visible but some cows , and they were asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 23]: Tom 's heart ached to be free , or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 27]: His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer , though he did not know it .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 8]: Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 13]: He released the tick and put him on the long flat desk .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 47]: The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that amounted to prayer , too , at this moment , but it was premature : for when he started thankfully to travel off , Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 30]: Tom 's bosom friend sat next him , suffering just as Tom had been , and now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 7]: This bosom friend was Joe Harper .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 16]: The two boys were sworn friends all the week , and embattled enemies on Saturdays .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 17]: Joe took a pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 7]: The sport grew in interest momently .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 21]: Soon Tom said that they were interfering with each other , and neither getting the fullest benefit of the tick .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 23]: So he put Joe 's slate on the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 59]: `` Now , '' said he , `` as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and I 'll let him alone ; but if you let him get away and get on my side , you 're to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over . ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 12]: `` All right , go ahead ; start him up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 13]: The tick escaped from Tom , presently , and crossed the equator .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 15]: Joe harassed him awhile , and then he got away and crossed back again .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 7]: This change of base occurred often .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 40]: While one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing interest , the other would look on with interest as strong , the two heads bowed together over the slate , and the two souls dead to all things else .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 11]: At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 66]: The tick tried this , that , and the other course , and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves , but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp , so to speak , and Tom 's fingers would be twitching to begin , Joe 's pin would deftly head him off , and keep possession .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 9]: At last Tom could stand it no longer .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 6]: The temptation was too strong .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 12]: So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 7]: Joe was angry in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 12]: Said he : `` Tom , you let him alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 15]: `` I only just want to stir him up a little , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 17]: `` No , sir , it ai n't fair ; you just let him alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 14]: `` Blame it , I ai n't going to stir him much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 10]: `` Let him alone , I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 6]: `` I wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 14]: `` You shall -- he 's on my side of the line . ''
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 13]: `` Look here , Joe Harper , whose is that tick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 28]: `` I do n't care whose tick he is -- he 's on my side of the line , and you sha 'n' t touch him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 12]: `` Well , I 'll just bet I will , though .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 19]: He 's my tick and I 'll do what I blame please with him , or die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 41]: A tremendous whack came down on Tom 's shoulders , and its duplicate on Joe 's ; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 31]: The boys had been too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 19]: He had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed his bit of variety to it .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 58]: When school broke up at noon , Tom flew to Becky Thatcher , and whispered in her ear : `` Put on your bonnet and let on you 're going home ; and when you get to the corner , give the rest of 'em the slip , and turn down through the lane and come back .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 16]: I 'll go the other way and come it over 'em the same way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 17]: So the one went off with one group of scholars , and the other with another .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 27]: In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane , and when they reached the school they had it all to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 34]: Then they sat together , with a slate before them , and Tom gave Becky the pencil and held her hand in his , guiding it , and so created another surprising house .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 15]: When the interest in art began to wane , the two fell to talking .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 6]: Tom was swimming in bliss .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 10]: He said : `` Do you love rats ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 5]: I hate them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 11]: `` Well , I do , too -- LIVE ones .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 16]: But I mean dead ones , to swing round your head with a string . ''
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 13]: `` No , I do n't care for rats much , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 7]: What I like is chewing-gum . ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 8]: `` Oh , I should say so !
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 8]: I wish I had some now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 4]: `` Do you ?
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 5]: I 've got some .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 18]: I 'll let you chew it awhile , but you must give it back to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 23]: That was agreeable , so they chewed it turn about , and dangled their legs against the bench in excess of contentment .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 9]: `` Was you ever at a circus ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 21]: `` Yes , and my pa 's going to take me again some time , if I 'm good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 15]: `` I been to the circus three or four times -- lots of times .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 8]: Church ai n't shucks to a circus .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 12]: There 's things going on at a circus all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 16]: I 'm going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 6]: `` Oh , are you !
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 5]: That will be nice .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 10]: They 're so lovely , all spotted up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 7]: `` Yes , that 's so .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 17]: And they get slathers of money -- most a dollar a day , Ben Rogers says .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 10]: Say , Becky , was you ever engaged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 9]: `` Why , engaged to be married . ''
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 7]: `` Would you like to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 5]: `` I reckon so .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 6]: What is it like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 3]: `` Like ?
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 7]: Why it ai n't like anything .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 28]: You only just tell a boy you wo n't ever have anybody but him , ever ever ever , and then you kiss and that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 6]: Anybody can do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 3]: `` Kiss ?
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 7]: What do you kiss for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 19]: `` Why , that , you know , is to -- well , they always do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 4]: `` Everybody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 14]: `` Why , yes , everybody that 's in love with each other .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 11]: Do you remember what I wrote on the slate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 6]: `` Ye -- yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 6]: `` What was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 9]: `` I sha 'n' t tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 7]: `` Shall I tell YOU ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 11]: `` Ye -- yes -- but some other time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 6]: `` No , now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 9]: `` No , not now -- to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 7]: `` Oh , no , NOW .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 18]: Please , Becky -- I 'll whisper it , I 'll whisper it ever so easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 32]: Becky hesitating , Tom took silence for consent , and passed his arm about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly , with his mouth close to her ear .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 18]: And then he added : `` Now you whisper it to me -- just the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 28]: She resisted , for a while , and then said : `` You turn your face away so you ca n't see , and then I will .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 13]: But you must n't ever tell anybody -- WILL you , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 9]: Now you wo n't , WILL you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 10]: `` No , indeed , indeed I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 5]: Now , Becky . ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 6]: He turned his face away .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 21]: She bent timidly around till her breath stirred his curls and whispered , `` I -- love -- you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 37]: Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches , with Tom after her , and took refuge in a corner at last , with her little white apron to her face .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 25]: Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded : `` Now , Becky , it 's all done -- all over but the kiss .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 15]: Do n't you be afraid of that -- it ai n't anything at all .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 5]: Please , Becky . ''
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 10]: And he tugged at her apron and the hands .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 27]: By and by she gave up , and let her hands drop ; her face , all glowing with the struggle , came up and submitted .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 17]: Tom kissed the red lips and said : `` Now it 's all done , Becky .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 34]: And always after this , you know , you ai n't ever to love anybody but me , and you ai n't ever to marry anybody but me , ever never and forever .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 4]: Will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 36]: `` No , I 'll never love anybody but you , Tom , and I 'll never marry anybody but you -- and you ai n't to ever marry anybody but me , either . ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 3]: Of course .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 6]: That 's PART of it .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 50]: And always coming to school or when we 're going home , you 're to walk with me , when there ai n't anybody looking -- and you choose me and I choose you at parties , because that 's the way you do when you 're engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 6]: `` It 's so nice .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 8]: I never heard of it before . ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 9]: `` Oh , it 's ever so gay !
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 21]: Why , me and Amy Lawrence -- '' The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped , confused .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 5]: `` Oh , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 14]: Then I ai n't the first you 've ever been engaged to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 6]: The child began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 22]: Tom said : `` Oh , do n't cry , Becky , I do n't care for her any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 14]: `` Yes , you do , Tom -- you know you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 28]: Tom tried to put his arm about her neck , but she pushed him away and turned her face to the wall , and went on crying .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 16]: Tom tried again , with soothing words in his mouth , and was repulsed again .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 14]: Then his pride was up , and he strode away and went outside .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 32]: He stood about , restless and uneasy , for a while , glancing at the door , every now and then , hoping she would repent and come to find him .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 5]: But she did not .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 15]: Then he began to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 23]: It was a hard struggle with him to make new advances , now , but he nerved himself to it and entered .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 19]: She was still standing back there in the corner , sobbing , with her face to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 6]: Tom 's heart smote him .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 16]: He went to her and stood a moment , not knowing exactly how to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 20]: Then he said hesitatingly : `` Becky , I -- I do n't care for anybody but you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 6]: No reply -- but sobs .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 6]: `` Becky '' -- pleadingly .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 10]: `` Becky , wo n't you say something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 3]: More sobs .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 44]: Tom got out his chiefest jewel , a brass knob from the top of an andiron , and passed it around her so that she could see it , and said : `` Please , Becky , wo n't you take it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 7]: She struck it to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 24]: Then Tom marched out of the house and over the hills and far away , to return to school no more that day .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 6]: Presently Becky began to suspect .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 24]: She ran to the door ; he was not in sight ; she flew around to the play-yard ; he was not there .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 7]: Then she called : `` Tom !
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 6]: Come back , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 10]: She listened intently , but there was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 9]: She had no companions but silence and loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 60]: So she sat down to cry again and upbraid herself ; and by this time the scholars began to gather again , and she had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross of a long , dreary , aching afternoon , with none among the strangers about her to exchange sorrows with .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 29]: CHAPTER VIII TOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the track of returning scholars , and then fell into a moody jog .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 25]: He crossed a small `` branch '' two or three times , because of a prevailing juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 32]: Half an hour later he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff Hill , and the schoolhouse was hardly distinguishable away off in the valley behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 28]: He entered a dense wood , picked his pathless way to the centre of it , and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 57]: There was not even a zephyr stirring ; the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the birds ; nature lay in a trance that was broken by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a woodpecker , and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the more profound .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 19]: The boy 's soul was steeped in melancholy ; his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 18]: He sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands , meditating .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 76]: It seemed to him that life was but a trouble , at best , and he more than half envied Jimmy Hodges , so lately released ; it must be very peaceful , he thought , to lie and slumber and dream forever and ever , with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave , and nothing to bother and grieve about , ever any more .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 22]: If he only had a clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go , and be done with it all .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 6]: Now as to this girl .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 5]: What had he done ?
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 2]: Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 21]: He had meant the best in the world , and been treated like a dog -- like a very dog .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 14]: She would be sorry some day -- maybe when it was too late .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 9]: Ah , if he could only die TEMPORARILY !
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 19]: But the elastic heart of youth can not be compressed into one constrained shape long at a time .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 15]: Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into the concerns of this life again .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 13]: What if he turned his back , now , and disappeared mysteriously ?
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 25]: What if he went away -- ever so far away , into unknown countries beyond the seas -- and never came back any more !
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 6]: How would she feel then !
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 18]: The idea of being a clown recurred to him now , only to fill him with disgust .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 30]: For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights were an offense , when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 19]: No , he would be a soldier , and return after long years , all war-worn and illustrious .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 79]: No -- better still , he would join the Indians , and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the Far West , and away in the future come back a great chief , bristling with feathers , hideous with paint , and prance into Sunday-school , some drowsy summer morning , with a bloodcurdling war-whoop , and sear the eyeballs of all his companions with unappeasable envy .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 11]: But no , there was something gaudier even than this .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 6]: He would be a pirate !
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 4]: That was it !
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 14]: NOW his future lay plain before him , and glowing with unimaginable splendor .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 13]: How his name would fill the world , and make people shudder !
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 34]: How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas , in his long , low , black-hulled racer , the Spirit of the Storm , with his grisly flag flying at the fore !
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 91]: And at the zenith of his fame , how he would suddenly appear at the old village and stalk into church , brown and weather-beaten , in his black velvet doublet and trunks , his great jack-boots , his crimson sash , his belt bristling with horse-pistols , his crime-rusted cutlass at his side , his slouch hat with waving plumes , his black flag unfurled , with the skull and crossbones on it , and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings , `` It 's Tom Sawyer the Pirate !
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 10]: -- the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 11]: Yes , it was settled ; his career was determined .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 11]: He would run away from home and enter upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 8]: He would start the very next morning .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 9]: Therefore he must now begin to get ready .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 7]: He would collect his resources together .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 23]: He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of it with his Barlow knife .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 8]: He soon struck wood that sounded hollow .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 20]: He put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively : `` What has n't come here , come !
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 8]: What 's here , stay here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 13]: Then he scraped away the dirt , and exposed a pine shingle .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 18]: He took it up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides were of shingles .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 6]: In it lay a marble .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 6]: Tom 's astonishment was boundless !
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 20]: He scratched his head with a perplexed air , and said : `` Well , that beats anything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 12]: Then he tossed the marble away pettishly , and stood cogitating .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 27]: The truth was , that a superstition of his had failed , here , which he and all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 58]: If you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations , and left it alone a fortnight , and then opened the place with the incantation he had just used , you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there , meantime , no matter how widely they had been separated .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 11]: But now , this thing had actually and unquestionably failed .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 12]: Tom 's whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 17]: He had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing before .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 25]: It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times before , himself , but could never find the hiding-places afterward .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 21]: He puzzled over the matter some time , and finally decided that some witch had interfered and broken the charm .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 29]: He thought he would satisfy himself on that point ; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot with a little funnel-shaped depression in it .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 28]: He laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and called -- `` Doodle-bug , doodle-bug , tell me what I want to know !
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 13]: Doodle-bug , doodle-bug , tell me what I want to know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 25]: The sand began to work , and presently a small black bug appeared for a second and then darted under again in a fright .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 6]: `` He das n't tell !
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 9]: So it WAS a witch that done it .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 6]: I just knowed it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 18]: He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches , so he gave up discouraged .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 31]: But it occurred to him that he might as well have the marble he had just thrown away , and therefore he went and made a patient search for it .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 7]: But he could not find it .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 51]: Now he went back to his treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing when he tossed the marble away ; then he took another marble from his pocket and tossed it in the same way , saying : `` Brother , go find your brother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 12]: He watched where it stopped , and went there and looked .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 17]: But it must have fallen short or gone too far ; so he tried twice more .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 6]: The last repetition was successful .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 11]: The two marbles lay within a foot of each other .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 19]: Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green aisles of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 57]: Tom flung off his jacket and trousers , turned a suspender into a belt , raked away some brush behind the rotten log , disclosing a rude bow and arrow , a lath sword and a tin trumpet , and in a moment had seized these things and bounded away , barelegged , with fluttering shirt .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 28]: He presently halted under a great elm , blew an answering blast , and then began to tiptoe and look warily out , this way and that .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 16]: He said cautiously -- to an imaginary company : `` Hold , my merry men !
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 7]: Keep hid till I blow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 14]: Now appeared Joe Harper , as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 6]: Tom called : `` Hold !
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 11]: Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 10]: `` Guy of Guisborne wants no man 's pass .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 33]: Who art thou that -- that -- '' `` Dares to hold such language , '' said Tom , prompting -- for they talked `` by the book , '' from memory .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 12]: `` Who art thou that dares to hold such language ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 5]: `` I , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 14]: I am Robin Hood , as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 9]: `` Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw ?
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 14]: Right gladly will I dispute with thee the passes of the merry wood .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 5]: Have at thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 39]: They took their lath swords , dumped their other traps on the ground , struck a fencing attitude , foot to foot , and began a grave , careful combat , `` two up and two down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 19]: Presently Tom said : `` Now , if you 've got the hang , go it lively ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 15]: So they `` went it lively , '' panting and perspiring with the work .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 9]: By and by Tom shouted : `` Fall !
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 2]: fall !
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 7]: Why do n't you fall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 6]: `` I sha 'n' t !
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 7]: Why do n't you fall yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 9]: You 're getting the worst of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 8]: `` Why , that ai n't anything .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 16]: I ca n't fall ; that ai n't the way it is in the book .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 18]: The book says , ` Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy of Guisborne . '
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 15]: You 're to turn around and let me hit you in the back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 18]: There was no getting around the authorities , so Joe turned , received the whack and fell .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 19]: `` Now , '' said Joe , getting up , `` you got to let me kill YOU .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 5]: That 's fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 17]: `` Why , I ca n't do that , it ai n't in the book . ''
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 13]: `` Well , it 's blamed mean -- that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 47]: `` Well , say , Joe , you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller 's son , and lam me with a quarter-staff ; or I 'll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be Robin Hood a little while and kill me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 12]: This was satisfactory , and so these adventures were carried out .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 24]: Then Tom became Robin Hood again , and was allowed by the treacherous nun to bleed his strength away through his neglected wound .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 47]: And at last Joe , representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws , dragged him sadly forth , gave his bow into his feeble hands , and Tom said , `` Where this arrow falls , there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree . ''
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 28]: Then he shot the arrow and fell back and would have died , but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 37]: The boys dressed themselves , hid their accoutrements , and went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more , and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 20]: They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than President of the United States forever .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 20]: CHAPTER IX AT half-past nine , that night , Tom and Sid were sent to bed , as usual .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 11]: They said their prayers , and Sid was soon asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 10]: Tom lay awake and waited , in restless impatience .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 19]: When it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight , he heard the clock strike ten !
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 4]: This was despair .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 21]: He would have tossed and fidgeted , as his nerves demanded , but he was afraid he might wake Sid .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 12]: So he lay still , and stared up into the dark .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 5]: Everything was dismally still .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 19]: By and by , out of the stillness , little , scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 12]: The ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 7]: Old beams began to crack mysteriously .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 5]: The stairs creaked faintly .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 5]: Evidently spirits were abroad .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 12]: A measured , muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly 's chamber .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 17]: And now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate , began .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 28]: Next the ghastly ticking of a deathwatch in the wall at the bed 's head made Tom shudder -- it meant that somebody 's days were numbered .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 25]: Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air , and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 6]: Tom was in an agony .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 35]: At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun ; he began to doze , in spite of himself ; the clock chimed eleven , but he did not hear it .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 16]: And then there came , mingling with his half-formed dreams , a most melancholy caterwauling .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 9]: The raising of a neighboring window disturbed him .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 6]: A cry of `` Scat !
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 4]: you devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 47]: and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt 's woodshed brought him wide awake , and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the `` ell '' on all fours .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 29]: He `` meow 'd '' with caution once or twice , as he went ; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 10]: Huckleberry Finn was there , with his dead cat .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 10]: The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 18]: At the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 10]: It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 16]: It was on a hill , about a mile and a half from the village .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 28]: It had a crazy board fence around it , which leaned inward in places , and outward the rest of the time , but stood upright nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 10]: Grass and weeds grew rank over the whole cemetery .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 33]: All the old graves were sunken in , there was not a tombstone on the place ; round-topped , worm-eaten boards staggered over the graves , leaning for support and finding none .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 39]: `` Sacred to the memory of '' So-and-So had been painted on them once , but it could no longer have been read , on the most of them , now , even if there had been light .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 25]: A faint wind moaned through the trees , and Tom feared it might be the spirits of the dead , complaining at being disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 27]: The boys talked little , and only under their breath , for the time and the place and the pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 33]: They found the sharp new heap they were seeking , and ensconced themselves within the protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of the grave .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 12]: Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 16]: The hooting of a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 6]: Tom 's reflections grew oppressive .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 6]: He must force some talk .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 25]: So he said in a whisper : `` Hucky , do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 9]: Huckleberry whispered : `` I wisht I knowed .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 11]: It 's awful solemn like , AI N'T it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 7]: `` I bet it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 14]: There was a considerable pause , while the boys canvassed this matter inwardly .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 19]: Then Tom whispered : `` Say , Hucky -- do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 7]: `` O ' course he does .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 6]: Least his sperrit does . ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 15]: Tom , after a pause : `` I wish I 'd said Mister Williams .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 7]: But I never meant any harm .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 6]: Everybody calls him Hoss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 22]: `` A body ca n't be too partic ` lar how they talk ` bout these-yer dead people , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 10]: This was a damper , and conversation died again .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 14]: Presently Tom seized his comrade 's arm and said : `` Sh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 8]: `` What is it , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 9]: And the two clung together with beating hearts .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 3]: `` Sh !
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 5]: There 't is again !
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 7]: Did n't you hear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 7]: `` I -- '' `` There !
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 6]: Now you hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 9]: `` Lord , Tom , they 're coming !
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 6]: They 're coming , sure .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 6]: What 'll we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 4]: `` I dono .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 7]: Think they 'll see us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 16]: `` Oh , Tom , they can see in the dark , same as cats .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 8]: I wisht I had n't come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 8]: `` Oh , do n't be afeard .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 9]: I do n't believe they 'll bother us .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 7]: We ai n't doing any harm .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 16]: If we keep perfectly still , maybe they wo n't notice us at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 20]: `` I 'll try to , Tom , but , Lord , I 'm all of a shiver . ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 4]: `` Listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 10]: The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 15]: A muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 3]: `` Look !
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 4]: See there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 3]: whispered Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 5]: `` It 's devil-fire .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 9]: Oh , Tom , this is awful . ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 24]: Some vague figures approached through the gloom , swinging an old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable little spangles of light .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 15]: Presently Huckleberry whispered with a shudder : `` It 's the devils sure enough .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 4]: Three of 'em !
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 8]: Lordy , Tom , we 're goners !
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 5]: Can you pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 12]: `` I 'll try , but do n't you be afeard .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 8]: They ai n't going to hurt us .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 17]: ` Now I lay me down to sleep , I -- ' '' `` Sh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 8]: `` What is it , Huck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 5]: `` They 're HUMANS !
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 7]: One of 'em is , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 11]: One of 'em 's old Muff Potter 's voice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 12]: `` No -- ` tai n't so , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 7]: `` I bet I know it .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 7]: Do n't you stir nor budge .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 9]: He ai n't sharp enough to notice us .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 14]: Drunk , the same as usual , likely -- blamed old rip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 9]: `` All right , I 'll keep still .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 5]: Now they 're stuck .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 5]: Ca n't find it .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 5]: Here they come again .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 5]: Now they 're hot .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 3]: Cold again .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 3]: Hot again .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 3]: Red hot !
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 10]: They 're p ` inted right , this time .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 18]: Say , Huck , I know another o ' them voices ; it 's Injun Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 10]: `` That 's so -- that murderin ' half-breed !
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 10]: I 'd druther they was devils a dern sight .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 8]: What kin they be up to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 28]: The whisper died wholly out , now , for the three men had reached the grave and stood within a few feet of the boys ' hiding-place .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 29]: `` Here it is , '' said the third voice ; and the owner of it held the lantern up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 19]: Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple of shovels on it .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 12]: They cast down their load and began to open the grave .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 26]: The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 11]: He was so close the boys could have touched him .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 6]: `` Hurry , men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 19]: he said , in a low voice ; `` the moon might come out at any moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 9]: They growled a response and went on digging .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 22]: For some time there was no noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of mould and gravel .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 5]: It was very monotonous .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 29]: Finally a spade struck upon the coffin with a dull woody accent , and within another minute or two the men had hoisted it out on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 21]: They pried off the lid with their shovels , got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 13]: The moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 26]: The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it , covered with a blanket , and bound to its place with the rope .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 44]: Potter took out a large spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said : `` Now the cussed thing 's ready , Sawbones , and you 'll just out with another five , or here she stays . ''
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 7]: `` That 's the talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 4]: said Injun Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 10]: `` Look here , what does this mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 4]: said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 15]: `` You required your pay in advance , and I 've paid you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 24]: `` Yes , and you done more than that , '' said Injun Joe , approaching the doctor , who was now standing .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 63]: `` Five years ago you drove me away from your father 's kitchen one night , when I come to ask for something to eat , and you said I war n't there for any good ; and when I swore I 'd get even with you if it took a hundred years , your father had me jailed for a vagrant .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 7]: Did you think I 'd forget ?
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 10]: The Injun blood ai n't in me for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 17]: And now I 've GOT you , and you got to SETTLE , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 17]: He was threatening the doctor , with his fist in his face , by this time .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 13]: The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 21]: Potter dropped his knife , and exclaimed : `` Here , now , do n't you hit my pard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 31]: and the next moment he had grappled with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main , trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 38]: Injun Joe sprang to his feet , his eyes flaming with passion , snatched up Potter 's knife , and went creeping , catlike and stooping , round and round about the combatants , seeking an opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 50]: All at once the doctor flung himself free , seized the heavy headboard of Williams ' grave and felled Potter to the earth with it -- and in the same instant the half-breed saw his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man 's breast .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 38]: He reeled and fell partly upon Potter , flooding him with his blood , and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 20]: Presently , when the moon emerged again , Injun Joe was standing over the two forms , contemplating them .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 15]: The doctor murmured inarticulately , gave a long gasp or two and was still .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 14]: The half-breed muttered : `` THAT score is settled -- damn you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 6]: Then he robbed the body .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 22]: After which he put the fatal knife in Potter 's open right hand , and sat down on the dismantled coffin .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 17]: Three -- four -- five minutes passed , and then Potter began to stir and moan .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 24]: His hand closed upon the knife ; he raised it , glanced at it , and let it fall , with a shudder .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 23]: Then he sat up , pushing the body from him , and gazed at it , and then around him , confusedly .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 6]: His eyes met Joe 's .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 10]: `` Lord , how is this , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 14]: `` It 's a dirty business , '' said Joe , without moving .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 9]: `` What did you do it for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 3]: `` I !
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 6]: I never done it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 4]: `` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 9]: That kind of talk wo n't wash . ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 6]: Potter trembled and grew white .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 8]: `` I thought I 'd got sober .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 8]: I 'd no business to drink to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 15]: But it 's in my head yet -- worse 'n when we started here .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 16]: I 'm all in a muddle ; ca n't recollect anything of it , hardly .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 17]: Tell me , Joe -- HONEST , now , old feller -- did I do it ?
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 21]: Joe , I never meant to -- ` pon my soul and honor , I never meant to , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 8]: Tell me how it was , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 14]: Oh , it 's awful -- and him so young and promising . ''
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 67]: `` Why , you two was scuffling , and he fetched you one with the headboard and you fell flat ; and then up you come , all reeling and staggering like , and snatched the knife and jammed it into him , just as he fetched you another awful clip -- and here you 've laid , as dead as a wedge til now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 12]: `` Oh , I did n't know what I was a-doing .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 11]: I wish I may die this minute if I did .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 15]: It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 12]: I never used a weepon in my life before , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 9]: I 've fought , but never with weepons .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 6]: They 'll all say that .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 6]: Joe , do n't tell !
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 14]: Say you wo n't tell , Joe -- that 's a good feller .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 15]: I always liked you , Joe , and stood up for you , too .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 5]: Do n't you remember ?
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 11]: You WO N'T tell , WILL you , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 19]: And the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer , and clasped his appealing hands .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 25]: `` No , you 've always been fair and square with me , Muff Potter , and I wo n't go back on you .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 15]: There , now , that 's as fair as a man can say . ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 10]: `` Oh , Joe , you 're an angel .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 13]: I 'll bless you for this the longest day I live . ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 6]: And Potter began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 11]: `` Come , now , that 's enough of that .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 8]: This ai n't any time for blubbering .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 11]: You be off yonder way and I 'll go this .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 14]: Move , now , and do n't leave any tracks behind you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 12]: Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 7]: The half-breed stood looking after him .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 58]: He muttered : `` If he 's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had the look of being , he wo n't think of the knife till he 's gone so far he 'll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself -- chicken-heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 30]: Two or three minutes later the murdered man , the blanketed corpse , the lidless coffin , and the open grave were under no inspection but the moon 's .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 8]: The stillness was complete again , too .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 18]: CHAPTER X THE two boys flew on and on , toward the village , speechless with horror .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 22]: They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time , apprehensively , as if they feared they might be followed .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 50]: Every stump that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy , and made them catch their breath ; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay near the village , the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give wings to their feet .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 16]: `` If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 9]: whispered Tom , in short catches between breaths .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 10]: `` I ca n't stand it much longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 30]: Huckleberry 's hard pantings were his only reply , and the boys fixed their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 31]: They gained steadily on it , and at last , breast to breast , they burst through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 25]: By and by their pulses slowed down , and Tom whispered : `` Huckleberry , what do you reckon 'll come of this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 15]: `` If Doctor Robinson dies , I reckon hanging 'll come of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 6]: `` Do you though ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 10]: `` Why , I KNOW it , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 14]: Tom thought a while , then he said : `` Who 'll tell ?
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 3]: We ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 7]: `` What are you talking about ?
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 10]: S'pose something happened and Injun Joe DID N'T hang ?
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 23]: Why , he 'd kill us some time or other , just as dead sure as we 're a laying here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 14]: `` That 's just what I was thinking to myself , Huck . ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 17]: `` If anybody tells , let Muff Potter do it , if he 's fool enough .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 7]: He 's generally drunk enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 8]: Tom said nothing -- went on thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 14]: Presently he whispered : `` Huck , Muff Potter do n't know it .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 6]: How can he tell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 12]: `` What 's the reason he do n't know it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 14]: `` Because he 'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 7]: D'you reckon he could see anything ?
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 7]: D'you reckon he knowed anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 11]: `` By hokey , that 's so , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 14]: `` And besides , look-a-here -- maybe that whack done for HIM ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 9]: `` No , ` taint likely , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 18]: He had liquor in him ; I could see that ; and besides , he always has .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 26]: Well , when pap 's full , you might take and belt him over the head with a church and you could n't phase him .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 8]: He says so , his own self .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 12]: So it 's the same with Muff Potter , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 21]: But if a man was dead sober , I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him ; I dono . ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 19]: After another reflective silence , Tom said : `` Hucky , you sure you can keep mum ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 9]: `` Tom , we GOT to keep mum .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 4]: You know that .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 32]: That Injun devil would n't make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats , if we was to squeak ` bout this and they did n't hang him .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 28]: Now , look-a-here , Tom , less take and swear to one another -- that 's what we got to do -- swear to keep mum . ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 5]: `` I 'm agreed .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 6]: It 's the best thing .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 22]: Would you just hold hands and swear that we -- '' `` Oh no , that would n't do for this .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 44]: That 's good enough for little rubbishy common things -- specially with gals , cuz THEY go back on you anyway , and blab if they get in a huff -- but there orter be writing ` bout a big thing like this .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 4]: And blood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 8]: Tom 's whole being applauded this idea .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 25]: It was deep , and dark , and awful ; the hour , the circumstances , the surroundings , were in keeping with it .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 61]: He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moonlight , took a little fragment of `` red keel '' out of his pocket , got the moon on his work , and painfully scrawled these lines , emphasizing each slow down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth , and letting up the pressure on the up-strokes .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 6]: -LSB- See next page . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 32]: `` Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot . ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 19]: Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom 's facility in writing , and the sublimity of his language .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 25]: He at once took a pin from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh , but Tom said : `` Hold on !
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 5]: Do n't do that .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 5]: A pin 's brass .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 8]: It might have verdigrease on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 6]: `` What 's verdigrease ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 7]: `` It 's p ` ison .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 6]: That 's what it is .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 13]: You just swaller some of it once -- you 'll see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 28]: So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles , and each boy pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 25]: In time , after many squeezes , Tom managed to sign his initials , using the ball of his little finger for a pen .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 19]: Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and an F , and the oath was complete .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 34]: They buried the shingle close to the wall , with some dismal ceremonies and incantations , and the fetters that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown away .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 25]: A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined building , now , but they did not notice it .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 19]: `` Tom , '' whispered Huckleberry , `` does this keep us from EVER telling -- ALWAYS ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 6]: `` Of course it does .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 15]: It do n't make any difference WHAT happens , we got to keep mum .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 13]: We 'd drop down dead -- do n't YOU know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 10]: `` Yes , I reckon that 's so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 9]: They continued to whisper for some little time .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 19]: Presently a dog set up a long , lugubrious howl just outside -- within ten feet of them .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 13]: The boys clasped each other suddenly , in an agony of fright .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 9]: `` Which of us does he mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 3]: gasped Huckleberry .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 9]: `` I dono -- peep through the crack .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 3]: Quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 8]: `` No , YOU , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 14]: `` I ca n't -- I ca n't DO it , Huck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 5]: `` Please , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 6]: There 't is again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 10]: `` Oh , lordy , I 'm thankful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 3]: whispered Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 6]: `` I know his voice .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 6]: It 's Bull Harbison . ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 41]: * -LSB- * If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull , Tom would have spoken of him as `` Harbison 's Bull , '' but a son or a dog of that name was `` Bull Harbison . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 32]: `` Oh , that 's good -- I tell you , Tom , I was most scared to death ; I 'd a bet anything it was a STRAY dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 5]: The dog howled again .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 8]: The boys ' hearts sank once more .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 5]: `` Oh , my !
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 8]: that ai n't no Bull Harbison ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 3]: whispered Huckleberry .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 6]: `` DO , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 16]: Tom , quaking with fear , yielded , and put his eye to the crack .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 21]: His whisper was hardly audible when he said : `` Oh , Huck , IT S A STRAY DOG ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 7]: `` Quick , Tom , quick !
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 6]: Who does he mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 15]: `` Huck , he must mean us both -- we 're right together . ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 11]: `` Oh , Tom , I reckon we 're goners .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 15]: I reckon there ai n't no mistake ` bout where I 'LL go to .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 6]: I been so wicked . ''
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 5]: `` Dad fetch it !
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 16]: This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a feller 's told NOT to do .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 25]: I might a been good , like Sid , if I 'd a tried -- but no , I would n't , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 19]: But if ever I get off this time , I lay I 'll just WALLER in Sunday-schools ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 8]: And Tom began to snuffle a little .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 5]: `` YOU bad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 7]: and Huckleberry began to snuffle too .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 21]: `` Consound it , Tom Sawyer , you 're just old pie , ` longside o ' what I am .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 18]: Oh , LORDY , lordy , lordy , I wisht I only had half your chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 13]: Tom choked off and whispered : `` Look , Hucky , look !
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 9]: He 's got his BACK to us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 9]: Hucky looked , with joy in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 9]: `` Well , he has , by jingoes !
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 5]: Did he before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 6]: `` Yes , he did .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 10]: But I , like a fool , never thought .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 9]: Oh , this is bully , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 7]: NOW who can he mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 4]: The howling stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 6]: Tom pricked up his ears .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 3]: `` Sh !
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 5]: What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 3]: he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 8]: `` Sounds like -- like hogs grunting .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 10]: No -- it 's somebody snoring , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 5]: `` That IS it !
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 9]: Where ` bouts is it , Huck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 11]: `` I bleeve it 's down at ` tother end .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 5]: Sounds so , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 27]: Pap used to sleep there , sometimes , ` long with the hogs , but laws bless you , he just lifts things when HE snores .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 17]: Besides , I reckon he ai n't ever coming back to this town any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 13]: The spirit of adventure rose in the boys ' souls once more .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 15]: `` Hucky , do you das ' t to go if I lead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 9]: `` I do n't like to , much .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 11]: Tom , s ` pose it 's Injun Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 3]: Tom quailed .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 30]: But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the boys agreed to try , with the understanding that they would take to their heels if the snoring stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 13]: So they went tiptoeing stealthily down , the one behind the other .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 26]: When they had got to within five steps of the snorer , Tom stepped on a stick , and it broke with a sharp snap .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 16]: The man moaned , writhed a little , and his face came into the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 5]: It was Muff Potter .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 25]: The boys ' hearts had stood still , and their hopes too , when the man moved , but their fears passed away now .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 21]: They tiptoed out , through the broken weather-boarding , and stopped at a little distance to exchange a parting word .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 12]: That long , lugubrious howl rose on the night air again !
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 28]: They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few feet of where Potter was lying , and FACING Potter , with his nose pointing heavenward .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 10]: `` Oh , geeminy , it 's HIM ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 8]: exclaimed both boys , in a breath .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 57]: `` Say , Tom -- they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller 's house , ` bout midnight , as much as two weeks ago ; and a whippoorwill come in and lit on the banisters and sung , the very same evening ; and there ai n't anybody dead there yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 7]: `` Well , I know that .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 6]: And suppose there ai n't .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 19]: Did n't Gracie Miller fall in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 9]: `` Yes , but she ai n't DEAD .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 13]: And what 's more , she 's getting better , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 9]: `` All right , you wait and see .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 16]: She 's a goner , just as dead sure as Muff Potter 's a goner .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 20]: That 's what the niggers say , and they know all about these kind of things , Huck . ''
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 6]: Then they separated , cogitating .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 14]: When Tom crept in at his bedroom window the night was almost spent .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 18]: He undressed with excessive caution , and fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 19]: He was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake , and had been so for an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 10]: When Tom awoke , Sid was dressed and gone .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 16]: There was a late look in the light , a late sense in the atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 4]: He was startled .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 16]: Why had he not been called -- persecuted till he was up , as usual ?
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 7]: The thought filled him with bodings .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 14]: Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs , feeling sore and drowsy .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 13]: The family were still at table , but they had finished breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 32]: There was no voice of rebuke ; but there were averted eyes ; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprit 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 38]: He sat down and tried to seem gay , but it was up-hill work ; it roused no smile , no response , and he lapsed into silence and let his heart sink down to the depths .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 29]: After breakfast his aunt took him aside , and Tom almost brightened in the hope that he was going to be flogged ; but it was not so .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 53]: His aunt wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so ; and finally told him to go on , and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave , for it was no use for her to try any more .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 19]: This was worse than a thousand whippings , and Tom 's heart was sorer now than his body .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 38]: He cried , he pleaded for forgiveness , promised to reform over and over again , and then received his dismissal , feeling that he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 27]: He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward Sid ; and so the latter 's prompt retreat through the back gate was unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 43]: He moped to school gloomy and sad , and took his flogging , along with Joe Harper , for playing hookey the day before , with the air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to trifles .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 43]: Then he betook himself to his seat , rested his elbows on his desk and his jaws in his hands , and stared at the wall with the stony stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 9]: His elbow was pressing against some hard substance .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 21]: After a long time he slowly and sadly changed his position , and took up this object with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 6]: It was in a paper .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 4]: He unrolled it .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 14]: A long , lingering , colossal sigh followed , and his heart broke .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 7]: It was his brass andiron knob !
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 9]: This final feather broke the camel 's back .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 19]: CHAPTER XI CLOSE upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified with the ghastly news .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 34]: No need of the as yet undreamed-of telegraph ; the tale flew from man to man , from group to group , from house to house , with little less than telegraphic speed .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 23]: Of course the schoolmaster gave holiday for that afternoon ; the town would have thought strangely of him if he had not .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 30]: A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man , and it had been recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter -- so the story ran .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 51]: And it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself in the `` branch '' about one or two o'clock in the morning , and that Potter had at once sneaked off -- suspicious circumstances , especially the washing which was not a habit with Potter .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 42]: It was also said that the town had been ransacked for this `` murderer '' -LRB- the public are not slow in the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict -RRB- , but that he could not be found .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 26]: Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every direction , and the Sheriff `` was confident '' that he would be captured before night .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 9]: All the town was drifting toward the graveyard .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 34]: Tom 's heartbreak vanished and he joined the procession , not because he would not a thousand times rather go anywhere else , but because an awful , unaccountable fascination drew him on .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 20]: Arrived at the dreadful place , he wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 12]: It seemed to him an age since he was there before .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 5]: Somebody pinched his arm .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 10]: He turned , and his eyes met Huckleberry 's .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 19]: Then both looked elsewhere at once , and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their mutual glance .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 14]: But everybody was talking , and intent upon the grisly spectacle before them .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 5]: `` Poor fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 6]: `` Poor young fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 12]: `` This ought to be a lesson to grave robbers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 13]: `` Muff Potter 'll hang for this if they catch him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 24]: This was the drift of remark ; and the minister said , `` It was a judgment ; His hand is here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 20]: Now Tom shivered from head to heel ; for his eye fell upon the stolid face of Injun Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 20]: At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle , and voices shouted , `` It 's him !
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 4]: it 's him !
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 6]: he 's coming himself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 3]: `` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 3]: Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 4]: from twenty voices .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 5]: `` Muff Potter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 7]: `` Hallo , he 's stopped !
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 8]: -- Look out , he 's turning !
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 8]: Do n't let him get away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 27]: People in the branches of the trees over Tom 's head said he was n't trying to get away -- he only looked doubtful and perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 5]: `` Infernal impudence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 27]: said a bystander ; `` wanted to come and take a quiet look at his work , I reckon -- did n't expect any company . ''
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 20]: The crowd fell apart , now , and the Sheriff came through , ostentatiously leading Potter by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 19]: The poor fellow 's face was haggard , and his eyes showed the fear that was upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 28]: When he stood before the murdered man , he shook as with a palsy , and he put his face in his hands and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 26]: `` I did n't do it , friends , '' he sobbed ; '' ` pon my word and honor I never done it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 7]: `` Who 's accused you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 4]: shouted a voice .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 7]: This shot seemed to carry home .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 16]: Potter lifted his face and looked around him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 29]: He saw Injun Joe , and exclaimed : `` Oh , Injun Joe , you promised me you 'd never -- '' `` Is that your knife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 10]: and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 17]: Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 53]: Then he said : `` Something told me ' t if I did n't come back and get -- '' He shuddered ; then waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said , `` Tell 'em , Joe , tell 'em -- it ai n't any use any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 48]: Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring , and heard the stony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement , they expecting every moment that the clear sky would deliver God 's lightnings upon his head , and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 58]: And when he had finished and still stood alive and whole , their wavering impulse to break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner 's life faded and vanished away , for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 7]: `` Why did n't you leave ?
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 10]: What did you want to come here for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 3]: somebody said .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 17]: `` I could n't help it -- I could n't help it , '' Potter moaned .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 19]: `` I wanted to run away , but I could n't seem to come anywhere but here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 7]: And he fell to sobbing again .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 47]: Injun Joe repeated his statement , just as calmly , a few minutes afterward on the inquest , under oath ; and the boys , seeing that the lightnings were still withheld , were confirmed in their belief that Joe had sold himself to the devil .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 31]: He was now become , to them , the most balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon , and they could not take their fascinated eyes from his face .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 25]: They inwardly resolved to watch him nights , when opportunity should offer , in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 35]: Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in a wagon for removal ; and it was whispered through the shuddering crowd that the wound bled a little !
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 42]: The boys thought that this happy circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction ; but they were disappointed , for more than one villager remarked : `` It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 50]: Tom 's fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as much as a week after this ; and at breakfast one morning Sid said : `` Tom , you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me awake half the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 7]: Tom blanched and dropped his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 14]: `` It 's a bad sign , '' said Aunt Polly , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 11]: `` What you got on your mind , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 8]: Nothing ' t I know of . ''
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 13]: But the boy 's hand shook so that he spilled his coffee .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 12]: `` And you do talk such stuff , '' Sid said .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 22]: `` Last night you said , ` It 's blood , it 's blood , that 's what it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 7]: You said that over and over .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 16]: And you said , ` Do n't torment me so -- I 'll tell ! '
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 3]: Tell WHAT ?
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 8]: What is it you 'll tell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 6]: Everything was swimming before Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 33]: There is no telling what might have happened , now , but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly 's face and she came to Tom 's relief without knowing it .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 6]: She said : `` Sho !
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 6]: It 's that dreadful murder .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 9]: I dream about it most every night myself .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 11]: Sometimes I dream it 's me that done it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 11]: Mary said she had been affected much the same way .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 4]: Sid seemed satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 32]: Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could , and after that he complained of toothache for a week , and tied up his jaws every night .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 40]: He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching , and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good while at a time , and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place again .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 17]: Tom 's distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew irksome and was discarded .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 20]: If Sid really managed to make anything out of Tom 's disjointed mutterings , he kept it to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 27]: It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding inquests on dead cats , and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 72]: Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries , though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises ; he noticed , too , that Tom never acted as a witness -- and that was strange ; and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion to these inquests , and always avoided them when he could .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 7]: Sid marvelled , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 19]: However , even inquests went out of vogue at last , and ceased to torture Tom 's conscience .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 40]: Every day or two , during this time of sorrow , Tom watched his opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such small comforts through to the `` murderer '' as he could get hold of .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 35]: The jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge of the village , and no guards were afforded for it ; indeed , it was seldom occupied .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 10]: These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom 's conscience .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 47]: The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride him on a rail , for body-snatching , but so formidable was his character that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the matter , so it was dropped .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 38]: He had been careful to begin both of his inquest-statements with the fight , without confessing the grave-robbery that preceded it ; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in the courts at present .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 33]: CHAPTER XII ONE of the reasons why Tom 's mind had drifted away from its secret troubles was , that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest itself about .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 8]: Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 24]: Tom had struggled with his pride a few days , and tried to `` whistle her down the wind , '' but failed .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 19]: He began to find himself hanging around her father 's house , nights , and feeling very miserable .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 4]: She was ill .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 6]: What if she should die !
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 7]: There was distraction in the thought .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 14]: He no longer took an interest in war , nor even in piracy .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 14]: The charm of life was gone ; there was nothing but dreariness left .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 19]: He put his hoop away , and his bat ; there was no joy in them any more .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 5]: His aunt was concerned .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 11]: She began to try all manner of remedies on him .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 23]: She was one of those people who are infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of producing health or mending it .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 9]: She was an inveterate experimenter in these things .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 39]: When something fresh in this line came out she was in a fever , right away , to try it ; not on herself , for she was never ailing , but on anybody else that came handy .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 29]: She was a subscriber for all the `` Health '' periodicals and phrenological frauds ; and the solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 87]: All the `` rot '' they contained about ventilation , and how to go to bed , and how to get up , and what to eat , and what to drink , and how much exercise to take , and what frame of mind to keep one 's self in , and what sort of clothing to wear , was all gospel to her , and she never observed that her health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they had recommended the month before .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 20]: She was as simple-hearted and honest as the day was long , and so she was an easy victim .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 34]: She gathered together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines , and thus armed with death , went about on her pale horse , metaphorically speaking , with `` hell following after . ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 25]: But she never suspected that she was not an angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise , to the suffering neighbors .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 19]: The water treatment was new , now , and Tom 's low condition was a windfall to her .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 81]: She had him out at daylight every morning , stood him up in the woodshed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water ; then she scrubbed him down with a towel like a file , and so brought him to ; then she rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul clean and `` the yellow stains of it came through his pores '' -- as Tom said .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 17]: Yet notwithstanding all this , the boy grew more and more melancholy and pale and dejected .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 14]: She added hot baths , sitz baths , shower baths , and plunges .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 9]: The boy remained as dismal as a hearse .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 14]: She began to assist the water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 21]: She calculated his capacity as she would a jug 's , and filled him up every day with quack cure-alls .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 10]: Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 11]: This phase filled the old lady 's heart with consternation .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 10]: This indifference must be broken up at any cost .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 10]: Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 7]: She ordered a lot at once .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 9]: She tasted it and was filled with gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 9]: It was simply fire in a liquid form .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 16]: She dropped the water treatment and everything else , and pinned her faith to Pain-killer .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 15]: She gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the result .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 22]: Her troubles were instantly at rest , her soul at peace again ; for the `` indifference '' was broken up .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 21]: The boy could not have shown a wilder , heartier interest , if she had built a fire under him .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 41]: Tom felt that it was time to wake up ; this sort of life might be romantic enough , in his blighted condition , but it was getting to have too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 22]: So he thought over various plans for relief , and finally hit pon that of professing to be fond of Pain-killer .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 27]: He asked for it so often that he became a nuisance , and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and quit bothering her .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 29]: If it had been Sid , she would have had no misgivings to alloy her delight ; but since it was Tom , she watched the bottle clandestinely .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 33]: She found that the medicine did really diminish , but it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in the sitting-room floor with it .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 33]: One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt 's yellow cat came along , purring , eying the teaspoon avariciously , and begging for a taste .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 17]: Tom said : `` Do n't ask for it unless you want it , Peter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 9]: But Peter signified that he did want it .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 7]: `` You better make sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 4]: Peter was sure .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 46]: `` Now you 've asked for it , and I 'll give it to you , because there ai n't anything mean about me ; but if you find you do n't like it , you must n't blame anybody but your own self . ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 4]: Peter was agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 12]: So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down the Pain-killer .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 36]: Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air , and then delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room , banging against furniture , upsetting flower-pots , and making general havoc .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 31]: Next he rose on his hind feet and pranced around , in a frenzy of enjoyment , with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 16]: Then he went tearing around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 36]: Aunt Polly entered in time to see him throw a few double summersets , deliver a final mighty hurrah , and sail through the open window , carrying the rest of the flower-pots with him .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 22]: The old lady stood petrified with astonishment , peering over her glasses ; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 11]: `` Tom , what on earth ails that cat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 13]: `` I do n't know , aunt , '' gasped the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 10]: `` Why , I never see anything like it .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 8]: What did make him act so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 23]: `` Deed I do n't know , Aunt Polly ; cats always act so when they 're having a good time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 8]: `` They do , do they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 11]: There was something in the tone that made Tom apprehensive .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 4]: `` Yes 'm .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 9]: That is , I believe they do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 5]: `` You DO ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 16]: The old lady was bending down , Tom watching , with interest emphasized by anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 9]: Too late he divined her `` drift . ''
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 12]: The handle of the telltale teaspoon was visible under the bed-valance .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 9]: Aunt Polly took it , held it up .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 8]: Tom winced , and dropped his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 21]: Aunt Polly raised him by the usual handle -- his ear -- and cracked his head soundly with her thimble .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 20]: `` Now , sir , what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so , for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 18]: `` I done it out of pity for him -- because he had n't any aunt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 6]: `` Had n't any aunt !
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 4]: -- you numskull .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 10]: What has that got to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 3]: `` Heaps .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 14]: Because if he 'd had one she 'd a burnt him out herself !
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 22]: She 'd a roasted his bowels out of him ` thout any more feeling than if he was a human ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 9]: Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 25]: This was putting the thing in a new light ; what was cruelty to a cat MIGHT be cruelty to a boy , too .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 9]: She began to soften ; she felt sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 29]: Her eyes watered a little , and she put her hand on Tom 's head and said gently : `` I was meaning for the best , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 11]: And , Tom , it DID do you good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 16]: Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping through his gravity .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 19]: `` I know you was meaning for the best , aunty , and so was I with Peter .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 7]: It done HIM good , too .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 27]: I never see him get around so since -- '' `` Oh , go ` long with you , Tom , before you aggravate me again .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 27]: And you try and see if you ca n't be a good boy , for once , and you need n't take any more medicine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 7]: Tom reached school ahead of time .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 14]: It was noticed that this strange thing had been occurring every day latterly .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 23]: And now , as usual of late , he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his comrades .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 12]: He was sick , he said , and he looked it .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 19]: He tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking -- down the road .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 24]: Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight , and Tom 's face lighted ; he gazed a moment , and then turned sorrowfully away .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 31]: When Jeff arrived , Tom accosted him ; and `` led up '' warily to opportunities for remark about Becky , but the giddy lad never could see the bait .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 32]: Tom watched and watched , hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight , and hating the owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 26]: At last frocks ceased to appear , and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps ; he entered the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 19]: Then one more frock passed in at the gate , and Tom 's heart gave a great bound .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 71]: The next instant he was out , and `` going on '' like an Indian ; yelling , laughing , chasing boys , jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb , throwing handsprings , standing on his head -- doing all the heroic things he could conceive of , and keeping a furtive eye out , all the while , to see if Becky Thatcher was noticing .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 14]: But she seemed to be unconscious of it all ; she never looked .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 14]: Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there ?
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 76]: He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity ; came war-whooping around , snatched a boy 's cap , hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse , broke through a group of boys , tumbling them in every direction , and fell sprawling , himself , under Becky 's nose , almost upsetting her -- and she turned , with her nose in the air , and he heard her say : `` Mf !
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 13]: some people think they 're mighty smart -- always showing off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 5]: Tom 's cheeks burned .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 12]: He gathered himself up and sneaked off , crushed and crestfallen .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 10]: CHAPTER XIII TOM 'S mind was made up now .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 6]: He was gloomy and desperate .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 80]: He was a forsaken , friendless boy , he said ; nobody loved him ; when they found out what they had driven him to , perhaps they would be sorry ; he had tried to do right and get along , but they would not let him ; since nothing would do them but to be rid of him , let it be so ; and let them blame HIM for the consequences -- why should n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 8]: What right had the friendless to complain ?
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 19]: Yes , they had forced him to it at last : he would lead a life of crime .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 5]: There was no choice .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 26]: By this time he was far down Meadow Lane , and the bell for school to `` take up '' tinkled faintly upon his ear .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 51]: He sobbed , now , to think he should never , never hear that old familiar sound any more -- it was very hard , but it was forced on him ; since he was driven out into the cold world , he must submit -- but he forgave them .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 8]: Then the sobs came thick and fast .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 29]: Just at this point he met his soul 's sworn comrade , Joe Harper -- hard-eyed , and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 13]: Plainly here were `` two souls with but a single thought . ''
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 50]: Tom , wiping his eyes with his sleeve , began to blubber out something about a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the great world never to return ; and ended by hoping that Joe would not forget him .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 30]: But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going to make of Tom , and had come to hunt him up for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 75]: His mother had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and knew nothing about ; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished him to go ; if she felt that way , there was nothing for him to do but succumb ; he hoped she would be happy , and never regret having driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 32]: As the two boys walked sorrowing along , they made a new compact to stand by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved them of their troubles .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 8]: Then they began to lay their plans .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 58]: Joe was for being a hermit , and living on crusts in a remote cave , and dying , some time , of cold and want and grief ; but after listening to Tom , he conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of crime , and so he consented to be a pirate .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 49]: Three miles below St. Petersburg , at a point where the Mississippi River was a trifle over a mile wide , there was a long , narrow , wooded island , with a shallow bar at the head of it , and this offered well as a rendezvous .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 23]: It was not inhabited ; it lay far over toward the further shore , abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 7]: So Jackson 's Island was chosen .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 19]: Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a matter that did not occur to them .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 25]: Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn , and he joined them promptly , for all careers were one to him ; he was indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 26]: They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour -- which was midnight .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 13]: There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 26]: Each would bring hooks and lines , and such provision as he could steal in the most dark and mysterious way -- as became outlaws .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 31]: And before the afternoon was done , they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would `` hear something . ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 16]: All who got this vague hint were cautioned to `` be mum and wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 27]: About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles , and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the meeting-place .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 8]: It was starlight , and very still .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 10]: The mighty river lay like an ocean at rest .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 12]: Tom listened a moment , but no sound disturbed the quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 9]: Then he gave a low , distinct whistle .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 8]: It was answered from under the bluff .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 14]: Tom whistled twice more ; these signals were answered in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 12]: Then a guarded voice said : `` Who goes there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 12]: `` Tom Sawyer , the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 5]: Name your names . ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 16]: `` Huck Finn the Red-Handed , and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas . ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 12]: Tom had furnished these titles , from his favorite literature . ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 4]: 'T is well .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 5]: Give the countersign . ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 18]: Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the brooding night : `` BLOOD ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 27]: Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it , tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 29]: There was an easy , comfortable path along the shore under the bluff , but it lacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 23]: The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon , and had about worn himself out with getting it there .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 27]: Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco , and had also brought a few corn-cobs to make pipes with .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 13]: But none of the pirates smoked or `` chewed '' but himself .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 18]: The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it would never do to start without some fire .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 15]: That was a wise thought ; matches were hardly known there in that day .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 26]: They saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above , and they went stealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 14]: They made an imposing adventure of it , saying , `` Hist ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 54]: every now and then , and suddenly halting with finger on lip ; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts ; and giving orders in dismal whispers that if `` the foe '' stirred , to `` let him have it to the hilt , '' because `` dead men tell no tales . ''
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 37]: They knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying in stores or having a spree , but still that was no excuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 21]: They shoved off , presently , Tom in command , Huck at the after oar and Joe at the forward .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 33]: Tom stood amidships , gloomy-browed , and with folded arms , and gave his orders in a low , stern whisper : `` Luff , and bring her to the wind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 6]: `` Aye-aye , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 6]: `` Steady , steady-y-y-y ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 8]: `` Steady it is , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 9]: `` Let her go off a point ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 8]: `` Point it is , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 37]: As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for `` style , '' and were not intended to mean anything in particular .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 8]: `` What sail 's she carrying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 13]: `` Courses , tops ` ls , and flying-jib , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 8]: `` Send the r ` yals up !
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 16]: Lay out aloft , there , half a dozen of ye -- foretopmaststuns ` l !
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 5]: Lively , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 6]: `` Aye-aye , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 8]: `` Shake out that maintogalans ` l !
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 4]: Sheets and braces !
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 5]: NOW my hearties ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 6]: `` Aye-aye , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 7]: `` Hellum-a-lee -- hard a port !
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 9]: Stand by to meet her when she comes !
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 4]: Port , port !
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 4]: NOW , men !
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 4]: With a will !
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 3]: Stead-y-y-y ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 8]: `` Steady it is , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 24]: The raft drew beyond the middle of the river ; the boys pointed her head right , and then lay on their oars .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 19]: The river was not high , so there was not more than a two or three mile current .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 13]: Hardly a word was said during the next three-quarters of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 10]: Now the raft was passing before the distant town .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 31]: Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay , peacefully sleeping , beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water , unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 62]: The Black Avenger stood still with folded arms , `` looking his last '' upon the scene of his former joys and his later sufferings , and wishing `` she '' could see him now , abroad on the wild sea , facing peril and death with dauntless heart , going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 35]: It was but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson 's Island beyond eyeshot of the village , and so he `` looked his last '' with a broken and satisfied heart .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 33]: The other pirates were looking their last , too ; and they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift them out of the range of the island .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 15]: But they discovered the danger in time , and made shift to avert it .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 35]: About two o'clock in the morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island , and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 48]: Part of the little raft 's belongings consisted of an old sail , and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions ; but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather , as became outlaws .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 49]: They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps within the sombre depths of the forest , and then cooked some bacon in the frying-pan for supper , and used up half of the corn `` pone '' stock they had brought .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 41]: It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild , free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island , far from the haunts of men , and they said they never would return to civilization .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 30]: The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple , and upon the varnished foliage and festooning vines .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 32]: When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone , and the last allowance of corn pone devoured , the boys stretched themselves out on the grass , filled with contentment .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 23]: They could have found a cooler place , but they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting camp-fire .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 7]: `` AI N'T it gay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 6]: `` It 's NUTS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 13]: `` What would the boys say if they could see us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 3]: `` Say ?
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 15]: Well , they 'd just die to be here -- hey , Hucky ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 16]: `` I reckon so , '' said Huckleberry ; `` anyways , I 'm suited .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 9]: I do n't want nothing better 'n this .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 30]: I do n't ever get enough to eat , gen ` ally -- and here they ca n't come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 13]: `` It 's just the life for me , '' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 30]: `` You do n't have to get up , mornings , and you do n't have to go to school , and wash , and all that blame foolishness .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 46]: You see a pirate do n't have to do ANYTHING , Joe , when he 's ashore , but a hermit HE has to be praying considerable , and then he do n't have any fun , anyway , all by himself that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 25]: `` Oh yes , that 's so , '' said Joe , `` but I had n't thought much about it , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 18]: I 'd a good deal rather be a pirate , now that I 've tried it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 34]: `` You see , '' said Tom , `` people do n't go much on hermits , nowadays , like they used to in old times , but a pirate 's always respected .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 48]: And a hermit 's got to sleep on the hardest place he can find , and put sackcloth and ashes on his head , and stand out in the rain , and -- '' `` What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 3]: inquired Huck .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 4]: `` I dono .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 8]: But they 've GOT to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 4]: Hermits always do .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 13]: You 'd have to do that if you was a hermit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 11]: `` Dern 'd if I would , '' said Huck .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 9]: `` Well , what would you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 4]: `` I dono .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 8]: But I would n't do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 10]: `` Why , Huck , you 'd HAVE to .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 8]: How 'd you get around it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 10]: `` Why , I just would n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 6]: I 'd run away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 4]: `` Run away !
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 13]: Well , you WOULD be a nice old slouch of a hermit .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 7]: You 'd be a disgrace . ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 10]: The Red-Handed made no response , being better employed .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 49]: He had finished gouging out a cob , and now he fitted a weed stem to it , loaded it with tobacco , and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke -- he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 17]: The other pirates envied him this majestic vice , and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 13]: Presently Huck said : `` What does pirates have to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 56]: Tom said : `` Oh , they have just a bully time -- take ships and burn them , and get the money and bury it in awful places in their island where there 's ghosts and things to watch it , and kill everybody in the ships -- make 'em walk a plank . ''
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 23]: `` And they carry the women to the island , '' said Joe ; `` they do n't kill the women . ''
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 20]: `` No , '' assented Tom , `` they do n't kill the women -- they 're too noble .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 9]: And the women 's always beautiful , too .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 10]: `` And do n't they wear the bulliest clothes !
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 3]: Oh no !
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 16]: All gold and silver and di ` monds , '' said Joe , with enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 3]: said Huck .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 7]: `` Why , the pirates . ''
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 7]: Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 35]: `` I reckon I ai n't dressed fitten for a pirate , '' said he , with a regretful pathos in his voice ; `` but I ai n't got none but these . ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 22]: But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough , after they should have begun their adventures .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 28]: They made him understand that his poor rags would do to begin with , though it was customary for wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 18]: Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the eyelids of the little waifs .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 22]: The pipe dropped from the fingers of the Red-Handed , and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 21]: The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had more difficulty in getting to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 64]: They said their prayers inwardly , and lying down , since there was nobody there with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud ; in truth , they had a mind not to say them at all , but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that , lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 28]: Then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep -- but an intruder came , now , that would not `` down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 4]: It was conscience .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 33]: They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away ; and next they thought of the stolen meat , and then the real torture came .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 83]: They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times ; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities ; it seemed to them , in the end , that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only `` hooking , '' while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing -- and there was a command against that in the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 27]: So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business , their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 16]: Then conscience granted a truce , and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 15]: CHAPTER XIV WHEN Tom awoke in the morning , he wondered where he was .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 11]: He sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked around .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 4]: Then he comprehended .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 28]: It was the cool gray dawn , and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 15]: Not a leaf stirred ; not a sound obtruded upon great Nature 's meditation .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 9]: Beaded dewdrops stood upon the leaves and grasses .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 22]: A white layer of ashes covered the fire , and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 6]: Joe and Huck still slept .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 23]: Now , far away in the woods a bird called ; another answered ; presently the hammering of a woodpecker was heard .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 20]: Gradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened , and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 18]: The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing boy .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 149]: A little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf , lifting two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and `` sniffing around , '' then proceeding again -- for he was measuring , Tom said ; and when the worm approached him , of its own accord , he sat as still as a stone , with his hopes rising and falling , by turns , as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere ; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom 's leg and began a journey over him , his whole heart was glad -- for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes -- without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 44]: Now a procession of ants appeared , from nowhere in particular , and went about their labors ; one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms , and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 87]: A brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade , and Tom bent down close to it and said , `` Lady-bug , lady-bug , fly away home , your house is on fire , your children 's alone , '' and she took wing and went off to see about it -- which did not surprise the boy , for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations , and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 32]: A tumblebug came next , heaving sturdily at its ball , and Tom touched the creature , to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 9]: The birds were fairly rioting by this time .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 121]: A catbird , the Northern mocker , lit in a tree over Tom 's head , and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment ; then a shrill jay swept down , a flash of blue flame , and stopped on a twig almost within the boy 's reach , cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity ; a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the `` fox '' kind came skurrying along , sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys , for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 34]: All Nature was wide awake and stirring , now ; long lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near , and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 41]: Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a shout , and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 19]: They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 36]: A vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their raft , but this only gratified them , since its going was something like burning the bridge between them and civilization .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 23]: They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed , glad-hearted , and ravenous ; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 46]: Huck found a spring of clear cold water close by , and the boys made cups of broad oak or hickory leaves , and felt that water , sweetened with such a wildwood charm as that , would be a good enough substitute for coffee .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 40]: While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast , Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a minute ; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in their lines ; almost immediately they had reward .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 34]: Joe had not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass , a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish -- provisions enough for quite a family .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 22]: They fried the fish with the bacon , and were astonished ; for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 49]: They did not know that the quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is ; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping , open-air exercise , bathing , and a large ingredient of hunger make , too .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 28]: They lay around in the shade , after breakfast , while Huck had a smoke , and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 34]: They tramped gayly along , over decaying logs , through tangled underbrush , among solemn monarchs of the forest , hung from their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 16]: Now and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 17]: They found plenty of things to be delighted with , but nothing to be astonished at .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 41]: They discovered that the island was about three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide , and that the shore it lay closest to was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards wide .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 25]: They took a swim about every hour , so it was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got back to camp .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 28]: They were too hungry to stop to fish , but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham , and then threw themselves down in the shade to talk .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 12]: But the talk soon began to drag , and then died .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 27]: The stillness , the solemnity that brooded in the woods , and the sense of loneliness , began to tell upon the spirits of the boys .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 5]: They fell to thinking .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 9]: A sort of undefined longing crept upon them .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 12]: This took dim shape , presently -- it was budding homesickness .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 13]: Even Finn the Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 19]: But they were all ashamed of their weakness , and none was brave enough to speak his thought .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 39]: For some time , now , the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar sound in the distance , just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a clock which he takes no distinct note of .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 14]: But now this mysterious sound became more pronounced , and forced a recognition .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 17]: The boys started , glanced at each other , and then each assumed a listening attitude .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 24]: There was a long silence , profound and unbroken ; then a deep , sullen boom came floating down out of the distance .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 6]: `` What is it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 7]: exclaimed Joe , under his breath .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 12]: `` I wonder , '' said Tom in a whisper . ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 23]: ` Tai n't thunder , '' said Huckleberry , in an awed tone , `` becuz thunder -- '' `` Hark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 8]: `` Listen -- do n't talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 20]: They waited a time that seemed an age , and then the same muffled boom troubled the solemn hush .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 8]: `` Let 's go and see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 14]: They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 14]: They parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 17]: The little steam ferryboat was about a mile below the village , drifting with the current .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 8]: Her broad deck seemed crowded with people .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 34]: There were a great many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat , but the boys could not determine what the men in them were doing .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 38]: Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboat 's side , and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud , that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 6]: `` I know now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 9]: exclaimed Tom ; `` somebody 's drownded ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 6]: `` That 's it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 34]: said Huck ; `` they done that last summer , when Bill Turner got drownded ; they shoot a cannon over the water , and that makes him come up to the top .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 36]: Yes , and they take loaves of bread and put quicksilver in 'em and set 'em afloat , and wherever there 's anybody that 's drownded , they 'll float right there and stop . ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 13]: `` Yes , I 've heard about that , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 11]: `` I wonder what makes the bread do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 34]: `` Oh , it ai n't the bread , so much , '' said Tom ; `` I reckon it 's mostly what they SAY over it before they start it out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 14]: `` But they do n't say anything over it , '' said Huck .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 11]: `` I 've seen 'em and they do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 11]: `` Well , that 's funny , '' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 9]: `` But maybe they say it to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 5]: Of COURSE they do .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 6]: Anybody might know that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 42]: The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said , because an ignorant lump of bread , uninstructed by an incantation , could not be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such gravity .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 17]: `` By jings , I wish I was over there , now , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 19]: `` I do too '' said Huck `` I 'd give heaps to know who it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 7]: The boys still listened and watched .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 28]: Presently a revealing thought flashed through Tom 's mind , and he exclaimed : `` Boys , I know who 's drownded -- it 's us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 8]: They felt like heroes in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 80]: Here was a gorgeous triumph ; they were missed ; they were mourned ; hearts were breaking on their account ; tears were being shed ; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising up , and unavailing regrets and remorse were being indulged ; and best of all , the departed were the talk of the whole town , and the envy of all the boys , as far as this dazzling notoriety was concerned .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 4]: This was fine .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 12]: It was worth while to be a pirate , after all .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 18]: As twilight drew on , the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business and the skiffs disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 6]: The pirates returned to camp .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 17]: They were jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble they were making .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 50]: They caught fish , cooked supper and ate it , and then fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them ; and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were gratifying to look upon -- from their point of view .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 30]: But when the shadows of night closed them in , they gradually ceased to talk , and sat gazing into the fire , with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 34]: The excitement was gone , now , and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as much as they were .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 17]: Misgivings came ; they grew troubled and unhappy ; a sigh or two escaped , unawares .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 37]: By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a roundabout `` feeler '' as to how the others might look upon a return to civilization -- not right now , but -- Tom withered him with derision !
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 44]: Huck , being uncommitted as yet , joined in with Tom , and the waverer quickly `` explained , '' and was glad to get out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted homesickness clinging to his garments as he could .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 10]: Mutiny was effectually laid to rest for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 15]: As the night deepened , Huck began to nod , and presently to snore .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 4]: Joe followed next .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 16]: Tom lay upon his elbow motionless , for some time , watching the two intently .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 26]: At last he got up cautiously , on his knees , and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung by the camp-fire .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 27]: He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore , and finally chose two which seemed to suit him .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 52]: Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something upon each of these with his `` red keel '' ; one he rolled up and put in his jacket pocket , and the other he put in Joe 's hat and removed it to a little distance from the owner .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 46]: And he also put into the hat certain schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value -- among them a lump of chalk , an India-rubber ball , three fishhooks , and one of that kind of marbles known as a `` sure ` nough crystal . ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 33]: Then he tiptoed his way cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing , and straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 22]: CHAPTER XV A FEW minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar , wading toward the Illinois shore .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 33]: Before the depth reached his middle he was half-way over ; the current would permit no more wading , now , so he struck out confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 17]: He swam quartering upstream , but still was swept downward rather faster than he had expected .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 22]: However , he reached the shore finally , and drifted along till he found a low place and drew himself out .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 31]: He put his hand on his jacket pocket , found his piece of bark safe , and then struck through the woods , following the shore , with streaming garments .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 31]: Shortly before ten o'clock he came out into an open place opposite the village , and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 8]: Everything was quiet under the blinking stars .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 39]: He crept down the bank , watching with all his eyes , slipped into the water , swam three or four strokes and climbed into the skiff that did `` yawl '' duty at the boat 's stern .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 12]: He laid himself down under the thwarts and waited , panting .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 17]: Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to `` cast off . ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 26]: A minute or two later the skiff 's head was standing high up , against the boat 's swell , and the voyage was begun .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 21]: Tom felt happy in his success , for he knew it was the boat 's last trip for the night .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 37]: At the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped , and Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk , landing fifty yards downstream , out of danger of possible stragglers .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 17]: He flew along unfrequented alleys , and shortly found himself at his aunt 's back fence .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 25]: He climbed over , approached the `` ell , '' and looked in at the sitting-room window , for a light was burning there .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 20]: There sat Aunt Polly , Sid , Mary , and Joe Harper 's mother , grouped together , talking .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 16]: They were by the bed , and the bed was between them and the door .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 58]: Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch ; then he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack ; he continued pushing cautiously , and quaking every time it creaked , till he judged he might squeeze through on his knees ; so he put his head through and began , warily .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 9]: `` What makes the candle blow so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 4]: said Aunt Polly .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 4]: Tom hurried up .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 11]: `` Why , that door 's open , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 7]: Why , of course it is .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 7]: No end of strange things now .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 10]: Go ` long and shut it , Sid . ''
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 9]: Tom disappeared under the bed just in time .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 25]: He lay and `` breathed '' himself for a time , and then crept to where he could almost touch his aunt 's foot .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 25]: `` But as I was saying , '' said Aunt Polly , `` he war n't BAD , so to say -- only mischEEvous .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 10]: Only just giddy , and harum-scarum , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 10]: He war n't any more responsible than a colt .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 23]: HE never meant any harm , and he was the best-hearted boy that ever was '' -- and she began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 89]: `` It was just so with my Joe -- always full of his devilment , and up to every kind of mischief , but he was just as unselfish and kind as he could be -- and laws bless me , to think I went and whipped him for taking that cream , never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because it was sour , and I never to see him again in this world , never , never , never , poor abused boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 11]: And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would break .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 31]: `` I hope Tom 's better off where he is , '' said Sid , `` but if he 'd been better in some ways -- '' `` SID ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 18]: Tom felt the glare of the old lady 's eye , though he could not see it .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 14]: `` Not a word against my Tom , now that he 's gone !
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 14]: God 'll take care of HIM -- never you trouble YOURself , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 15]: Oh , Mrs. Harper , I do n't know how to give him up !
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 10]: I do n't know how to give him up !
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 22]: He was such a comfort to me , although he tormented my old heart out of me , ` most . ''
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 19]: `` The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away -- Blessed be the name of the Lord !
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 13]: But it 's so hard -- Oh , it 's so hard !
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 18]: Only last Saturday my Joe busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 29]: Little did I know then , how soon -- Oh , if it was to do over again I 'd hug him and bless him for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 25]: `` Yes , yes , yes , I know just how you feel , Mrs. Harper , I know just exactly how you feel .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 30]: No longer ago than yesterday noon , my Tom took and filled the cat full of Pain-killer , and I did think the cretur would tear the house down .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 21]: And God forgive me , I cracked Tom 's head with my thimble , poor boy , poor dead boy .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 10]: But he 's out of all his troubles now .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 31]: And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach -- '' But this memory was too much for the old lady , and she broke entirely down .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 18]: Tom was snuffling , now , himself -- and more in pity of himself than anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 19]: He could hear Mary crying , and putting in a kindly word for him from time to time .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 13]: He began to have a nobler opinion of himself than ever before .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 48]: Still , he was sufficiently touched by his aunt 's grief to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy -- and the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his nature , too , but he resisted and lay still .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 135]: He went on listening , and gathered by odds and ends that it was conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim ; then the small raft had been missed ; next , certain boys said the missing lads had promised that the village should `` hear something '' soon ; the wise-heads had `` put this and that together '' and decided that the lads had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below , presently ; but toward noon the raft had been found , lodged against the Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village -- and then hope perished ; they must be drowned , else hunger would have driven them home by nightfall if not sooner .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 39]: It was believed that the search for the bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must have occurred in mid-channel , since the boys , being good swimmers , would otherwise have escaped to shore .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 5]: This was Wednesday night .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 25]: If the bodies continued missing until Sunday , all hope would be given over , and the funerals would be preached on that morning .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 3]: Tom shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 11]: Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing good-night and turned to go .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 28]: Then with a mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other 's arms and had a good , consoling cry , and then parted .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 17]: Aunt Polly was tender far beyond her wont , in her good-night to Sid and Mary .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 14]: Sid snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 42]: Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly , so appealingly , and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice , that he was weltering in tears again , long before she was through .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 30]: He had to keep still long after she went to bed , for she kept making broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time , tossing unrestfully , and turning over .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 15]: But at last she was still , only moaning a little in her sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 24]: Now the boy stole out , rose gradually by the bedside , shaded the candle-light with his hand , and stood regarding her .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 9]: His heart was full of pity for her .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 13]: He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the candle .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 11]: But something occurred to him , and he lingered considering .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 20]: His face lighted with a happy solution of his thought ; he put the bark hastily in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 23]: Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips , and straightway made his stealthy exit , latching the door behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 48]: He threaded his way back to the ferry landing , found nobody at large there , and walked boldly on board the boat , for he knew she was tenantless except that there was a watchman , who always turned in and slept like a graven image .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 19]: He untied the skiff at the stern , slipped into it , and was soon rowing cautiously upstream .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 22]: When he had pulled a mile above the village , he started quartering across and bent himself stoutly to his work .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 21]: He hit the landing on the other side neatly , for this was a familiar bit of work to him .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 42]: He was moved to capture the skiff , arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore legitimate prey for a pirate , but he knew a thorough search would be made for it and that might end in revelations .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 9]: So he stepped ashore and entered the woods .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 24]: He sat down and took a long rest , torturing himself meanwhile to keep awake , and then started warily down the home-stretch .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 6]: The night was far spent .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 14]: It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the island bar .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 26]: He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the great river with its splendor , and then he plunged into the stream .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 35]: A little later he paused , dripping , upon the threshold of the camp , and heard Joe say : `` No , Tom 's true-blue , Huck , and he 'll come back .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 5]: He wo n't desert .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 22]: He knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate , and Tom 's too proud for that sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 8]: He 's up to something or other .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 6]: Now I wonder what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 15]: `` Well , the things is ours , anyway , ai n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 10]: `` Pretty near , but not yet , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 15]: The writing says they are if he ai n't back here to breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 6]: `` Which he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 13]: exclaimed Tom , with fine dramatic effect , stepping grandly into camp .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 30]: A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided , and as the boys set to work upon it , Tom recounted -LRB- and adorned -RRB- his adventures .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 15]: They were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 25]: Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon , and the other pirates got ready to fish and explore .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 18]: CHAPTER XVI AFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 28]: They went about poking sticks into the sand , and when they found a soft place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 13]: Sometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 14]: They were perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 15]: They had a famous fried-egg feast that night , and another on Friday morning .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 69]: After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar , and chased each other round and round , shedding clothes as they went , until they were naked , and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the bar , against the stiff current , which latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 82]: And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each other 's faces with their palms , gradually approaching each other , with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays , and finally gripping and struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor , and then they all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing , sputtering , laughing , and gasping for breath at one and the same time .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 47]: When they were well exhausted , they would run out and sprawl on the dry , hot sand , and lie there and cover themselves up with it , and by and by break for the water again and go through the original performance once more .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 47]: Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented flesh-colored `` tights '' very fairly ; so they drew a ring in the sand and had a circus -- with three clowns in it , for none would yield this proudest post to his neighbor .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 24]: Next they got their marbles and played `` knucks '' and `` ring-taw '' and `` keeps '' till that amusement grew stale .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 53]: Then Joe and Huck had another swim , but Tom would not venture , because he found that in kicking off his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his ankle , and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the protection of this mysterious charm .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 25]: He did not venture again until he had found it , and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to rest .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 31]: They gradually wandered apart , dropped into the `` dumps , '' and fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay drowsing in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 29]: Tom found himself writing `` BECKY '' in the sand with his big toe ; he scratched it out , and was angry with himself for his weakness .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 14]: But he wrote it again , nevertheless ; he could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 22]: He erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving the other boys together and joining them .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 11]: But Joe 's spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 14]: He was so homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 8]: The tears lay very near the surface .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 6]: Huck was melancholy , too .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 12]: Tom was downhearted , but tried hard not to show it .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 33]: He had a secret which he was not ready to tell , yet , but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon , he would have to bring it out .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 24]: He said , with a great show of cheerfulness : `` I bet there 's been pirates on this island before , boys .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 6]: We 'll explore it again .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 7]: They 've hid treasures here somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 19]: How 'd you feel to light on a rotten chest full of gold and silver -- hey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 15]: But it roused only faint enthusiasm , which faded out , with no reply .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 14]: Tom tried one or two other seductions ; but they failed , too .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 5]: It was discouraging work .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 14]: Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking very gloomy .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 15]: Finally he said : `` Oh , boys , let 's give it up .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 6]: I want to go home .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 6]: It 's so lonesome . ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 18]: `` Oh no , Joe , you 'll feel better by and by , '' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 11]: `` Just think of the fishing that 's here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 8]: `` I do n't care for fishing .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 7]: I want to go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 14]: `` But , Joe , there ai n't such another swimming-place anywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 6]: `` Swimming 's no good .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 25]: I do n't seem to care for it , somehow , when there ai n't anybody to say I sha 'n' t go in .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 7]: I mean to go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 5]: `` Oh , shucks !
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 2]: Baby !
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 11]: You want to see your mother , I reckon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 22]: `` Yes , I DO want to see my mother -- and you would , too , if you had one .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 11]: I ai n't any more baby than you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 6]: And Joe snuffled a little .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 20]: `` Well , we 'll let the cry-baby go home to his mother , wo n't we , Huck ?
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 11]: Poor thing -- does it want to see its mother ?
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 5]: And so it shall .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 11]: You like it here , do n't you , Huck ?
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 9]: We 'll stay , wo n't we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 13]: Huck said , `` Y-e-s '' -- without any heart in it .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 20]: `` I 'll never speak to you again as long as I live , '' said Joe , rising .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 5]: `` There now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 11]: And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 5]: `` Who cares ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 6]: `` Nobody wants you to .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 9]: Go ` long home and get laughed at .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 8]: Oh , you 're a nice pirate .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 7]: Huck and me ai n't cry-babies .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 10]: We 'll stay , wo n't we , Huck ?
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 8]: Let him go if he wants to .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 14]: I reckon we can get along without him , per ` aps . ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 20]: But Tom was uneasy , nevertheless , and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly on with his dressing .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 23]: And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying Joe 's preparations so wistfully , and keeping up such an ominous silence .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 17]: Presently , without a parting word , Joe began to wade off toward the Illinois shore .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 7]: Tom 's heart began to sink .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 5]: He glanced at Huck .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 12]: Huck could not bear the look , and dropped his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 14]: Then he said : `` I want to go , too , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 14]: It was getting so lonesome anyway , and now it 'll be worse .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 10]: Let 's us go , too , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 5]: `` I wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 10]: You can all go , if you want to .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 6]: I mean to stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 8]: `` Tom , I better go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 13]: `` Well , go ` long -- who 's hendering you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 9]: Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 14]: He said : `` Tom , I wisht you 'd come , too .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 6]: Now you think it over .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 12]: We 'll wait for you when we get to shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 16]: `` Well , you 'll wait a blame long time , that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 29]: Huck started sorrowfully away , and Tom stood looking after him , with a strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 14]: He hoped the boys would stop , but they still waded slowly on .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 14]: It suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 21]: He made one final struggle with his pride , and then darted after his comrades , yelling : `` Wait !
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 2]: Wait !
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 8]: I want to tell you something ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 7]: They presently stopped and turned around .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 49]: When he got to where they were , he began unfolding his secret , and they listened moodily till at last they saw the `` point '' he was driving at , and then they set up a war-whoop of applause and said it was `` splendid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 17]: and said if he had told them at first , they would n't have started away .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 46]: He made a plausible excuse ; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret would keep them with him any very great length of time , and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 31]: The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will , chattering all the time about Tom 's stupendous plan and admiring the genius of it .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 19]: After a dainty egg and fish dinner , Tom said he wanted to learn to smoke , now .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 15]: Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to try , too .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 8]: So Huck made pipes and filled them .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 28]: These novices had never smoked anything before but cigars made of grape-vine , and they `` bit '' the tongue , and were not considered manly anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 20]: Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff , charily , and with slender confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 26]: The smoke had an unpleasant taste , and they gagged a little , but Tom said : `` Why , it 's just as easy !
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 17]: If I 'd a knowed this was all , I 'd a learnt long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 9]: `` So would I , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 7]: `` It 's just nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 34]: `` Why , many a time I 've looked at people smoking , and thought well I wish I could do that ; but I never thought I could , '' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 15]: `` That 's just the way with me , hai n't it , Huck ?
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 15]: You 've heard me talk just that way -- have n't you , Huck ?
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 12]: I 'll leave it to Huck if I have n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 11]: `` Yes -- heaps of times , '' said Huck .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 18]: `` Well , I have too , '' said Tom ; `` oh , hundreds of times .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 6]: Once down by the slaughter-house .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 7]: Do n't you remember , Huck ?
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 18]: Bob Tanner was there , and Johnny Miller , and Jeff Thatcher , when I said it .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 14]: Do n't you remember , Huck , ` bout me saying that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 11]: `` Yes , that 's so , '' said Huck .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 12]: `` That was the day after I lost a white alley .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 9]: No , 't was the day before . ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 12]: `` There -- I told you so , '' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 6]: `` Huck recollects it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 15]: `` I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 8]: `` I do n't feel sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 9]: `` Neither do I , '' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 8]: `` I could smoke it all day .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 10]: But I bet you Jeff Thatcher could n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 4]: `` Jeff Thatcher !
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 11]: Why , he 'd keel over just with two draws .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 7]: Just let him try it once .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 5]: HE 'D see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 6]: `` I bet he would .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 15]: And Johnny Miller -- I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle it once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 8]: `` Oh , do n't I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 17]: `` Why , I bet you Johnny Miller could n't any more do this than nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 10]: Just one little snifter would fetch HIM . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 7]: ` Deed it would , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 12]: Say -- I wish the boys could see us now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 41]: `` So do I. '' `` Say -- boys , do n't say anything about it , and some time when they 're around , I 'll come up to you and say , ` Joe , got a pipe ?
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 6]: I want a smoke . '
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 43]: And you 'll say , kind of careless like , as if it war n't anything , you 'll say , ` Yes , I got my OLD pipe , and another one , but my tobacker ai n't very good . '
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 20]: And I 'll say , ` Oh , that 's all right , if it 's STRONG enough . '
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 27]: And then you 'll out with the pipes , and we 'll light up just as ca 'm , and then just see 'em look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 11]: `` By jings , that 'll be gay , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 7]: I wish it was NOW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 5]: `` So do I !
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 23]: And when we tell 'em we learned when we was off pirating , wo n't they wish they 'd been along ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 7]: `` Oh , I reckon not !
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 8]: I 'll just BET they will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 6]: So the talk ran on .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 13]: But presently it began to flag a trifle , and grow disjointed .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 9]: The silences widened ; the expectoration marvellously increased .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 50]: Every pore inside the boys ' cheeks became a spouting fountain ; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues fast enough to prevent an inundation ; little overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they could do , and sudden retchings followed every time .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 11]: Both boys were looking very pale and miserable , now .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 9]: Joe 's pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 4]: Tom 's followed .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 14]: Both fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 11]: Joe said feebly : `` I 've lost my knife .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 10]: I reckon I better go and find it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 16]: Tom said , with quivering lips and halting utterance : `` I 'll help you .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 14]: You go over that way and I 'll hunt around by the spring .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 15]: No , you need n't come , Huck -- we can find it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 11]: So Huck sat down again , and waited an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 13]: Then he found it lonesome , and went to find his comrades .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 16]: They were wide apart in the woods , both very pale , both fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 18]: But something informed him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of it .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 9]: They were not talkative at supper that night .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 43]: They had a humble look , and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare theirs , they said no , they were not feeling very well -- something they ate at dinner had disagreed with them .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 10]: About midnight Joe awoke , and called the boys .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 14]: There was a brooding oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 26]: The boys huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of the fire , though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was stifling .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 8]: They sat still , intent and waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 5]: The solemn hush continued .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 16]: Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 18]: Presently there came a quivering glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 10]: By and by another came , a little stronger .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 3]: Then another .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 38]: Then a faint moan came sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting breath upon their cheeks , and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit of the Night had gone by .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 5]: There was a pause .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 24]: Now a weird flash turned night into day and showed every little grass-blade , separate and distinct , that grew about their feet .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 11]: And it showed three white , startled faces , too .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 22]: A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 22]: A sweep of chilly air passed by , rustling all the leaves and snowing the flaky ashes broadcast about the fire .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 25]: Another fierce glare lit up the forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the tree-tops right over the boys ' heads .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 13]: They clung together in terror , in the thick gloom that followed .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 10]: A few big rain-drops fell pattering upon the leaves .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 3]: `` Quick !
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 8]: boys , go for the tent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 3]: exclaimed Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 22]: They sprang away , stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark , no two plunging in the same direction .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 15]: A furious blast roared through the trees , making everything sing as it went .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 15]: One blinding flash after another came , and peal on peal of deafening thunder .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 19]: And now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 21]: The boys cried out to each other , but the roaring wind and the booming thunder-blasts drowned their voices utterly .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 39]: However , one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent , cold , scared , and streaming with water ; but to have company in misery seemed something to be grateful for .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 22]: They could not talk , the old sail flapped so furiously , even if the other noises would have allowed them .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 24]: The tempest rose higher and higher , and presently the sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 29]: The boys seized each others ' hands and fled , with many tumblings and bruises , to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the river-bank .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 8]: Now the battle was at its highest .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 64]: Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies , everything below stood out in clean-cut and shadowless distinctness : the bending trees , the billowy river , white with foam , the driving spray of spume-flakes , the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side , glimpsed through the drifting cloud-rack and the slanting veil of rain .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 36]: Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth ; and the unflagging thunder-peals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts , keen and sharp , and unspeakably appalling .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 46]: The storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces , burn it up , drown it to the tree-tops , blow it away , and deafen every creature in it , all at one and the same moment .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 14]: It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out in .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 26]: But at last the battle was done , and the forces retired with weaker and weaker threatenings and grumblings , and peace resumed her sway .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 57]: The boys went back to camp , a good deal awed ; but they found there was still something to be thankful for , because the great sycamore , the shelter of their beds , was a ruin , now , blasted by the lightnings , and they were not under it when the catastrophe happened .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 30]: Everything in camp was drenched , the camp-fire as well ; for they were but heedless lads , like their generation , and had made no provision against rain .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 14]: Here was matter for dismay , for they were soaked through and chilled .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 79]: They were eloquent in their distress ; but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against -LRB- where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground -RRB- , that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting ; so they patiently wrought until , with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs , they coaxed the fire to burn again .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 20]: Then they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace , and were glad-hearted once more .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 42]: They dried their boiled ham and had a feast , and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning , for there was not a dry spot to sleep on , anywhere around .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 29]: As the sun began to steal in upon the boys , drowsiness came over them , and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 15]: They got scorched out by and by , and drearily set about getting breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 17]: After the meal they felt rusty , and stiff-jointed , and a little homesick once more .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 18]: Tom saw the signs , and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as he could .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 16]: But they cared nothing for marbles , or circus , or swimming , or anything .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 15]: He reminded them of the imposing secret , and raised a ray of cheer .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 13]: While it lasted , he got them interested in a new device .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 19]: This was to knock off being pirates , for a while , and be Indians for a change .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 54]: They were attracted by this idea ; so it was not long before they were stripped , and striped from head to heel with black mud , like so many zebras -- all of them chiefs , of course -- and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an English settlement .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 30]: By and by they separated into three hostile tribes , and darted upon each other from ambush with dreadful war-whoops , and killed and scalped each other by thousands .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 6]: It was a gory day .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 8]: Consequently it was an extremely satisfactory one .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 45]: They assembled in camp toward supper-time , hungry and happy ; but now a difficulty arose -- hostile Indians could not break the bread of hospitality together without first making peace , and this was a simple impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 12]: There was no other process that ever they had heard of .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 11]: Two of the savages almost wished they had remained pirates .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 35]: However , there was no other way ; so with such show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and took their whiff as it passed , in due form .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 49]: And behold , they were glad they had gone into savagery , for they had gained something ; they found that they could now smoke a little without having to go and hunt for a lost knife ; they did not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 15]: They were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 22]: No , they practised cautiously , after supper , with right fair success , and so they spent a jubilant evening .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 24]: They were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 22]: We will leave them to smoke and chatter and brag , since we have no further use for them at present .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 17]: CHAPTER XVII BUT there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil Saturday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 22]: The Harpers , and Aunt Polly 's family , were being put into mourning , with great grief and many tears .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 18]: An unusual quiet possessed the village , although it was ordinarily quiet enough , in all conscience .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 19]: The villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air , and talked little ; but they sighed often .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 10]: The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to the children .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 14]: They had no heart in their sports , and gradually gave them up .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 19]: In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted schoolhouse yard , and feeling very melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 9]: But she found nothing there to comfort her .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 15]: She soliloquized : `` Oh , if I only had a brass andiron-knob again !
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 13]: But I have n't got anything now to remember him by . ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 8]: And she choked back a little sob .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 15]: Presently she stopped , and said to herself : `` It was right here .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 26]: Oh , if it was to do over again , I would n't say that -- I would n't say it for the whole world .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 19]: But he 's gone now ; I 'll never , never , never see him any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 18]: This thought broke her down , and she wandered away , with tears rolling down her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 67]: Then quite a group of boys and girls -- playmates of Tom 's and Joe 's -- came by , and stood looking over the paling fence and talking in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw him , and how Joe said this and that small trifle -LRB- pregnant with awful prophecy , as they could easily see now ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 94]: -- and each speaker pointed out the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time , and then added something like `` and I was a-standing just so -- just as I am now , and as if you was him -- I was as close as that -- and he smiled , just this way -- and then something seemed to go all over me , like -- awful , you know -- and I never thought what it meant , of course , but I can see now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 79]: Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life , and many claimed that dismal distinction , and offered evidences , more or less tampered with by the witness ; and when it was ultimately decided who DID see the departed last , and exchanged the last words with them , the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance , and were gaped at and envied by all the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 32]: One poor chap , who had no other grandeur to offer , said with tolerably manifest pride in the remembrance : `` Well , Tom Sawyer he licked me once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 9]: But that bid for glory was a failure .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 17]: Most of the boys could say that , and so that cheapened the distinction too much .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 17]: The group loitered away , still recalling memories of the lost heroes , in awed voices .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 25]: When the Sunday-school hour was finished , the next morning , the bell began to toll , instead of ringing in the usual way .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 23]: It was a very still Sabbath , and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush that lay upon nature .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 21]: The villagers began to gather , loitering a moment in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 27]: But there was no whispering in the house ; only the funereal rustling of dresses as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 13]: None could remember when the little church had been so full before .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 60]: There was finally a waiting pause , an expectant dumbness , and then Aunt Polly entered , followed by Sid and Mary , and they by the Harper family , all in deep black , and the whole congregation , the old minister as well , rose reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 24]: There was another communing silence , broken at intervals by muffled sobs , and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 21]: A moving hymn was sung , and the text followed : `` I am the Resurrection and the Life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 67]: As the service proceeded , the clergyman drew such pictures of the graces , the winning ways , and the rare promise of the lost lads that every soul there , thinking he recognized these pictures , felt a pang in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always before , and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor boys .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 63]: The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the departed , too , which illustrated their sweet , generous natures , and the people could easily see , now , how noble and beautiful those episodes were , and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had seemed rank rascalities , well deserving of the cowhide .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 50]: The congregation became more and more moved , as the pathetic tale went on , till at last the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus of anguished sobs , the preacher himself giving way to his feelings , and crying in the pulpit .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 34]: There was a rustle in the gallery , which nobody noticed ; a moment later the church door creaked ; the minister raised his streaming eyes above his handkerchief , and stood transfixed !
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 58]: First one and then another pair of eyes followed the minister 's , and then almost with one impulse the congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up the aisle , Tom in the lead , Joe next , and Huck , a ruin of drooping rags , sneaking sheepishly in the rear !
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 15]: They had been hid in the unused gallery listening to their own funeral sermon !
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 48]: Aunt Polly , Mary , and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored ones , smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings , while poor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable , not knowing exactly what to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 25]: He wavered , and started to slink away , but Tom seized him and said : `` Aunt Polly , it ai n't fair .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 11]: Somebody 's got to be glad to see Huck . ''
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 6]: `` And so they shall .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 12]: I 'm glad to see him , poor motherless thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 24]: And the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 22]: Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice : `` Praise God from whom all blessings flow -- SING !
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 9]: -- and put your hearts in it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 4]: And they did .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 42]: Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst , and while it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the proudest moment of his life .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 30]: As the `` sold '' congregation trooped out they said they would almost be willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that once more .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 42]: Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day -- according to Aunt Polly 's varying moods -- than he had earned before in a year ; and he hardly knew which expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 24]: CHAPTER XVIII THAT was Tom 's great secret -- the scheme to return home with his brother pirates and attend their own funerals .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 68]: They had paddled over to the Missouri shore on a log , at dusk on Saturday , landing five or six miles below the village ; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town till nearly daylight , and had then crept through back lanes and alleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of invalided benches .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 23]: At breakfast , Monday morning , Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to Tom , and very attentive to his wants .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 8]: There was an unusual amount of talk .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 58]: In the course of it Aunt Polly said : `` Well , I do n't say it was n't a fine joke , Tom , to keep everybody suffering ` most a week so you boys had a good time , but it is a pity you could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 38]: If you could come over on a log to go to your funeral , you could have come over and give me a hint some way that you war n't dead , but only run off . ''
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 29]: `` Yes , you could have done that , Tom , '' said Mary ; `` and I believe you would if you had thought of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 7]: `` Would you , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 9]: said Aunt Polly , her face lighting wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 16]: `` Say , now , would you , if you 'd thought of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 10]: `` I -- well , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 9]: ` Twould ` a ' spoiled everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 25]: `` Tom , I hoped you loved me that much , '' said Aunt Polly , with a grieved tone that discomforted the boy .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 25]: `` It would have been something if you 'd cared enough to THINK of it , even if you did n't DO it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 39]: `` Now , auntie , that ai n't any harm , '' pleaded Mary ; `` it 's only Tom 's giddy way -- he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 6]: `` More 's the pity .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 5]: Sid would have thought .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 11]: And Sid would have come and DONE it , too .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 36]: Tom , you 'll look back , some day , when it 's too late , and wish you 'd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so little . ''
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 17]: `` Now , auntie , you know I do care for you , '' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 14]: `` I 'd know it better if you acted more like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 26]: `` I wish now I 'd thought , '' said Tom , with a repentant tone ; `` but I dreamt about you , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 9]: That 's something , ai n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 19]: `` It ai n't much -- a cat does that much -- but it 's better than nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 6]: What did you dream ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 32]: `` Why , Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the bed , and Sid was sitting by the woodbox , and Mary next to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 7]: `` Well , so we did .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 5]: So we always do .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 15]: I 'm glad your dreams could take even that much trouble about us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 13]: `` And I dreamt that Joe Harper 's mother was here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 7]: `` Why , she was here !
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 7]: Did you dream any more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 5]: `` Oh , lots .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 9]: But it 's so dim , now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 12]: `` Well , try to recollect -- ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 24]: `` Somehow it seems to me that the wind -- the wind blowed the -- the -- '' `` Try harder , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 6]: The wind did blow something .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 3]: Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 22]: Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute , and then said : `` I 've got it now !
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 6]: I 've got it now !
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 6]: It blowed the candle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 5]: `` Mercy on us !
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 9]: Go on , Tom -- go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 28]: `` And it seems to me that you said , ` Why , I believe that that door -- ' '' `` Go ON , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 12]: `` Just let me study a moment -- just a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 14]: Oh , yes -- you said you believed the door was open . ''
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 10]: `` As I 'm sitting here , I did !
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 6]: Did n't I , Mary !
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 4]: Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 32]: `` And then -- and then -- well I wo n't be certain , but it seems like as if you made Sid go and -- and -- '' `` Well ?
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 2]: Well ?
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 9]: What did I make him do , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 8]: What did I make him do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 16]: `` You made him -- you -- Oh , you made him shut it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 9]: `` Well , for the land 's sake !
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 12]: I never heard the beat of that in all my days !
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 14]: Do n't tell ME there ai n't anything in dreams , any more .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 13]: Sereny Harper shall know of this before I 'm an hour older .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 16]: I 'd like to see her get around THIS with her rubbage ` bout superstition .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 6]: Go on , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 15]: `` Oh , it 's all getting just as bright as day , now .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 33]: Next you said I war n't BAD , only mischeevous and harum-scarum , and not any more responsible than -- than -- I think it was a colt , or something . ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 6]: `` And so it was !
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 5]: Well , goodness gracious !
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 6]: Go on , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 9]: `` And then you began to cry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 5]: `` So I did .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 4]: So I did .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 7]: Not the first time , neither .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 46]: And then -- '' `` Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry , and said Joe was just the same , and she wished she had n't whipped him for taking cream when she 'd throwed it out her own self -- '' `` Tom !
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 6]: The sperrit was upon you !
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 12]: You was a prophesying -- that 's what you was doing !
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 9]: Land alive , go on , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 23]: `` Then Sid he said -- he said -- '' `` I do n't think I said anything , '' said Sid .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 11]: `` Yes you did , Sid , '' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 10]: `` Shut your heads and let Tom go on !
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 8]: What did he say , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 36]: `` He said -- I THINK he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone to , but if I 'd been better sometimes -- '' `` THERE , d'you hear that !
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 7]: It was his very words ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 9]: `` And you shut him up sharp . ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 6]: `` I lay I did !
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 10]: There must ` a ' been an angel there .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 9]: There WAS an angel there , somewheres ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 32]: `` And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker , and you told about Peter and the Painkiller -- '' `` Just as true as I live ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 42]: `` And then there was a whole lot of talk ` bout dragging the river for us , and ` bout having the funeral Sunday , and then you and old Miss Harper hugged and cried , and she went . ''
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 6]: `` It happened just so !
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 16]: It happened just so , as sure as I 'm a-sitting in these very tracks .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 18]: Tom , you could n't told it more like if you 'd ` a ' seen it !
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 4]: And then what ?
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 6]: Go on , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 21]: `` Then I thought you prayed for me -- and I could see you and hear every word you said .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 74]: And you went to bed , and I was so sorry that I took and wrote on a piece of sycamore bark , ` We ai n't dead -- we are only off being pirates , ' and put it on the table by the candle ; and then you looked so good , laying there asleep , that I thought I went and leaned over and kissed you on the lips . ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 9]: `` Did you , Tom , DID you !
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 9]: I just forgive you everything for that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 19]: And she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the guiltiest of villains .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 21]: `` It was very kind , even though it was only a -- dream , '' Sid soliloquized just audibly .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 6]: `` Shut up , Sid !
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 18]: A body does just the same in a dream as he 'd do if he was awake .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 29]: Here 's a big Milum apple I 've been saving for you , Tom , if you was ever found again -- now go ` long to school .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 83]: I 'm thankful to the good God and Father of us all I 've got you back , that 's long-suffering and merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word , though goodness knows I 'm unworthy of it , but if only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places , there 's few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 21]: Go ` long Sid , Mary , Tom -- take yourselves off -- you 've hendered me long enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 25]: The children left for school , and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper and vanquish her realism with Tom 's marvellous dream .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 20]: Sid had better judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the house .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 22]: It was this : `` Pretty thin -- as long a dream as that , without any mistakes in it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 9]: What a hero Tom was become , now !
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 28]: He did not go skipping and prancing , but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the public eye was on him .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 32]: And indeed it was ; he tried not to seem to see the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along , but they were food and drink to him .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 44]: Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels , as proud to be seen with him , and tolerated by him , as if he had been the drummer at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into town .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 25]: Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at all ; but they were consuming with envy , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 31]: They would have given anything to have that swarthy suntanned skin of his , and his glittering notoriety ; and Tom would not have parted with either for a circus .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 36]: At school the children made so much of him and of Joe , and delivered such eloquent admiration from their eyes , that the two heroes were not long in becoming insufferably `` stuck-up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 34]: They began to tell their adventures to hungry listeners -- but they only began ; it was not a thing likely to have an end , with imaginations like theirs to furnish material .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 23]: And finally , when they got out their pipes and went serenely puffing around , the very summit of glory was reached .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 12]: Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 4]: Glory was sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 6]: He would live for glory .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 17]: Now that he was distinguished , maybe she would be wanting to `` make up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 19]: Well , let her -- she should see that he could be as indifferent as some other people .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 4]: Presently she arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 7]: Tom pretended not to see her .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 16]: He moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to talk .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 66]: Soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes , pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates , and screaming with laughter when she made a capture ; but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity , and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at such times , too .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 44]: It gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him ; and so , instead of winning him , it only `` set him up '' the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 23]: Presently she gave over skylarking , and moved irresolutely about , sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and wistfully toward Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 19]: Then she observed that now Tom was talking more particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 13]: She felt a sharp pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 20]: She tried to go away , but her feet were treacherous , and carried her to the group instead .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 21]: She said to a girl almost at Tom 's elbow -- with sham vivacity : `` Why , Mary Austin !
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 13]: you bad girl , why did n't you come to Sunday-school ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 12]: `` I did come -- did n't you see me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 5]: `` Why , no !
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 3]: Did you ?
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 6]: Where did you sit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 14]: `` I was in Miss Peters ' class , where I always go .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 5]: I saw YOU . ''
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 4]: `` Did you ?
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 11]: Why , it 's funny I did n't see you .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 10]: I wanted to tell you about the picnic . ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 7]: `` Oh , that 's jolly .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 8]: Who 's going to give it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 12]: `` My ma 's going to let me have one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 14]: `` Oh , goody ; I hope she 'll let ME come . ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 6]: `` Well , she will .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 6]: The picnic 's for me .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 15]: She 'll let anybody come that I want , and I want you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 7]: `` That 's ever so nice .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 8]: When is it going to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 5]: `` By and by .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 5]: Maybe about vacation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 9]: `` Oh , wo n't it be fun !
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 11]: You going to have all the girls and boys ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 68]: `` Yes , every one that 's friends to me -- or wants to be '' ; and she glanced ever so furtively at Tom , but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence about the terrible storm on the island , and how the lightning tore the great sycamore tree `` all to flinders '' while he was `` standing within three feet of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 8]: `` Oh , may I come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 4]: said Grace Miller .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 5]: `` And me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 4]: said Sally Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 7]: `` And me , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 4]: said Susy Harper .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 5]: `` And Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 22]: And so on , with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged for invitations but Tom and Amy .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 15]: Then Tom turned coolly away , still talking , and took Amy with him .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 66]: Becky 's lips trembled and the tears came to her eyes ; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on chattering , but the life had gone out of the picnic , now , and out of everything else ; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and had what her sex call `` a good cry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 14]: Then she sat moody , with wounded pride , till the bell rang .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 30]: She roused up , now , with a vindictive cast in her eye , and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what SHE 'D do .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 12]: At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant self-satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 15]: And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate her with the performance .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 16]: At last he spied her , but there was a sudden falling of his mercury .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 50]: She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple -- and so absorbed were they , and their heads so close together over the book , that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 8]: Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom 's veins .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 17]: He began to hate himself for throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 16]: He called himself a fool , and all the hard names he could think of .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 7]: He wanted to cry with vexation .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 24]: Amy chatted happily along , as they walked , for her heart was singing , but Tom 's tongue had lost its function .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 30]: He did not hear what Amy was saying , and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer an awkward assent , which was as often misplaced as otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 24]: He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse , again and again , to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 6]: He could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 30]: And it maddened him to see , as he thought he saw , that Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the living .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 30]: But she did see , nevertheless ; and she knew she was winning her fight , too , and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 7]: Amy 's happy prattle became intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 21]: Tom hinted at things he had to attend to ; things that must be done ; and time was fleeting .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 9]: But in vain -- the girl chirped on .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 21]: Tom thought , `` Oh , hang her , ai n't I ever going to get rid of her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 26]: At last he must be attending to those things -- and she said artlessly that she would be `` around '' when school let out .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 10]: And he hastened away , hating her for it .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 6]: `` Any other boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 7]: Tom thought , grating his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 22]: `` Any boy in the whole town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is aristocracy !
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 26]: Oh , all right , I licked you the first day you ever saw this town , mister , and I 'll lick you again !
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 9]: You just wait till I catch you out !
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 28]: I 'll just take and -- '' And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy -- pummelling the air , and kicking and gouging .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 9]: `` Oh , you do , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 8]: You holler ` nough , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 10]: Now , then , let that learn you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 11]: And so the imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 6]: Tom fled home at noon .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 25]: His conscience could not endure any more of Amy 's grateful happiness , and his jealousy could bear no more of the other distress .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 64]: Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred , but as the minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer , her triumph began to cloud and she lost interest ; gravity and absent-mindedness followed , and then melancholy ; two or three times she pricked up her ear at a footstep , but it was a false hope ; no Tom came .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 16]: At last she grew entirely miserable and wished she had n't carried it so far .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 29]: When poor Alfred , seeing that he was losing her , he did not know how , kept exclaiming : `` Oh , here 's a jolly one !
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 5]: look at this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 17]: she lost patience at last , and said , `` Oh , do n't bother me !
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 8]: I do n't care for them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 12]: and burst into tears , and got up and walked away .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 28]: Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her , but she said : `` Go away and leave me alone , ca n't you !
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 5]: I hate you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 33]: So the boy halted , wondering what he could have done -- for she had said she would look at pictures all through the nooning -- and she walked on , crying .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 9]: Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 6]: He was humiliated and angry .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 26]: He easily guessed his way to the truth -- the girl had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 15]: He was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 18]: He wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much risk to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 8]: Tom 's spelling-book fell under his eye .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 5]: Here was his opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 16]: He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and poured ink upon the page .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 25]: Becky , glancing in at a window behind him at the moment , saw the act , and moved on , without discovering herself .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 25]: She started homeward , now , intending to find Tom and tell him ; Tom would be thankful and their troubles would be healed .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 15]: Before she was half way home , however , she had changed her mind .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 24]: The thought of Tom 's treatment of her when she was talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 24]: She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book 's account , and to hate him forever , into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 46]: CHAPTER XIX TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood , and the first thing his aunt said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising market : `` Tom , I 've a notion to skin you alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 9]: `` Auntie , what have I done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 8]: `` Well , you 've done enough .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 54]: Here I go over to Sereny Harper , like an old softy , expecting I 'm going to make her believe all that rubbage about that dream , when lo and behold you she 'd found out from Joe that you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 19]: Tom , I do n't know what is to become of a boy that will act like that .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 30]: It makes me feel so bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 9]: This was a new aspect of the thing .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 18]: His smartness of the morning had seemed to Tom a good joke before , and very ingenious .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 8]: It merely looked mean and shabby now .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 16]: He hung his head and could not think of anything to say for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 22]: Then he said : `` Auntie , I wish I had n't done it -- but I did n't think . ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 9]: `` Oh , child , you never think .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 10]: You never think of anything but your own selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 53]: You could think to come all the way over here from Jackson 's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles , and you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream ; but you could n't ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 19]: `` Auntie , I know now it was mean , but I did n't mean to be mean .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 6]: I did n't , honest .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 17]: And besides , I did n't come over here to laugh at you that night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 10]: `` What did you come for , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 21]: `` It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us , because we had n't got drownded . ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 43]: `` Tom , Tom , I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could believe you ever had as good a thought as that , but you know you never did -- and I know it , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 22]: `` Indeed and ` deed I did , auntie -- I wish I may never stir if I did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 14]: `` Oh , Tom , do n't lie -- do n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 10]: It only makes things a hundred times worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 14]: `` It ai n't a lie , auntie ; it 's the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 17]: I wanted to keep you from grieving -- that was all that made me come . ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 22]: `` I 'd give the whole world to believe that -- it would cover up a power of sins , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 15]: I 'd ` most be glad you 'd run off and acted so bad .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 18]: But it ai n't reasonable ; because , why did n't you tell me , child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 42]: `` Why , you see , when you got to talking about the funeral , I just got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church , and I could n't somehow bear to spoil it .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 15]: So I just put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum . ''
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 5]: `` What bark ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 15]: `` The bark I had wrote on to tell you we 'd gone pirating .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 20]: I wish , now , you 'd waked up when I kissed you -- I do , honest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 18]: The hard lines in his aunt 's face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 9]: `` DID you kiss me , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 9]: `` Why , yes , I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 10]: `` Are you sure you did , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 14]: `` Why , yes , I did , auntie -- certain sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 11]: `` What did you kiss me for , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 19]: `` Because I loved you so , and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 6]: The words sounded like truth .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 22]: The old lady could not hide a tremor in her voice when she said : `` Kiss me again , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 20]: -- and be off with you to school , now , and do n't bother me any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 26]: The moment he was gone , she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a jacket which Tom had gone pirating in .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 23]: Then she stopped , with it in her hand , and said to herself : `` No , I do n't dare .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 29]: Poor boy , I reckon he 's lied about it -- but it 's a blessed , blessed lie , there 's such a comfort come from it .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 24]: I hope the Lord -- I KNOW the Lord will forgive him , because it was such goodheartedness in him to tell it .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 13]: But I do n't want to find out it 's a lie .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 6]: I wo n't look . ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 13]: She put the jacket away , and stood by musing a minute .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 17]: Twice she put out her hand to take the garment again , and twice she refrained .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 37]: Once more she ventured , and this time she fortified herself with the thought : `` It 's a good lie -- it 's a good lie -- I wo n't let it grieve me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 7]: So she sought the jacket pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 35]: A moment later she was reading Tom 's piece of bark through flowing tears and saying : `` I could forgive the boy , now , if he 'd committed a million sins ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 30]: CHAPTER XX THERE was something about Aunt Polly 's manner , when she kissed Tom , that swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 20]: He started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the head of Meadow Lane .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 7]: His mood always determined his manner .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 27]: Without a moment 's hesitation he ran to her and said : `` I acted mighty mean to-day , Becky , and I 'm so sorry .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 27]: I wo n't ever , ever do that way again , as long as ever I live -- please make up , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 26]: The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face : `` I 'll thank you to keep yourself TO yourself , Mr. Thomas Sawyer .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 9]: I 'll never speak to you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 8]: She tossed her head and passed on .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 23]: Tom was so stunned that he had not even presence of mind enough to say `` Who cares , Miss Smarty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 11]: until the right time to say it had gone by .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 5]: So he said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 10]: But he was in a fine rage , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 22]: He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were a boy , and imagining how he would trounce her if she were .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 13]: He presently encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 13]: She hurled one in return , and the angry breach was complete .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 36]: It seemed to Becky , in her hot resentment , that she could hardly wait for school to `` take in , '' she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 22]: If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple , Tom 's offensive fling had driven it entirely away .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 15]: Poor girl , she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 15]: The master , Mr. Dobbins , had reached middle age with an unsatisfied ambition .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 27]: The darling of his desires was , to be a doctor , but poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 24]: Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 9]: He kept that book under lock and key .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 23]: There was not an urchin in school but was perishing to have a glimpse of it , but the chance never came .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 35]: Every boy and girl had a theory about the nature of that book ; but no two theories were alike , and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 26]: Now , as Becky was passing by the desk , which stood near the door , she noticed that the key was in the lock !
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 6]: It was a precious moment .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 20]: She glanced around ; found herself alone , and the next instant she had the book in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 23]: The title-page -- Professor Somebody 's ANATOMY -- carried no information to her mind ; so she began to turn the leaves .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 19]: She came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece -- a human figure , stark naked .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 25]: At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 24]: Becky snatched at the book to close it , and had the hard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 21]: She thrust the volume into the desk , turned the key , and burst out crying with shame and vexation .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 30]: `` Tom Sawyer , you are just as mean as you can be , to sneak up on a person and look at what they 're looking at . ''
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 12]: `` How could I know you was looking at anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 35]: `` You ought to be ashamed of yourself , Tom Sawyer ; you know you 're going to tell on me , and oh , what shall I do , what shall I do !
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 14]: I 'll be whipped , and I never was whipped in school . ''
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 18]: Then she stamped her little foot and said : `` BE so mean if you want to !
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 9]: I know something that 's going to happen .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 8]: You just wait and you 'll see !
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 7]: Hateful , hateful , hateful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 15]: -- and she flung out of the house with a new explosion of crying .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 10]: Tom stood still , rather flustered by this onslaught .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 18]: Presently he said to himself : `` What a curious kind of a fool a girl is !
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 6]: Never been licked in school !
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 2]: Shucks !
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 5]: What 's a licking !
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 14]: That 's just like a girl -- they 're so thin-skinned and chicken-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 39]: Well , of course I ai n't going to tell old Dobbins on this little fool , because there 's other ways of getting even on her , that ai n't so mean ; but what of it ?
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 11]: Old Dobbins will ask who it was tore his book .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 4]: Nobody 'll answer .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 37]: Then he 'll do just the way he always does -- ask first one and then t ` other , and when he comes to the right girl he 'll know it , without any telling .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 8]: Girls ' faces always tell on them .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 7]: They ai n't got any backbone .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 5]: She 'll get licked .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 25]: Well , it 's a kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher , because there ai n't any way out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 37]: Tom conned the thing a moment longer , and then added : `` All right , though ; she 'd like to see me in just such a fix -- let her sweat it out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 9]: Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 14]: In a few moments the master arrived and school `` took in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 11]: Tom did not feel a strong interest in his studies .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 20]: Every time he stole a glance at the girls ' side of the room Becky 's face troubled him .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 24]: Considering all things , he did not want to pity her , and yet it was all he could do to help it .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 13]: He could get up no exultation that was really worthy the name .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 24]: Presently the spelling-book discovery was made , and Tom 's mind was entirely full of his own matters for a while after that .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 16]: Becky roused up from her lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 29]: She did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he spilt the ink on the book himself ; and she was right .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 12]: The denial only seemed to make the thing worse for Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 28]: Becky supposed she would be glad of that , and she tried to believe she was glad of it , but she found she was not certain .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 51]: When the worst came to the worst , she had an impulse to get up and tell on Alfred Temple , but she made an effort and forced herself to keep still -- because , said she to herself , `` he 'll tell about me tearing the picture sure .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 14]: I would n't say a word , not to save his life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 61]: Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all broken-hearted , for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly upset the ink on the spelling-book himself , in some skylarking bout -- he had denied it for form 's sake and because it was custom , and had stuck to the denial from principle .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 24]: A whole hour drifted by , the master sat nodding in his throne , the air was drowsy with the hum of study .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 35]: By and by , Mr. Dobbins straightened himself up , yawned , then unlocked his desk , and reached for his book , but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 22]: Most of the pupils glanced up languidly , but there were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 23]: Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while , then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read !
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 7]: Tom shot a glance at Becky .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 21]: He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she did , with a gun levelled at its head .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 8]: Instantly he forgot his quarrel with her .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 7]: Quick -- something must be done !
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 7]: done in a flash , too !
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 11]: But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 2]: Good !
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 6]: -- he had an inspiration !
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 15]: He would run and snatch the book , spring through the door and fly .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 21]: But his resolution shook for one little instant , and the chance was lost -- the master opened the volume .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 10]: If Tom only had the wasted opportunity back again !
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 3]: Too late .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 11]: There was no help for Becky now , he said .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 9]: The next moment the master faced the school .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 7]: Every eye sank under his gaze .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 13]: There was that in it which smote even the innocent with fear .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 16]: There was silence while one might count ten -- the master was gathering his wrath .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 11]: Then he spoke : `` Who tore this book ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 6]: There was not a sound .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 8]: One could have heard a pin drop .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 15]: The stillness continued ; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 11]: `` Benjamin Rogers , did you tear this book ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 3]: A denial .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 3]: Another pause .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 8]: `` Joseph Harper , did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 3]: Another denial .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 16]: Tom 's uneasiness grew more and more intense under the slow torture of these proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 23]: The master scanned the ranks of boys -- considered a while , then turned to the girls : `` Amy Lawrence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 6]: A shake of the head .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 5]: `` Gracie Miller ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 4]: The same sign .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 10]: `` Susan Harper , did you do this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 3]: Another negative .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 7]: The next girl was Becky Thatcher .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 19]: Tom was trembling from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 47]: `` Rebecca Thatcher '' -LSB- Tom glanced at her face -- it was white with terror -RSB- -- `` did you tear -- no , look me in the face '' -LSB- her hands rose in appeal -RSB- -- `` did you tear this book ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 10]: A thought shot like lightning through Tom 's brain .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 14]: He sprang to his feet and shouted -- `` I done it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 10]: The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 47]: Tom stood a moment , to gather his dismembered faculties ; and when he stepped forward to go to his punishment the surprise , the gratitude , the adoration that shone upon him out of poor Becky 's eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 73]: Inspired by the splendor of his own act , he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever administered ; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed -- for he knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done , and not count the tedious time as loss , either .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 74]: Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple ; for with shame and repentance Becky had told him all , not forgetting her own treachery ; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way , soon , to pleasanter musings , and he fell asleep at last with Becky 's latest words lingering dreamily in his ear -- `` Tom , how COULD you be so noble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 6]: CHAPTER XXI VACATION was approaching .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 30]: The schoolmaster , always severe , grew severer and more exacting than ever , for he wanted the school to make a good showing on `` Examination '' day .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 17]: His rod and his ferule were seldom idle now -- at least among the smaller pupils .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 16]: Only the biggest boys , and young ladies of eighteen and twenty , escaped lashing .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 45]: Mr. Dobbins ' lashings were very vigorous ones , too ; for although he carried , under his wig , a perfectly bald and shiny head , he had only reached middle age , and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 31]: As the great day approached , all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface ; he seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 22]: The consequence was , that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 12]: They threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 8]: But he kept ahead all the time .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 23]: The retribution that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the field badly worsted .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 16]: At last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 18]: They swore in the sign-painter 's boy , told him the scheme , and asked his help .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 29]: He had his own reasons for being delighted , for the master boarded in his father 's family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 90]: The master 's wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days , and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan ; the master always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled , and the sign-painter 's boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on Examination Evening he would `` manage the thing '' while he napped in his chair ; then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 10]: In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 22]: At eight in the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted , and adorned with wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 19]: The master sat throned in his great chair upon a raised platform , with his blackboard behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 6]: He was looking tolerably mellow .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 30]: Three rows of benches on each side and six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the pupils .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 94]: To his left , back of the rows of citizens , was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening ; rows of small boys , washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort ; rows of gawky big boys ; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms , their grandmothers ' ancient trinkets , their bits of pink and blue ribbon and the flowers in their hair .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 12]: All the rest of the house was filled with non-participating scholars .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 4]: The exercises began .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 57]: A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited , `` You 'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage , '' etc. -- accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used -- supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 26]: But he got through safely , though cruelly scared , and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and retired .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 34]: A little shamefaced girl lisped , `` Mary had a little lamb , '' etc. , performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy , got her meed of applause , and sat down flushed and happy .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 41]: Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into the unquenchable and indestructible `` Give me liberty or give me death '' speech , with fine fury and frantic gesticulation , and broke down in the middle of it .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 18]: A ghastly stage-fright seized him , his legs quaked under him and he was like to choke .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 28]: True , he had the manifest sympathy of the house but he had the house 's silence , too , which was even worse than its sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 10]: The master frowned , and this completed the disaster .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 10]: Tom struggled awhile and then retired , utterly defeated .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 13]: There was a weak attempt at applause , but it died early .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 24]: `` The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck '' followed ; also `` The Assyrian Came Down , '' and other declamatory gems .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 11]: Then there were reading exercises , and a spelling fight .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 8]: The meagre Latin class recited with honor .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 21]: The prime feature of the evening was in order , now -- original `` compositions '' by the young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 43]: Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform , cleared her throat , held up her manuscript -LRB- tied with dainty ribbon -RRB- , and proceeded to read , with labored attention to `` expression '' and punctuation .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 36]: The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them , their grandmothers , and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the Crusades .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 59]: `` Friendship '' was one ; `` Memories of Other Days '' ; `` Religion in History '' ; `` Dream Land '' ; `` The Advantages of Culture '' ; `` Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted '' ; `` Melancholy '' ; `` Filial Love '' ; `` Heart Longings , '' etc. , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 79]: A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy ; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of `` fine language '' ; another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out ; and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 32]: No matter what the subject might be , a brain-racking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 39]: The glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion from the schools , and it is not sufficient to-day ; it never will be sufficient while the world stands , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 53]: There is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with a sermon ; and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 5]: But enough of this .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 5]: Homely truth is unpalatable .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 9]: Let us return to the `` Examination . ''
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 18]: The first composition that was read was one entitled `` Is this , then , Life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 35]: Perhaps the reader can endure an extract from it : `` In the common walks of life , with what delightful emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity !
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 9]: Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 23]: In fancy , the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng , ` the observed of all observers . '
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 33]: Her graceful form , arrayed in snowy robes , is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance ; her eye is brightest , her step is lightest in the gay assembly .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 32]: `` In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by , and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world , of which she has had such bright dreams .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 10]: How fairy-like does everything appear to her enchanted vision !
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 10]: Each new scene is more charming than the last .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 65]: But after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior , all is vanity , the flattery which once charmed her soul , now grates harshly upon her ear ; the ball-room has lost its charms ; and with wasted health and imbittered heart , she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures can not satisfy the longings of the soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 7]: And so forth and so on .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 24]: There was a buzz of gratification from time to time during the reading , accompanied by whispered ejaculations of `` How sweet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 5]: `` How eloquent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 5]: `` So true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 18]: etc. , and after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 30]: Then arose a slim , melancholy girl , whose face had the `` interesting '' paleness that comes of pills and indigestion , and read a `` poem . ''
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 20]: Two stanzas of it will do : `` A MISSOURI MAIDEN 'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA `` Alabama , good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 5]: I love thee well !
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 11]: But yet for a while do I leave thee now !
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 20]: Sad , yes , sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell , And burning recollections throng my brow !
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 36]: For I have wandered through thy flowery woods ; Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa 's stream ; Have listened to Tallassee 's warring floods , And wooed on Coosa 's side Aurora 's beam .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 42]: `` Yet shame I not to bear an o'er-full heart , Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes ; 'T is from no stranger land I now must part , 'T is to no strangers left I yield these sighs .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 38]: Welcome and home were mine within this State , Whose vales I leave -- whose spires fade fast from me And cold must be mine eyes , and heart , and tete , When , dear Alabama !
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 7]: they turn cold on thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 22]: There were very few there who knew what `` tete '' meant , but the poem was very satisfactory , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 43]: Next appeared a dark-complexioned , black-eyed , black-haired young lady , who paused an impressive moment , assumed a tragic expression , and began to read in a measured , solemn tone : `` A VISION `` Dark and tempestuous was night .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 54]: Around the throne on high not a single star quivered ; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear ; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven , seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin !
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 28]: Even the boisterous winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes , and blustered about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 55]: `` At such a time , so dark , so dreary , for human sympathy my very spirit sighed ; but instead thereof , '' ` My dearest friend , my counsellor , my comforter and guide -- My joy in grief , my second bliss in joy , ' came to my side .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 35]: She moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy 's Eden by the romantic and young , a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 40]: So soft was her step , it failed to make even a sound , and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch , as other unobtrusive beauties , she would have glided away un-perceived -- unsought .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 36]: A strange sadness rested upon her features , like icy tears upon the robe of December , as she pointed to the contending elements without , and bade me contemplate the two beings presented . ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 28]: This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the first prize .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 14]: This composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 53]: The mayor of the village , in delivering the prize to the author of it , made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most `` eloquent '' thing he had ever listened to , and that Daniel Webster himself might well be proud of it .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 42]: It may be remarked , in passing , that the number of compositions in which the word `` beauteous '' was over-fondled , and human experience referred to as `` life 's page , '' was up to the usual average .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 43]: Now the master , mellow almost to the verge of geniality , put his chair aside , turned his back to the audience , and began to draw a map of America on the blackboard , to exercise the geography class upon .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 22]: But he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand , and a smothered titter rippled over the house .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 14]: He knew what the matter was , and set himself to right it .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 24]: He sponged out lines and remade them ; but he only distorted them more than ever , and the tittering was more pronounced .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 23]: He threw his entire attention upon his work , now , as if determined not to be put down by the mirth .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 27]: He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him ; he imagined he was succeeding , and yet the tittering continued ; it even manifestly increased .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 5]: And well it might .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 70]: There was a garret above , pierced with a scuttle over his head ; and down through this scuttle came a cat , suspended around the haunches by a string ; she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing ; as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string , she swung downward and clawed at the intangible air .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 60]: The tittering rose higher and higher -- the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher 's head -- down , down , a little lower , and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws , clung to it , and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession !
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 23]: And how the light did blaze abroad from the master 's bald pate -- for the sign-painter 's boy had GILDED it !
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 6]: That broke up the meeting .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 5]: The boys were avenged .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 4]: Vacation had come .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 54]: NOTE : -- The pretended `` compositions '' quoted in this chapter are taken without alteration from a volume entitled `` Prose and Poetry , by a Western Lady '' -- but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl pattern , and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 24]: CHAPTER XXII TOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance , being attracted by the showy character of their `` regalia . ''
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 19]: He promised to abstain from smoking , chewing , and profanity as long as he remained a member .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 38]: Now he found out a new thing -- namely , that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 43]: Tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear ; the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 62]: Fourth of July was coming ; but he soon gave that up -- gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours -- and fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer , justice of the peace , who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral , since he was so high an official .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 19]: During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge 's condition and hungry for news of it .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 23]: Sometimes his hopes ran high -- so high that he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the looking-glass .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 11]: But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 13]: At last he was pronounced upon the mend -- and then convalescent .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 13]: Tom was disgusted ; and felt a sense of injury , too .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 19]: He handed in his resignation at once -- and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 13]: Tom resolved that he would never trust a man like that again .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 7]: The funeral was a fine thing .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 15]: The Cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill the late member with envy .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 15]: Tom was a free boy again , however -- there was something in that .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 20]: He could drink and swear , now -- but found to his surprise that he did not want to .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 18]: The simple fact that he could , took the desire away , and the charm of it .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 20]: Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning to hang a little heavily on his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 18]: He attempted a diary -- but nothing happened during three days , and so he abandoned it .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 17]: The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town , and made a sensation .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 17]: Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were happy for two days .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 67]: Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure , for it rained hard , there was no procession in consequence , and the greatest man in the world -LRB- as Tom supposed -RRB- , Mr. Benton , an actual United States Senator , proved an overwhelming disappointment -- for he was not twenty-five feet high , nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 4]: A circus came .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 32]: The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents made of rag carpeting -- admission , three pins for boys , two for girls -- and then circusing was abandoned .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 20]: A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came -- and went again and left the village duller and drearier than ever .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 27]: There were some boys-and-girls ' parties , but they were so few and so delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 26]: Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her parents during vacation -- so there was no bright side to life anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 11]: The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 10]: It was a very cancer for permanency and pain .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 5]: Then came the measles .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 17]: During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner , dead to the world and its happenings .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 11]: He was very ill , he was interested in nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 24]: When he got upon his feet at last and moved feebly down-town , a melancholy change had come over everything and every creature .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 28]: There had been a `` revival , '' and everybody had `` got religion , '' not only the adults , but even the boys and girls .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 22]: Tom went about , hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed sinful face , but disappointment crossed him everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 17]: He found Joe Harper studying a Testament , and turned sadly away from the depressing spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 17]: He sought Ben Rogers , and found him visiting the poor with a basket of tracts .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 22]: He hunted up Jim Hollis , who called his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 62]: Every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression ; and when , in desperation , he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn and was received with a Scriptural quotation , his heart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost , forever and forever .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 24]: And that night there came on a terrific storm , with driving rain , awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 35]: He covered his head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom ; for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 23]: He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and that this was the result .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 48]: It might have seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery , but there seemed nothing incongruous about the getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from under an insect like himself .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 14]: By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its object .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 13]: The boy 's first impulse was to be grateful , and reform .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 15]: His second was to wait -- for there might not be any more storms .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 12]: The next day the doctors were back ; Tom had relapsed .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 15]: The three weeks he spent on his back this time seemed an entire age .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 30]: When he got abroad at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared , remembering how lonely was his estate , how companionless and forlorn he was .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 35]: He drifted listlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder , in the presence of her victim , a bird .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 15]: He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a stolen melon .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 3]: Poor lads !
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 10]: they -- like Tom -- had suffered a relapse .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 22]: CHAPTER XXIII AT last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred -- and vigorously : the murder trial came on in the court .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 10]: It became the absorbing topic of village talk immediately .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 8]: Tom could not get away from it .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 65]: Every reference to the murder sent a shudder to his heart , for his troubled conscience and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his hearing as `` feelers '' ; he did not see how he could be suspected of knowing anything about the murder , but still he could not be comfortable in the midst of this gossip .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 11]: It kept him in a cold shiver all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 14]: He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 24]: It would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while ; to divide his burden of distress with another sufferer .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 13]: Moreover , he wanted to assure himself that Huck had remained discreet .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 14]: `` Huck , have you ever told anybody about -- that ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 5]: ` Bout what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 6]: `` You know what . ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 10]: `` Oh -- ` course I have n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 6]: `` Never a word ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 10]: `` Never a solitary word , so help me .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 6]: What makes you ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 8]: `` Well , I was afeard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 19]: `` Why , Tom Sawyer , we would n't be alive two days if that got found out .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 5]: YOU know that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 5]: Tom felt more comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 20]: After a pause : `` Huck , they could n't anybody get you to tell , could they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 6]: `` Get me to tell ?
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 18]: Why , if I wanted that half-breed devil to drownd me they could get me to tell .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 8]: They ai n't no different way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 10]: `` Well , that 's all right , then .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 12]: I reckon we 're safe as long as we keep mum .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 8]: But let 's swear again , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 6]: It 's more surer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 6]: `` I 'm agreed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 8]: So they swore again with dread solemnities .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 9]: `` What is the talk around , Huck ?
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 9]: I 've heard a power of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 3]: `` Talk ?
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 17]: Well , it 's just Muff Potter , Muff Potter , Muff Potter all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 20]: It keeps me in a sweat , constant , so 's I want to hide som ` ers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 13]: `` That 's just the same way they go on round me .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 7]: I reckon he 's a goner .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 11]: Do n't you feel sorry for him , sometimes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 7]: `` Most always -- most always .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 18]: He ai n't no account ; but then he hai n't ever done anything to hurt anybody .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 36]: Just fishes a little , to get money to get drunk on -- and loafs around considerable ; but lord , we all do that -- leastways most of us -- preachers and such like .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 43]: But he 's kind of good -- he give me half a fish , once , when there war n't enough for two ; and lots of times he 's kind of stood by me when I was out of luck . ''
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 20]: `` Well , he 's mended kites for me , Huck , and knitted hooks on to my line .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 11]: I wish we could get him out of there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 3]: `` My !
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 9]: we could n't get him out , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 17]: And besides , ` twould n't do any good ; they 'd ketch him again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 7]: `` Yes -- so they would .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 20]: But I hate to hear 'em abuse him so like the dickens when he never done -- that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 7]: `` I do too , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 27]: Lord , I hear 'em say he 's the bloodiest looking villain in this country , and they wonder he was n't ever hung before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 12]: `` Yes , they talk like that , all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 18]: I 've heard 'em say that if he was to get free they 'd lynch him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 10]: `` And they 'd do it , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 14]: The boys had a long talk , but it brought them little comfort .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 35]: As the twilight drew on , they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood of the little isolated jail , perhaps with an undefined hope that something would happen that might clear away their difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 18]: But nothing happened ; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in this luckless captive .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 23]: The boys did as they had often done before -- went to the cell grating and gave Potter some tobacco and matches .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 12]: He was on the ground floor and there were no guards .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 21]: His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before -- it cut deeper than ever , this time .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 32]: They felt cowardly and treacherous to the last degree when Potter said : `` You 've been mighty good to me , boys -- better 'n anybody else in this town .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 11]: And I do n't forget it , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 82]: Often I says to myself , says I , ' I used to mend all the boys ' kites and things , and show 'em where the good fishin ' places was , and befriend 'em what I could , and now they 've all forgot old Muff when he 's in trouble ; but Tom do n't , and Huck do n't -- THEY do n't forget him , says I , ` and I do n't forget them . '
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 41]: Well , boys , I done an awful thing -- drunk and crazy at the time -- that 's the only way I account for it -- and now I got to swing for it , and it 's right .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 15]: Right , and BEST , too , I reckon -- hope so , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 9]: Well , we wo n't talk about that .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 15]: I do n't want to make YOU feel bad ; you 've befriended me .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 24]: But what I want to say , is , do n't YOU ever get drunk -- then you wo n't ever get here .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 44]: Stand a litter furder west -- so -- that 's it ; it 's a prime comfort to see faces that 's friendly when a body 's in such a muck of trouble , and there do n't none come here but yourn .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 8]: Good friendly faces -- good friendly faces .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 13]: Git up on one another 's backs and let me touch 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 4]: That 's it .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 16]: Shake hands -- yourn 'll come through the bars , but mine 's too big .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 26]: Little hands , and weak -- but they 've helped Muff Potter a power , and they 'd help him more if they could . ''
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 15]: Tom went home miserable , and his dreams that night were full of horrors .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 31]: The next day and the day after , he hung about the court-room , drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in , but forcing himself to stay out .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 7]: Huck was having the same experience .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 6]: They studiously avoided each other .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 20]: Each wandered away , from time to time , but the same dismal fascination always brought them back presently .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 31]: Tom kept his ears open when idlers sauntered out of the court-room , but invariably heard distressing news -- the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor Potter .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 42]: At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect that Injun Joe 's evidence stood firm and unshaken , and that there was not the slightest question as to what the jury 's verdict would be .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 16]: Tom was out late , that night , and came to bed through the window .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 9]: He was in a tremendous state of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 9]: It was hours before he got to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 20]: All the village flocked to the court-house the next morning , for this was to be the great day .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 11]: Both sexes were about equally represented in the packed audience .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 58]: After a long wait the jury filed in and took their places ; shortly afterward , Potter , pale and haggard , timid and hopeless , was brought in , with chains upon him , and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him ; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe , stolid as ever .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 20]: There was another pause , and then the judge arrived and the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 13]: The usual whisperings among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 20]: These details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation that was as impressive as it was fascinating .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 37]: Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing in the brook , at an early hour of the morning that the murder was discovered , and that he immediately sneaked away .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 17]: After some further questioning , counsel for the prosecution said : `` Take the witness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 29]: The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment , but dropped them again when his own counsel said : `` I have no questions to ask him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 13]: The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 12]: Counsel for the prosecution said : `` Take the witness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 15]: `` I have no questions to ask him , '' Potter 's lawyer replied .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 15]: A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter 's possession .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 6]: `` Take the witness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 8]: Counsel for Potter declined to question him .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 10]: The faces of the audience began to betray annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 15]: Did this attorney mean to throw away his client 's life without an effort ?
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 17]: Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter 's guilty behavior when brought to the scene of the murder .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 11]: They were allowed to leave the stand without being cross-questioned .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 38]: Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was brought out by credible witnesses , but none of them were cross-examined by Potter 's lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 19]: The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 41]: Counsel for the prosecution now said : `` By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion , we have fastened this awful crime , beyond all possibility of question , upon the unhappy prisoner at the bar .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 7]: We rest our case here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 33]: A groan escaped from poor Potter , and he put his face in his hands and rocked his body softly to and fro , while a painful silence reigned in the court-room .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 15]: Many men were moved , and many women 's compassion testified itself in tears .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 49]: Counsel for the defence rose and said : `` Your honor , in our remarks at the opening of this trial , we foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced by drink .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 6]: We have changed our mind .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 8]: We shall not offer that plea . ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 12]: -LSB- Then to the clerk :] `` Call Thomas Sawyer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 17]: A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house , not even excepting Potter 's .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 20]: Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as he rose and took his place upon the stand .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 12]: The boy looked wild enough , for he was badly scared .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 5]: The oath was administered .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 20]: `` Thomas Sawyer , where were you on the seventeenth of June , about the hour of midnight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 14]: Tom glanced at Injun Joe 's iron face and his tongue failed him .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 12]: The audience listened breathless , but the words refused to come .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 41]: After a few moments , however , the boy got a little of his strength back , and managed to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear : `` In the graveyard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 8]: `` A little bit louder , please .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 5]: Do n't be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 10]: You were -- '' `` In the graveyard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 10]: A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 11]: `` Were you anywhere near Horse Williams ' grave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 9]: `` Speak up -- just a trifle louder .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 6]: How near were you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 9]: `` Near as I am to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 9]: `` Were you hidden , or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 6]: `` I was hid . ''
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 14]: `` Behind the elms that 's on the edge of the grave . ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 8]: Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 7]: `` Any one with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 13]: I went there with -- '' `` Wait -- wait a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 8]: Never mind mentioning your companion 's name .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 9]: We will produce him at the proper time .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 9]: Did you carry anything there with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 6]: Tom hesitated and looked confused .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 12]: `` Speak out , my boy -- do n't be diffident .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 6]: The truth is always respectable .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 7]: What did you take there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 10]: `` Only a -- a -- dead cat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 12]: There was a ripple of mirth , which the court checked .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 10]: `` We will produce the skeleton of that cat .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 30]: Now , my boy , tell us everything that occurred -- tell it in your own way -- do n't skip anything , and do n't be afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 69]: Tom began -- hesitatingly at first , but as he warmed to his subject his words flowed more and more easily ; in a little while every sound ceased but his own voice ; every eye fixed itself upon him ; with parted lips and bated breath the audience hung upon his words , taking no note of time , rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 39]: The strain upon pent emotion reached its climax when the boy said : '' -- and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell , Injun Joe jumped with the knife and -- '' Crash !
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 21]: Quick as lightning the half-breed sprang for a window , tore his way through all opposers , and was gone !
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 22]: CHAPTER XXIV TOM was a glittering hero once more -- the pet of the old , the envy of the young .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 15]: His name even went into immortal print , for the village paper magnified him .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 17]: There were some that believed he would be President , yet , if he escaped hanging .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 26]: As usual , the fickle , unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 23]: But that sort of conduct is to the world 's credit ; therefore it is not well to find fault with it .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 20]: Tom 's days were days of splendor and exultation to him , but his nights were seasons of horror .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 15]: Injun Joe infested all his dreams , and always with doom in his eye .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 13]: Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to stir abroad after nightfall .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 64]: Poor Huck was in the same state of wretchedness and terror , for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer the night before the great day of the trial , and Huck was sore afraid that his share in the business might leak out , yet , notwithstanding Injun Joe 's flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 16]: The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy , but what of that ?
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 48]: Since Tom 's harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the lawyer 's house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths , Huck 's confidence in the human race was well-nigh obliterated .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 23]: Daily Muff Potter 's gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken ; but nightly he wished he had sealed up his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 23]: Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured ; the other half he was afraid he would be .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 23]: He felt sure he never could draw a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 18]: Rewards had been offered , the country had been scoured , but no Injun Joe was found .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 42]: One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels , a detective , came up from St. Louis , moused around , shook his head , looked wise , and made that sort of astounding success which members of that craft usually achieve .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 12]: That is to say , he `` found a clew . ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 34]: But you ca n't hang a `` clew '' for murder , and so after that detective had got through and gone home , Tom felt just as insecure as he was before .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 18]: The slow days drifted on , and each left behind it a slightly lightened weight of apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 27]: CHAPTER XXV THERE comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy 's life when he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 9]: This desire suddenly came upon Tom one day .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 13]: He sallied out to find Joe Harper , but failed of success .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 11]: Next he sought Ben Rogers ; he had gone fishing .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 9]: Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 4]: Huck would answer .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 15]: Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 4]: Huck was willing .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 35]: Huck was always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital , for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is not money .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 7]: `` Where 'll we dig ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 3]: said Huck .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 7]: `` Oh , most anywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 10]: `` Why , is it hid all around ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 8]: `` No , indeed it ai n't .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 50]: It 's hid in mighty particular places , Huck -- sometimes on islands , sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of an old dead tree , just where the shadow falls at midnight ; but mostly under the floor in ha ` nted houses . ''
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 6]: `` Who hides it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 13]: `` Why , robbers , of course -- who 'd you reckon ?
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 6]: Sunday-school sup ` rintendents ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 21]: If 't was mine I would n't hide it ; I 'd spend it and have a good time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 5]: `` So would I .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 8]: But robbers do n't do that way .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 10]: They always hide it and leave it there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 11]: `` Do n't they come after it any more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 20]: `` No , they think they will , but they generally forget the marks , or else they die .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 53]: Anyway , it lays there a long time and gets rusty ; and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks -- a paper that 's got to be ciphered over about a week because it 's mostly signs and hy ` roglyphics . ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 6]: `` Hyro -- which ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 21]: `` Hy ` roglyphics -- pictures and things , you know , that do n't seem to mean anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 12]: `` Have you got one of them papers , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 13]: `` Well then , how you going to find the marks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 8]: `` I do n't want any marks .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 28]: They always bury it under a ha ` nted house or on an island , or under a dead tree that 's got one limb sticking out .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 48]: Well , we 've tried Jackson 's Island a little , and we can try it again some time ; and there 's the old ha ` nted house up the Still-House branch , and there 's lots of dead-limb trees -- dead loads of 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 9]: `` Is it under all of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 5]: `` How you talk !
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 3]: No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 14]: `` Then how you going to know which one to go for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 8]: `` Go for all of 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 12]: `` Why , Tom , it 'll take all summer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 7]: `` Well , what of that ?
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 27]: Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars in it , all rusty and gray , or rotten chest full of di ` monds .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 5]: How 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 5]: Huck 's eyes glowed .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 5]: `` That 's bully .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 6]: Plenty bully enough for me .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 18]: Just you gim me the hundred dollars and I do n't want no di ` monds . ''
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 16]: But I bet you I ai n't going to throw off on di ` monds .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 26]: Some of 'em 's worth twenty dollars apiece -- there ai n't any , hardly , but 's worth six bits or a dollar . ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 5]: Is that so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 11]: `` Cert ` nly -- anybody 'll tell you so .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 10]: Hai n't you ever seen one , Huck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 7]: `` Not as I remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 10]: `` Oh , kings have slathers of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 13]: `` Well , I don ' know no kings , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 7]: `` I reckon you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 19]: But if you was to go to Europe you 'd see a raft of 'em hopping around . ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 6]: `` Do they hop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 3]: `` Hop ?
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 4]: -- your granny !
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 3]: No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 13]: `` Well , what did you say they did , for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 25]: `` Shucks , I only meant you 'd SEE 'em -- not hopping , of course -- what do they want to hop for ?
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 24]: -- but I mean you 'd just see 'em -- scattered around , you know , in a kind of a general way .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 7]: Like that old humpbacked Richard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 3]: `` Richard ?
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 7]: What 's his other name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 9]: `` He did n't have any other name .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 11]: Kings do n't have any but a given name . ''
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 4]: `` No ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 7]: `` But they do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 34]: `` Well , if they like it , Tom , all right ; but I do n't want to be a king and have only just a given name , like a nigger .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 11]: But say -- where you going to dig first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 8]: `` Well , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 19]: S'pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the hill t ` other side of Still-House branch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 6]: `` I 'm agreed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 18]: So they got a crippled pick and a shovel , and set out on their three-mile tramp .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 24]: They arrived hot and panting , and threw themselves down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 9]: `` I like this , '' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 27]: `` So do I. '' `` Say , Huck , if we find a treasure here , what you going to do with your share ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 26]: `` Well , I 'll have pie and a glass of soda every day , and I 'll go to every circus that comes along .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 10]: I bet I 'll have a gay time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 14]: `` Well , ai n't you going to save any of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 4]: `` Save it ?
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 4]: What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 17]: `` Why , so as to have something to live on , by and by . ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 9]: `` Oh , that ai n't any use .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 34]: Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day and get his claws on it if I did n't hurry up , and I tell you he 'd clean it out pretty quick .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 11]: What you going to do with yourn , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 32]: `` I 'm going to buy a new drum , and a sure - ` nough sword , and a red necktie and a bull pup , and get married . ''
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 4]: `` Married ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 6]: `` That 's it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 16]: `` Tom , you -- why , you ai n't in your right mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 8]: `` Wait -- you 'll see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 12]: `` Well , that 's the foolishest thing you could do .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 7]: Look at pap and my mother .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 2]: Fight !
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 10]: Why , they used to fight all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 7]: I remember , mighty well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 6]: `` That ai n't anything .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 12]: The girl I 'm going to marry wo n't fight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 10]: `` Tom , I reckon they 're all alike .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 7]: They 'll all comb a body .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 9]: Now you better think ` bout this awhile .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 6]: I tell you you better .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 9]: What 's the name of the gal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 15]: `` It ai n't a gal at all -- it 's a girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 25]: `` It 's all the same , I reckon ; some says gal , some says girl -- both 's right , like enough .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 10]: Anyway , what 's her name , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 12]: `` I 'll tell you some time -- not now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 8]: `` All right -- that 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 14]: Only if you get married I 'll be more lonesomer than ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 6]: `` No you wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 8]: You 'll come and live with me .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 13]: Now stir out of this and we 'll go to digging . ''
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 9]: They worked and sweated for half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 3]: No result .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 5]: They toiled another half-hour .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 4]: Still no result .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 15]: Huck said : `` Do they always bury it as deep as this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 6]: `` Sometimes -- not always .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 3]: Not generally .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 11]: I reckon we have n't got the right place . ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 10]: So they chose a new spot and began again .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 12]: The labor dragged a little , but still they made progress .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 9]: They pegged away in silence for some time .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 36]: Finally Huck leaned on his shovel , swabbed the beaded drops from his brow with his sleeve , and said : `` Where you going to dig next , after we get this one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 24]: `` I reckon maybe we 'll tackle the old tree that 's over yonder on Cardiff Hill back of the widow 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 10]: `` I reckon that 'll be a good one .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 13]: But wo n't the widow take it away from us , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 7]: It 's on her land . ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 6]: `` SHE take it away !
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 9]: Maybe she 'd like to try it once .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 13]: Whoever finds one of these hid treasures , it belongs to him .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 13]: It do n't make any difference whose land it 's on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 4]: That was satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 5]: The work went on .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 19]: By and by Huck said : `` Blame it , we must be in the wrong place again .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 6]: What do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 8]: `` It is mighty curious , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 6]: I do n't understand it .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 4]: Sometimes witches interfere .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 12]: I reckon maybe that 's what 's the trouble now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 3]: `` Shucks !
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 11]: Witches ai n't got no power in the daytime . ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 7]: `` Well , that 's so .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 7]: I did n't think of that .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 9]: Oh , I know what the matter is !
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 9]: What a blamed lot of fools we are !
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 23]: You got to find out where the shadow of the limb falls at midnight , and that 's where you dig ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 15]: `` Then consound it , we 've fooled away all this work for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 14]: Now hang it all , we got to come back in the night .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 7]: It 's an awful long way .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 6]: Can you get out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 6]: `` I bet I will .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 33]: We 've got to do it to-night , too , because if somebody sees these holes they 'll know in a minute what 's here and they 'll go for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 12]: `` Well , I 'll come around and maow to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 10]: Let 's hide the tools in the bushes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 12]: The boys were there that night , about the appointed time .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 7]: They sat in the shadow waiting .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 15]: It was a lonely place , and an hour made solemn by old traditions .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 35]: Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves , ghosts lurked in the murky nooks , the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance , an owl answered with his sepulchral note .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 12]: The boys were subdued by these solemnities , and talked little .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 22]: By and by they judged that twelve had come ; they marked where the shadow fell , and began to dig .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 6]: Their hopes commenced to rise .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 13]: Their interest grew stronger , and their industry kept pace with it .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 28]: The hole deepened and still deepened , but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon something , they only suffered a new disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 9]: It was only a stone or a chunk .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 20]: At last Tom said : `` It ai n't any use , Huck , we 're wrong again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 10]: `` Well , but we CA N'T be wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 9]: We spotted the shadder to a dot . ''
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 13]: `` I know it , but then there 's another thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 7]: `` What 's that ? '' .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 10]: `` Why , we only guessed at the time .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 11]: Like enough it was too late or too early . ''
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 5]: Huck dropped his shovel .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 9]: `` That 's it , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 7]: `` That 's the very trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 8]: We got to give this one up .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 32]: We ca n't ever tell the right time , and besides this kind of thing 's too awful , here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 32]: I feel as if something 's behind me all the time ; and I 'm afeard to turn around , becuz maybe there 's others in front a-waiting for a chance .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 13]: I been creeping all over , ever since I got here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 14]: `` Well , I 've been pretty much so , too , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 24]: They most always put in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree , to look out for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 4]: `` Lordy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 6]: `` Yes , they do .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 7]: I 've always heard that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 17]: `` Tom , I do n't like to fool around much where there 's dead people .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 14]: A body 's bound to get into trouble with 'em , sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 12]: `` I do n't like to stir 'em up , either .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 15]: S'pose this one here was to stick his skull out and say something ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 5]: `` Do n't Tom !
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 5]: It 's awful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 7]: `` Well , it just is .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 11]: Huck , I do n't feel comfortable a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 18]: `` Say , Tom , let 's give this place up , and try somewheres else . ''
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 10]: `` All right , I reckon we better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 7]: `` What 'll it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 15]: Tom considered awhile ; and then said : `` The ha ` nted house .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 5]: That 's it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 15]: `` Blame it , I do n't like ha ` nted houses , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 12]: Why , they 're a dern sight worse 'n dead people .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 44]: Dead people might talk , maybe , but they do n't come sliding around in a shroud , when you ai n't noticing , and peep over your shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth , the way a ghost does .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 16]: I could n't stand such a thing as that , Tom -- nobody could . ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 16]: `` Yes , but , Huck , ghosts do n't travel around only at night .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 13]: They wo n't hender us from digging there in the daytime . ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 7]: `` Well , that 's so .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 23]: But you know mighty well people do n't go about that ha ` nted house in the day nor the night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 50]: `` Well , that 's mostly because they do n't like to go where a man 's been murdered , anyway -- but nothing 's ever been seen around that house except in the night -- just some blue lights slipping by the windows -- no regular ghosts . ''
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 28]: `` Well , where you see one of them blue lights flickering around , Tom , you can bet there 's a ghost mighty close behind it .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 5]: It stands to reason .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 14]: Becuz you know that they do n't anybody but ghosts use 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 7]: `` Yes , that 's so .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 22]: But anyway they do n't come around in the daytime , so what 's the use of our being afeard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 6]: `` Well , all right .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 22]: We 'll tackle the ha ` nted house if you say so -- but I reckon it 's taking chances . ''
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 10]: They had started down the hill by this time .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 53]: There in the middle of the moonlit valley below them stood the `` ha ` nted '' house , utterly isolated , its fences gone long ago , rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps , the chimney crumbled to ruin , the window-sashes vacant , a corner of the roof caved in .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 66]: The boys gazed awhile , half expecting to see a blue light flit past a window ; then talking in a low tone , as befitted the time and the circumstances , they struck far off to the right , to give the haunted house a wide berth , and took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 22]: CHAPTER XXVI ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree ; they had come for their tools .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 35]: Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house ; Huck was measurably so , also -- but suddenly said : `` Lookyhere , Tom , do you know what day it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 26]: Tom mentally ran over the days of the week , and then quickly lifted his eyes with a startled look in them -- `` My !
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 10]: I never once thought of it , Huck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 22]: `` Well , I did n't neither , but all at once it popped onto me that it was Friday . ''
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 14]: `` Blame it , a body ca n't be too careful , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 20]: We might ` a ' got into an awful scrape , tackling such a thing on a Friday . ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 3]: `` MIGHT !
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 5]: Better say we WOULD !
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 14]: There 's some lucky days , maybe , but Friday ai n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 6]: `` Any fool knows that .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 16]: I do n't reckon YOU was the first that found it out , Huck . ''
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 12]: `` Well , I never said I was , did I ?
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 8]: And Friday ai n't all , neither .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 14]: I had a rotten bad dream last night -- dreampt about rats . ''
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 5]: Sure sign of trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 5]: Did they fight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 9]: `` Well , that 's good , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 19]: When they do n't fight it 's only a sign that there 's trouble around , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 16]: All we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 11]: We 'll drop this thing for to-day , and play .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 9]: Do you know Robin Hood , Huck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 6]: Who 's Robin Hood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 20]: `` Why , he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England -- and the best .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 6]: He was a robber . ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 8]: `` Cracky , I wisht I was .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 6]: Who did he rob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 15]: `` Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings , and such like .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 7]: But he never bothered the poor .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 4]: He loved 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 10]: He always divided up with 'em perfectly square . ''
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 13]: `` Well , he must ` a ' been a brick . ''
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 9]: `` I bet you he was , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 11]: Oh , he was the noblest man that ever was .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 13]: They ai n't any such men now , I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 37]: He could lick any man in England , with one hand tied behind him ; and he could take his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece every time , a mile and a half . ''
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 8]: `` What 's a YEW bow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 11]: It 's some kind of a bow , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 20]: And if he hit that dime only on the edge he would set down and cry -- and curse .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 12]: But we 'll play Robin Hood -- it 's nobby fun .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 6]: I 'll learn you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 6]: `` I 'm agreed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 34]: So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon , now and then casting a yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the morrow 's prospects and possibilities there .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 34]: As the sun began to sink into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff Hill .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 16]: On Saturday , shortly after noon , the boys were at the dead tree again .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 71]: They had a smoke and a chat in the shade , and then dug a little in their last hole , not with great hope , but merely because Tom said there were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it , and then somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 40]: The thing failed this time , however , so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune , but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 51]: When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun , and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the place , that they were afraid , for a moment , to venture in .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 12]: Then they crept to the door and took a trembling peep .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 34]: They saw a weed-grown , floorless room , unplastered , an ancient fireplace , vacant windows , a ruinous staircase ; and here , there , and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 31]: They presently entered , softly , with quickened pulses , talking in whispers , ears alert to catch the slightest sound , and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 32]: In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the place a critical and interested examination , rather admiring their own boldness , and wondering at it , too .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 7]: Next they wanted to look up-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 38]: This was something like cutting off retreat , but they got to daring each other , and of course there could be but one result -- they threw their tools into a corner and made the ascent .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 9]: Up there were the same signs of decay .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 24]: In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery , but the promise was a fraud -- there was nothing in it .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 10]: Their courage was up now and well in hand .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 15]: They were about to go down and begin work when -- `` Sh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 7]: whispered Huck , blanching with fright .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 3]: `` Sh !
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 3]: ... There !
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 5]: ... Hear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 5]: ... Oh , my !
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 5]: Let 's run ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 4]: `` Keep still !
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 5]: Do n't you budge !
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 9]: They 're coming right toward the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 26]: The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to knot-holes in the planking , and lay waiting , in a misery of fear .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 13]: `` They 've stopped ... No -- coming ... Here they are .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 8]: Do n't whisper another word , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 12]: My goodness , I wish I was out of this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 4]: Two men entered .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 34]: Each boy said to himself : `` There 's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that 's been about town once or twice lately -- never saw t ` other man before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 18]: `` T'other '' was a ragged , unkempt creature , with nothing very pleasant in his face .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 29]: The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape ; he had bushy white whiskers ; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero , and he wore green goggles .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 42]: When they came in , `` t ` other '' was talking in a low voice ; they sat down on the ground , facing the door , with their backs to the wall , and the speaker continued his remarks .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 36]: His manner became less guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded : `` No , '' said he , `` I 've thought it all over , and I do n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 5]: It 's dangerous . ''
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 4]: `` Dangerous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 17]: grunted the `` deaf and dumb '' Spaniard -- to the vast surprise of the boys .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 4]: `` Milksop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 9]: This voice made the boys gasp and quake .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 6]: It was Injun Joe 's !
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 7]: There was silence for some time .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 24]: Then Joe said : `` What 's any more dangerous than that job up yonder -- but nothing 's come of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 5]: `` That 's different .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 12]: Away up the river so , and not another house about .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 20]: ` Two n't ever be known that we tried , anyway , long as we did n't succeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 14]: `` Well , what 's more dangerous than coming here in the daytime !
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 10]: -- anybody would suspicion us that saw us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 5]: `` I know that .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 16]: But there war n't any other place as handy after that fool of a job .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 7]: I want to quit this shanty .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 34]: I wanted to yesterday , only it war n't any use trying to stir out of here , with those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in full view . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 34]: `` Those infernal boys '' quaked again under the inspiration of this remark , and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and concluded to wait a day .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 11]: They wished in their hearts they had waited a year .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 12]: The two men got out some food and made a luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 27]: After a long and thoughtful silence , Injun Joe said : `` Look here , lad -- you go back up the river where you belong .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 8]: Wait there till you hear from me .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 18]: I 'll take the chances on dropping into this town just once more , for a look .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 23]: We 'll do that ` dangerous ' job after I 've spied around a little and think things look well for it .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 4]: Then for Texas !
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 7]: We 'll leg it together ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 4]: This was satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 19]: Both men presently fell to yawning , and Injun Joe said : `` I 'm dead for sleep !
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 8]: It 's your turn to watch . ''
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 12]: He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 12]: His comrade stirred him once or twice and he became quiet .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 21]: Presently the watcher began to nod ; his head drooped lower and lower , both men began to snore now .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 9]: The boys drew a long , grateful breath .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 12]: Tom whispered : `` Now 's our chance -- come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 18]: Huck said : `` I ca n't -- I 'd die if they was to wake . ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 7]: Tom urged -- Huck held back .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 12]: At last Tom rose slowly and softly , and started alone .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 24]: But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 7]: He never made a second attempt .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 38]: The boys lay there counting the dragging moments till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray ; and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 5]: Now one snore ceased .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 34]: Injun Joe sat up , stared around -- smiled grimly upon his comrade , whose head was drooping upon his knees -- stirred him up with his foot and said : `` Here !
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 9]: YOU 'RE a watchman , ai n't you !
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 10]: All right , though -- nothing 's happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 3]: `` My !
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 6]: have I been asleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 7]: `` Oh , partly , partly .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 10]: Nearly time for us to be moving , pard .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 14]: What 'll we do with what little swag we 've got left ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 18]: `` I do n't know -- leave it here as we 've always done , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 11]: No use to take it away till we start south .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 12]: Six hundred and fifty in silver 's something to carry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 17]: `` Well -- all right -- it wo n't matter to come here once more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 22]: `` No -- but I 'd say come in the night as we used to do -- it 's better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 50]: `` Yes : but look here ; it may be a good while before I get the right chance at that job ; accidents might happen ; ` tai n't in such a very good place ; we 'll just regularly bury it -- and bury it deep . ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 33]: `` Good idea , '' said the comrade , who walked across the room , knelt down , raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 41]: He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself and as much for Injun Joe , and passed the bag to the latter , who was on his knees in the corner , now , digging with his bowie-knife .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 14]: The boys forgot all their fears , all their miseries in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 8]: With gloating eyes they watched every movement .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 2]: Luck !
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 10]: -- the splendor of it was beyond all imagination !
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 14]: Six hundred dollars was money enough to make half a dozen boys rich !
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 21]: Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest auspices -- there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to dig .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 32]: They nudged each other every moment -- eloquent nudges and easily understood , for they simply meant -- `` Oh , but ai n't you glad NOW we 're here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 7]: Joe 's knife struck upon something .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 4]: `` Hello ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 4]: said his comrade .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 14]: `` Half-rotten plank -- no , it 's a box , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 15]: Here -- bear a hand and we 'll see what it 's here for .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 10]: Never mind , I 've broke a hole . ''
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 18]: He reached his hand in and drew it out -- `` Man , it 's money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 9]: The two men examined the handful of coins .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 4]: They were gold .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 13]: The boys above were as excited as themselves , and as delighted .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 14]: Joe 's comrade said : `` We 'll make quick work of this .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 28]: There 's an old rusty pick over amongst the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace -- I saw it a minute ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 11]: He ran and brought the boys ' pick and shovel .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 27]: Injun Joe took the pick , looked it over critically , shook his head , muttered something to himself , and then began to use it .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 6]: The box was soon unearthed .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 23]: It was not very large ; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the slow years had injured it .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 10]: The men contemplated the treasure awhile in blissful silence .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 16]: `` Pard , there 's thousands of dollars here , '' said Injun Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 21]: 'T was always said that Murrel 's gang used to be around here one summer , '' the stranger observed .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 22]: `` I know it , '' said Injun Joe ; `` and this looks like it , I should say . ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 12]: `` Now you wo n't need to do that job . ''
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 4]: The half-breed frowned .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 10]: Said he : `` You do n't know me .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 10]: Least you do n't know all about that thing .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 11]: ` Tai n't robbery altogether -- it 's REVENGE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 9]: and a wicked light flamed in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 9]: `` I 'll need your help in it .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 8]: When it 's finished -- then Texas .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 19]: Go home to your Nance and your kids , and stand by till you hear from me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 20]: `` Well -- if you say so ; what 'll we do with this -- bury it again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 6]: -LSB- Ravishing delight overhead . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 2]: NO !
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 7]: by the great Sachem , no !
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 6]: -LSB- Profound distress overhead . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 5]: I 'd nearly forgot .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 8]: That pick had fresh earth on it !
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 12]: -LSB- The boys were sick with terror in a moment . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 10]: What business has a pick and a shovel here ?
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 8]: What business with fresh earth on them ?
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 11]: Who brought them here -- and where are they gone ?
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 5]: Have you heard anybody ?
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 4]: -- seen anybody ?
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 14]: bury it again and leave them to come and see the ground disturbed ?
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 6]: Not exactly -- not exactly .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 9]: We 'll take it to my den . ''
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 6]: `` Why , of course !
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 7]: Might have thought of that before .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 6]: You mean Number One ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 10]: `` No -- Number Two -- under the cross .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 10]: The other place is bad -- too common . ''
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 9]: It 's nearly dark enough to start . ''
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 15]: Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping out .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 13]: Presently he said : `` Who could have brought those tools here ?
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 9]: Do you reckon they can be up-stairs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 7]: The boys ' breath forsook them .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 22]: Injun Joe put his hand on his knife , halted a moment , undecided , and then turned toward the stairway .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 13]: The boys thought of the closet , but their strength was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 54]: The steps came creaking up the stairs -- the intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the lads -- they were about to spring for the closet , when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 21]: He gathered himself up cursing , and his comrade said : `` Now what 's the use of all that ?
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 19]: If it 's anybody , and they 're up there , let them STAY there -- who cares ?
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 17]: If they want to jump down , now , and get into trouble , who objects ?
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 19]: It will be dark in fifteen minutes -- and then let them follow us if they want to .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 4]: I 'm willing .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 25]: In my opinion , whoever hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or devils or something .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 9]: I 'll bet they 're running yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 26]: Joe grumbled awhile ; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 23]: Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening twilight , and moved toward the river with their precious box .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 25]: Tom and Huck rose up , weak but vastly relieved , and stared after them through the chinks between the logs of the house .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 2]: Follow ?
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 3]: Not they .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 20]: They were content to reach ground again without broken necks , and take the townward track over the hill .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 6]: They did not talk much .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 24]: They were too much absorbed in hating themselves -- hating the ill luck that made them take the spade and the pick there .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 11]: But for that , Injun Joe never would have suspected .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 36]: He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait there till his `` revenge '' was satisfied , and then he would have had the misfortune to find that money turn up missing .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 12]: Bitter , bitter luck that the tools were ever brought there !
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 39]: They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job , and follow him to `` Number Two , '' wherever that might be .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 8]: Then a ghastly thought occurred to Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 3]: `` Revenge ?
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 9]: What if he means US , Huck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 7]: `` Oh , do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 6]: said Huck , nearly fainting .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 41]: They talked it all over , and as they entered town they agreed to believe that he might possibly mean somebody else -- at least that he might at least mean nobody but Tom , since only Tom had testified .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 15]: Very , very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger !
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 10]: Company would be a palpable improvement , he thought .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 15]: CHAPTER XXVII THE adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom 's dreams that night .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 35]: Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 44]: As he lay in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure , he noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away -- somewhat as if they had happened in another world , or in a time long gone by .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 15]: Then it occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream !
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 29]: There was one very strong argument in favor of this idea -- namely , that the quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 61]: He had never seen as much as fifty dollars in one mass before , and he was like all boys of his age and station in life , in that he imagined that all references to `` hundreds '' and `` thousands '' were mere fanciful forms of speech , and that no such sums really existed in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 29]: He never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any one 's possession .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 34]: If his notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed , they would have been found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague , splendid , ungraspable dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 42]: But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer under the attrition of thinking them over , and so he presently found himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a dream , after all .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 7]: This uncertainty must be swept away .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 12]: He would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and find Huck .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 22]: Huck was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat , listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking very melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 11]: Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 20]: If he did not do it , then the adventure would be proved to have been only a dream .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 6]: `` Hello , Huck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 6]: `` Hello , yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 6]: Silence , for a minute .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 27]: `` Tom , if we 'd ` a ' left the blame tools at the dead tree , we 'd ` a ' got the money .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 9]: Oh , ai n't it awful ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 14]: ` Tai n't a dream , then , ` tai n't a dream !
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 7]: Somehow I most wish it was .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 10]: Dog 'd if I do n't , Huck . ''
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 8]: `` What ai n't a dream ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 7]: `` Oh , that thing yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 8]: I been half thinking it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 3]: `` Dream !
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 19]: If them stairs had n't broke down you 'd ` a ' seen how much dream it was !
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 24]: I 've had dreams enough all night -- with that patch-eyed Spanish devil going for me all through 'em -- rot him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 7]: `` No , not rot him .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 3]: FIND him !
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 5]: Track the money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 9]: `` Tom , we 'll never find him .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 19]: A feller do n't have only one chance for such a pile -- and that one 's lost .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 15]: I 'd feel mighty shaky if I was to see him , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 28]: `` Well , so 'd I ; but I 'd like to see him , anyway -- and track him out -- to his Number Two . ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 10]: `` Number Two -- yes , that 's it .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 7]: I been thinking ` bout that .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 10]: But I ca n't make nothing out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 8]: What do you reckon it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 4]: `` I dono .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 5]: It 's too deep .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 14]: Say , Huck -- maybe it 's the number of a house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 3]: `` Goody !
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 10]: ... No , Tom , that ai n't it .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 12]: If it is , it ai n't in this one-horse town .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 8]: They ai n't no numbers here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 7]: `` Well , that 's so .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 6]: Lem me think a minute .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 18]: Here -- it 's the number of a room -- in a tavern , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 8]: `` Oh , that 's the trick !
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 7]: They ai n't only two taverns .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 7]: We can find out quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 12]: `` You stay here , Huck , till I come . ''
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 6]: Tom was off at once .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 13]: He did not care to have Huck 's company in public places .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 7]: He was gone half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 25]: He found that in the best tavern , No. 2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer , and was still so occupied .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 12]: In the less ostentatious house , No. 2 was a mystery .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 92]: The tavern-keeper 's young son said it was kept locked all the time , and he never saw anybody go into it or come out of it except at night ; he did not know any particular reason for this state of things ; had had some little curiosity , but it was rather feeble ; had made the most of the mystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was `` ha ` nted '' ; had noticed that there was a light in there the night before .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 11]: `` That 's what I 've found out , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 13]: I reckon that 's the very No. 2 we 're after . ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 8]: `` I reckon it is , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 8]: Now what you going to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 6]: `` Lem me think . ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 6]: Tom thought a long time .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 10]: Then he said : `` I 'll tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 31]: The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap of a brick store .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 34]: Now you get hold of all the door-keys you can find , and I 'll nip all of auntie 's , and the first dark night we 'll go there and try 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 34]: And mind you , keep a lookout for Injun Joe , because he said he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 28]: If you see him , you just follow him ; and if he do n't go to that No. 2 , that ai n't the place . ''
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 14]: `` Lordy , I do n't want to foller him by myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 10]: `` Why , it 'll be night , sure .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 20]: He might n't ever see you -- and if he did , maybe he 'd never think anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 15]: `` Well , if it 's pretty dark I reckon I 'll track him .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 6]: I dono -- I dono .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 5]: I 'll try . ''
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 15]: `` You bet I 'll follow him , if it 's dark , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 25]: Why , he might ` a ' found out he could n't get his revenge , and be going right after that money . ''
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 11]: `` It 's so , Tom , it 's so .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 12]: I 'll foller him ; I will , by jingoes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 6]: `` Now you 're TALKING !
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 14]: Do n't you ever weaken , Huck , and I wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 13]: CHAPTER XXVIII THAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 26]: They hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine , one watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern door .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 19]: Nobody entered the alley or left it ; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern door .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 45]: The night promised to be a fair one ; so Tom went home with the understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on , Huck was to come and `` maow , '' whereupon he would slip out and try the keys .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 23]: But the night remained clear , and Huck closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 9]: Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 3]: Also Wednesday .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 6]: But Thursday night promised better .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 23]: Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt 's old tin lantern , and a large towel to blindfold it with .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 14]: He hid the lantern in Huck 's sugar hogshead and the watch began .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 21]: An hour before midnight the tavern closed up and its lights -LRB- the only ones thereabouts -RRB- were put out .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 6]: No Spaniard had been seen .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 8]: Nobody had entered or left the alley .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 4]: Everything was auspicious .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 19]: The blackness of darkness reigned , the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant thunder .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 30]: Tom got his lantern , lit it in the hogshead , wrapped it closely in the towel , and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 12]: Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 18]: Then there was a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck 's spirits like a mountain .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 31]: He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern -- it would frighten him , but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive yet .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 8]: It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 21]: Surely he must have fainted ; maybe he was dead ; maybe his heart had burst under terror and excitement .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 35]: In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer and closer to the alley ; fearing all sorts of dreadful things , and momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away his breath .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 34]: There was not much to take away , for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls , and his heart would soon wear itself out , the way it was beating .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 18]: Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came tearing by him : `` Run ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 11]: said he ; `` run , for your life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 26]: He need n't have repeated it ; once was enough ; Huck was making thirty or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 21]: The boys never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the lower end of the village .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 16]: Just as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 17]: As soon as Tom got his breath he said : `` Huck , it was awful !
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 37]: I tried two of the keys , just as soft as I could ; but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I could n't hardly get my breath I was so scared .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 10]: They would n't turn in the lock , either .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 22]: Well , without noticing what I was doing , I took hold of the knob , and open comes the door !
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 5]: It war n't locked !
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 18]: I hopped in , and shook off the towel , and , GREAT CAESAR 'S GHOST ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 9]: -- what 'd you see , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 13]: `` Huck , I most stepped onto Injun Joe 's hand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 25]: He was lying there , sound asleep on the floor , with his old patch on his eye and his arms spread out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 8]: `` Lordy , what did you do ?
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 6]: Did he wake up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 6]: `` No , never budged .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 5]: Drunk , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 9]: I just grabbed that towel and started ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 16]: `` I 'd never ` a ' thought of the towel , I bet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 6]: `` Well , I would .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 13]: My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 12]: `` Say , Tom , did you see that box ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 11]: `` Huck , I did n't wait to look around .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 14]: I did n't see the box , I did n't see the cross .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 33]: I did n't see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by Injun Joe ; yes , I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 19]: Do n't you see , now , what 's the matter with that ha ` nted room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 11]: `` Why , it 's ha ` nted with whiskey !
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 18]: Maybe ALL the Temperance Taverns have got a ha ` nted room , hey , Huck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 10]: `` Well , I reckon maybe that 's so .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 10]: Who 'd ` a ' thought such a thing ?
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 23]: But say , Tom , now 's a mighty good time to get that box , if Injun Joe 's drunk . ''
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 6]: `` It is , that !
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 5]: You try it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 3]: Huck shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 10]: `` Well , no -- I reckon not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 8]: `` And I reckon not , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 11]: Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ai n't enough .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 18]: If there 'd been three , he 'd be drunk enough and I 'd do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 35]: There was a long pause for reflection , and then Tom said : `` Lookyhere , Huck , less not try that thing any more till we know Injun Joe 's not in there .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 5]: It 's too scary .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 36]: Now , if we watch every night , we 'll be dead sure to see him go out , some time or other , and then we 'll snatch that box quicker 'n lightning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 7]: `` Well , I 'm agreed .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 30]: I 'll watch the whole night long , and I 'll do it every night , too , if you 'll do the other part of the job . ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 7]: `` All right , I will .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 36]: All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a block and maow -- and if I 'm asleep , you throw some gravel at the window and that 'll fetch me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 9]: `` Agreed , and good as wheat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 16]: `` Now , Huck , the storm 's over , and I 'll go home .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 12]: It 'll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 12]: You go back and watch that long , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 12]: `` I said I would , Tom , and I will .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 13]: I 'll ha ` nt that tavern every night for a year !
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 14]: I 'll sleep all day and I 'll stand watch all night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 6]: `` That 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 9]: Now , where you going to sleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 7]: `` In Ben Rogers ' hayloft .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 16]: He lets me , and so does his pap 's nigger man , Uncle Jake .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 32]: I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to , and any time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 9]: That 's a mighty good nigger , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 17]: He likes me , becuz I do n't ever act as if I was above him .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 11]: Sometime I 've set right down and eat WITH him .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 7]: But you need n't tell that .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 24]: A body 's got to do things when he 's awful hungry he would n't want to do as a steady thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 19]: `` Well , if I do n't want you in the daytime , I 'll let you sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 7]: I wo n't come bothering around .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 20]: Any time you see something 's up , in the night , just skip right around and maow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 30]: CHAPTER XXIX THE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of news -- Judge Thatcher 's family had come back to town the night before .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 26]: Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment , and Becky took the chief place in the boy 's interest .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 25]: He saw her and they had an exhausting good time playing `` hi-spy '' and `` gully-keeper '' with a crowd of their school-mates .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 32]: The day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly satisfactory way : Becky teased her mother to appoint the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic , and she consented .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 14]: The child 's delight was boundless ; and Tom 's not more moderate .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 27]: The invitations were sent out before sunset , and straightway the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 48]: Tom 's excitement enabled him to keep awake until a pretty late hour , and he had good hopes of hearing Huck 's `` maow , '' and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers with , next day ; but he was disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 6]: No signal came that night .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 31]: Morning came , eventually , and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy and rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher 's , and everything was ready for a start .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 16]: It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 26]: The children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 23]: The old steam ferryboat was chartered for the occasion ; presently the gay throng filed up the main street laden with provision-baskets .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 18]: Sid was sick and had to miss the fun ; Mary remained at home to entertain him .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 20]: The last thing Mrs. Thatcher said to Becky , was : `` You 'll not get back till late .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 21]: Perhaps you 'd better stay all night with some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing , child . ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 12]: `` Then I 'll stay with Susy Harper , mamma . ''
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 13]: And mind and behave yourself and do n't be any trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 24]: Presently , as they tripped along , Tom said to Becky : `` Say -- I 'll tell you what we 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 23]: ` Stead of going to Joe Harper 's we 'll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas ' .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 5]: She 'll have ice-cream !
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 12]: She has it most every day -- dead loads of it .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 11]: And she 'll be awful glad to have us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 9]: `` Oh , that will be fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 16]: Then Becky reflected a moment and said : `` But what will mamma say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 8]: `` How 'll she ever know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 28]: The girl turned the idea over in her mind , and said reluctantly : `` I reckon it 's wrong -- but -- '' `` But shucks !
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 13]: Your mother wo n't know , and so what 's the harm ?
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 32]: All she wants is that you 'll be safe ; and I bet you she 'd ` a ' said go there if she 'd ` a ' thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 6]: I know she would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 11]: The Widow Douglas ' splendid hospitality was a tempting bait .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 10]: It and Tom 's persuasions presently carried the day .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 14]: So it was decided to say nothing anybody about the night 's programme .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 18]: Presently it occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 13]: The thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 15]: Still he could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas ' .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 32]: And why should he give it up , he reasoned -- the signal did not come the night before , so why should it be any more likely to come to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 39]: The sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure ; and , boy-like , he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 18]: Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody hollow and tied up .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 21]: The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 37]: All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with , and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites , and then the destruction of the good things began .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 19]: After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 13]: By-and-by somebody shouted : `` Who 's ready for the cave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 3]: Everybody was .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 17]: Bundles of candles were procured , and straightway there was a general scamper up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 24]: The mouth of the cave was up the hillside -- an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 26]: Within was a small chamber , chilly as an ice-house , and walled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 24]: It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 16]: But the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off , and the romping began again .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 50]: The moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it ; a struggle and a gallant defence followed , but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out , and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 7]: But all things have an end .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 36]: By-and-by the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue , the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 13]: This main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 40]: Every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand -- for McDougal 's cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 66]: It was said that one might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms , and never find the end of the cave ; and that he might go down , and down , and still down , into the earth , and it was just the same -- labyrinth under labyrinth , and no end to any of them .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 8]: No man `` knew '' the cave .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 6]: That was an impossible thing .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 24]: Most of the young men knew a portion of it , and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 12]: Tom Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 46]: The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of a mile , and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch avenues , fly along the dismal corridors , and take each other by surprise at points where the corridors joined again .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 23]: Parties were able to elude each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the `` known '' ground .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 43]: By-and-by , one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of the cave , panting , hilarious , smeared from head to foot with tallow drippings , daubed with clay , and entirely delighted with the success of the day .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 23]: Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no note of time and that night was about at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 11]: The clanging bell had been calling for half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 17]: However , this sort of close to the day 's adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 26]: When the ferryboat with her wild freight pushed into the stream , nobody cared sixpence for the wasted time but the captain of the craft .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 17]: Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat 's lights went glinting past the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 27]: He heard no noise on board , for the young people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly tired to death .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 34]: He wondered what boat it was , and why she did not stop at the wharf -- and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his attention upon his business .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 8]: The night was growing cloudy and dark .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 43]: Ten o'clock came , and the noise of vehicles ceased , scattered lights began to wink out , all straggling foot-passengers disappeared , the village betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence and the ghosts .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 17]: Eleven o'clock came , and the tavern lights were put out ; darkness everywhere , now .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 13]: Huck waited what seemed a weary long time , but nothing happened .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 5]: His faith was weakening .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 5]: Was there any use ?
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 6]: Was there really any use ?
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 9]: Why not give it up and turn in ?
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 7]: A noise fell upon his ear .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 8]: He was all attention in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 6]: The alley door closed softly .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 10]: He sprang to the corner of the brick store .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 19]: The next moment two men brushed by him , and one seemed to have something under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 6]: It must be that box !
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 9]: So they were going to remove the treasure .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 5]: Why call Tom now ?
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 19]: It would be absurd -- the men would get away with the box and never be found again .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 23]: No , he would stick to their wake and follow them ; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 34]: So communing with himself , Huck stepped out and glided along behind the men , cat-like , with bare feet , allowing them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 18]: They moved up the river street three blocks , then turned to the left up a cross-street .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 23]: They went straight ahead , then , until they came to the path that led up Cardiff Hill ; this they took .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 22]: They passed by the old Welshman 's house , half-way up the hill , without hesitating , and still climbed upward .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 14]: Good , thought Huck , they will bury it in the old quarry .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 8]: But they never stopped at the quarry .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 8]: They passed on , up the summit .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 21]: They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes , and were at once hidden in the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 20]: Huck closed up and shortened his distance , now , for they would never be able to see him .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 46]: He trotted along awhile ; then slackened his pace , fearing he was gaining too fast ; moved on a piece , then stopped altogether ; listened ; no sound ; none , save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 13]: The hooting of an owl came over the hill -- ominous sound !
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 4]: But no footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 6]: Heavens , was everything lost !
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 21]: He was about to spring with winged feet , when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him !
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 47]: Huck 's heart shot into his throat , but he swallowed it again ; and then he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once , and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 6]: He knew where he was .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 17]: He knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas ' grounds .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 20]: Very well , he thought , let them bury it there ; it wo n't be hard to find .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 35]: Now there was a voice -- a very low voice -- Injun Joe 's : `` Damn her , maybe she 's got company -- there 's lights , late as it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 8]: `` I ca n't see any . ''
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 14]: This was that stranger 's voice -- the stranger of the haunted house .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 20]: A deadly chill went to Huck 's heart -- this , then , was the `` revenge '' job !
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 7]: His thought was , to fly .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 26]: Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been kind to him more than once , and maybe these men were going to murder her .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 24]: He wished he dared venture to warn her ; but he knew he did n't dare -- they might come and catch him .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 34]: He thought all this and more in the moment that elapsed between the stranger 's remark and Injun Joe 's next -- which was -- `` Because the bush is in your way .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 14]: Now -- this way -- now you see , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 10]: Well , there IS company there , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 6]: Better give it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 13]: `` Give it up , and I just leaving this country forever !
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 10]: Give it up and maybe never have another chance .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 25]: I tell you again , as I 've told you before , I do n't care for her swag -- you may have it .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 32]: But her husband was rough on me -- many times he was rough on me -- and mainly he was the justice of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 6]: And that ai n't all .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 9]: It ai n't a millionth part of it !
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 5]: He had me HORSEWHIPPED !
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 12]: -- horsewhipped in front of the jail , like a nigger !
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 8]: -- with all the town looking on !
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 2]: HORSEWHIPPED !
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 5]: -- do you understand ?
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 8]: He took advantage of me and died .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 10]: But I 'll take it out of HER . ''
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 8]: `` Oh , do n't kill her !
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 6]: Do n't do that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 3]: `` Kill ?
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 6]: Who said anything about killing ?
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 13]: I would kill HIM if he was here ; but not her .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 17]: When you want to get revenge on a woman you do n't kill her -- bosh !
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 6]: you go for her looks .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 14]: You slit her nostrils -- you notch her ears like a sow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 15]: `` By God , that 's -- '' `` Keep your opinion to yourself !
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 7]: It will be safest for you .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 8]: I 'll tie her to the bed .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 11]: If she bleeds to death , is that my fault ?
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 9]: I 'll not cry , if she does .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 29]: My friend , you 'll help me in this thing -- for MY sake -- that 's why you 're here -- I might n't be able alone .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 9]: If you flinch , I 'll kill you .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 5]: Do you understand that ?
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 29]: And if I have to kill you , I 'll kill her -- and then I reckon nobody 'll ever know much about who done this business . ''
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 17]: `` Well , if it 's got to be done , let 's get at it .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 13]: The quicker the better -- I 'm all in a shiver . ''
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 5]: `` Do it NOW ?
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 4]: And company there ?
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 15]: Look here -- I 'll get suspicious of you , first thing you know .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 17]: No -- we 'll wait till the lights are out -- there 's no hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 63]: Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue -- a thing still more awful than any amount of murderous talk ; so he held his breath and stepped gingerly back ; planted his foot carefully and firmly , after balancing , one-legged , in a precarious way and almost toppling over , first on one side and then on the other .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 29]: He took another step back , with the same elaboration and the same risks ; then another and another , and -- a twig snapped under his foot !
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 7]: His breath stopped and he listened .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 10]: There was no sound -- the stillness was perfect .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 5]: His gratitude was measureless .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 33]: Now he turned in his tracks , between the walls of sumach bushes -- turned himself as carefully as if he were a ship -- and then stepped quickly but cautiously along .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 21]: When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure , and so he picked up his nimble heels and flew .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 13]: Down , down he sped , till he reached the Welshman 's .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 24]: He banged at the door , and presently the heads of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 7]: `` What 's the row there ?
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 4]: Who 's banging ?
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 6]: What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 7]: `` Let me in -- quick !
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 6]: I 'll tell everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 8]: `` Why , who are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 11]: `` Huckleberry Finn -- quick , let me in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 6]: `` Huckleberry Finn , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 13]: It ai n't a name to open many doors , I judge !
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 17]: But let him in , lads , and let 's see what 's the trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 21]: `` Please do n't ever tell I told you , '' were Huck 's first words when he got in .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 46]: `` Please do n't -- I 'd be killed , sure -- but the widow 's been good friends to me sometimes , and I want to tell -- I WILL tell if you 'll promise you wo n't ever say it was me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 19]: `` By George , he HAS got something to tell , or he would n't act so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 19]: exclaimed the old man ; `` out with it and nobody here 'll ever tell , lad . ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 33]: Three minutes later the old man and his sons , well armed , were up the hill , and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe , their weapons in their hands .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 6]: Huck accompanied them no further .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 11]: He hid behind a great bowlder and fell to listening .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 24]: There was a lagging , anxious silence , and then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 6]: Huck waited for no particulars .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 17]: He sprang away and sped down the hill as fast as his legs could carry him .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 29]: CHAPTER XXX AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning , Huck came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman 's door .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 27]: The inmates were asleep , but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger , on account of the exciting episode of the night .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 13]: A call came from a window : `` Who 's there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 16]: Huck 's scared voice answered in a low tone : `` Please let me in !
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 7]: It 's only Huck Finn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 16]: `` It 's a name that can open this door night or day , lad !
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 5]: -- and welcome ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 19]: These were strange words to the vagabond boy 's ears , and the pleasantest he had ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 17]: He could not recollect that the closing word had ever been applied in his case before .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 10]: The door was quickly unlocked , and he entered .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 19]: Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 44]: `` Now , my boy , I hope you 're good and hungry , because breakfast will be ready as soon as the sun 's up , and we 'll have a piping hot one , too -- make yourself easy about that !
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 16]: I and the boys hoped you 'd turn up and stop here last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 15]: `` I was awful scared , '' said Huck , `` and I run .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 18]: I took out when the pistols went off , and I did n't stop for three mile .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 38]: I 've come now becuz I wanted to know about it , you know ; and I come before daylight becuz I did n't want to run across them devils , even if they was dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 35]: `` Well , poor chap , you do look as if you 'd had a hard night of it -- but there 's a bed here for you when you 've had your breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 16]: No , they ai n't dead , lad -- we are sorry enough for that .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 52]: You see we knew right where to put our hands on them , by your description ; so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them -- dark as a cellar that sumach path was -- and just then I found I was going to sneeze .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 8]: It was the meanest kind of luck !
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 22]: I tried to keep it back , but no use -- 't was bound to come , and it did come !
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 34]: I was in the lead with my pistol raised , and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path , I sung out , ` Fire boys ! '
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 11]: and blazed away at the place where the rustling was .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 5]: So did the boys .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 21]: But they were off in a jiffy , those villains , and we after them , down through the woods .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 7]: I judge we never touched them .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 22]: They fired a shot apiece as they started , but their bullets whizzed by and did n't do us any harm .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 23]: As soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing , and went down and stirred up the constables .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 35]: They got a posse together , and went off to guard the river bank , and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 8]: My boys will be with them presently .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 19]: I wish we had some sort of description of those rascals -- ` twould help a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 20]: But you could n't see what they were like , in the dark , lad , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 13]: `` Oh yes ; I saw them down-town and follered them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 3]: `` Splendid !
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 10]: Describe them -- describe them , my boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 41]: `` One 's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that 's ben around here once or twice , and t ` other 's a mean-looking , ragged -- '' `` That 's enough , lad , we know the men !
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 19]: Happened on them in the woods back of the widow 's one day , and they slunk away .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 18]: Off with you , boys , and tell the sheriff -- get your breakfast to-morrow morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 8]: The Welshman 's sons departed at once .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 28]: As they were leaving the room Huck sprang up and exclaimed : `` Oh , please do n't tell ANYbody it was me that blowed on them !
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 5]: Oh , please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 23]: `` All right if you say it , Huck , but you ought to have the credit of what you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 6]: `` Oh no , no !
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 6]: Please do n't tell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 23]: When the young men were gone , the old Welshman said : `` They wo n't tell -- and I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 10]: But why do n't you want it known ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 48]: Huck would not explain , further than to say that he already knew too much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything against him for the whole world -- he would be killed for knowing it , sure .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 23]: The old man promised secrecy once more , and said : `` How did you come to follow these fellows , lad ?
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 6]: Were they looking suspicious ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 11]: Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 61]: Then he said : `` Well , you see , I 'm a kind of a hard lot , -- least everybody says so , and I do n't see nothing agin it -- and sometimes I ca n't sleep much , on account of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 9]: That was the way of it last night .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 46]: I could n't sleep , and so I come along up-street ` bout midnight , a-turning it all over , and when I got to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern , I backed up agin the wall to have another think .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 29]: Well , just then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me , with something under their arm , and I reckoned they 'd stole it .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 64]: One was a-smoking , and t ` other one wanted a light ; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard , by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye , and t ` other one was a rusty , ragged-looking devil . ''
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 14]: `` Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 7]: This staggered Huck for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 22]: Then he said : `` Well , I do n't know -- but somehow it seems as if I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 16]: `` Then they went on , and you -- '' `` Follered 'em -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 4]: That was it .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 13]: I wanted to see what was up -- they sneaked along so .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 46]: I dogged 'em to the widder 's stile , and stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder , and the Spaniard swear he 'd spile her looks just as I told you and your two -- '' `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 10]: The DEAF AND DUMB man said all that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 7]: Huck had made another terrible mistake !
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 41]: He was trying his best to keep the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be , and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 27]: He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape , but the old man 's eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 16]: Presently the Welshman said : `` My boy , do n't be afraid of me .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 14]: I would n't hurt a hair of your head for all the world .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 12]: No -- I 'd protect you -- I 'd protect you .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 25]: This Spaniard is not deaf and dumb ; you 've let that slip without intending it ; you ca n't cover that up now .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 13]: You know something about that Spaniard that you want to keep dark .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 21]: Now trust me -- tell me what it is , and trust me -- I wo n't betray you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 34]: Huck looked into the old man 's honest eyes a moment , then bent over and whispered in his ear : '' ` Tai n't a Spaniard -- it 's Injun Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 9]: The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 15]: In a moment he said : `` It 's all plain enough , now .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 29]: When you talked about notching ears and slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment , because white men do n't take that sort of revenge .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 4]: But an Injun !
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 8]: That 's a different matter altogether . ''
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 51]: During breakfast the talk went on , and in the course of it the old man said that the last thing which he and his sons had done , before going to bed , was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 16]: They found none , but captured a bulky bundle of -- `` Of WHAT ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 22]: If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more stunning suddenness from Huck 's blanched lips .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 18]: His eyes were staring wide , now , and his breath suspended -- waiting for the answer .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 25]: The Welshman started -- stared in return -- three seconds -- five seconds -- ten -- then replied : `` Of burglar 's tools .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 10]: Why , what 's the MATTER with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 13]: Huck sank back , panting gently , but deeply , unutterably grateful .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 19]: The Welshman eyed him gravely , curiously -- and presently said : `` Yes , burglar 's tools .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 9]: That appears to relieve you a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 8]: But what did give you that turn ?
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 9]: What were YOU expecting we 'd found ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 69]: Huck was in a close place -- the inquiring eye was upon him -- he would have given anything for material for a plausible answer -- nothing suggested itself -- the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper -- a senseless reply offered -- there was no time to weigh it , so at a venture he uttered it -- feebly : `` Sunday-school books , maybe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 55]: Poor Huck was too distressed to smile , but the old man laughed loud and joyously , shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot , and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man 's pocket , because it cut down the doctor 's bill like everything .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 34]: Then he added : `` Poor old chap , you 're white and jaded -- you ai n't well a bit -- no wonder you 're a little flighty and off your balance .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 8]: But you 'll come out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 14]: Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right , I hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 49]: Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a suspicious excitement , for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from the tavern was the treasure , as soon as he had heard the talk at the widow 's stile .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 36]: He had only thought it was not the treasure , however -- he had not known that it was n't -- and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 39]: But on the whole he felt glad the little episode had happened , for now he knew beyond all question that that bundle was not THE bundle , and so his mind was at rest and exceedingly comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 54]: In fact , everything seemed to be drifting just in the right direction , now ; the treasure must be still in No. 2 , the men would be captured and jailed that day , and he and Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of interruption .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 13]: Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 21]: Huck jumped for a hiding-place , for he had no mind to be connected even remotely with the late event .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 32]: The Welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen , among them the Widow Douglas , and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill -- to stare at the stile .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 6]: So the news had spread .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 14]: The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the visitors .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 10]: The widow 's gratitude for her preservation was outspoken .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 11]: `` Do n't say a word about it , madam .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 31]: There 's another that you 're more beholden to than you are to me and my boys , maybe , but he do n't allow me to tell his name .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 11]: We would n't have been there but for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 49]: Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main matter -- but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors , and through them be transmitted to the whole town , for he refused to part with his secret .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 27]: When all else had been learned , the widow said : `` I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 10]: Why did n't you come and wake me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 9]: `` We judged it war n't worth while .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 34]: Those fellows war n't likely to come again -- they had n't any tools left to work with , and what was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death ?
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 16]: My three negro men stood guard at your house all the rest of the night .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 7]: They 've just come back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 20]: More visitors came , and the story had to be told and retold for a couple of hours more .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 15]: There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation , but everybody was early at church .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 7]: The stirring event was well canvassed .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 15]: News came that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 37]: When the sermon was finished , Judge Thatcher 's wife dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said : `` Is my Becky going to sleep all day ?
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 11]: I just expected she would be tired to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 5]: `` Your Becky ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 20]: `` Yes , '' with a startled look -- `` did n't she stay with you last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 6]: `` Why , no . ''
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 25]: Mrs. Thatcher turned pale , and sank into a pew , just as Aunt Polly , talking briskly with a friend , passed by .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 10]: Aunt Polly said : `` Good-morning , Mrs. Thatcher .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 5]: Good-morning , Mrs. Harper .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 11]: I 've got a boy that 's turned up missing .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 15]: I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last night -- one of you .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 10]: And now he 's afraid to come to church .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 9]: I 've got to settle with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 12]: Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 18]: `` He did n't stay with us , '' said Mrs. Harper , beginning to look uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 10]: A marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 13]: `` Joe Harper , have you seen my Tom this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 5]: `` No 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 9]: `` When did you see him last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 13]: Joe tried to remember , but was not sure he could say .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 9]: The people had stopped moving out of church .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 14]: Whispers passed along , and a boding uneasiness took possession of every countenance .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 9]: Children were anxiously questioned , and young teachers .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 36]: They all said they had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip ; it was dark ; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 16]: One young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave !
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 5]: Mrs. Thatcher swooned away .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 10]: Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her hands .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 34]: The alarm swept from lip to lip , from group to group , from street to street , and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the whole town was up !
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 50]: The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant insignificance , the burglars were forgotten , horses were saddled , skiffs were manned , the ferryboat ordered out , and before the horror was half an hour old , two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward the cave .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 11]: All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 14]: Many women visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 15]: They cried with them , too , and that was still better than words .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 35]: All the tedious night the town waited for news ; but when the morning dawned at last , all the word that came was , `` Send more candles -- and send food . ''
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 12]: Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed ; and Aunt Polly , also .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 19]: Judge Thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave , but they conveyed no real cheer .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 21]: The old Welshman came home toward daylight , spattered with candle-grease , smeared with clay , and almost worn out .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 19]: He found Huck still in the bed that had been provided for him , and delirious with fever .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 20]: The physicians were all at the cave , so the Widow Douglas came and took charge of the patient .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 42]: She said she would do her best by him , because , whether he was good , bad , or indifferent , he was the Lord 's , and nothing that was the Lord 's was a thing to be neglected .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 22]: The Welshman said Huck had good spots in him , and the widow said : `` You can depend on it .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 7]: That 's the Lord 's mark .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 7]: He do n't leave it off .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 4]: He never does .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 13]: Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 24]: Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village , but the strongest of the citizens continued searching .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 74]: All the news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had never been visited before ; that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched ; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages , lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance , and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 41]: In one place , far from the section usually traversed by tourists , the names `` BECKY & TOM '' had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke , and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 10]: Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 43]: She said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child ; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious , because this one parted latest from the living body before the awful death came .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 61]: Some said that now and then , in the cave , a far-away speck of light would glimmer , and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle -- and then a sickening disappointment always followed ; the children were not there ; it was only a searcher 's light .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 20]: Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along , and the village sank into a hopeless stupor .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 7]: No one had heart for anything .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 32]: The accidental discovery , just made , that the proprietor of the Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises , scarcely fluttered the public pulse , tremendous as the fact was .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 39]: In a lucid interval , Huck feebly led up to the subject of taverns , and finally asked -- dimly dreading the worst -- if anything had been discovered at the Temperance Tavern since he had been ill .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said the widow .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 11]: Huck started up in bed , wild-eyed : `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 5]: What was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 3]: `` Liquor !
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 9]: -- and the place has been shut up .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 14]: Lie down , child -- what a turn you did give me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 14]: `` Only tell me just one thing -- only just one -- please !
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 9]: Was it Tom Sawyer that found it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 6]: The widow burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 9]: `` Hush , hush , child , hush !
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 11]: I 've told you before , you must NOT talk .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 8]: You are very , very sick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 22]: Then nothing but liquor had been found ; there would have been a great powwow if it had been the gold .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 10]: So the treasure was gone forever -- gone forever !
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 8]: But what could she be crying about ?
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 6]: Curious that she should cry .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 22]: These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck 's mind , and under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 16]: The widow said to herself : `` There -- he 's asleep , poor wreck .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 5]: Tom Sawyer find it !
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 8]: Pity but somebody could find Tom Sawyer !
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 28]: Ah , there ai n't many left , now , that 's got hope enough , or strength enough , either , to go on searching . ''
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 15]: CHAPTER XXXI NOW to return to Tom and Becky 's share in the picnic .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 50]: They tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company , visiting the familiar wonders of the cave -- wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names , such as `` The Drawing-Room , '' `` The Cathedral , '' `` Aladdin 's Palace , '' and so on .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 64]: Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began , and Tom and Becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome ; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled web-work of names , dates , post-office addresses , and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been frescoed -LRB- in candle-smoke -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 25]: Still drifting along and talking , they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls were not frescoed .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 13]: They smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf and moved on .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 44]: Presently they came to a place where a little stream of water , trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it , had , in the slow-dragging ages , formed a laced and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 17]: Tom squeezed his small body behind it in order to illuminate it for Becky 's gratification .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 30]: He found that it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls , and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 21]: Becky responded to his call , and they made a smoke-mark for future guidance , and started upon their quest .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 35]: They wound this way and that , far down into the secret depths of the cave , made another mark , and branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 54]: In one place they found a spacious cavern , from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a man 's leg ; they walked all about it , wondering and admiring , and presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 59]: This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring , whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals ; it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together , the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 38]: Under the roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together , thousands in a bunch ; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds , squeaking and darting furiously at the candles .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 13]: Tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort of conduct .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 40]: He seized Becky 's hand and hurried her into the first corridor that offered ; and none too soon , for a bat struck Becky 's light out with its wing while she was passing out of the cavern .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 30]: The bats chased the children a good distance ; but the fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered , and at last got rid of the perilous things .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 23]: Tom found a subterranean lake , shortly , which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 23]: He wanted to explore its borders , but concluded that it would be best to sit down and rest awhile , first .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 24]: Now , for the first time , the deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 26]: Becky said : `` Why , I did n't notice , but it seems ever so long since I heard any of the others . ''
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 35]: `` Come to think , Becky , we are away down below them -- and I do n't know how far away north , or south , or east , or whichever it is .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 8]: We could n't hear them here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 4]: Becky grew apprehensive .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 13]: `` I wonder how long we 've been down here , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 6]: We better start back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 8]: `` Yes , I reckon we better .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 5]: P'raps we better . ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 9]: `` Can you find the way , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 10]: It 's all a mixed-up crookedness to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 13]: `` I reckon I could find it -- but then the bats .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 13]: If they put our candles out it will be an awful fix .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 16]: Let 's try some other way , so as not to go through there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 3]: `` Well .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 9]: But I hope we wo n't get lost .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 7]: It would be so awful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 12]: and the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 40]: They started through a corridor , and traversed it in silence a long way , glancing at each new opening , to see if there was anything familiar about the look of it ; but they were all strange .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 31]: Every time Tom made an examination , Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign , and he would say cheerily : `` Oh , it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 16]: This ai n't the one , but we 'll come to it right away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 35]: But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure , and presently began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random , in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 42]: He still said it was `` all right , '' but there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said , `` All is lost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 25]: Becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear , and tried hard to keep back the tears , but they would come .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 22]: At last she said : `` Oh , Tom , never mind the bats , let 's go back that way !
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 13]: We seem to get worse and worse off all the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 4]: `` Listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 16]: Profound silence ; silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in the hush .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 3]: Tom shouted .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 26]: The call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 20]: `` Oh , do n't do it again , Tom , it is too horrid , '' said Becky .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 25]: `` It is horrid , but I better , Becky ; they might hear us , you know , '' and he shouted again .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 21]: The `` might '' was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter , it so confessed a perishing hope .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 13]: The children stood still and listened ; but there was no result .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 14]: Tom turned upon the back track at once , and hurried his steps .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 28]: It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky -- he could not find his way back !
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 13]: `` Oh , Tom , you did n't make any marks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 9]: `` Becky , I was such a fool !
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 4]: Such a fool !
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 10]: I never thought we might want to come back !
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 9]: No -- I ca n't find the way .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 7]: It 's all mixed up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 9]: `` Tom , Tom , we 're lost !
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 4]: we 're lost !
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 10]: We never can get out of this awful place !
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 11]: Oh , why DID we ever leave the others ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 30]: She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom was appalled with the idea that she might die , or lose her reason .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 46]: He sat down by her and put his arms around her ; she buried her face in his bosom , she clung to him , she poured out her terrors , her unavailing regrets , and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 16]: Tom begged her to pluck up hope again , and she said she could not .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 21]: He fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable situation ; this had a better effect .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 30]: She said she would try to hope again , she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 13]: For he was no more to blame than she , she said .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 23]: So they moved on again -- aimlessly -- simply at random -- all they could do was to move , keep moving .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 46]: For a little while , hope made a show of reviving -- not with any reason to back it , but only because it is its nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and familiarity with failure .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 11]: By-and-by Tom took Becky 's candle and blew it out .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 6]: This economy meant so much !
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 5]: Words were not needed .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 9]: Becky understood , and her hope died again .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 22]: She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets -- yet he must economize .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 66]: By-and-by , fatigue began to assert its claims ; the children tried to pay attention , for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so precious , moving , in some direction , in any direction , was at least progress and might bear fruit ; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 12]: At last Becky 's frail limbs refused to carry her farther .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 4]: She sat down .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 28]: Tom rested with her , and they talked of home , and the friends there , and the comfortable beds and , above all , the light !
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 30]: Becky cried , and Tom tried to think of some way of comforting her , but all his encouragements were grown threadbare with use , and sounded like sarcasms .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 13]: Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 4]: Tom was grateful .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 30]: He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams ; and by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 26]: The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit , and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 32]: While he was deep in his musings , Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh -- but it was stricken dead upon her lips , and a groan followed it .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 8]: `` Oh , how COULD I sleep !
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 9]: I wish I never , never had waked !
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 8]: No , I do n't , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 5]: Do n't look so !
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 8]: I wo n't say it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 26]: `` I 'm glad you 've slept , Becky ; you 'll feel rested , now , and we 'll find the way out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 19]: `` We can try , Tom ; but I 've seen such a beautiful country in my dream .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 8]: I reckon we are going there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 7]: `` Maybe not , maybe not .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 13]: Cheer up , Becky , and let 's go on trying . ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 13]: They rose up and wandered along , hand in hand and hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 44]: They tried to estimate how long they had been in the cave , but all they knew was that it seemed days and weeks , and yet it was plain that this could not be , for their candles were not gone yet .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 31]: A long time after this -- they could not tell how long -- Tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water -- they must find a spring .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 15]: They found one presently , and Tom said it was time to rest again .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 17]: Both were cruelly tired , yet Becky said she thought she could go a little farther .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 8]: She was surprised to hear Tom dissent .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 6]: She could not understand it .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 20]: They sat down , and Tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 12]: Thought was soon busy ; nothing was said for some time .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 15]: Then Becky broke the silence : `` Tom , I am so hungry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 8]: Tom took something out of his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 7]: `` Do you remember this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 4]: Becky almost smiled .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 9]: `` It 's our wedding-cake , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 22]: `` Yes -- I wish it was as big as a barrel , for it 's all we 've got . ''
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 38]: `` I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on , Tom , the way grown-up people do with wedding-cake -- but it 'll be our -- '' She dropped the sentence where it was .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 18]: Tom divided the cake and Becky ate with good appetite , while Tom nibbled at his moiety .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 12]: There was abundance of cold water to finish the feast with .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 9]: By-and-by Becky suggested that they move on again .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 6]: Tom was silent a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 18]: Then he said : `` Becky , can you bear it if I tell you something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 11]: Becky 's face paled , but she thought she could .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 19]: `` Well , then , Becky , we must stay here , where there 's water to drink .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 9]: That little piece is our last candle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 8]: Becky gave loose to tears and wailings .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 14]: Tom did what he could to comfort her , but with little effect .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 9]: At length Becky said : `` Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 6]: `` Well , Becky ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 11]: `` They 'll miss us and hunt for us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 6]: `` Yes , they will !
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 5]: Certainly they will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 12]: `` Maybe they 're hunting for us now , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 9]: `` Why , I reckon maybe they are .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 6]: I hope they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 10]: `` When would they miss us , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 13]: `` When they get back to the boat , I reckon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 18]: `` Tom , it might be dark then -- would they notice we had n't come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 16]: But anyway , your mother would miss you as soon as they got home . ''
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 22]: A frightened look in Becky 's face brought Tom to his senses and he saw that he had made a blunder .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 10]: Becky was not to have gone home that night !
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 7]: The children became silent and thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 44]: In a moment a new burst of grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers also -- that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher discovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper 's .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 62]: The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it melt slowly and pitilessly away ; saw the half inch of wick stand alone at last ; saw the feeble flame rise and fall , climb the thin column of smoke , linger at its top a moment , and then -- the horror of utter darkness reigned !
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 25]: How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that she was crying in Tom 's arms , neither could tell .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 32]: All that they knew was , that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time , both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 12]: Tom said it might be Sunday , now -- maybe Monday .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 21]: He tried to get Becky to talk , but her sorrows were too oppressive , all her hopes were gone .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 20]: Tom said that they must have been missed long ago , and no doubt the search was going on .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 10]: He would shout and maybe some one would come .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 21]: He tried it ; but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no more .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 14]: The hours wasted away , and hunger came to torment the captives again .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 18]: A portion of Tom 's half of the cake was left ; they divided and ate it .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 7]: But they seemed hungrier than before .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 9]: The poor morsel of food only whetted desire .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 7]: By-and-by Tom said : `` SH !
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 6]: Did you hear that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 7]: Both held their breath and listened .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 11]: There was a sound like the faintest , far-off shout .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 21]: Instantly Tom answered it , and leading Becky by the hand , started groping down the corridor in its direction .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 17]: Presently he listened again ; again the sound was heard , and apparently a little nearer .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 6]: `` It 's them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 8]: said Tom ; `` they 're coming !
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 12]: Come along , Becky -- we 're all right now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 9]: The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 20]: Their speed was slow , however , because pitfalls were somewhat common , and had to be guarded against .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 10]: They shortly came to one and had to stop .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 22]: It might be three feet deep , it might be a hundred -- there was no passing it at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 15]: Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 3]: No bottom .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 11]: They must stay there and wait until the searchers came .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 12]: They listened ; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant !
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 11]: a moment or two more and they had gone altogether .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 6]: The heart-sinking misery of it !
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 14]: Tom whooped until he was hoarse , but it was of no use .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 19]: He talked hopefully to Becky ; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came again .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 10]: The children groped their way back to the spring .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 16]: The weary time dragged on ; they slept again , and awoke famished and woe-stricken .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 10]: Tom believed it must be Tuesday by this time .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 6]: Now an idea struck him .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 9]: There were some side passages near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 20]: It would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the heavy time in idleness .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 33]: He took a kite-line from his pocket , tied it to a projection , and he and Becky started , Tom in the lead , unwinding the line as he groped along .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 16]: At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a `` jumping-off place . ''
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 64]: Tom got down on his knees and felt below , and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands conveniently ; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right , and at that moment , not twenty yards away , a human hand , holding a candle , appeared from behind a rock !
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 24]: Tom lifted up a glorious shout , and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to -- Injun Joe 's !
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 9]: Tom was paralyzed ; he could not move .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 25]: He was vastly gratified the next moment , to see the `` Spaniard '' take to his heels and get himself out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 20]: Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come over and killed him for testifying in court .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 9]: But the echoes must have disguised the voice .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 10]: Without doubt , that was it , he reasoned .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 10]: Tom 's fright weakened every muscle in his body .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 36]: He said to himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there , and nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 14]: He was careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 12]: He told her he had only shouted `` for luck . ''
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 13]: But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 13]: Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought changes .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 9]: The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 26]: Tom believed that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday , now , and that the search had been given over .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 7]: He proposed to explore another passage .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 12]: He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 6]: But Becky was very weak .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 13]: She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be roused .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 21]: She said she would wait , now , where she was , and die -- it would not be long .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 55]: She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he chose ; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak to her ; and she made him promise that when the awful time came , he would stay by her and hold her hand until all was over .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 63]: Tom kissed her , with a choking sensation in his throat , and made a show of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave ; then he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the passages on his hands and knees , distressed with hunger and sick with bodings of coming doom .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 12]: CHAPTER XXXII TUESDAY afternoon came , and waned to the twilight .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 8]: The village of St. Petersburg still mourned .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 8]: The lost children had not been found .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 36]: Public prayers had been offered up for them , and many and many a private prayer that had the petitioner 's whole heart in it ; but still no good news came from the cave .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 30]: The majority of the searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily avocations , saying that it was plain the children could never be found .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 15]: Mrs. Thatcher was very ill , and a great part of the time delirious .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 35]: People said it was heartbreaking to hear her call her child , and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time , then lay it wearily down again with a moan .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 18]: Aunt Polly had drooped into a settled melancholy , and her gray hair had grown almost white .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 14]: The village went to its rest on Tuesday night , sad and forlorn .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 36]: Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells , and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad people , who shouted , `` Turn out !
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 3]: turn out !
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 4]: they 're found !
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 5]: they 're found ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 54]: Tin pans and horns were added to the din , the population massed itself and moved toward the river , met the children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens , thronged around it , joined its homeward march , and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after huzzah !
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 23]: The village was illuminated ; nobody went to bed again ; it was the greatest night the little town had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 46]: During the first half-hour a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher 's house , seized the saved ones and kissed them , squeezed Mrs. Thatcher 's hand , tried to speak but could n't -- and drifted out raining tears all over the place .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 14]: Aunt Polly 's happiness was complete , and Mrs. Thatcher 's nearly so .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 28]: It would be complete , however , as soon as the messenger dispatched with the great news to the cave should get the word to her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 116]: Tom lay upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful adventure , putting in many striking additions to adorn it withal ; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went on an exploring expedition ; how he followed two avenues as far as his kite-line would reach ; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of the kite-line , and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off speck that looked like daylight ; dropped the line and groped toward it , pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole , and saw the broad Mississippi rolling by !
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 28]: And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more !
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 42]: He told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff , for she was tired , and knew she was going to die , and wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 145]: He described how he labored with her and convinced her ; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight ; how he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out ; how they sat there and cried for gladness ; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition ; how the men did n't believe the wild tale at first , `` because , '' said they , `` you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in '' -- then took them aboard , rowed to a house , gave them supper , made them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 37]: Before day-dawn , Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him were tracked out , in the cave , by the twine clews they had strung behind them , and informed of the great news .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 27]: Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be shaken off at once , as Tom and Becky soon discovered .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 24]: They were bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday , and seemed to grow more and more tired and worn , all the time .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 46]: Tom got about , a little , on Thursday , was down-town Friday , and nearly as whole as ever Saturday ; but Becky did not leave her room until Sunday , and then she looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 31]: Tom learned of Huck 's sickness and went to see him on Friday , but could not be admitted to the bedroom ; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 22]: He was admitted daily after that , but was warned to keep still about his adventure and introduce no exciting topic .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 11]: The Widow Douglas stayed by to see that he obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 41]: At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event ; also that the `` ragged man 's '' body had eventually been found in the river near the ferry-landing ; he had been drowned while trying to escape , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 44]: About a fortnight after Tom 's rescue from the cave , he started off to visit Huck , who had grown plenty strong enough , now , to hear exciting talk , and Tom had some that would interest him , he thought .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 17]: Judge Thatcher 's house was on Tom 's way , and he stopped to see Becky .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 28]: The Judge and some friends set Tom to talking , and some one asked him ironically if he would n't like to go to the cave again .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 10]: Tom said he thought he would n't mind it .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 23]: The Judge said : `` Well , there are others just like you , Tom , I 've not the least doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 8]: But we have taken care of that .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 11]: Nobody will get lost in that cave any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 26]: `` Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago , and triple-locked -- and I 've got the keys . ''
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 8]: Tom turned as white as a sheet .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 8]: `` What 's the matter , boy !
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 6]: Here , run , somebody !
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 7]: Fetch a glass of water ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 11]: The water was brought and thrown into Tom 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 9]: `` Ah , now you 're all right .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 10]: What was the matter with you , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 13]: `` Oh , Judge , Injun Joe 's in the cave ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 38]: CHAPTER XXXIII WITHIN a few minutes the news had spread , and a dozen skiff-loads of men were on their way to McDougal 's cave , and the ferryboat , well filled with passengers , soon followed .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 11]: Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 20]: When the cave door was unlocked , a sorrowful sight presented itself in the dim twilight of the place .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 47]: Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground , dead , with his face close to the crack of the door , as if his longing eyes had been fixed , to the latest moment , upon the light and the cheer of the free world outside .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 17]: Tom was touched , for he knew by his own experience how this wretch had suffered .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 56]: His pity was moved , but nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security , now , which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 14]: Injun Joe 's bowie-knife lay close by , its blade broken in two .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 57]: The great foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through , with tedious labor ; useless labor , too , it was , for the native rock formed a sill outside it , and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect ; the only damage done was to the knife itself .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 43]: But if there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless still , for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have squeezed his body under the door , and he knew it .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 30]: So he had only hacked that place in order to be doing something -- in order to pass the weary time -- in order to employ his tortured faculties .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 30]: Ordinarily one could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this vestibule , left there by tourists ; but there were none now .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 10]: The prisoner had searched them out and eaten them .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 24]: He had also contrived to catch a few bats , and these , also , he had eaten , leaving only their claws .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 8]: The poor unfortunate had starved to death .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 30]: In one place , near at hand , a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages , builded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 53]: The captive had broken off the stalagmite , and upon the stump had placed a stone , wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick -- a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 49]: That drop was falling when the Pyramids were new ; when Troy fell ; when the foundations of Rome were laid ; when Christ was crucified ; when the Conqueror created the British empire ; when Columbus sailed ; when the massacre at Lexington was `` news . ''
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 40]: It is falling now ; it will still be falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history , and the twilight of tradition , and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 8]: Has everything a purpose and a mission ?
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 20]: Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insect 's need ?
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 14]: and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come ?
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 3]: No matter .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 49]: It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops , but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of McDougal 's cave .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 26]: Injun Joe 's cup stands first in the list of the cavern 's marvels ; even `` Aladdin 's Palace '' can not rival it .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 68]: Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave ; and people flocked there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and hamlets for seven miles around ; they brought their children , and all sorts of provisions , and confessed that they had had almost as satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the hanging .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 21]: This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing -- the petition to the governor for Injun Joe 's pardon .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 50]: The petition had been largely signed ; many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held , and a committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the governor , and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty under foot .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 18]: Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the village , but what of that ?
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 36]: If he had been Satan himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon-petition , and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky water-works .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 18]: The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have an important talk .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 46]: Huck had learned all about Tom 's adventure from the Welshman and the Widow Douglas , by this time , but Tom said he reckoned there was one thing they had not told him ; that thing was what he wanted to talk about now .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 5]: Huck 's face saddened .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 10]: He said : `` I know what it is .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 12]: You got into No. 2 and never found anything but whiskey .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 63]: Nobody told me it was you ; but I just knowed it must ` a ' ben you , soon as I heard ` bout that whiskey business ; and I knowed you had n't got the money becuz you 'd ` a ' got at me some way or other and told me even if you was mum to everybody else .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 17]: Tom , something 's always told me we 'd never get holt of that swag . ''
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 12]: `` Why , Huck , I never told on that tavern-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 15]: YOU know his tavern was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 13]: Do n't you remember you was to watch there that night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 4]: `` Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 10]: Why , it seems ` bout a year ago .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 16]: It was that very night that I follered Injun Joe to the widder 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 6]: `` YOU followed him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 8]: `` Yes -- but you keep mum .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 25]: I reckon Injun Joe 's left friends behind him , and I do n't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 19]: If it had n't ben for me he 'd be down in Texas now , all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 24]: Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom , who had only heard of the Welshman 's part of it before .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 45]: `` Well , '' said Huck , presently , coming back to the main question , `` whoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2 , nipped the money , too , I reckon -- anyways it 's a goner for us , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 13]: `` Huck , that money was n't ever in No. 2 ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 8]: Huck searched his comrade 's face keenly .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 15]: `` Tom , have you got on the track of that money again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 10]: `` Huck , it 's in the cave ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 5]: Huck 's eyes blazed .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 8]: `` Say it again , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 9]: `` The money 's in the cave ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 16]: `` Tom -- honest injun , now -- is it fun , or earnest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 16]: `` Earnest , Huck -- just as earnest as ever I was in my life .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 14]: Will you go in there with me and help get it out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 6]: `` I bet I will !
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 19]: I will if it 's where we can blaze our way to it and not get lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 19]: `` Huck , we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 5]: `` Good as wheat !
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 21]: What makes you think the money 's -- '' `` Huck , you just wait till we get in there .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 24]: If we do n't find it I 'll agree to give you my drum and every thing I 've got in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 7]: I will , by jings . ''
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 9]: `` All right -- it 's a whiz .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 6]: When do you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 9]: `` Right now , if you say it .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 6]: Are you strong enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 8]: `` Is it far in the cave ?
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 36]: I ben on my pins a little , three or four days , now , but I ca n't walk more 'n a mile , Tom -- least I do n't think I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 35]: `` It 's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go , Huck , but there 's a mighty short cut that they do n't anybody but me know about .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 13]: Huck , I 'll take you right to it in a skiff .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 19]: I 'll float the skiff down there , and I 'll pull it back again all by myself .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 10]: You need n't ever turn your hand over . ''
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 9]: `` Less start right off , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 35]: We want some bread and meat , and our pipes , and a little bag or two , and two or three kite-strings , and some of these new-fangled things they call lucifer matches .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 21]: I tell you , many 's the time I wished I had some when I was in there before . ''
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 24]: A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who was absent , and got under way at once .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 43]: When they were several miles below `` Cave Hollow , '' Tom said : `` Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the cave hollow -- no houses , no wood-yards , bushes all alike .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 16]: But do you see that white place up yonder where there 's been a landslide ?
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 9]: Well , that 's one of my marks .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 8]: We 'll get ashore , now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 3]: They landed .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 22]: `` Now , Huck , where we 're a-standing you could touch that hole I got out of with a fishing-pole .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 8]: See if you can find it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 11]: Huck searched all the place about , and found nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 18]: Tom proudly marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said : `` Here you are !
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 15]: Look at it , Huck ; it 's the snuggest hole in this country .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 7]: You just keep mum about it .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 34]: All along I 've been wanting to be a robber , but I knew I 'd got to have a thing like this , and where to run across it was the bother .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 46]: We 've got it now , and we 'll keep it quiet , only we 'll let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in -- because of course there 's got to be a Gang , or else there would n't be any style about it .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 16]: Tom Sawyer 's Gang -- it sounds splendid , do n't it , Huck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 9]: `` Well , it just does , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 7]: And who 'll we rob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 6]: `` Oh , most anybody .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 10]: Waylay people -- that 's mostly the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 6]: `` And kill them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 6]: `` No , not always .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 12]: Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 7]: `` What 's a ransom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 3]: `` Money .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 32]: You make them raise all they can , off 'n their friends ; and after you 've kept them a year , if it ai n't raised then you kill them .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 6]: That 's the general way .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 8]: Only you do n't kill the women .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 13]: You shut up the women , but you do n't kill them .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 11]: They 're always beautiful and rich , and awfully scared .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 18]: You take their watches and things , but you always take your hat off and talk polite .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 17]: They ai n't anybody as polite as robbers -- you 'll see that in any book .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 36]: Well , the women get to loving you , and after they 've been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you could n't get them to leave .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 14]: If you drove them out they 'd turn right around and come back .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 9]: It 's so in all the books . ''
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 10]: `` Why , it 's real bully , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 12]: I believe it 's better 'n to be a pirate . ''
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 23]: `` Yes , it 's better in some ways , because it 's close to home and circuses and all that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 18]: By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole , Tom in the lead .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 22]: They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel , then made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 19]: A few steps brought them to the spring , and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 31]: He showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay against the wall , and described how he and Becky had watched the flame struggle and expire .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 23]: The boys began to quiet down to whispers , now , for the stillness and gloom of the place oppressed their spirits .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 22]: They went on , and presently entered and followed Tom 's other corridor until they reached the `` jumping-off place . ''
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 25]: The candles revealed the fact that it was not really a precipice , but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet high .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 14]: Tom whispered : `` Now I 'll show you something , Huck . ''
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 19]: He held his candle aloft and said : `` Look as far around the corner as you can .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 5]: Do you see that ?
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 14]: There -- on the big rock over yonder -- done with candle-smoke . ''
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 9]: `` Tom , it 's a CROSS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 8]: `` NOW where 's your Number Two ?
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 8]: ` UNDER THE CROSS , ' hey ?
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 16]: Right yonder 's where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle , Huck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 26]: Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile , and then said with a shaky voice : `` Tom , less git out of here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 6]: and leave the treasure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 6]: `` Yes -- leave it .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 12]: Injun Joe 's ghost is round about there , certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 13]: `` No it ai n't , Huck , no it ai n't .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 26]: It would ha ` nt the place where he died -- away out at the mouth of the cave -- five mile from here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 9]: `` No , Tom , it would n't .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 7]: It would hang round the money .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 13]: I know the ways of ghosts , and so do you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 9]: Tom began to fear that Huck was right .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 6]: Misgivings gathered in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 21]: But presently an idea occurred to him -- `` Lookyhere , Huck , what fools we 're making of ourselves !
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 18]: Injun Joe 's ghost ai n't a going to come around where there 's a cross ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 6]: The point was well taken .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 5]: It had its effect .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 10]: `` Tom , I did n't think of that .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 5]: But that 's so .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 10]: It 's luck for us , that cross is .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 16]: I reckon we 'll climb down there and have a hunt for that box . ''
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 15]: Tom went first , cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 3]: Huck followed .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 15]: Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood in .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 10]: The boys examined three of them with no result .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 44]: They found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock , with a pallet of blankets spread down in it ; also an old suspender , some bacon rind , and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 6]: But there was no money-box .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 12]: The lads searched and researched this place , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 10]: Tom said : `` He said UNDER the cross .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 11]: Well , this comes nearest to being under the cross .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 18]: It ca n't be under the rock itself , because that sets solid on the ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 12]: They searched everywhere once more , and then sat down discouraged .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 5]: Huck could suggest nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 32]: By-and-by Tom said : `` Lookyhere , Huck , there 's footprints and some candle-grease on the clay about one side of this rock , but not on the other sides .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 7]: Now , what 's that for ?
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 10]: I bet you the money IS under the rock .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 10]: I 'm going to dig in the clay . ''
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 11]: `` That ai n't no bad notion , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 5]: said Huck with animation .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 23]: Tom 's `` real Barlow '' was out at once , and he had not dug four inches before he struck wood .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 5]: `` Hey , Huck !
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 6]: -- you hear that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 8]: Huck began to dig and scratch now .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 8]: Some boards were soon uncovered and removed .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 12]: They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 30]: Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could , but said he could not see to the end of the rift .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 5]: He proposed to explore .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 12]: He stooped and passed under ; the narrow way descended gradually .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 21]: He followed its winding course , first to the right , then to the left , Huck at his heels .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 20]: Tom turned a short curve , by-and-by , and exclaimed : `` My goodness , Huck , lookyhere ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 50]: It was the treasure-box , sure enough , occupying a snug little cavern , along with an empty powder-keg , a couple of guns in leather cases , two or three pairs of old moccasins , a leather belt , and some other rubbish well soaked with the water-drip .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 7]: `` Got it at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 12]: said Huck , ploughing among the tarnished coins with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 11]: `` My , but we 're rich , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 11]: `` Huck , I always reckoned we 'd get it .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 16]: It 's just too good to believe , but we HAVE got it , sure !
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 9]: Say -- let 's not fool around here .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 6]: Let 's snake it out .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 11]: Lem me see if I can lift the box . ''
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 6]: It weighed about fifty pounds .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 17]: Tom could lift it , after an awkward fashion , but could not carry it conveniently .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 27]: `` I thought so , '' he said ; `` THEY carried it like it was heavy , that day at the ha ` nted house .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 4]: I noticed that .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 15]: I reckon I was right to think of fetching the little bags along . ''
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 18]: The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross rock .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 13]: `` Now less fetch the guns and things , '' said Huck .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 9]: `` No , Huck -- leave them there .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 13]: They 're just the tricks to have when we go to robbing .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 19]: We 'll keep them there all the time , and we 'll hold our orgies there , too .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 10]: It 's an awful snug place for orgies . ''
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 5]: `` What orgies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 4]: `` I dono .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 18]: But robbers always have orgies , and of course we 've got to have them , too .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 14]: Come along , Huck , we 've been in here a long time .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 8]: It 's getting late , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 6]: I 'm hungry , too .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 13]: We 'll eat and smoke when we get to the skiff . ''
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 29]: They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes , looked warily out , found the coast clear , and were soon lunching and smoking in the skiff .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 15]: As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got under way .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 21]: Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight , chatting cheerily with Huck , and landed shortly after dark .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 60]: `` Now , Huck , '' said Tom , `` we 'll hide the money in the loft of the widow 's woodshed , and I 'll come up in the morning and we 'll count it and divide , and then we 'll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be safe .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 29]: Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook Benny Taylor 's little wagon ; I wo n't be gone a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 37]: He disappeared , and presently returned with the wagon , put the two small sacks into it , threw some old rags on top of them , and started off , dragging his cargo behind him .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 14]: When the boys reached the Welshman 's house , they stopped to rest .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 24]: Just as they were about to move on , the Welshman stepped out and said : `` Hallo , who 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 7]: `` Huck and Tom Sawyer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 3]: `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 13]: Come along with me , boys , you are keeping everybody waiting .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 16]: Here -- hurry up , trot ahead -- I 'll haul the wagon for you .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 12]: Why , it 's not as light as it might be .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 5]: Got bricks in it ?
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 6]: -- or old metal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 8]: `` Old metal , '' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 45]: `` I judged so ; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away more time hunting up six bits ' worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 13]: But that 's human nature -- hurry along , hurry along ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 11]: The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 18]: `` Never mind ; you 'll see , when we get to the Widow Douglas ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 28]: Huck said with some apprehension -- for he was long used to being falsely accused : `` Mr. Jones , we have n't been doing nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 4]: The Welshman laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 13]: `` Well , I do n't know , Huck , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 7]: I do n't know about that .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 10]: Ai n't you and the widow good friends ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 13]: Well , she 's ben good friends to me , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 6]: `` All right , then .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 10]: What do you want to be afraid for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 27]: This question was not entirely answered in Huck 's slow mind before he found himself pushed , along with Tom , into Mrs. Douglas ' drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 11]: Mr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 19]: The place was grandly lighted , and everybody that was of any consequence in the village was there .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 37]: The Thatchers were there , the Harpers , the Rogerses , Aunt Polly , Sid , Mary , the minister , the editor , and a great many more , and all dressed in their best .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 18]: The widow received the boys as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 8]: They were covered with clay and candle-grease .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 16]: Aunt Polly blushed crimson with humiliation , and frowned and shook her head at Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 13]: Nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did , however .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 43]: Mr. Jones said : `` Tom was n't at home , yet , so I gave him up ; but I stumbled on him and Huck right at my door , and so I just brought them along in a hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 12]: `` And you did just right , '' said the widow .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 8]: `` Come with me , boys . ''
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 16]: She took them to a bedchamber and said : `` Now wash and dress yourselves .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 15]: Here are two new suits of clothes -- shirts , socks , everything complete .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 21]: They 're Huck 's -- no , no thanks , Huck -- Mr. Jones bought one and I the other .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 8]: But they 'll fit both of you .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 4]: Get into them .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 14]: We 'll wait -- come down when you are slicked up enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 4]: Then she left .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 19]: CHAPTER XXXIV HUCK said : `` Tom , we can slope , if we can find a rope .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 10]: The window ai n't high from the ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 3]: `` Shucks !
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 9]: what do you want to slope for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 14]: `` Well , I ai n't used to that kind of a crowd .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 6]: I ca n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 10]: I ai n't going down there , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 5]: `` Oh , bother !
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 5]: It ai n't anything .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 8]: I do n't mind it a bit .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 8]: I 'll take care of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 3]: Sid appeared .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 18]: `` Tom , '' said he , `` auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 15]: Mary got your Sunday clothes ready , and everybody 's been fretting about you .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 14]: Say -- ai n't this grease and clay , on your clothes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 15]: `` Now , Mr. Siddy , you jist ` tend to your own business .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 10]: What 's all this blow-out about , anyway ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 15]: `` It 's one of the widow 's parties that she 's always having .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 25]: This time it 's for the Welshman and his sons , on account of that scrape they helped her out of the other night .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 16]: And say -- I can tell you something , if you want to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 6]: `` Well , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 45]: `` Why , old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people here to-night , but I overheard him tell auntie to-day about it , as a secret , but I reckon it 's not much of a secret now .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 19]: Everybody knows -- the widow , too , for all she tries to let on she do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 24]: Mr. Jones was bound Huck should be here -- could n't get along with his grand secret without Huck , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 8]: `` Secret about what , Sid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 11]: `` About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow 's .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 26]: I reckon Mr. Jones was going to make a grand time over his surprise , but I bet you it will drop pretty flat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 10]: Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 10]: `` Sid , was it you that told ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 9]: `` Oh , never mind who it was .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 8]: SOMEBODY told -- that 's enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 22]: `` Sid , there 's only one person in this town mean enough to do that , and that 's you .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 25]: If you had been in Huck 's place you 'd ` a ' sneaked down the hill and never told anybody on the robbers .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 23]: You ca n't do any but mean things , and you ca n't bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 27]: There -- no thanks , as the widow says '' -- and Tom cuffed Sid 's ears and helped him to the door with several kicks .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 18]: `` Now go and tell auntie if you dare -- and to-morrow you 'll catch it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 37]: Some minutes later the widow 's guests were at the supper-table , and a dozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room , after the fashion of that country and that day .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 45]: At the proper time Mr. Jones made his little speech , in which he thanked the widow for the honor she was doing himself and his sons , but said that there was another person whose modesty -- And so forth and so on .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 44]: He sprung his secret about Huck 's share in the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of , but the surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 56]: However , the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment , and heaped so many compliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody 's gaze and everybody 's laudations .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 37]: The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him educated ; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in business in a modest way .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 6]: Tom 's chance was come .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 10]: He said : `` Huck do n't need it .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 5]: Huck 's rich . ''
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 25]: Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 8]: But the silence was a little awkward .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 10]: Tom broke it : `` Huck 's got money .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 15]: Maybe you do n't believe it , but he 's got lots of it .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 14]: Oh , you need n't smile -- I reckon I can show you .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 7]: You just wait a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 6]: Tom ran out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 20]: The company looked at each other with a perplexed interest -- and inquiringly at Huck , who was tongue-tied .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 8]: `` Sid , what ails Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 4]: said Aunt Polly .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 16]: `` He -- well , there ai n't ever any making of that boy out .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 24]: I never -- '' Tom entered , struggling with the weight of his sacks , and Aunt Polly did not finish her sentence .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 22]: Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the table and said : `` There -- what did I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 14]: Half of it 's Huck 's and half of it 's mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 8]: The spectacle took the general breath away .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 9]: All gazed , nobody spoke for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 10]: Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 11]: Tom said he could furnish it , and he did .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 10]: The tale was long , but brimful of interest .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 16]: There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the charm of its flow .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 32]: When he had finished , Mr. Jones said : `` I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion , but it do n't amount to anything now .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 15]: This one makes it sing mighty small , I 'm willing to allow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 5]: The money was counted .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 11]: The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand dollars .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 30]: It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time before , though several persons were there who were worth considerably more than that in property .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 27]: CHAPTER XXXV THE reader may rest satisfied that Tom 's and Huck 's windfall made a mighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 15]: So vast a sum , all in actual cash , seemed next to incredible .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 27]: It was talked about , gloated over , glorified , until the reason of many of the citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 50]: Every `` haunted '' house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected , plank by plank , and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden treasure -- and not by boys , but men -- pretty grave , unromantic men , too , some of them .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 14]: Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted , admired , stared at .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 65]: The boys were not able to remember that their remarks had possessed weight before ; but now their sayings were treasured and repeated ; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as remarkable ; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying commonplace things ; moreover , their past history was raked up and discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 10]: The village paper published biographical sketches of the boys .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 28]: The Widow Douglas put Huck 's money out at six per cent. , and Judge Thatcher did the same with Tom 's at Aunt Polly 's request .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 27]: Each lad had an income , now , that was simply prodigious -- a dollar for every week-day in the year and half of the Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 24]: It was just what the minister got -- no , it was what he was promised -- he generally could n't collect it .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 35]: A dollar and a quarter a week would board , lodge , and school a boy in those old simple days -- and clothe him and wash him , too , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 10]: Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 17]: He said that no commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 99]: When Becky told her father , in strict confidence , how Tom had taken her whipping at school , the Judge was visibly moved ; and when she pleaded grace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that whipping from her shoulders to his own , the Judge said with a fine outburst that it was a noble , a generous , a magnanimous lie -- a lie that was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to breast with George Washington 's lauded Truth about the hatchet !
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 26]: Becky thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 10]: She went straight off and told Tom about it .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 16]: Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some day .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 43]: He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the National Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school in the country , in order that he might be ready for either career or both .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 45]: Huck Finn 's wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas ' protection introduced him into society -- no , dragged him into it , hurled him into it -- and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 43]: The widow 's servants kept him clean and neat , combed and brushed , and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 70]: He had to eat with a knife and fork ; he had to use napkin , cup , and plate ; he had to learn his book , he had to go to church ; he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth ; whithersoever he turned , the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 16]: He bravely bore his miseries three weeks , and then one day turned up missing .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 13]: For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in great distress .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 20]: The public were profoundly concerned ; they searched high and low , they dragged the river for his body .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 30]: Early the third morning Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind the abandoned slaughter-house , and in one of them he found the refugee .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 32]: Huck had slept there ; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and ends of food , and was lying off , now , in comfort , with his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 30]: He was unkempt , uncombed , and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 21]: Tom routed him out , told him the trouble he had been causing , and urged him to go home .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 14]: Huck 's face lost its tranquil content , and took a melancholy cast .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 12]: He said : `` Do n't talk about it , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 18]: I 've tried it , and it do n't work ; it do n't work , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 13]: It ai n't for me ; I ai n't used to it .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 18]: The widder 's good to me , and friendly ; but I ca n't stand them ways .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 120]: She makes me get up just at the same time every morning ; she makes me wash , they comb me all to thunder ; she wo n't let me sleep in the woodshed ; I got to wear them blamed clothes that just smothers me , Tom ; they do n't seem to any air git through 'em , somehow ; and they 're so rotten nice that I ca n't set down , nor lay down , nor roll around anywher 's ; I hai n't slid on a cellar-door for -- well , it ` pears to be years ; I got to go to church and sweat and sweat -- I hate them ornery sermons !
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 14]: I ca n't ketch a fly in there , I ca n't chaw .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 8]: I got to wear shoes all Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 37]: The widder eats by a bell ; she goes to bed by a bell ; she gits up by a bell -- everything 's so awful reg ` lar a body ca n't stand it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 11]: `` Well , everybody does that way , Huck . ''
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 10]: `` Tom , it do n't make no difference .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 12]: I ai n't everybody , and I ca n't STAND it .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 9]: It 's awful to be tied up so .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 18]: And grub comes too easy -- I do n't take no interest in vittles , that way .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 30]: I got to ask to go a-fishing ; I got to ask to go in a-swimming -- dern 'd if I hai n't got to ask to do everything .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 48]: Well , I 'd got to talk so nice it was n't no comfort -- I 'd got to go up in the attic and rip out awhile , every day , to git a taste in my mouth , or I 'd a died , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 56]: The widder would n't let me smoke ; she would n't let me yell , she would n't let me gape , nor stretch , nor scratch , before folks -- '' -LSB- Then with a spasm of special irritation and injury -RSB- -- `` And dad fetch it , she prayed all the time !
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 7]: I never see such a woman !
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 12]: I HAD to shove , Tom -- I just had to .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 30]: And besides , that school 's going to open , and I 'd a had to go to it -- well , I would n't stand THAT , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 17]: Looky here , Tom , being rich ai n't what it 's cracked up to be .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 21]: It 's just worry and worry , and sweat and sweat , and a-wishing you was dead all the time .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 26]: Now these clothes suits me , and this bar ' l suits me , and I ai n't ever going to shake 'em any more .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 80]: Tom , I would n't ever got into all this trouble if it had n't ` a ' ben for that money ; now you just take my sheer of it along with your ` n , and gim me a ten-center sometimes -- not many times , becuz I do n't give a dern for a thing ` thout it 's tollable hard to git -- and you go and beg off for me with the widder . ''
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 13]: `` Oh , Huck , you know I ca n't do that .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 25]: ` Tai n't fair ; and besides if you 'll try this thing just a while longer you 'll come to like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 4]: `` Like it !
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 20]: Yes -- the way I 'd like a hot stove if I was to set on it long enough .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 21]: No , Tom , I wo n't be rich , and I wo n't live in them cussed smothery houses .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 21]: I like the woods , and the river , and hogsheads , and I 'll stick to 'em , too .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 4]: Blame it all !
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 33]: just as we 'd got guns , and a cave , and all just fixed to rob , here this dern foolishness has got to come up and spile it all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 24]: Tom saw his opportunity -- `` Lookyhere , Huck , being rich ai n't going to keep me back from turning robber . ''
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 14]: Oh , good-licks ; are you in real dead-wood earnest , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 11]: `` Just as dead earnest as I 'm sitting here .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 21]: But Huck , we ca n't let you into the gang if you ai n't respectable , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 6]: Huck 's joy was quenched .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 9]: `` Ca n't let me in , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 11]: Did n't you let me go for a pirate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 8]: `` Yes , but that 's different .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 16]: A robber is more high-toned than what a pirate is -- as a general thing .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 17]: In most countries they 're awful high up in the nobility -- dukes and such . ''
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 14]: `` Now , Tom , hai n't you always ben friendly to me ?
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 12]: You would n't shet me out , would you , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 14]: You would n't do that , now , WOULD you , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 22]: `` Huck , I would n't want to , and I DO N'T want to -- but what would people say ?
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 9]: Why , they 'd say , ` Mph !
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 5]: Tom Sawyer 's Gang !
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 7]: pretty low characters in it ! '
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 7]: They 'd mean you , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 12]: You would n't like that , and I would n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 13]: Huck was silent for some time , engaged in a mental struggle .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 45]: Finally he said : `` Well , I 'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I can come to stand it , if you 'll let me b ` long to the gang , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 11]: `` All right , Huck , it 's a whiz !
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 23]: Come along , old chap , and I 'll ask the widow to let up on you a little , Huck . ''
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 10]: `` Will you , Tom -- now will you ?
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 4]: That 's good .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 26]: If she 'll let up on some of the roughest things , I 'll smoke private and cuss private , and crowd through or bust .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 12]: When you going to start the gang and turn robbers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 6]: `` Oh , right off .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 15]: We 'll get the boys together and have the initiation to-night , maybe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 6]: `` Have the which ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 6]: `` Have the initiation . ''
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 43]: `` It 's to swear to stand by one another , and never tell the gang 's secrets , even if you 're chopped all to flinders , and kill anybody and all his family that hurts one of the gang . ''
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 17]: `` That 's gay -- that 's mighty gay , Tom , I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 8]: `` Well , I bet it is .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 40]: And all that swearing 's got to be done at midnight , in the lonesomest , awfulest place you can find -- a ha ` nted house is the best , but they 're all ripped up now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 12]: `` Well , midnight 's good , anyway , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 7]: `` Yes , so it is .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 17]: And you 've got to swear on a coffin , and sign it with blood . ''
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 8]: `` Now , that 's something LIKE !
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 11]: Why , it 's a million times bullier than pirating .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 50]: I 'll stick to the widder till I rot , Tom ; and if I git to be a reg ` lar ripper of a robber , and everybody talking ` bout it , I reckon she 'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet . ''
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 6]: CONCLUSION SO endeth this chronicle .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 29]: It being strictly a history of a BOY , it must stop here ; the story could not go much further without becoming the history of a MAN .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 38]: When one writes a novel about grown people , he knows exactly where to stop -- that is , with a marriage ; but when he writes of juveniles , he must stop where he best can .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 18]: Most of the characters that perform in this book still live , and are prosperous and happy .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 49]: Some day it may seem worth while to take up the story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they turned out to be ; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that part of their lives at present .
