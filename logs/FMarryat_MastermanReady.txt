Parsing [sent. 1 len. 44]: Masterman Ready - by Captain Marryat Chapter I It was in the month of October , 18 -- , that the Pacific , a large ship , was running before a heavy gale of wind in the middle of the vast Atlantic Ocean .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 130]: She had but little sail , for the wind was so strong , that the canvas would have been split into pieces by the furious blasts before which she was driven through the waves , which were very high , and following her almost as fast as she darted through their boiling waters ; sometimes heaving up her stern and sinking her bows down so deep into the hollow of the sea , that it appeared as if she would have dived down underneath the waves ; but she was a fine vessel , and the captain was a good seaman , who did what he considered best for the safety of his vessel , and then put his trust in that Providence who is ever watchful over us .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 75]: The captain stood before the wheel , watching the men who were steering the ship ; for when you are running before a heavy gale , it requires great attention to the helm : and as he looked around him and up at the heavens , he sang in a low voice the words of a sea song : `` One wide water all around us , All above us one black sky . ''
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 68]: And so it was with them ; -- they were in the middle of the Atlantic , not another vessel to be seen , and the heavens were covered with black clouds , which were borne along furiously by the gale ; the sea ran mountains high , and broke into large white foaming crests , while the fierce wind howled through the rigging of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 62]: Besides the captain of the ship and the two men at the wheel , there were two other personages on deck : one was a young lad about twelve years old , and the other a weather-beaten old seaman , whose grisly locks were streaming in the wind , as he paced aft and looked over the taffrail of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 42]: The young lad , observing a heavy sea coming up to the stern of the vessel , caught hold of the old man 's arm , crying out - `` Wo n't that great wave come into us , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 23]: `` No , Master William , it will not : do n't you see how the ship lifts her quarters to it ?
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 9]: -- and now it has passed underneath us .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 26]: But it might happen , and then what would become of you , if I did not hold on , and hold you on also ?
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 7]: You would be washed overboard . ''
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 25]: `` I do n't like the sea much , Ready ; I wish we were safe on shore again , '' replied the lad .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 19]: `` Do n't the waves look as if they wished to beat the ship all to pieces ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 52]: `` Yes , they do ; and they roar as if angry because they can not bury the vessel beneath them : but I am used to them , and with a good ship like this , and a good captain and crew , I do n't care for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 14]: `` But sometimes ships do sink , and then everybody is drowned . ''
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 19]: `` Yes ; and very often the very ships sink which those on board think are most safe .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 20]: We can only do our best , and after that we must submit to the will of Heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 15]: `` What little birds are those flying about so close to the water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 8]: `` Those are Mother Carey 's chickens .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 18]: You seldom see them except in a storm , or when a storm is coming on . ''
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 11]: The birds which William referred to were the stormy petrels .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 14]: `` Were you ever shipwrecked on a desolate island like Robinson Crusoe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 19]: `` Yes , Master William , I have been shipwrecked ; but I never heard of Robinson Crusoe .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 48]: So many have been wrecked and undergone great hardships , and so many more have never lived to tell what they have suffered , that it 's not very likely that I should have known that one man you speak of , out of so many . ''
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 12]: but it 's all in a book which I have read .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 41]: I could tell you all about it -- and so I will when the ship is quiet again ; but now I wish you would help me down below , for I promised mamma not to stay up long . ''
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 68]: `` Then always keep your promise like a good lad , '' replied the old man ; `` now give me your hand , and I 'll answer for it that we will fetch the hatchway without a tumble ; and when the weather is fine again , I 'll tell you how I was wrecked , and you shall tell me all about Robinson Crusoe . ''
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 23]: Having seen William safe to the cabin door , the old seaman returned to the deck , for it was his watch .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 39]: Masterman Ready , for such was his name , had been more than fifty years at sea , having been bound apprentice to a collier which sailed from South Shields , when he was only ten years old .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 27]: His face was browned from long exposure , and there were deep furrows on his cheeks , but he was still a hale and active man .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 46]: He had served many years on board of a man-of-war , and had been in every climate : he had many strange stories to tell , and he might be believed even when his stories were strange , for he would not tell an untruth .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 17]: He could navigate a vessel , and , of course , he could read and write .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 43]: The name of Ready was very well suited to him , for he was seldom at a loss ; and in cases of difficulty and danger , the captain would not hesitate to ask his opinion , and frequently take his advice .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 8]: He was second mate of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 25]: The Pacific was , as we have observed , a very fine ship , and well able to contend with the most violent storm .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 36]: She was of more than four hundred tons burthen , and was then making a passage out to New South Wales , with a valuable cargo of English hardware , cutlery , and other manufactures .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 45]: The captain was a good navigator and seaman , and moreover a good man , of a cheerful , happy disposition , always making the best of everything , and when accidents did happen , always more inclined to laugh than to look grave .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 5]: His name was Osborn .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 40]: The first mate , whose name was Mackintosh , was a Scotsman , rough and ill-tempered , but paying strict attention to his duty - a man that Captain Osborn could trust , but whom he did not like .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 93]: Ready we have already spoken of , and it will not be necessary to say anything about the seamen on board , except that there were thirteen of them , hardly a sufficient number to man so large a vessel ; but just as they were about to sail , five of the seamen , who did not like the treatment they had received from Mackintosh , the first mate , had left the ship , and Captain Osborn did not choose to wait until he could obtain others in their stead .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 15]: This proved unfortunate , as the events which we shall hereafter relate will show .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 83]: Chapter II Master William , whom we have introduced to the reader , was the eldest boy of a family who were passengers on board , consisting of the father , mother , and four children : his father was a Mr. Seagrave , a very well-informed , clever man , who having for many years held an office under government at Sydney , the capital of New South Wales , was now returning from a leave of absence of three years .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 40]: He had purchased from the government several thousand acres of land ; it had since risen very much in value , and the sheep and cattle which he had put on it were proving a source of great profit .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 71]: His property had been well managed by the person who had charge of it during his absence in England , and he was now taking out with him a variety of articles of every description for its improvement , and for his own use , such as furniture for his house , implements of agriculture , seeds , plants , cattle , and many other things too numerous to mention .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 14]: Mrs. Seagrave was an amiable woman , but not in very strong health .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 110]: The family consisted of William , who was the eldest , a clever , steady boy , but , at the same time , full of mirth and humour ; Thomas , who was six years old , a very thoughtless but good-tempered boy , full of mischief , and always in a scrape ; Caroline , a little girl of seven years ; and Albert , a fine strong little fellow , who was not one year old : he was under the charge of a black girl , who had come from the Cape of Good Hope to Sydney , and had followed Mrs. Seagrave to England .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 48]: We have now mentioned all the people on board of the Pacific : perhaps we ought not to forget two shepherd 's dogs , belonging to Mr. Seagrave , and a little terrier , which was a great favourite of Captain Osborn , to whom she belonged .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 27]: It was not until the fourth day from its commencement that the gale abated , and then it gradually subsided until it was nearly a calm .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 68]: The men who had been watching night after night during the gale now brought all their clothes which had been drenched by the rain and spray , and hung them up in the rigging to dry : the sails , also , which had been furled , and had been saturated by the wet , were now loosened and spread out that they might not be mildewed .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 31]: The wind blew mild and soft , the sea had gone down , and the ship was running through the water at the speed of about four miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 58]: Mrs. Seagrave , wrapped up in a cloak , was seated upon one of the arm-chests near the stern of the ship , her husband and children were all with her enjoying the fine weather , when Captain Osborn , who had been taking an observation of the sun with his sextant , came up to them .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 17]: `` Well , Master Tommy , you are very glad that the gale is over ? ''
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 18]: `` I did n't care , '' replied Tommy , `` only I spilt all my soup .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 22]: But Juno tumbled off her chair , and rolled away with the baby , till papa picked them both up . ''
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 17]: `` It was a mercy that poor Albert was not killed , '' observed Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 28]: `` And so he might have been , if Juno had not thought only of him and nothing at all about herself , '' replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 13]: `` That 's very true , sir , '' replied Captain Osborn .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 15]: `` She saved the child , and , I fear , hurt herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 14]: `` I thump my head very hard , '' said Juno , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 25]: `` Yes , and it 's lucky that you have a good thick woolly coat over it , '' replied Captain Osborn , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 23]: `` It is 12 o'clock by the sun , sir , '' said Mackintosh , the first mate , to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 26]: `` Then bring me up the latitude , Mr. Mackintosh , while I work out the longitude from the sights which I took this morning .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 22]: In five minutes , Mr. Seagrave , I shall be ready to prick off over our place on the chart . ''
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 30]: `` Here are the dogs come up on deck , '' said William ; `` I dare say they are as glad of the fine weather as we are .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 5]: Come here , Romulus !
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 4]: Here , Remus !
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 4]: - Remus ! ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 31]: `` Well , sir , '' said Ready , who was standing by them with his quadrant in his hand , `` I should like to ask you a question .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 15]: Those dogs of yours have two very odd names which I never heard before .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 7]: Who were Romulus and Remus ? ''
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 43]: `` Romulus and Remus , '' replied Mr. Seagrave , `` were the names of two shepherds , brothers , who in ancient days founded the city of Rome , which eventually became the largest and most celebrated empire in the world .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 12]: They were the first kings of Rome , and reigned together .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 41]: History says that Remus affronted Romulus by leaping over a wall he had raised , and Romulus , in his anger , took away his life ; but the history of early days is not to be depended upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 32]: `` No , nor the brothers either , it appears , '' replied Ready ; `` however , it is the old story - two of a trade can never agree .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 14]: One sometimes hears of Rome now - is that the same place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' replied William , `` it is the remains of the old city . ''
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 12]: `` Well , one lives and learns , '' said Ready .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 25]: `` I have learnt something to-day , which everyone will to the last day of his life , if he will only ask questions .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 54]: I 'm an old man , and perhaps do n't know much , except in the seafaring way ; but I should have known much less if I did not ask for information , and was not ashamed to acknowledge my ignorance ; that 's the way to learn , Master William . ''
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 41]: `` Very good advice , Ready , - and , William , I hope you will profit by it , '' said Mr. Seagrave ; `` never be ashamed to ask the meaning of what you do not understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 7]: `` I always do , papa .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 10]: Do I not ask you questions , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 33]: `` Yes , you do , and very clever questions for a boy of your age ; and I only wish that I could answer them better than I can sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 28]: `` I should like to go down now , my dear , '' said Mrs. Seagrave ; `` perhaps Ready will see the baby down safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 40]: `` That I will , ma'am , '' said Ready , putting his quadrant on the capstan : `` now , Juno , give me the child , and go down first ; - backwards , you stupid girl !
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 8]: how often do I tell you that ?
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 13]: Some day or another you will come down with a run . ''
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 10]: `` And break my head , '' said Juno .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 18]: `` Yes , or break your arm ; and then who is to hold the child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 43]: As soon as they were all down in the cabin , the captain and Mr. Seagrave marked the position of the vessel on the chart , and found that they were one hundred and thirty miles from the Cape of Good Hope .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 20]: `` If the wind holds , we shall be in to-morrow , '' said Mr. Seagrave to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 13]: `` Juno , perhaps you may see your father and mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 17]: Poor Juno shook her head , and a tear or two stole down her dark cheek .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 50]: With a mournful face she told them , that her father and mother belonged to a Dutch boor , who had gone with them many miles into the interior : she had been parted from them when quite a little child , and had been left at Cape Town .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 17]: Chapter III The next morning the Pacific arrived at the Cape and anchored in Table Bay .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 12]: `` Why do they call this Table Bay , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 3]: said William .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 30]: `` I suppose it 's because they call that great mountain the Table Mountain , Master William ; you see how flat the mountain is on the top . ''
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 13]: `` Yes , it is quite as flat as a table . ''
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 42]: `` Yes , and sometimes you will see the white clouds rolling down over the top of it in a very curious manner , and that the sailors call spreading the tablecloth : it is a sign of bad weather . ''
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 30]: `` Then I hope they will not spread the tablecloth while we are here , Ready , '' said William , `` for I shall certainly have no appetite .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 16]: We have had bad weather enough already , and mamma suffers so much from it .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 8]: What a pretty place it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 32]: `` We shall remain here two days , sir , '' said Captain Osborn to Mr. Seagrave , `` if you and Mrs. Seagrave would like to go on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 25]: `` I will go down and ask Mrs. Seagrave , '' said her husband , who went down the ladder , followed by William .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 77]: Upon the question being put to Mrs. Seagrave , she replied that she was quite satisfied with the ship having no motion , and did not feel herself equal to going on shore ; it was therefore decided that she should remain on board with the two younger children , and that , on the following day , Mr. Seagrave should take William and Tommy to see Cape Town , and return on board before night .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 31]: The next morning , Captain Osborn lowered down one of the large boats , and Mr. Seagrave , accompanied by Captain Osborn , went on shore with William and Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 29]: Tommy had promised his mamma to be very good ; but that he always did , and almost always forgot his promise directly he was out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 22]: As soon as they landed , they went up to a gentleman 's house , with whom Captain Osborn was acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 58]: They stayed for a few minutes to drink a glass of lemonade , for it was very warm ; and then it was proposed that they should go to the Company 's Gardens and see the wild beasts which were confined there , at which William was much delighted , and Tommy clapped his hands with joy .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 11]: `` What are the Company 's Gardens , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 3]: inquired William .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 25]: `` They were made by the Dutch East India Company , at the time that the Cape of Good Hope was in their possession .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 23]: They are , properly speaking , Botanical Gardens ; but , at the same time , the wild animals are kept there .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 29]: Formerly there were a great many , but they have not been paid attention to lately , for we have plenty of these animals in England now . ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 7]: `` What shall we see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 3]: said Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 22]: `` You will see lions , Tommy , a great many in a large den together , '' said Captain Osborn .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 8]: I want to see a lion . ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 12]: `` You must not go too near them , recollect . ''
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 11]: `` No , I wo n't , '' said Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 40]: As soon as they entered the gates , Tommy escaped from Captain Osborn , and ran away in his hurry to see the lions ; but Captain Osborn caught him again , and held him fast by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 89]: `` Here is a pair of very strange birds , '' said the gentleman who accompanied them ; `` they are called Secretaries , on account of the feathers which hang behind their heads , as the feather of a pen does when a clerk puts it behind his ear : but they are very useful , for they are snake-killers ; indeed , they would , if they could , live altogether upon snakes , which they are very great enemies to , never letting one escape .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 18]: They strike them with their feet , and with such force as to kill them immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 10]: `` Are there many snakes in this country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 3]: inquired William .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 25]: `` Yes , and very venomous snakes , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` so that these birds are very useful in destroying them .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 67]: You observe , William , that the Almighty , in his wisdom , has so arranged it that no animal -LRB- especially of a noxious kind -RRB- shall be multiplied to excess , but kept under by being preyed upon by some other ; indeed , wherever in any country an animal exists in any quantity , there is generally found another animal which destroys it .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 28]: The Secretary inhabits this country where snakes exist in numbers , that it may destroy them : in England the bird would be of little value . ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 28]: `` But some animals are too large or too fierce to be destroyed by others , papa ; for instance , the elephant and the lion . ''
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 24]: `` Very true ; but these larger animals do not breed so fast , and therefore their numbers do not increase so rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 55]: For instance , a pair of elephants will not have more than one young one in the space of two years or more ; while the rabbits , which are preyed upon and the food of so many other beasts as well as birds , would increase enormously , if they were not destroyed .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 52]: Examine through the whole of creation , and you will find that there is an unerring hand , which invariably preserves the balance exact ; and that there are no more mouths than for which food is provided , although accidental circumstances may for a time occasion a slight alteration . ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 14]: They continued their walk until they came to the den of the lions .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 37]: It was a large place , in closed with a strong and high wall of stone , with only one window to it for the visitors to look at them , as it was open above .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 48]: This window was wide , and with strong iron bars running from the top to the bottom ; but the width between the bars was such that a lion could put his paw out with ease ; and they were therefore cautioned not to go too near .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 43]: It was a fine sight to see eight or ten of these noble-looking animals lying down in various attitudes , quite indifferent apparently to the people outside -- basking in the sun , and slowly moving their tufted tails to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 42]: William examined them at a respectful distance from the bars ; and so did Tommy , who had his mouth open with astonishment , in which there was at first not a little fear mixed , but he soon got bolder .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 32]: The gentleman who had accompanied them , and who had been long at the Cape , was relating to Mr. Seagrave and Captain Osborn some very curious anecdotes about the lion .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 25]: William and they were so interested , that they did not perceive that Tommy had slipped back to the grated window of the den .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 97]: Tommy looked at the lions , and then he wanted to make them move about : there was one fine full-grown young lion , about three years old , who was lying down nearest to the window ; and Tommy took up a stone and threw it at him : the lion appeared not to notice it , for he did not move , although he fixed his eyes upon Tommy ; so Tommy became more brave , and threw another , and then another , approaching each time nearer to the bars of the window .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 42]: All of a sudden the lion gave a tremendous roar , and sprang at Tommy , bounding against the iron bars of the cage with such force that , had they not been very strong , it must have broken them .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 18]: As it was , they shook and rattled so that pieces of mortar fell from the stones .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 27]: Tommy shrieked ; and , fortunately for himself , fell back and tumbled head over heels , or the lion 's paws would have reached him .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 48]: Captain Osborn and Mr. Seagrave ran up to Tommy , and picked him up : he roared with fright as soon as he could fetch his breath , while the lion stood at the bars , lashing his tail , snarling , and showing his enormous fangs .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 13]: `` Take me away -- take me on board the ship ! ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 8]: cried Tommy , who was terribly frightened .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 9]: `` What did you do , Tommy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 4]: said Captain Osborn .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 18]: `` I wo n't throw any more stones , Mr. Lion ; I wo n't indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 9]: cried Tommy , looking terrified towards the animal .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 37]: Mr. Seagrave scolded Tommy well for his foolish conduct , and by degrees he became more composed ; but he did not recover himself until they had walked some distance away from the lion 's den .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 25]: They then looked at the other animals which were to be seen , Tommy keeping a most respectful distance from every one of them .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 15]: He would n't even go near to a Cape sheep with a broad tail .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 27]: When they had seen everything , they went back to the gentleman 's house to dinner ; and , after dinner , they returned on board .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 54]: Chapter IV The following morning the fresh water and provisions were received on board , and once more the Pacific stretched her broad canvas to the winds , and there was every prospect of a rapid voyage , as for many days she continued her passage with a fair wind and flowing sheet .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 90]: But this did not continue : it fell calm , and remained so for nearly three days , during which not a breath of wind was to be seen on the wide expanse of water ; all nature appeared as if in repose , except that now and then an albatross would drop down at some distance from the stern of the vessel , and , as he swam lazily along with his wings half-furled , pick up the fragments of food which had been thrown over the side .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 10]: `` What great bird is that , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 3]: inquired William .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 12]: `` It is an albatross , the largest sea-bird we have .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 6]: Their wings are very long .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 33]: I have seen them shot , and they have measured eleven feet from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other when the wings have been spread out . ''
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 15]: `` It is the first one that I have seen , '' said William .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 34]: `` Because you seldom meet them north of the Cape , sir : people do say that they go to sleep on the wing , balancing themselves high up in the air . ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 30]: `` Papa , '' said William , turning to Mr. Seagrave , who stood by , `` why is it that one bird can swim and another can not ?
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 35]: You recollect when Tommy drove the hens into the large pond , they flounced about , and their feathers became wet , and would support them no longer , and then they were drowned .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 16]: Now , how does a sea-bird contrive to remain so long on the water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 34]: `` Because a sea-bird , William , is provided with a sort of oil on purpose to anoint the outside of its feathers , and this oil prevents the water from penetrating them .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 15]: Have you not observed the ducks on shore dressing their feathers with their bills ?
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 13]: They were then using this oil to make their feathers waterproof . ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 5]: `` How odd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 45]: `` Do n't say how odd , William ; that is not an expression to use when we talk of the wonderful provisions made by the Almighty hand , who neglects not the meanest of his creatures - say rather , how wonderful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 41]: `` That 's very true , sir , '' observed Ready ; `` but still you must not be too hard upon Master William , for I have heard many a grownup man make use of the same expression . ''
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 42]: On the third day of the calm , the barometer fell so low as to induce Captain Osborn to believe that they should have a severe gale , and every preparation was made to meet it , should it come on .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 65]: Nor was he mistaken : towards midnight the clouds gathered up fast , and as they gathered up in thick piles , heaped one over the other , the lightning darted through them in every direction ; and as the clouds rose up , so did the wind , but at first only in heavy gusts , and then lulling again to a calm .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 20]: `` Ready , '' said Captain Osborn , `` how do you think we shall have the wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 25]: `` Why , Captain Osborn , to tell you the truth , I do n't think it will be steady to one point long .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 30]: It may at first blow hard from the north , but it 's my idea it will shift soon to some other quarter , and blow still harder . ''
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 8]: `` What think you , Mackintosh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 31]: `` We 'll have plenty of it , and a long steady gale , that 's my notion ; and the sooner we ship the dead lights the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 31]: Mr. Seagrave , with William , happened to be standing by at the time of this conversation , and at the term dead lights Willie 's face expressed some anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 57]: Ready perceived it , and said -- `` That 's a foolish name they give to the shutters which go over the cabin windows to prevent the water from breaking into the cabin when a vessel sails before the wind ; you know we had them on the last time that we had a gale . ''
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 25]: `` But , Ready , '' said Captain Osborn , `` why do you think that we shall have a shift of wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 56]: `` Well , I do n't know ; perhaps I was wrong , '' replied the old man , `` and Mr. Mackintosh is right : the wind does seem to come steady from the north-east , that 's certain ; '' and Ready walked away to the binnacle , and looked at the compass .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 18]: Mr. Seagrave and William then went below , and Mr. Mackintosh went forward to give his orders .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 91]: As soon as they were all gone , Ready went up again to Captain Osborn and said : `` Captain Osborn , it 's not for me to contradict Mr. Mackintosh , but that 's of little consequence in a time like this : I should have held to my opinion , had it not been that the gentleman passenger and his son were standing by , but now , as the coast is clear , I tell you that we shall have something worse than a gale of wind .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 19]: I have been in these latitudes before , and I am an old seaman , as you know .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 70]: There 's something in the air , and there has been something during the last three days of calm , which reminds me too well of what I have seen here before ; and I am sure that we shall have little better than a hurricane , as far as wind goes - and worse in one point , that it will last much longer than hurricanes generally do .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 26]: I have been watching , and even the birds tell me so , and they are told by their nature , which is never mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 31]: That calm has been nothing more than a repose of the winds previous to their being roused up to do their worst ; and that is my real opinion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 36]: `` Well , and I 'm inclined to agree with you , Ready ; so we must send topgallant yards down on deck , and all the small sails and lumber out of the tops .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 13]: Get the trysail aft and bent , and lower down the gaff .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 6]: I will go forward . ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 18]: Their preparations were hardly complete before the wind had settled to a fierce gale from the north-east .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 35]: The sea rose rapidly ; topsail after topsail was furled ; and by dusk the Pacific was flying through the water with the wind on her quarter , under reefed foresail and storm staysail .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 31]: It was with difficulty that three men at the wheel could keep the helm , such were the blows which the vessel received from the heavy seas on the quarter .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 31]: Not one seaman in the ship took advantage of his watch below to go to sleep that night , careless as they generally are ; the storm was too dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 66]: About three o'clock in the morning the wind suddenly subsided ; it was but for a minute or two , and then it again burst on the vessel from another quarter of the compass , as Ready had foretold , splitting the foresail into fragments , which lashed and flogged the wind till they were torn away by it , and carried far to leeward .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 25]: The heavens above were of a pitchy darkness , and the only light was from the creaming foam of the sea on every side .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 88]: The shift of wind , which had been to the west-north-west , compelled them to alter the course of the vessel , for they had no chance but to scud , as they now did , under bare poles ; but in consequence of the sea having taken its run from the former wind , which had been north-east , it was , as sailors call it , cross , and every minute the waves poured over the ship , sweeping all before their weight of waters .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 19]: One poor man was washed overboard , and any attempt made to save him would have been unavailing .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 34]: Captain Osborn was standing by the weather gunnel , holding on by one of the belaying-pins , when he said to Mackintosh : `` How long will this last , think you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 13]: `` Longer than the ship will , '' replied the mate gravely .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 19]: `` I should hope not , '' replied the captain ; `` still it can not look worse .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 8]: What do you think , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 42]: `` Far more fear from above than from below just now , '' replied Ready , pointing to the yard-arms of the ship , to each of which were little balls of electric matter attached , flaring out to a point .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 73]: `` Look at those two clouds , sir , rushing at each other ; if I -- '' Ready had not time to finish what he would have said , before a blaze of light , so dazzling that it left them all in utter darkness for some seconds afterwards , burst upon their vision , accompanied with a peal of thunder , at which the whole vessel trembled fore and aft .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 87]: A crash - a rushing forward - and a shriek were heard , and when they had recovered their eyesight , the foremast had been rent by the lightning as if it had been a lath , and the ship was in flames : the men at the wheel , blinded by the lightning , as well as appalled , could not steer ; the ship broached to - away went the mainmast over the side - and all was wreck , confusion , and dismay .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 60]: Fortunately the heavy seas which poured over the forecastle soon extinguished the flames , or they all must have perished ; but the ship lay now helpless , and at the mercy of the waves beating violently against the wrecks of the masts which floated to leeward , but were still held fast to the vessel by their rigging .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 57]: As soon as they could recover from the shock , Ready and the first mate hastened to the wheel to try to get the ship before the wind ; but this they could not do , as , the foremast and mainmast being gone , the mizenmast prevented her paying off and answering to the helm .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 81]: Ready , having persuaded two of the men to take the helm , made a sign to Mackintosh -LRB- for now the wind was so loud that they could not hear each other speak -RRB- , and , going aft , they obtained axes , and cut away the mizen-rigging ; the mizen-topmast and head of the mizenmast went over the side , and then the stump of the foremast was sufficient to get the ship before the wind again .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 65]: Still there was much delay and confusion , before they could clear away the wreck of the masts ; and , as soon as they could make inquiry , they found that four of the men had been killed by the lightning and the fall of the foremast , and there were now but eight remaining , besides Captain Osborn and his two mates .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 23]: Chapter V Sailors are never discouraged by danger as long as they have any chance of relieving themselves by their own exertions .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 61]: The loss of their shipmates , so instantaneously summoned away , - the wrecked state of the vessel , - the wild surges burying them beneath their angry waters , - the howling of the wind , the dazzling of the lightning , and the pealing of the thunder , did not prevent them from doing what their necessity demanded .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 61]: Mackintosh , the first mate , rallied the men , and contrived to fix a block and strap to the still smoking stump of the foremast ; a rope was rove through the block , and the main-topgallant sail hoisted , so that the vessel might run faster before the gale , and answer her helm better than she did .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 24]: The ship was again before the wind , and comparatively safe , notwithstanding the heavy blows she now received from the pursuing waves .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 22]: Night again came on , but there was no repose , and the men were worn out with exposure and fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 106]: The third day of the gale dawned , but the appearances were as alarming as ever : the continual breaking of the seas over the stern had washed away the binnacles , and it was impossible now to be certain of the course the ship had been steered , or the distance which had been run ; the leaky state of the vessel proved how much she had already suffered from the violent shocks which she had received , and the certainty was apparent , that if the weather did not abate , she could not possibly withstand the force of the waves much longer .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 82]: The countenance of Captain Osborn showed great anxiety : he had a heavy responsibility on his shoulders - he might lose a valuable ship , and still more valuable cargo , even if they did not all lose their lives ; for they were now approaching where the sea was studded with low coral islands , upon which they might be thrown by the waves and wind , without having the slightest power to prevent it in their present disabled condition .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 34]: Ready was standing by him when Captain Osborn said -- `` I do n't much like this , Ready ; we are now running on danger and have no help for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 33]: `` That 's true enough , '' replied Ready : `` we have no help for it ; it is God 's will , sir , and His will be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 4]: `` Amen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 40]: replied Captain Osborn solemnly ; and then he continued , after a pause , `` There were many captains who envied me when I obtained command of this fine ship , - would they change with me now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 21]: `` I should rather think not , Captain Osborn , but you never know what the day may bring forth .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 27]: You sailed with this vessel , full of hope - you now , not without reason , feel something approaching to despair ; but who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 39]: it may please the Almighty to rebuke those angry winds and waves , and to-morrow we may again hope for the best ; at all events you have done your duty - no man can do more . ''
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 25]: `` You are right , '' replied Captain Osborn ; `` but hold hard , Ready , that sea 's aboard of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 47]: Ready had just time to cling with both hands to the belaying-pins when the sea poured over the vessel , with a volume of water which for some time swept them off their legs : they clung on firmly , and at last recovered their feet .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 19]: `` She started a timber or two with that blow , I rather think , '' said Ready .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 47]: `` I 'm afraid so ; the best vessel ever built could not stand such shocks long , '' replied Captain Osborn ; `` and at present , with our weak crew , I do not see that we can get more sail upon her . ''
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 12]: All that night the ship flew in darkness before the gale .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 40]: At daybreak the wind abated , and the sea went down : the ship was , however , still kept before the wind , for she had suffered too much to venture to put her broadside to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 37]: Preparations were now made for getting up jury-masts ; and the worn-out seamen were busily employed , under the direction of Captain Osborn and his two mates , when Mr. Seagrave and William came upon deck .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 41]: William stared about him : he perceived , to his astonishment , that the tall masts , with all their rigging and sails , had disappeared , and that the whole deck was in a state of confusion and disorder .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 20]: `` See , my child , '' said Mr. Seagrave , `` the wreck and devastation which are here .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 17]: See how the pride of man is humbled before the elements of the great Jehovah . ''
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 21]: `` Ay , Master Willy , '' said old Ready , `` look around you , as you well may .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 9]: Do you remember the verses in the Bible ?
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 60]: - if not , I remember them well , for I have often read them , and have often felt the truth of them : ` They that go down to the sea in ships , that do business in great waters , these see the works of the Lord , and his wonders in the deep ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 27]: `` But , father , '' said Willy , after a pause , `` how shall we ever get to Sydney without masts or sails ? ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 43]: `` Why , William , '' replied Ready , `` we must do what we can : we sailors are never much at a loss , and I dare say before night you will find us under some sort of sail again .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 44]: We have lost our great masts , so we must put up jury-masts , as we call them ; that is , little ones , and little sails upon them ; and , if it pleases God , we shall see Sydney yet .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 7]: How is Madam , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 6]: continued Ready to Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 6]: `` Is she better ? ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 26]: `` I fear she is very weak and ill , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` nothing but fine weather will do her any good .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 11]: Do you think that it will be fine now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 55]: `` Why , sir , to tell you the truth , I fear we shall have more of it yet : I have not given my thoughts to the captain , as I might be mistaken ; but still I think so - I 've not been fifty years at sea without learning something .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 37]: I do n't like the gathering of that bank there , Mr. Seagrave , and I should n't wonder if it were to blow again from the very same quarter , and that before dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 31]: `` God 's will be done , '' replied Mr. Seagrave , `` but I am very fearful about my poor wife , who is worn to a shadow . ''
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 28]: `` I should n't think so much about that , sir , as I really never knew of people dying that way , although they suffer much .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 20]: William , do you know that we have lost some of our men since you were down below ? ''
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 15]: `` No - I heard the steward say something outside about the foremast . ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 38]: `` We have lost five of our smartest and best men - Wilson was washed overboard , Fennings and Masters struck dead with the lightning , and Jones and Emery crushed by the fall of the foremast .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 44]: You are young , Master Willy , but you can not think too early of your Maker , or call to mind what they say in the burial service , - ` In the midst of life we are in death ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 33]: `` Thank you , Ready , for the lesson you have given my son , '' said Mr. Seagrave ; `` and , William , treasure it up in your memory . ''
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 58]: `` Yes , William , they are the words of an old man who has seen many and many a one who was full of youth and spirits called away before him , and who is grateful to God that he has been pleased to preserve his life , and allow him to amend his ways . ''
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 31]: `` I have been thinking , '' said Mr. Seagrave , after a silence of a minute or two , `` that a sailor has no right to marry . ''
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 46]: `` I 've always thought so , sir , '' replied Ready ; `` and I dare say many a poor deserted sailor 's wife , when she has listened to the wind and rain in her lonely bed , has thought the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 31]: `` With my permission , '' continued Mr. Seagrave , `` my boys shall never go to sea if there is any other profession to be found for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 87]: `` Well , Mr. Seagrave , they do say that it 's no use baulking a lad if he wishes to go to sea , and that if he is determined , he must go : now I think otherwise - I think a parent has a right to say no , if he pleases , upon that point ; for you see , sir , a lad , at the early age at which he goes to sea , does not know his own mind .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 65]: Every high-spirited boy wishes to go to sea - it 's quite natural ; but if the most of them were to speak the truth , it is not that they so much want to go to sea , as that they want to go from school or from home , where they are under the control of their masters or their parents . ''
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 21]: `` Very true , Ready ; they wish to be , as they consider they will be , independent . ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 12]: `` And a pretty mistake they make of it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 60]: Why , there is not a greater slave in the world than a boy who goes to sea , for the first few years after his shipping : for once they are corrected on shore , they are punished ten times at sea , and they never again meet with the love and affection they have left behind them .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 48]: It is a hard life , and there have been but few who have not bitterly repented it , and who would not have returned , like the prodigal son , and cast themselves at their fathers ' feet , only that they have been ashamed . ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 45]: `` That 's the truth , Ready , and it is on that account that I consider that a parent is justified in refusing his consent to his son going to sea , if he can properly provide for him in any other profession .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 56]: There never will be any want of sailors , for there always will be plenty of poor lads whose friends can do no better for them ; and in that case the seafaring life is a good one to choose , as it requires no other capital for their advancement than activity and courage . ''
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 37]: Chapter VI Mr. Seagrave and William went down below into the cabin , where they found that there was plenty of employment ; the steward had brought a basin of very hot pea-soup for the children .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 78]: Tommy , who was sitting up in the bed-place with his sister , had snatched it out of Juno 's left hand , for she held the baby with the other , and in so doing , had thrown it over Caroline , who was screaming , while Juno , in her hurry to assist Caroline , had slipped down on the deck with the baby , who was also crying with fright , although not hurt .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 59]: Unfortunately , Juno had fallen down upon Vixen the terrier , who in return had bitten her in the leg , which had made Juno also cry out ; while Mrs. Seagrave was hanging her head out of her standing bed-place , frightened out of her wits at the accident , but unable to be of any assistance .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 42]: Fortunately , Mr. Seagrave came down just in time to pick up Juno and the baby , and then tried to comfort little Caroline , who after all was not much scalded , as the soup had had time to cool .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 17]: `` Massa Tommy is a very naughty boy , '' cried Juno , rubbing her leg .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 28]: Master Tommy thought it better to say nothing - he was duly admonished - the steward cleaned up the mess , and order was at length restored .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 58]: In the meantime , they were not idle upon deck ; the carpenter was busy fixing a step for one of the spare topmasts instead of a mainmast , and the men were fitting the rigging ; the ship unfortunately had sprung a leak , and four hands at the pumps interfered very much with their task .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 41]: As Ready had prophesied , before night the gale blew , the sea rose again with the gale , and the leaking of the vessel increased so much , that all other labour was suspended for that at the pump .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 69]: For two more days did the storm continue , during which time the crew were worn out with fatigue - they could pump no longer : the ship , as she rolled , proved that she had a great deal of water in her hold - when , melancholy as were their prospects already , a new disaster took place , which was attended with most serious results .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 49]: Captain Osborn was on the forecastle giving some orders to the men , when the strap of the block which hoisted up the main-topgallant yard on the stump of the foremast gave way , the yard and sail came down on the deck , and struck him senseless .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 67]: As long as Captain Osborn commanded them , the sailors had so high an opinion of his abilities as a seaman , and were so encouraged by his cheerful disposition , that they performed their work well and cheerfully ; but now that he was , if not killed , at all events senseless and incapable of action , they no longer felt themselves under control .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 19]: Mackintosh was too much disliked by the seamen to allow his words to have any weight with them .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 16]: They were regardless of his injunctions or requests , and they now consulted among themselves .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 30]: `` The gale is broke , my men , and we shall have fine weather now , '' observed Ready , going up to the sailors on the forecastle .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 9]: `` The wind is going down fast . ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 26]: `` Yes , '' replied one of the men , `` and the ship is going down fast , that 's quite as certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 18]: `` A good spell at the pumps would do us some good now , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 9]: `` What d'ye say , my lads ? ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 17]: `` A glass of grog or two would do us more , '' replied the seaman .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 8]: `` What d'ye say , my boys ?
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 20]: I do n't think that the captain would refuse us , poor fellow , if he could speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 12]: `` What do you mean to do , my lads ? ''
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 12]: inquired Mackintosh : `` not get drunk , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 15]: observed another of the men ; `` the ship must go down soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 53]: `` Perhaps she may - I will not deny it , '' said Mackintosh ; `` but that is no reason why we should not be saved : now , if you get drunk , there is no chance of any one being saved , and my life is precious to me .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 40]: I 'm ready to join with you in anything you please , and you may decide what is to be done ; but get drunk you shall not , if I can help it , that 's certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 9]: `` And how can you help it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 8]: replied one of the seamen , surlily .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 47]: `` Because two resolute men can do a great deal - I may say three , for in this instance Ready will be of my side , and I can call to my assistance the cabin passenger - recollect the firearms are all in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 6]: But why should we quarrel ?
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 29]: - Say at once what you intend to do ; and if you have not made up your minds , will you listen to what I propose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 24]: As Mackintosh 's courage and determination were well known , the seamen again consulted together , and then asked him what he proposed .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 47]: `` We have one good boat left , the new yawl at the booms : the others , as you know , are washed away , with the exception of the little boat astern , which is useless , as she is knocked almost to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 22]: Now we can not be very far from some of the islands , indeed I think we are among them now .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 39]: Let us fit out the boat with everything we require , go about our work steadily and quietly , drink as much grog as will not hurt us , and take a good provision of it with us .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 26]: The boat is complete with her masts , sails , and oars ; and it 's very hard if we do not save ourselves somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 11]: Ready , do I give good advice or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 25]: `` You give very good advice , Mackintosh - only what is to become of the cabin passengers , the women , and children ?
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 10]: and are you going to leave poor Captain Osborn ?
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 9]: or what do you mean to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 15]: `` We wo n't leave the captain , '' said one of the seamen .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 6]: `` No - no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 4]: exclaimed the others .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 6]: `` And the passengers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 27]: `` Very sorry for them , '' replied the former spokesman ; `` but we shall have enough to do to save our own lives . ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 15]: `` Well , my lads , I agree with you , '' said Mackintosh .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 6]: `` Charity begins at home .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 12]: What do you say I - shall it be so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 21]: `` Yes , '' replied the seamen , unanimously ; and Ready knew that it was in vain to expostulate .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 14]: They now set about preparing the boat , and providing for their wants .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 90]: Biscuits , salt pork , two or three small casks of water , and a barrel of rum were collected at the gangway ; Mackintosh brought up his quadrant and a compass , some muskets , powder and shot ; the carpenter , with the assistance of another man , cut away the ship 's bulwarks down to the gunnel , so as to enable them to launch the boat overboard , for they could not , of course , hoist her out now that the masts were gone .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 7]: In an hour everything was prepared .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 32]: A long rope was made fast to the boat , which was brought to the gunnel ready for launching overboard , and the ship 's broadside was brought to the wind .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 15]: As this was done , Mr. Seagrave came on deck and looked around him .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 49]: He perceived the boat ready for launching , the provisions and water at the gangway , the ship brought to the wind , and rolling slowly to the heave of the sea ; at last he saw Ready sitting down by Captain Osborn , who was apparently dead .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 9]: `` What is all this , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 3]: inquired Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 9]: `` Are they going to leave the ship ?
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 7]: have they killed Captain Osborn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 13]: `` No , sir , - not quite so bad as that .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 43]: Poor Captain Osborn was struck down by the fall of the yard , and has been insensible ever since ; but , as to the other matter , I fear that is decided : you see they are launching the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 25]: `` But my poor wife , she will never be able to go - she can not move - she is so ill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 30]: `` I 'm afraid , Mr. Seagrave , that they have no idea of taking either you , or your wife , or your children , with them . ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 9]: leave us here to perish I Merciful Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 7]: how cruel - how barbarous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 20]: `` It is not kind , Mr. Seagrave , but still you see it is the law of nature .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 44]: When it is a question of life , it is every one for himself , for life is sweet : they are not more unkind than they would be to each other , if there were too many for the boat to hold .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 16]: I 've seen all this before in my time , '' replied Ready , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 4]: `` My wife !
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 4]: my children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 11]: cried Mr. Seagrave , covering his face with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 38]: `` But I will speak to them , '' continued he after a pause ; `` surely they will listen to the dictates of humanity ; at all events Mr. Mackintosh will have some power over them .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 9]: Do n't you think so , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 79]: `` Well , Mr. Seagrave , if I must speak , I confess to you that there is not a harder heart among them than that of Mr. Mackintosh , and it 's useless speaking to him or any one of them ; and you must not be too severe upon them neither : the boat is small , and could not hold more people with the provisions which they take with them - that is the fact .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 44]: If they were to take you and your family into the boat , it might be the cause of all perishing together ; if I thought otherwise I would try what I could do to persuade them , but it is useless . ''
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 11]: `` What must be done , then , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 25]: `` We must put our trust in a merciful God , Mr. Seagrave , who will dispose of us as he thinks fit . ''
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 4]: `` We must ?
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 8]: do not you go with them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 6]: `` No , Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 22]: I have been thinking about it this last hour , and I have made up my mind to remain with you .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 30]: They intend to take poor Captain Osborn with them , and give him a chance , and have offered to take me ; but I shall stay here . ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 5]: `` To perish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 7]: replied Mr. Seagrave , with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 20]: `` As God pleases , Mr. Seagrave I am an old man , and it is of little consequence .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 69]: I care little whether I am taken away a year or two sooner , but I do not like to see blossoms cut off in early spring : I may be of use if I remain , for I 've an old head upon my shoulders , and I could not leave you all to perish when you might be saved if you only knew how to act .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 24]: But here the seamen come - the boat is all ready , and they will now take poor Captain Osborn with them . ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 13]: The sailors came aft , and lifted up the still insensible captain .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 23]: As they were going away one of them said , `` Come , Ready , there 's no time to lose . ''
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 18]: `` Never mind me , Williams ; I shall stick to the ship , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 67]: `` I wish you success with all my heart ; and , Mr. Mackintosh , I have but one promise to exact from you , and I hope you will not refuse me : which is , that if you are saved , you will not forget those you leave here on board , and take measures for their being searched for among the islands . ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 5]: `` Nonsense , Ready !
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 11]: come into the boat , '' replied the first mate .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 22]: `` I shall stay here , Mr. Mackintosh ; and I only beg that you will promise me what I ask .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 29]: Acquaint Mr. Seagrave 's friends with what has happened , and where it is most likely we may be found , if it please God to save us .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 7]: Do you promise me that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 41]: `` Yes , I do , if you are determined to stay ; but , '' continued he , going up to Ready , and whispering to him , `` it is madness : - come away , man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 14]: `` Good-bye , Mr. Mackintosh , '' replied Ready , extending his hand .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 8]: `` You will keep your promise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 35]: After much further expostulation on the part of Mackintosh and the seamen , to which Ready gave a deaf ear , the boat was pushed off , and they made sail to the north-east .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 28]: Chapter VII For some time after the boat had shoved off from the ship , old Ready remained with his arms folded , watching it in silence .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 59]: Mr. Seagrave stood by him ; his heart was too full for utterance , for he imagined that as the boat increased her distance from the vessel , so did every ray of hope depart , and that his wife and children , himself , and the old man who was by his side were doomed to perish .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 11]: His countenance was that of a man in utter despair .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 6]: At last old Ready spoke .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 48]: `` They think that they will be saved and that we must perish , Mr. Seagrave ; they forget that there is a Power above , who will himself decide that point - a power compared to which the efforts of weak man are as nought . ''
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 42]: `` True , '' replied Mr. Seagrave , in a low voice ; `` but still what chance we can have on a sinking ship , with so many helpless creatures around us , I confess I can not imagine . ''
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 38]: `` We must do our best , and submit to His will , '' replied Ready , who then went aft , and shifted the helm , so as to put the ship again before the wind .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 29]: As the old man had foretold to the seamen before they quitted the vessel , the gale was now over , and the sea had gone down considerably .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 26]: The ship , however , dragged but slowly through the water , and after a short time Ready lashed the wheel , and went forward .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 37]: On his return to the quarter-deck , he found Mr. Seagrave had thrown himself down -LRB- apparently in a state of despair -RRB- upon the sail on which Captain Osborn had been laid after his accident .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 61]: `` Mr. Seagrave , do not give way , '' said Ready ; `` if I thought our situation hopeless , I would candidly say so ; but there always is hope , even at the very worst , - and there always ought to be trust in that God without whose knowledge not a sparrow falls to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 20]: But , Mr. Seagrave , I shall speak as a seaman , and tell you what our probabilities are .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 43]: The ship is half-full of water , from her seams having opened by the straining in the gale , and the heavy blows which she received ; but , now that the gale has abated , she has recovered herself very much .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 34]: I have sounded the well , and find that she has not made many inches within the last two hours , and probably , as she closes her seams , will make less .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 65]: If , therefore , it pleases God that the fine weather should continue , there is no fear of the vessel sinking under us for some time ; and as we are now amongst the islands , it is not impossible , nay , it is very probable , that we may be able to run her ashore , and thins save our hives .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 88]: I thought of all this when I refused to go in the boat , and I thought also , Mr. Seagrave , that if you were to have been deserted by me as well as by all the rest , you would have been unable yourself to take advantage of any chances which might turn up in your favour , and therefore I have remained , hoping , under God 's providence , to be the means of assisting you and your family in this sore position .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 43]: I think now it would be better that you should go down into the cabin , and with a cheerful face encourage poor Mrs. Seagrave with the change in the weather , and the hopes of arriving in some place of safety .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 51]: If she does not know that the men have quitted the ship , do not tell her ; say that the steward is with the other men , which will be true enough , and , if possible , leave her in the dark as to what has taken place .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 23]: Master William can be trusted , and if you will send him here to me , I will talk to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 31]: `` I hardly know what to think , Ready , or how sufficiently to thank you for your self-devotion , if I may so term it , in this exigency .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 66]: That your advice is excellent and that I shall follow it , you may be assured ; and , should we be saved from the death which at present stares us in the face , my gratitude -- '' `` Do not speak of that , sir ; I am an old man with few wants , and whose life is of little use now .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 28]: All I wish to feel is , that I am trying to do my duty in that situation into which it has pleased God to call me .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 33]: What can this world offer to one who has roughed it all his life , and who has neither kith nor kin that he knows of to care about his death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 16]: Mr. Seagrave pressed the hand of Ready , and went down without making any reply .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 19]: He found that his wife had been asleep for the last hour , and was not yet awake .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 9]: The children were also quiet in their beds .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 12]: Juno and William were the only two who were sitting up .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 59]: William made a sign to his father that his mother was asleep , and then said in a whisper , `` I did not like to leave the cabin while you were on deck , hut the steward has not been here these two hours : he went to milk the goat for baby and has not returned .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 11]: We have had no breakfast , none of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 21]: `` William , go on deck , '' replied his father ; `` Ready wishes to speak to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 52]: William went on deck to Ready , who explained to him the position in which they were placed ; he pointed out to him the necessity of his doing all he could to assist his father and him , and not to alarm his mother in her precarious state of health .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 32]: William , who , as it may be expected , looked very grave , did , however , immediately enter into Ready 's views , and proceeded to do his best .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 32]: `` The steward , '' said he , `` has left with the other men , and when my mother wakes she will ask why the children have had no breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 6]: What can I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 97]: `` I think you can milk one of the goats if I show you how , while I go and get the other things ready ; I can leave the deck , for you see the ship steers herself very nicely ; - and , William , I have sounded the well just before you came up , and I do n't think she makes much water ; and , '' continued he , looking round him , and up above , `` we shall have fine weather , and a smooth sea before night . ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 22]: By the united exertions of Ready and William the breakfast was prepared while Mrs. Seagrave still continued in a sound sleep .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 86]: The motion of the ship was now very little : she only rolled very slowly from one side to the other ; the sea and wind had gone down , and the sun shone brightly over their heads ; the boat had been out of sight some time , and the ship did not go through the water faster than three miles an hour , for she had no other sail upon her than the main-topgallant sail hoisted up on the stump of the foremast .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 27]: Ready , who had been some time down in the cabin , proposed to Mr. Seagrave that Juno and all the children should go on deck .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 33]: `` They can not be expected to be quiet , sir ; and , now that Madam is in such a sweet sleep , it would be a pity to wake her .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 37]: After so much fatigue she may sheep for hours , and the longer the better , for you know that -LRB- in a short time , I trust -RRB- she will have to exert herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 31]: Mr. Seagrave agreed to the good sense of this proposal , and went on deck with Juno and the children , leaving William in the cabin to watch his mother .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 47]: Poor Juno was very much astonished when she came up the ladder and perceived the condition of the vessel , and the absence of the men ; but Mr. Seagrave told her what had happened , and cautioned her against saying a word to Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 38]: Juno promised that she would not ; but the poor girl perceived the danger of their position , and , as she pressed little Albert to her bosom , a tear or two rolled down her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 23]: Even Tommy and Caroline could not help asking where the masts and sails were , and what had become of Captain Osborn .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 19]: `` Look there , sir , '' said Ready , pointing out some floating sea-weed to Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 16]: `` I perceive it , '' said Mr. Seagrave ; `` but what then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 24]: `` That by itself would not be quite proof , '' replied Ready , `` but we sailors have other signs and tokens .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 11]: Do you see those birds hovering over the waves ? ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 81]: `` Well , sir , those birds never go far from land , that 's all : and now , sir , I 'll go down for my quadrant ; for , although I can not tell the longitude just now , at all events I can find out the latitude we are in , and then by looking at the chart shall be able to give some kind of guess whereabout we are , if we see land soon .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 23]: `` It is nearly noon now , '' observed Ready , reading off his quadrant , `` the sun rises very slowly .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 8]: What a happy thing a child is !
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 32]: Look , sir , at those little creatures playing about , and as merry now , and as unaware of danger , as if they were at home in their parlour .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 31]: I often think , sir , it is a great blessing for a child to be called away early ; and that it is selfish in parents to repine . ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 16]: `` Perhaps it is , '' replied Mr. Seagrave , looking mournfully at his children .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 8]: `` It 's twelve o'clock , sir .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 20]: I 'll just go down and work the latitude , and then I 'll bring up the chart . ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 6]: Mr. Seagrave remained on deck .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 62]: He was soon in deep and solemn thought ; nor was it to be wondered at - the ship a wreck and deserted - left alone on the wide water with his wife and helpless family , with but one to assist him : had that one deserted as well as the rest , what would have been his position then ?
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 3]: Utter helplessness !
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 8]: And now what had they to expect ?
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 40]: Their greatest hopes were to gain some island , and , if they succeeded , perhaps a desert island , perhaps an island inhabited by savages - to be murdered , or to perish miserably of hunger and thirst .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 45]: It was not until some time after these reflections had passed through his mind , that Mr. Seagrave could recall himself to a sense of thankfulness to the Almighty for having hitherto preserved them , or could say with humility , `` O Lord !
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 10]: thy will , not mine , be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 30]: But , having once succeeded in repressing his murmurs , he then felt that he had courage and faith to undergo every trial which might be imposed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 48]: `` Here is the chart , sir , '' said Ready , `` and I have drawn a pencil line through our latitude : you perceive that it passes through this cluster of islands ; and I think we must be among them , or very near .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 18]: Now I must put something on for dinner , and then look sharp out for the land .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 18]: Will you take a look round , Mr. Seagrave , especially a-head and on the bows ? ''
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 32]: Ready went down to see what he could procure for dinner , as the seamen , when they left the ship , had collected almost all which came first to hand .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 25]: He soon procured a piece of salt beef and some potatoes , which he put into the saucepan , and then returned on deck .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 17]: Mr. Seagrave was forward , looking over the bows , and Ready went there to him .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 33]: `` Ready , I think I see something , but I can hardly tell what it is : it appears to be in the air , and yet it is not clouds .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 10]: Look there , where I point my finger . ''
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 59]: `` You 're right , sir , '' replied Ready , `` there is something ; it is not the land which you see , but it is the trees upon the land which are refracted , as they call it , so as to appear , as you say , as if they were in the air .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 21]: That is an island , sir , depend upon it ; but I will go down and get my glass .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 51]: `` It is the land , Mr. Seagrave , '' said Ready , after examining it with his glass - `` yes , it is so , '' continued he , musing ; `` I wish that we had seen it earlier ; and yet we must be thankful . ''
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 7]: `` Why so , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 44]: `` Only , sir , as the ship forges so slowly through the water , I fear that we shall not reach it before dark , and I should have wished to have had daylight to have laid her nicely on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 9]: `` There is very little wind now . ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 26]: `` Well , let us hope that there will be more , '' replied Ready ; `` if not , we must do our best .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 66]: But I must now go to the helm , for we must steer right for the island ; it would not do to pass it , for , Mr. Seagrave , although the ship does not leak so much as she did , yet I must now tell you that I do not think that she could be kept more than twenty-four hours above water .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 63]: I thought otherwise this morning when I sounded the well ; but when I went down in the hold for the beef , I perceived that we were in more danger than I had any idea of ; however , there is the land , and every chance of escape ; so let us thank the Lord for all his mercies . ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 4]: `` Amen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 4]: replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 85]: Ready went to the helm and steered a course for the land , which was not so far distant as he had imagined , for the island was very low : by degrees the wind freshened up , and they went faster through the water ; and now , the trees , which had appeared as if in the air , joined on to the land , and they could make out that it was a low coral island covered with groves of cocoa-nuts .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 16]: Occasionally Ready gave the helm up to Mr. Seagrave , and went forward to examine .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 143]: When they were within three or four miles of it , Ready came back from the forecastle and said , `` I think I see my way pretty clear , sir : you see we are to the windward of the island , and there is always deep water to the windward of these sort of isles , and reefs and shoals to leeward ; we must , therefore , find some little cleft in the coral rock to dock her in , as it were , or she may fall back into deep water after she has taken the ground , for sometimes these islands run up like a wall , with forty or fifty fathom of water close to the weather-sides of them ; but I see a spot where I think she may be put on shore with safety .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 12]: You see those three cocoa-nut trees close together on the beach ?
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 72]: Now , sir , I can not well see them as I steer , so do you go forward , and if I am to steer more to the right , put out your right hand , and if to the left , the same with your left ; and when the ship 's head is as it ought to be , then drop the hand which you have raised . ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 28]: `` I understand , Ready , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; who then went forward and directed the steering of the vessel as they neared the island .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 57]: When they were within half a mile of it , the colour of the water changed , very much to the satisfaction of Ready , who knew that the weather-side of the island would not be so steep as was usually the case : still it was an agitating moment as they ran on to beach .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 82]: They were now within a cable 's length , and still the ship did not ground ; a little nearer , and there was a grating at her bottom - it was the breaking off of the coral-trees which grew below like forests under water - again she grated , and more harshly , then struck , and then again ; at last she struck violently , as the swell lifted her further on , and then remained fast amid quiet .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 13]: Ready let go the helm to ascertain the position of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 29]: He looked over the stern and around the ship , and found that she was firmly fixed , fore and aft , upon a bed of coral rocks .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 29]: Chapter VIII `` All 's well so far , sir , '' said Ready to Mr. Seagrave ; `` and now let us return thanks to Heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 49]: As they rose to their feet again , after giving thanks to the Almighty , William came up and said , `` Father , my mother was awakened by the noise under the ship 's bottom , and is frightened - will you go down to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 18]: `` What is the matter , my dear , - and where have you all been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 11]: exclaimed Mrs. Seagrave , when her husband went down below .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 25]: `` I have been so frightened - I was in a sound sleep , and I was awakened with such a dreadful noise . ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 30]: `` Be composed , my dear , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` we have been in great danger , and are now , I trust , in safety .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 13]: Tell me , are you not better for your long sleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 18]: `` Yes , much better - much stronger ; but do tell me what has happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 46]: `` Much took place , dearest , before you went to sleep , which was concealed from you ; but now , as I expect we shall all go on shore in a short time -- '' `` Go on shore , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 6]: `` Yes , on shore .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 23]: Now be calm , and hear what has happened , and how much we have reason to be grateful to Heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 13]: Mr. Seagrave then entered into a detail of all that had passed .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 23]: Mrs. Seagrave heard him without reply ; and when he had finished , she threw herself in his arms and wept bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 35]: Mr. Seagrave remained with his wife , using all his efforts to console her , until Juno reappeared with the children , for it was now getting late ; then he returned on deck .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 38]: `` Well , sir , '' said Ready , when Mr. Seagrave went up to him , `` I have been looking well about me , and I think that we have great reason to be thankful .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 52]: The ship is fast enough , and will not move until some violent gales come on and break her up ; but of that there is no fear at present : the little wind that there is , is going down , and we shall have a calm before morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 21]: `` I grant that there is no immediate danger , Ready ; but how are we to get on shore ?
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 14]: - and , when on shore , how are we to exist ? ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 71]: `` I have thought of that too , sir , and I must have your assistance , and even that of Master William , to get the little boat on board to repair her : her bottom is stove in , it is true , but I am carpenter enough for that , and with some well-tarred canvas I can make her sufficiently water-tight to land us all in safety .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 8]: We must set to at daylight . ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 9]: `` And when we get on shore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 38]: `` Why , Mr. Seagrave , where there are cocoa-nut trees in such plenty as there are on that island , there is no fear of starvation , even if we had not the ship 's provisions .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 32]: I expect a little difficulty with regard to water , for the island is low and small ; but we can not expect to find everything exactly as we wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 25]: `` I am thankful to the Almighty for our preservation , Ready ; but still there are feelings which I can not get over .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 31]: Here we are cast away upon a desolate island , which perhaps no ship may ever come near , so that there is little chance of our being taken off .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 17]: It is a melancholy and cruel fate , Ready , and that you must acknowledge . ''
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 30]: `` Mr. Seagrave , as an old man compared to you , I may venture to say that you are ungrateful to Heaven to give way to these repinings .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 9]: What is said in the book of Job ?
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 17]: ` Shall we receive good of the Lord , and shall we not receive evil ? '
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 14]: Besides , who knows whether good may not proceed from what appears evil ?
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 37]: I beg your pardon , Mr. Seagrave , I hope I have not offended you ; but , indeed , sir , I felt that it was my duty to speak as I have done . ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 39]: `` You have reproved me very just -RSB- y , Ready ; and I thank you for it , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` I will repine no more , but make the best of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 33]: `` And trust in God , sir , who , if he thinks fit , will restore you once more to your friends , and increase tenfold your flocks and herds . ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 35]: `` That quotation becomes very apt , Ready , '' replied Mr. Seagrave , smiling , `` considering that all my prospects are in flocks and herds upon my land in New South Wales .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 24]: I must put myself under your orders ; for , in our present position , you are my superior - knowledge is power .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 7]: Can we do anything to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 58]: `` I can do a little , Mr. Seagrave ; but you can not assist me till tomorrow morning , except indeed to help me to drag these two spars aft ; and then I can rig a pair of sheers , and have them all ready for hoisting up to-morrow morning to get the boat in .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 22]: You see , with so little strength on board , and no masts , we shall be obliged to contrive . ''
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 20]: Mr. Seagrave assisted Ready in getting the two spars aft , and laid on the spot which was required .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 13]: `` There now , Mr. Seagrave , you may go down below .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 26]: William had better let loose the two dogs , and give them a little victuals , for we have quite forgot them , poor things .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 26]: I shall keep watch to-night , for I have plenty to do , and plenty to think of ; so , good-night , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 21]: Ready remained on deck , lashing the heads of the spars , and fixing his tackles ready for the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 21]: When all was done , he sat down upon one of the hen-coops aft , and remained in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 15]: At last , tired with watching and exertion , the old man fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 38]: He was awakened at daylight by the dogs , who had been set at liberty , and who , after walking about the ship and finding nobody , had then gone to sleep at the cabin door .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 33]: At daybreak they had roused up , and going on deck had found old Ready asleep on the hen-coop , and were licking his face in their joy at having discovered him .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 33]: `` Ay , '' said the old man , as he got off the hen-coop , `` you 'll all three be useful , if I mistake not , by and by .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 21]: Down , Vixen , down - poor creature , you 've lost a good master , I 'm afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 50]: `` Stop - now let me see , '' said Ready , talking to himself ; `` first - but I 'll get the log board and a bit of chalk , and write them down , for my memory is not quite so good as it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 97]: Ready placed the logboard on the hen-coop , and then wrote on it with the chalk : -- `` Three dogs , two goats , and Billy the kid -LRB- I think there 's five pigs -RRB- ; fowls -LRB- quite enough -RRB- ; three or four pigeons -LRB- I 'm sure -RRB- ; the cow -LRB- she has lain down and wo n't get up again , I 'm afraid , so we must kill her -RRB- ; and there 's the merino ram and sheep belonging to Mr. Seagrave - plenty of live stock .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 64]: Now , what 's the first things we must get on shore after we are all landed - a spar and topgallant sail for a tent , a coil or two of rope , a mattress or two for Madam and the children , two axes , hammer and nails , something to eat - yes , and something to cut it with .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 17]: There , that will do for the present , '' said old Ready , getting up .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 61]: `` Now , I 'll just light the fire , get the water on , and , while I think of it , boil two or three pieces of beef and pork to go on shore with them ; and then I 'll call up Mr. Seagrave , for I reckon it will be a hard day 's work . ''
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 29]: Chapter IX As soon as Ready had executed his intentions , and had fed the animals , he went to the cabin and called Mr. Seagrave and William .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 45]: With their assistance the sheers were raised , and secured in their place ; the boat was then hooked on , but , as one person was required to bear it clear of the davits and taffrail , they could not hoist it in .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 29]: `` Master William , will you run down to Juno , and tell her to come on deck to assist us - we must all work now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 26]: William soon returned with Juno , who was a strong girl ; and , with her assistance , they succeeded in getting the boat in .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 40]: The boat was turned over , and Ready commenced his work ; while Mr. Seagrave , at his request , put the pitch-pot on the galley fire , all ready for pitching the canvas when it was nailed on .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 38]: It was not till dinner-time that Ready , who had worked hard , could patch up the boat ; he then payed the canvas and the seams which he had caulked with pitch both inside and out .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 26]: `` I think we shall do now , sir , '' said Ready ; `` we 'll drag her to the gangway and launch her .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 21]: It 's fortunate for us that they did clear away the gunnel , as we shall have no trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 45]: A rope was made fast to the boat , to hold her to the ship : she was then launched over the gunnel by the united exertions of Mr. Seagrave and Ready , and to their great satisfaction she appeared to leak very little .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 29]: `` Now , sir , '' said Ready , `` what shall we do first - take some things on shore , or some of the children ? ''
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 9]: `` What do you say , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 48]: `` I think as the water is as smooth as glass , and we can land anywhere , you and I had better go first to reconnoitre , - it is not two hundred yards to the beach , and we shall lose but little time . ''
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 17]: `` Very well , Ready , I will first run down and tell my wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 24]: `` And , in the meanwhile , I 'll put the sail into the boat , and one or two other things . ''
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 28]: Ready put the sail in , an axe , a musket , and some cord ; then they both got into the boat and pulled on shore .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 56]: When they landed , they found that they could see nothing of the interior of the island , the cocoa-nut groves were so thick ; but to their right they perceived , at about a quarter of a mile off , a small sandy cove , with brushwood growing in front of the cocoa-nut trees .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 17]: `` That , '' said Ready , pointing to it , `` must be our location .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 13]: Let us get into the boat again and pull to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 21]: In a few minutes they arrived at the cove ; the water was shallow , and as clear as crystal .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 20]: Beneath the boat 's bottom they could see beautiful shells , and the fish darting about in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 37]: The sand extended about forty yards from the water , and then commenced the brushwood , which ran back about forty yards further , intermingled with single cocoa-nut trees , until it joined the cocoa-nut grove .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 8]: They pulled the boat in and landed .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 9]: `` What a lovely spot this is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 69]: exclaimed Mr. Seagrave ; `` and perhaps mortal man has never yet visited it till now : those cocoa-nuts have borne their fruit year after year , have died , and others have sprung up in their stead ; and here has this spot remained , perhaps for centuries , all ready for man to live in , and to enjoy whenever he should come to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 23]: `` Providence is bountiful , Mr. Seagrave , '' replied Ready , `` and supplies our wants when we least expect it .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 58]: If you please we will walk a little way into the wood : take the gun as a precaution , sir ; not that there appears to be much occasion for it - there is seldom anything wild on these small islands , except a pig or two has been put on shore by considerate Christians . ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 19]: `` Well , now that we are in the grove , Ready , what do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 62]: `` I was looking for a place to fix a tent up for the present , sir , and I think that on that little rise would be a very good place till we can look about us and do better ; but we have no time now , sir , for we have plenty of trips to make before nightfall .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 24]: If you please , we 'll haul the sail and other articles on to the beach , and then return on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 24]: As they were pulling the boat back , Ready said , `` I 've been thinking about what is best , Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 8]: Would Mrs. Seagrave mind your leaving her ?
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 25]: - if not , I should say we should have Juno and William on shore first , as they can be of use . ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 38]: `` I do not think that she will mind being left on board with William and the children , provided that I return for her when she is to come on shore herself with the baby . ''
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 16]: `` Well then , let William remain on board , if you please , sir .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 27]: I 'll land you and Juno , Tommy , and the dogs , this time , for they will be a protection in case of accidents .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 21]: You and Juno can be doing something while I return by myself for the other articles we shall require . ''
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 25]: As soon as they arrived on board , Mr. Seagrave went down to cheer his wife with the account of what they had seen .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 46]: While he was down below , Ready had cast off the lashings of the two spars which had formed the sheers , and dragging them forward , had launched them over the gunnel , with lines fast to them , ready for towing on shore .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 48]: In a few minutes Juno and Tommy made their appearance on deck ; Ready put some tools into the boat , and a couple of shovels , which he brought up when he went for the dogs , and once more they landed at the sandy cove .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 76]: Tommy stared about him a great deal , but did not speak , until he saw the shells lying on the beach , when he screamed with delight , and began to pick them up as fast as he could ; the dogs barked and galloped about , overjoyed at being once more on shore ; and Juno smiled as she looked around her , saying to Ready , `` What a nice place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 16]: `` Now , Mr. Seagrave , I 'll remain on shore with you a little .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 32]: First , we 'll load the musket in case of need , and then you can put it out of the way of Tommy , who fingers everything , I observe .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 9]: We will take up the sail between us .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 28]: Juno , you can carry the tools ; and then we can come back again for the spars , and the rope , and the other things .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 23]: Come , Tommy , you can carry a shovel at all events , and that will make you of some use . ''
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 48]: Having taken all these things to the little knoll which Ready had pointed out before , they returned for the spars ; and in two trips they had carried everything there , Tommy with the second shovel on his shoulder , and very proud to be employed .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 123]: `` Here are two trees which will answer our purpose pretty well , '' said Ready , `` as they are far enough apart : we must lash the spars up to them , and then throw the sail over , and bring it down to the ground at both ends ; that will be a beginning , at all events ; and I will bring some more canvas on shore , to set up the other tent between these other trees , and also to shut up the two ends of both of them ; then we shall have a shelter for Madam , and Juno , and the younger children , and another for William , Tommy , and ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 30]: Now , sir , I 'll just help you to lash the spars , and then I 'll leave you to finish while I go on board again . ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 12]: `` But how can we reach so high , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 37]: `` Why , sir , we can manage that by first lashing a spar as high as we can conveniently reach , and then standing on that while we lash the other in its proper place .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 23]: I shall bring another spar on shore , that we may do the same when we set up the other tent . ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 38]: Having by this plan succeeded in lashing the spar high enough , and throwing the sail over the spar , Ready and Mr. Seagrave spread it out , and found that it made a very good-sized tent .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 62]: `` Now , sir , I 'll return on board ; in the meantime , if you can cut pegs from the brush wood to fasten the sail down to the ground , and then with the shovel cover the bottom of it with sand to keep it down , it will be close enough when it is all finished . ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 29]: `` I shall do very well , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` Juno can help me to pull the canvas out tight when I am ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 45]: `` Yes ; and in the meantime , Juno , take a shovel , and level the inside of the tent nice and smooth , and throw out all those old cocoa-nut leaves , and look if you see any vermin lurking among them .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 25]: Master Tommy , you must not run away ; and you must not touch the axes , they will cut you if you do .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 41]: It may be as well to say , Mr. Seagrave , that should anything happen , and you require my assistance , you had better fire off the gun , and I will come on shore to you immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 27]: Chapter X When Ready returned on board , he first went down into the cabin to acquaint Mrs. Seagrave and William with what they had done .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 33]: Mrs. Seagrave naturally felt anxious about her husband being on shore alone , and Ready informed her that they had agreed that if anything should occur Mr. Seagrave would fire the musket .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 28]: He then went down into the sail-room to get some canvas , a new topgallant sail which was there , and a palm and needles with twine .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 57]: Scarcely had he got them out , and at the foot of the ladder , when the report of the musket was heard , and Mrs. Seagrave rushed out of the cabin in the greatest alarm ; Ready seized another musket , jumped into the boat , and pulled on shore as fast as he could .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 48]: On his arrival , quite out of breath , for as he pulled on shore he had his back towards it , and could see nothing , he found Mr. Seagrave and Juno busy with the tent , and Tommy sitting on the ground crying very lustily .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 45]: It appeared that , while Mr Seagrave and Juno were employed , Tommy had crept away to where the musket was placed up on end against a cocoa-nut tree , and , after pulling it about some little while , had touched the trigger .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 23]: The musket went off ; and , as the muzzle was pointed upwards , the charge had brought down two large cocoa-nuts .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 38]: Mr. Seagrave , who was aware what an alarm this would produce on board the vessel , had been scolding him soundly , and now Master Tommy was crying , to prove how very penitent he was .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 20]: `` I had better return on board immediately , sir , and tell Mrs. Seagrave , '' said Ready .

WARNING: Untokenizable:  (U+8, decimal: 8)
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 10]: `` Do , pray , '' repli r. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 17]: Ready then returned to the ship , and explained matters , and then recommenced his labour .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 73]: Having put into the boat the sailmaker 's bag , with palm and needles , two mattresses , and blankets from the captain 's state room , the saucepan with the beef and pork , and a spar which he towed astern , Ready found that he had as much as he could carry ; but , as there was nobody but himself in it , he came on shore very well .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 48]: Having , with the assistance of Mr. Seagrave and Juno , got all the things up to the knoll , Ready lashed the spar up for the second tent , and then leaving them to fix it up like the other , he returned again on board .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 47]: He made two other trips to the ship , bringing with him more bedding , a bag of ship 's biscuits , another of potatoes , plates , knives and forks , spoons , frying-pans and other cooking utensils , and a variety of other articles .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 45]: He then showed Juno how to fill up the ends of the first tent with the canvas and sails he had brought on shore , so as to inclose it all round ; Juno took the needle and twine , and worked very well .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 59]: Ready , satisfied that she would be able to get on without them , now said : `` Mr. Seagrave , we have but two hours more daylight , and it is right that Mrs. Seagrave should come on shore now ; so , if you please , we 'll go off and fetch her and the children .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 36]: I think we shall be able to do very well for the first night ; and if it pleases God to give us fine weather , we may do a great deal more to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 22]: As soon as they arrived on board , Mr. Seagrave went down to his wife to propose her going on shore .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 44]: She was much agitated , and very weak from her illness , but she behaved courageously notwithstanding , and , supported by her husband , gained the deck , William following with the baby , and his little sister Caroline carried by Ready .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 41]: With some difficulty they were all at last placed in the boat and shoved off ; but Mrs. Seagrave was so ill , that her husband was obliged to support her in his arms , and William took an oar .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 24]: They landed very safely , and carried Mrs. Seagrave up to the tent , and laid her down on one of the mattresses .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 7]: She asked for a little water .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 55]: `` And I have forgotten to bring any with me : well , I am a stupid old man ; but I 'll go on board directly , '' said Ready : `` to think that I should be so busy in bringing other things on shore and forget the greatest necessary in life !
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 30]: The fact is , I intended to look for it on the island as soon as I could , as it would save a great deal of trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 30]: Ready returned on board as fast as he could , and brought on shore two kegs of fresh water , which he and William rolled up to the tent .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 22]: Juno had completely finished her task , and Mrs. Seagrave having drank some water , declared that she was much better .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 25]: `` I shall not return on board any more to-night , '' said Ready , `` I feel tired - very tired indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 20]: `` You must be , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` do not think of doing any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 23]: `` And I have n't touched food this day , or even quenched my thirst , '' replied Ready , sitting down .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 12]: `` You are ill , are you not , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 3]: said William .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 16]: `` A little faint , William ; I 'm not so young as I was .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 9]: Could you give me a little water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 35]: `` Stop , William , I will , '' said Mr. Seagrave , taking up a tin can which had been filled for his wife : `` here , Ready , drink this . ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 30]: `` I shall be better soon , sir ; I 'll just lie down a little , and then I 'll have a biscuit and a little meat . ''
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 19]: Poor old Ready was indeed quite tired out ; but he ate something , and felt much revived .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 20]: Juno was very busy ; she had given the children some of the salt meat and biscuit to eat .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 22]: The baby , and Tommy , and Caroline had been put to bed , and the second tent was nearly ready .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 27]: `` It will do very well for to-night , Juno , '' said Mr. Seagrave ; `` we have done work enough for this day . ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 30]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied Ready , `` and I think we ought to thank God for his mercies to us before we go to sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 32]: `` You remind me of my duty , Ready ; let us thank him for his goodness , and pray to him for his protection before we go to sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 17]: Mr. Seagrave then offered up a prayer of thankfulness ; and they all retired to rest .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 19]: Chapter XI Mr. Seagrave was the first who awoke and rose from his bed on the ensuing morning .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 12]: He stepped out of the tent , and looked around him .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 7]: The sky was clear and brilliant .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 27]: A light breeze ruffled o'er the surface of the water , and the tiny waves rippled one after another upon the white sand of the cove .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 24]: To the left of the cove the land rose , forming small hills , behind which appeared the continuation of the cocoa-nut groves .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 53]: To the right , a low ridge of coral rocks rose almost as a wall from the sea , and joined the herbage and brushwood at about a hundred paces , while the wreck of the Pacific , lying like some huge stranded monster , formed the prominent feature in the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 32]: The sun was powerful where its beams could penetrate ; but where Mr. Seagrave stood , the cocoa-nuts waved their feathery leaves to the wind , and offered an impervious shade .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 35]: A feeling of the extreme beauty of the scene , subdued by the melancholy created by the sight of the wrecked vessel , pervaded the mind of Mr. Seagrave as he meditated over it .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 38]: `` Yes , '' thought he , `` if , tired with the world and its anxieties , I had sought an abode of peace and beauty , it would have been on a spot like this .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 6]: How lovely is the scene !
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 15]: - what calm - what content - what a sweet sadness does it create !
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 48]: How mercifully have we been preserved when all hope appeared to be gone ; and how bountifully have we been provided for , now that we have been saved , - and yet I have dared to repine , when I ought to be full of gratitude !
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 5]: May God forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 36]: Wife , children , all safe , nothing to regret but a few worldly goods and a seclusion from the world for a time - yes , but for how long a time - What !
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 3]: rebellious still !
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 16]: - for the time that it shall please God in his wisdom to ordain . ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 8]: Mr. Seagrave turned back to his tent .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 12]: William , Tommy , and old Ready still remained fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 6]: `` Excellent old man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 4]: thought Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 13]: `` What a heart of oak is hid under that rugged bark !
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 22]: - Had it not been for his devotion where might I and all those dear helpless creatures have been now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 30]: The dogs , who had crept into the tent and laid themselves down upon the mattresses by the side of William and Tommy , now fawned upon Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 27]: William woke up with their whining , and having received a caution from his father not to wake Ready , he dressed himself and came out .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 11]: `` Had I not better call Juno , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 19]: said William ; `` I think I can , without waking mamma , if she is asleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 25]: `` Then do , if you can , my boy ; and I will see what cooking utensils Ready has brought on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 31]: William soon returned to his father , stating that his mother was in a sound sleep , and that Juno had got up without waking her or the two children .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 19]: `` Well , we 'll see if we can not get some breakfast ready for them , William .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 11]: Those dry cocoa-nut leaves will make an excellent fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 13]: `` But , father , how are we to light the fire ?
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 8]: we have no tinder-box or matches . ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 22]: `` No ; but there are other ways , William , although , in most of them , tinder is necessary .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 17]: The savages can produce fire by rubbing a soft piece of wood against a hard one .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 40]: But we have gunpowder ; and we have two ways of igniting gunpowder - one is by a flint and steel , and the other is by collecting the sun 's rays into one focus by a magnifying-glass . ''
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 18]: `` But , father , when we have lighted the fire , what have we to cook ?
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 8]: we have no tea or coffee . ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 15]: `` No , I do not think we have , '' replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 9]: `` But we have potatoes , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 38]: `` Yes , William , but do n't you think it would be better if we made our breakfast off the cold beef and pork and ship 's biscuit for once , and not use the potatoes ?
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 11]: we may want them all to plant , you know .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 13]: But why should we not go on board of the ship ourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 28]: you can pull an oar pretty well , and we must all learn to work now , and not leave everything for poor old Ready to do .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 5]: Come , William . ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 35]: Mr. Seagrave then went down to the cove ; the little boat was lying on the beach , just lifted by the rippling waves ; they pushed her off , and got into her .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 46]: `` I know where the steward kept the tea and coffee , father , '' said William , as they pulled on board ; `` mamma would like some for breakfast , I 'm sure , and I 'll milk the goats for baby . ''
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 33]: Although they were neither of them very handy at the oar , they were soon alongside of the ship ; and , having made the boat fast , they climbed on board .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 38]: William first went down to the cabin for the tea and coffee , and then left his father to collect other things while he went to milk the goats , which he did in a tin pan .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 29]: He then poured the milk into a bottle , which he had washed out , that it might not be spilt , and went back to his father .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 25]: `` I have filled these two baskets full of a great many things , William , which will be very acceptable to your mamma .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 7]: What else shall we take ? ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 80]: `` Let us take the telescope , at all events , father ; and let us take a whole quantity of clothes - they will please mamma : the clean ones are all in the drawers - we can bring them up in a sheet ; and then , father , let us bring some of the books on shore ; and I 'm sure mamma will long for her Bible and prayer-book ; - here they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 14]: `` You are a good boy , William , '' replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 20]: `` I will now take those things up to the boat , and then return for the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 18]: In a short time everything was put into the boat , and they pulled on shore again .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 25]: They found Juno , who had been washing herself , waiting for them at the cove , to assist to take up the things .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 14]: `` Well , Juno , how do you find yourself this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 27]: `` Quite well , massa , '' said Juno : and then pointing to the clear water , she said , `` Plenty fish here . ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 14]: `` Yes , if we only had lines , '' replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 11]: `` I think Ready has both hooks and lines somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 22]: Come , Juno , take up this bundle of linen to your tent : we can manage all the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 24]: When they arrived at the tent they found that every one was awake except Ready , who appeared still to sleep very sound .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 15]: Mrs. Seagrave had passed a very good night , and felt herself much refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 25]: William made some touch-paper , which he lighted with one of the glasses from the telescope , and they soon had a good fire .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 32]: Mr. Seagrave went to the beach , and procured three large stones to rest the saucepan on ; and in half an hour the water was boiling and the tea made .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 66]: Chapter XII Juno had taken the children down to the cove , and , walking out into the water up to her knees , had dipped them in all over , as the shortest way of washing them , and had then dressed them and left them with their mother , while she assisted William to get the cups and saucers and plates for breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 22]: Everything was laid out nice and tidy between the two tents , and then William proposed that he should awaken Ready .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 19]: `` Yes , my boy , you may as well now - he will want his breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 9]: William went and pushed Ready on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 10]: `` Ready , have you had sleep enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 10]: said William , as the old man sat up .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 5]: `` Yes , William .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 30]: I have had a good nap , I expect ; and now I will get up , and see what I can get for breakfast for you all . ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 9]: `` Do , '' replied William , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 18]: Ready was soon dressed , for he had only taken off his jacket when he lay down .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 45]: He put it on , and came out of the tent ; when , to his astonishment , he found the whole party -LRB- Mrs. Seagrave having come out with the children -RRB- standing round the breakfast , which was spread on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 6]: `` Good-morning , Ready ! ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 8]: said Mrs. Seagrave , extending her hand .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 8]: Mr. Seagrave also shook hands with him .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 30]: `` You have had a good long sleep , Ready , '' said Mr. Seagrave , `` and I would not waken you after your fatigue of yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 41]: `` I thank you , sir ; and I am glad to see that Madam is so well : and I am not sorry to see that you can do so well without me , '' continued Ready , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 36]: `` Indeed , but we can not , I 'm afraid , '' replied Mrs. Seagrave ; `` had it not been for you and your kindness , where should we have been now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 33]: `` We can get a breakfast ready without you , '' said Mr. Seagrave ; `` but without you , I think we never should have required another breakfast by this time .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 25]: But we will tell Ready all we have done while we eat our breakfast : now , my dear , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 24]: Mrs. Seagrave then read a chapter from the Bible , and afterwards they all knelt down while Mr. Seagrave offered up a prayer .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 39]: While they were at breakfast , William told Ready how they had gone on board , and what they had brought on shore , and he also mentioned how Juno had dipped all the children in the sea .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 45]: `` But Juno must not do that again , '' replied Ready , `` until I have made all safe ; you know that there are plenty of sharks about these islands , and it is very dangerous to go into the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 11]: `` Oh , what an escape they have had ! ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 6]: cried Mrs. Seagrave , shuddering .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 76]: `` It 's very true , '' continued Ready ; `` but they do n't keep so much to the windward of the islands where we are at present ; but still that smooth cove is a very likely place for them to come into ; so it 's just as well not to go in again , Juno , until I have time to make a place for you to bathe in in safety .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 27]: As soon as we can get as much as we want from the ship , we must decide whether we shall stay here or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 8]: `` Stay here or not , Ready !
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 7]: - what do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 41]: `` Why , we have not yet found any water , and that is the first necessary of life - if there is no water on this side of the island , we must pitch our tents somewhere else . ''
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 24]: `` That 's very true , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` I wish we could find time to explore a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 24]: `` So we can , sir ; but we must not lose this fine weather to get a few things from the ship .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 6]: We had better go now .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 27]: You and William can remain on board to collect the things , and I will land them on the beach for Juno to bring up . ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 18]: The whole day was spent in landing every variety of article which they thought could be useful .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 22]: All the small sails , cordage , twine , canvas , small casks , saws , chisels , and large nails .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 13]: and elm and oak plank , were brought on shore before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 63]: After they had taken a hearty dinner , the cabin tables and chairs , all their clothes , some boxes of candles , two bags of coffee , two of rice , two more of biscuits , several pieces of beef and pork and bags of flour , some more water , the grindstone , and Mrs. Seagrave 's medicine-chest were landed .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 51]: When Ready came off again , he said , `` Our poor boat is getting very leaky , and will not take much more on shore without being repaired ; and Juno has not been able to get half the things up - they are too heavy for one person .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 29]: I think we shall do pretty well now , Mr. Seagrave ; and we had better , before it is dark , get all the animals on shore .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 22]: I do n't much like to trust them to swim on shore , but they are awkward things in a boat .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 98]: We 'll try a pig , at all events ; and while I get one up , do you and William tie the legs of the fowls , and put them into the boat ; as for the cow , she can not be brought on shore , she is still lying down , and , I expect , wo n't get up again any more ; however , I have given her plenty of hay , and if she do n't rise , why I will kill her , and we can salt her down . ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 64]: Ready went below , and the squealing of the pig was soon heard ; he came on deck with it hanging over his back by the hind legs , and threw it into the sea over the gunnel : the pig floundered at first ; but after a few seconds , turned its head away from the ship and swam for the shore .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 44]: `` He goes ashore straight enough , '' said Ready , who , with Mr. Seagrave and William , was watching the animal ; but a minute afterwards , Ready exclaimed : `` I thought as much - we 've lost him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 4]: replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 15]: `` D'ye see that black thing above water pushing so fast to the animal ?
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 26]: - that 's the back fin of a shark , and he will have the poor thing - there , he 's got him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 15]: said Ready , as the pig disappeared under the water with a heavy splash .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 19]: `` Well , he 's gone ; better the pig than your little children , Mr. Seagrave . ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 9]: `` Yes , indeed , God be praised !
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 21]: - that monster might have been close to them at the time that Juno took them into the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 14]: `` He was not far off ; I reckon , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 36]: `` We 'll go down now and tie the legs of the other four pigs , and bring them up ; with what 's already in the boat they will be a good load . ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 33]: As soon as the pigs were in the boat , Ready sculled it on shore , while Mr. Seagrave and William brought up the goats and sheep ready for the next trip .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 4]: Ready soon returned .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 39]: `` Now this will be our last trip for to-day , and , if I am any judge of the weather , our last trip for some days ; it is banking up very thick in the offing .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 43]: This trip we 'll be able to put into the boat a bag of corn for the creatures , in case we require it , and then we may say good-bye to the ship for a day or two at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 33]: They then all got into the boat , which was very deeply laden , for the corn was heavy , but they got safe on shore , although they leaked very much .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 33]: Having landed the goats and sheep , William led them up to the tent , where they remained very quietly ; the pigs had run away , and so had the fowls .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 49]: `` That 's what I call a good day 's work , Mr. Seagrave , '' said Ready ; `` the little boat has done its duty well ; but we must not venture in her again until I have put her into a little better condition . ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 47]: They were not at all sorry , after their hard day 's work , to find that Juno had prepared coffee for them ; and while they were drinking it , they narrated to Mrs. Seagrave the tragically death of the poor pig by the shark .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 23]: Poor Juno appeared quite frightened at the danger which the children had been in , even now that it was all over .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 24]: `` We shall have plenty to do here to-morrow , '' observed Mr. Seagrave , `` in getting things into their places . ''
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 18]: `` We shall have plenty to do for some time , I expect , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 33]: `` In two months , or thereabouts , we shall have the rainy season come on , and we must be under cover before that time , if we possibly can . ''
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 13]: `` What 's the first thing we must do , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 4]: inquired Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 52]: `` To-morrow we had better fix up another tent or two , to stow away all the articles we have brought on shore : that will be one good day 's work ; we shall then know where to lay our hands upon everything , and see what we want . ''
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 14]: `` That 's very true ; and what shall we do then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 30]: `` Why then , sir , I think we must make a little expedition to explore the island , and find out where we must build our house . ''
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 8]: `` Can we build a house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 3]: said William .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 16]: `` Oh , yes , sir , and with more ease than you would think .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 26]: There 's no tree so valuable as the cocoa-nut tree ; and the wood is so light that we can easily move it about . ''
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 14]: `` Why , what are the great merits of the cocoa-nut tree ? ''
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 4]: said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 144]: `` I 'll tell you , madam : in the first place , you have the wood to build the house with ; then you have the bark with which you can make ropes and lines , and fishing-nets if you please ; then you have the leaves for thatching your house ; then you have the fruit , which , as a nut , is good to eat , and very useful in cooking ; and in the young nut is the milk , which is also very wholesome ; then you have the oil to burn , and the shell to make cups of , if you have n't any , and then you can draw toddy from the tree , which is very pleasant to drink when fresh , but will make you tipsy if it is kept too long .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 22]: There is no tree which yields so many useful things to man , for it supplies him with almost everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 15]: `` At all events , we 've plenty of them , '' said William .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 35]: `` Yes , William , there 's no want of them ; and I am glad of it , for had there been but few , I should not have liked to destroy them .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 45]: People might be wrecked here , as well as ourselves , and without the good fortune that we have had in getting so many necessaries on shore ; and they might be obliged to depend wholly upon the cocoa-nut trees for their support . ''
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 60]: Chapter XIII When breakfast was over the next morning , Ready observed , `` Now , Mr. Seagrave , we must hold a council of war , and decide upon an exploring party for to-morrow ; and , when we have settled that , we will find some useful way of employing ourselves for the rest of the day .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 13]: The first question is , of whom is the party to consist ?
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 12]: - and upon that I wish to hear your opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 23]: `` Why , Ready , '' replied Mr. Seagrave , `` it appears to me that you and I should go . ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 15]: `` Surely not both of you , my dear , '' interrupted Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 15]: `` You can do without my husband , can you not , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 86]: `` I certainly should have liked to have Mr. Seagrave to advise with , ma'am , '' replied Ready ; `` but still I have thought upon it , and do not think that William would be quite sufficient protection for you ; or , at all events , you would not feel that he was , which is much the same thing ; and so , if Mr. Seagrave has no objection , it would perhaps be better that he remained with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 11]: `` Would you go alone , then , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 4]: said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 37]: `` No , sir , I do not think that would be right either , - some accident might happen ; there is no saying what might happen , although there is every appearance of safety .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 25]: I should like , therefore , to have some one with me ; the question is , whether it be William or Juno ? ''
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 8]: `` Take me , '' said Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 7]: `` Take you , Tommy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 17]: said Ready , laughing ; `` then I must take Juno to take care of you .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 10]: No ; I think they can not spare you .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 50]: Your mamma will want you when we are gone ; you are so useful in gathering wood for the fire , and taking care of your little sister and brother , that your mother can not part with you ; so I must have either Juno or William . ''
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 10]: `` And which would you prefer , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 4]: said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 25]: `` William , certainly , ma'am , if you will let him go with me , as you could ill spare the girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 23]: `` Indeed , I do not like it ; I would rather lose Juno for a time , '' replied Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 29]: `` My dear wife , '' said Mr. Seagrave , `` recollect how Providence has preserved us in such awful dangers - how we are landed in safety .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 25]: And now , will you not put trust in that Providence , when the dangers are , as I trust , only imaginary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 37]: `` I was wrong , my dear husband ; but sickness and suffering have made me , I fear , not only nervous and frightened , but selfish : I must and will shake it off .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 27]: Hitherto I have only been a clog and an incumbrance to you ; but I trust I shall soon behave better , and make myself useful .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 24]: If you think , then , that it would be better that you should go instead of William , I am quite content .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 15]: Go , then , with Ready , and may Heaven protect you both ! ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 17]: `` No , ma'am , '' replied Ready , `` William will do just as well .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 21]: Indeed , I would go by myself with pleasure ; but we know not what the day may bring forth .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 45]: I might be taken ill - I might hurt myself - I am an old man , you know ; and then I was thinking that if any accident was to happen to me , you might miss me - that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 18]: `` Pardon me , '' replied Mrs Seagrave ; `` a mother is foolish at times . ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 15]: `` Over-anxious , ma'am , perhaps , but not foolish , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 31]: `` Well , then , William shall go with you , Ready ; - that point 's settled , '' observed Mr. Seagrave : `` what is the next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 10]: `` The next is to prepare for our journey .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 45]: We must take some provisions and water with us , a gun and some ammunition , a large axe for me , and one of the hatchets for William ; and , if you please , Romulus and Remus had better come with us .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 16]: Juno , put a piece of beef and a piece of pork into the pot .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 26]: William , will you fill four quart bottles with water , while I sew up a knapsack out of canvas for each of us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 10]: `` And what shall I do , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 4]: said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 39]: `` Why , sir , if you will sharpen the axe and the hatchet on the grindstone , it would be of great service , and Tommy can turn it , he is so fond of work . ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 52]: Tommy jumped up directly ; he was quite strong enough to turn the grindstone , but he was much fonder of play than work ; but as Ready had said that he was fond of it , he wished to prove that such was the case , and worked very hard .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 25]: Before they went to prayers and retired for the night , the axe was sharpened , the knapsacks made , and everything else ready .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 11]: `` When do you intend to start , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 4]: said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 26]: `` Why , sir , I should like to get off at the dawn of day , when the heat is not so great . ''
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 11]: `` And when do you intend to come back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 4]: said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 50]: `` Why , madam , we have provisions enough for three days : if we start to-morrow morning , which is Wednesday , I hope to be back some time on Friday evening ; but I wo n't be later than Saturday morning if I can help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 22]: `` Good-night - and good-bye , mother , '' said William , `` for I shall not see you to-morrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 12]: `` God bless and protect you , my dear child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 4]: replied Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 17]: `` Take care of him , Ready , and good-bye to you till we meet . ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 16]: Mrs. Seagrave went into the tent to hide the tears which she could not suppress .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 16]: Chapter XIV Ready was up before the sun had appeared , and he awakened William .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 36]: The knapsacks had been already packed , with two bottles of water in each , wrapped round with cocoa-nut leaves , to prevent their breaking , and the beef and pork divided between each knapsack .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 28]: Ready 's , which was larger than William 's , held the biscuit and several other things which Ready had prepared in case they might require them .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 42]: As soon as the knapsacks were on , Ready took the axe and gun , and asked William if he thought he could carry a small spade on his shoulder , which they had brought on shore along with the shovels .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 25]: William replied that he could ; and the dogs , who appeared to know they were going , were all ready standing by them .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 25]: Then , just as the sun rose , they turned into the cocoa-nut grove , and were soon out of sight of the tents .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 54]: `` Now , William , do you know , '' said Ready , stopping after they had walked twenty yards , `` by what means we may find our way back again ; for you see this forest of trees is rather puzzling , and there is no path to guide us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 52]: `` No , I am sure I can not tell ; I was thinking of the very same thing when you spoke ; and of Tom Thumb , who strewed peas to find his way back , but could not do it , because the birds picked them all up . ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 38]: `` Well , Tom Thumb did not manage well , and we must try to do better ; we must do as the Americans always do in their woods , - we must blaze the trees . ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 4]: `` Blaze them !
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 8]: what , set fire to them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 3]: replied William .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 7]: `` No , no , William .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 40]: Blaze is a term they use when they cut a slice of the bark off the trunk of a tree , just with one blow of a sharp axe , as a mark to find their way back again .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 54]: They do not blaze every tree , but about every tenth tree as they go along , first one to the right , and then one to the left , which is quite sufficient ; and it is very little trouble , - they do it as they walk along , without stopping .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 34]: So now we 'll begin : you take the other side , it will be more handy for you to have your hatchet in your right hand ; I can use my left .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 20]: See now - just a slice off the bark - the weight of the axe does it almost . ''
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 7]: `` What an excellent plan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 3]: observed William .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 23]: `` But I have another friend in my pocket , '' replied Ready , `` and I must use him soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 6]: `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 7]: `` Poor Captain Osborn 's pocket-compass .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 30]: You see , William , the blazing will direct us how to go back again ; but it will not tell us what course we are now to steer .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 41]: At present , I know we are going right , as I can see through the wood behind us ; but by and by we shall not be able , and then I must make use of the compass . ''
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 30]: `` I understand that very well ; but tell me , Ready , why do you bring the spade with us - what will be the use of it ?
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 14]: You did not say yesterday that you were going to bring me . ''
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 86]: `` No , William , I did not , as I did not like to make your mother anxious ; but the fact is , I am very anxious myself as to whether there is any water on this island ; if there is not , we shall have to quit it sooner or later , for although we may get water by digging in the sand , it would be too brackish to use for any time , and would make us all ill .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 27]: Very often there will be water if you dig for it , although it does not show above-ground ; and therefore I brought the spade . ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 9]: `` You think of everything , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 104]: `` No , I do not , William ; but , in our present situation , I think of more things than perhaps your father and mother would : they have never known what it is to be put to their shifts ; but a man like me , who has been all his life at sea , and who has been wrecked , and suffered hardships and difficulties , and has been obliged to think or die , has a greater knowledge , not only from his own sufferings , but by hearing how others have acted when they were in distress .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 28]: Necessity sharpens a man 's wits ; and it is very curious what people do contrive when they are compelled to do so , especially seamen . ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 12]: `` And where are we going to now , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 11]: `` Right to the leeward side of the island . ''
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 14]: `` Why do you call it the leeward side of the island ? ''
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 44]: `` Because among these islands the winds almost always blow one way ; we landed on the windward side ; the wind is at our back ; now put up your finger , and you will feel it even among the trees . ''
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 18]: `` No , I can not , '' replied William , as he held up his finger .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 11]: `` Then wet your finger , and try again . ''
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 11]: William wet his finger , and held it up again .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 19]: `` Yes , I feel it now , '' said he ; `` but why is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 16]: `` Because the wind blows against the wet , and you feel the cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 14]: As Ready said this the dogs growled , then started forward and barked .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 7]: `` What can be there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 3]: cried William .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 24]: `` Stand still , William , '' replied Ready , cocking his gun , `` and I will go forward to see . ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 10]: Ready advanced cautiously with the gun to his hip .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 49]: The dogs barked more furiously ; and at last , out of a heap of cocoa-nut leaves collected together , burst all the pigs which had been brought on shore , grunting and galloping away as fast as they could , with the dogs in pursuit of them .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 26]: `` It 's only the pigs , '' said Ready , smiling ; `` I never thought I should be half-frightened by a tame pig .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 4]: Here , Romulus !
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 4]: here , Remus !
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 4]: come back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 8]: continued Ready , calling to the dogs .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 12]: `` Well , William , this is our first adventure . ''
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 30]: `` I hope we shall not meet with any one more dangerous , '' replied William , laughing ; `` but I must say that I was alarmed . ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 61]: `` No wonder ; for , although not likely , it is possible there may be wild animals on this island , or even savages ; but being alarmed is one thing , and being afraid is another : a man may be alarmed , and stand his ground ; but a man that is afraid will run away . ''
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 22]: `` I do not think I shall ever run away and leave you , Ready , if there is danger . ''
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 33]: `` I 'm sure you will not ; but still you must not be rash ; and now we will go on again , as soon as I have uncocked my gun .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 27]: I have seen more accidents happen from people cocking their guns , and forgetting to uncock them afterwards , than you can have any idea of .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 16]: Recollect , also , until you want to fire , never cock your gun . ''
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 34]: Ready and William continued their way through the cocoa-nut grove for more than an hour longer , marking the trees as they went along ; they then sat down to take their breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 24]: `` Do n't give the dogs any water , William , nor any of the salt meat ; give them biscuit only . ''
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 16]: `` But they are very thirsty ; may not I give them a little ? ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 28]: `` No : we shall want it all ourselves , in the first place ; and , in the next , I wish them to be thirsty .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 20]: And , William , take my advice , and only drink a small quantity of water at a time .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 11]: The more you drink , the more you want . ''
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 12]: `` Then I should not eat so much salt meat . ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 23]: `` Very true ; the less you eat the better , unless we find water , and fill our bottles again . ''
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 25]: `` But we have our axes , and can always cut down a cocoa-nut , and get the milk from the young nuts . ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 41]: `` Very true ; and fortunate it is that we have that to resort to ; but still we could not do very well on cocoa-nut milk alone , even if it were to be procured all the year round .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 13]: Now we will go on if you do not feel tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 31]: `` Not in the least ; I am tired of seeing nothing but the stems of cocoa-nut trees , and shall be glad when we are through the wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 30]: `` Then the faster we walk the better , '' said Ready ; `` as far as I can judge , we must be about half-way across now . ''
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 39]: Ready and William recommenced their journey ; and , after half-an-hour 's walking , they found that the ground was not so level as it had been - sometimes they went gradually up hill , at others down .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 25]: `` I am very glad to find the island is not so flat here ; we have a better chance of finding water . ''
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 20]: `` It is much steeper before us , '' replied William ; `` it 's quite a hill . ''
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 20]: The ground now became more undulating , although still covered with cocoa-nut trees , even thicker together than before .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 32]: They continued their march , occasionally looking at the compass , until William showed symptoms of weariness , for the wood had become more difficult to get through than at first .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 14]: `` How many miles do you think we have walked , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 3]: said Willy .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 9]: `` About eight , I should think . ''
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 7]: `` Not more than eight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 53]: `` No ; I do not think that we have made more than two miles an hour : it 's slow work , travelling by compass and marking the trees ; but I think the wood looks lighter before us , now that we are at the top of this hill . ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 17]: `` It does , Ready ; I fancy I can see the blue sky again . ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 24]: `` Your eyes are younger than mine , William , and perhaps you may - however , we shall soon find out . ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 15]: They now descended into a small hollow , and then went up hill again .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 19]: As soon as they arrived at the top , William cried out , `` The sea , Ready !
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 6]: there 's the sea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 15]: `` Very true , William , and I 'm not sorry for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 34]: `` I thought we never should get out of that nasty wood again , '' said William , as he impatiently pushed on , and at last stood clear of the cocoa-nut grove .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 15]: Ready soon joined him , and they surveyed the scene before them in silence .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 5]: Chapter XV `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 4]: how beautiful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 17]: exclaimed William , at last ; `` I 'm sure mamma would like to live here .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 20]: I thought the other side of the island very pretty , but it 's nothing compared to this . ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 12]: `` It is very beautiful , '' replied Ready , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 9]: A more lovely scene could scarcely be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 78]: The cocoa-nut grove terminated about a quarter of a mile from the beach , very abruptly , for there was a rapid descent for about thirty feet from where they stood to the land below , on which was a mixture of little grass knolls and brushwood , to about fifty yards from the water 's edge , where it was met with dazzling white sand , occasionally divided by narrow ridges of rock which ran inland .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 40]: The water was a deep blue , except where it was broken into white foam on the reefs , which extended for miles from the beach , and the rocks of which now and then showed themselves above water .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 56]: On the rocks were perched crowds of gannets and men-of-war birds , while others wheeled in the air , every now and then darting down into the blue sea , and bringing up in their bills a fish out of the shoals which rippled the water , or bounded clear of it in their gambols .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 26]: The form of the coast was that of a horse-shoe bay - two points of land covered with shrubs extending far out on each side .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 16]: The line of the horizon , far out at sea , was clear and unbroken .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 26]: Ready remained for some time without speaking ; he scanned the horizon right and left , and then he turned his eyes along the land .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 15]: At last William said : `` What are you thinking of , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 19]: `` Why , I am thinking that we must look for water as fast as we can . ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 9]: `` But why are you so anxious ? ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 54]: `` Because I can see no island to leeward of us as I expected , and therefore there is less chance of getting off this island ; and this bay , although very beautiful , is full of reefs , and I see no inlet , which makes it awkward for many reasons .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 9]: But we can not judge at first sight .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 20]: Let us now sit down and take our dinner , and after that we will explore a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 32]: Ready cut two wide marks in the stems of the cocoa-nut trees , and then descended with William to the low ground , where they sat down to eat their dinner .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 43]: As soon as their meal was finished they first walked down to the water 's edge , and Ready turned his eyes inland to see if he could discover any little ravine or hollow which might be likely to contain fresh water .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 42]: `` There are one or two places there , '' observed Ready , pointing to them with his finger , `` where the water has run down in the rainy season : we must examine them carefully , but not now .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 72]: I want to find out whether there is any means of getting our little boat through this reef of rocks , or otherwise we shall have very hard work -LRB- if we change our abode to this spot -RRB- to bring all our stores through that wood ; so we will pass the rest of this day in examining the coast , and to-morrow we will try for fresh water . ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 18]: `` Look at the dogs , Ready , they are drinking the sea-water , poor things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 22]: `` They wo n't drink much of that , I expect ; you see they do n't like it already . ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 41]: `` How beautiful the corals are - look here , they grow like little trees under the water , - and look here , here is really a flower in bloom growing on that rock just below the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 14]: `` Put your finger to it , Master William , '' said Ready .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 17]: William did so , and the flower , as he called it , immediately shut up .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 11]: `` Why , it 's flesh , and alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 34]: `` Yes , it is ; I have often seen them before : they call them sea-anemones - they are animals ; but I do n't know whether they are shell-fish or not .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 27]: Now , let us walk out to the end of this point of land , and see if we can discover any opening in the reef .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 32]: The sun is going down , and we shall not have more than an hour 's daylight , and then we must look out for a place to sleep in . ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 7]: `` But what is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 15]: cried William , pointing to the sand - `` that round dark thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 18]: `` That 's what I 'm very glad to see , William : it 's a turtle .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 24]: They come up about this time in the evening to drop their eggs , and then they bury them in the sand . ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 8]: `` Ca n't we catch them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 56]: `` Yes , we can catch them if we go about it quietly ; but you must take care not to go behind them , or they will throw such a shower of sand upon you , with their hind flappers or fins , that they would blind you and escape at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 34]: The way to catch them is to get at their heads and turn them over on their backs by one of the fore-fins , and then they can not turn back again . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 10]: `` Let us go and catch that one . ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 32]: `` I should think it very foolish to do so , as we could not take it away , and it would die to-morrow from the heat of the sun . ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 29]: `` I did not think of that , Ready ; if we come to live here , I suppose we shall catch them whenever we want them . ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 65]: `` No , we shall not , for they only come on shore in the breeding-season ; but we will make a turtle pond somewhere which they can not get out of , but which the sea flows into ; and then when we catch them we will put them into it , and have them ready for use as we require them . ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 13]: `` That will be a very good plan , '' replied William .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 31]: They now continued their walk , and , forcing their way through the brushwood which grew thick upon the point of land , soon arrived at the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 8]: `` What is that out there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 12]: said William , pointing to the right of where they stood .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 41]: `` That is another island , which I am very glad to see even in that direction , although it will not be so easy to gain it , if we are obliged to leave this for want of water .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 35]: It is a much larger island than this , at all events , '' continued Ready , scanning the length of the horizon , along which he could see the tops of the trees .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 32]: - `` Well , we have done very well for our first day , so we will go and look for a place to lie down and pass the night . ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 31]: They returned to the high ground where the cocoa-nut grove ended , and collecting together several branches and piles of leaves , made a good soft bed under the trees .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 9]: `` And now we 'll go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 18]: Look , William , at the long shadow of the trees the sun has nearly set . ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 12]: `` Shall I give the dogs some water now , Ready ?
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 13]: See , poor Remus is licking the sides of the bottles . ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 46]: `` No , do not give them any : it appears to be cruel , but I want the intelligence of the poor animals to-morrow , and the want of water will make them very keen , and we shall turn it to good account .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 28]: So now , William , we must not forget to return thanks to a merciful God , and to beg his care over us for this night .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 10]: We little know what the day may bring forth .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 3]: Good-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 41]: Chapter XVI William slept as sound as if he had been on shore in England upon a soft bed in a warm room - so did old Ready ; and when they awoke the next morning it was broad daylight .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 32]: The poor dogs were suffering for want of water , and it pained William to see them with their tongues out , panting and whining as they looked up to him .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 26]: `` Now , William , '' said Ready , `` shall we take our breakfast before we start , or have a walk first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 30]: `` Ready , I can not really drink a drop of water myself , and I am thirsty , unless you give a little to these poor dogs . ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 33]: `` I pity the poor dumb creatures as much as you do , Master Willy ; it is kindness to ourselves and them too , which makes me refuse it to them .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 22]: However , if you like , we will take a walk first , and see if we can find any water .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 36]: Let us first go to the little dell to the right , and if we do not succeed , we will try farther on where the water has run down during the rainy season . ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 31]: William was very glad to go , and away they went , followed by the dogs , Ready having taken up the spade , which he carried on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 21]: They soon came to the dell , and the dogs put their noses to the ground , and snuffed about .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 11]: Ready watched them ; at last they lay down panting .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 35]: `` Let us go on , '' said Ready , thoughtfully ; they went on to where the run of water appeared to have been - the dogs snuffed about more eagerly than before .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 32]: `` You see , William , these poor dogs are now so eager for water , that if there is any , they will find it out where we never could .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 15]: I do n't expect water above-ground , but there may be some below it .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 23]: This beach is hardly far enough from the water 's edge , or I should try in the sand for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 13]: `` In the sand - but would it not be salt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 3]: replied William .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 72]: `` No , not if at a good distance from the sea-beach ; for you see , William , the sand by degrees filters the sea-water fresh , and very often when the sand runs in a long way from the high-water mark , if you dig down , you will find good fresh water , at other times it is a little brackish , but still fit for use . ''
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 24]: `` Look , Ready , at Romulus and Remus - how hard they are digging with their paws there in the hollow . ''
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 8]: `` Thanks to Heaven that they are !
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 28]: You do n't know how happy you have made me feel : for , to tell you the truth , I was beginning to be alarmed . ''
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 8]: `` But why do they dig ? ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 10]: `` Because there is water there , poor animals .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 40]: Now you see the advantage of having kept them in pain for a few hours ; it is in all probability the saving of all of us , for we must either have found water or quitted this island .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 22]: Now let us help the poor dogs with the spade , and they shall soon be rewarded for their sufferings . ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 45]: Ready walked quickly to where the dogs continued digging : they had already got down to the moist earth , and were so eagerly at work , that it was with difficulty he could get them out of his way to use his spade .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 33]: He had not dug two feet before the water trickled down , and in four or five minutes the dogs had sufficient to plunge their noses in , and to drink copiously .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 5]: `` Look at them !
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 5]: how they enjoy it !
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 21]: I do n't think any Israelite felt more grateful when Moses struck the rock than I do now , William .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 15]: This was the one thing wanting , but it was the one thing indispensable .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 47]: Now we have everything we can wish for on this island , and if we are only content , we may be happy - ay , much happier than are those who are worrying themselves to heap up riches , not knowing who shall gather them .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 11]: See , the poor animals have had enough at last .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 10]: Now , shall we go back to breakfast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 24]: `` Yes , '' replied William : `` I shall enjoy it now , and have a good drink of water myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 63]: `` That is a plenteous spring , depend upon it , '' said Ready , as they walked back to where they had slept and left their knapsacks ; `` but we must clear it out further up among the trees , where the sun can not reach it , and then it will be cool , and not be dried up .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 18]: We shall have plenty of work for the next year at least , if we remain here .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 16]: Where we are now will be a capital spot to build our house on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 71]: As soon as the breakfast was over , Ready said , `` Now we must go down and explore the other point , for you see , William , I have not yet found a passage through the reef , and as our little boat must come round this side of the island , it is at the point on this side that I must try to find an entrance .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 36]: When I was on the opposite point it did appear to me that the water was not broken close to this point ; and should there be a passage we shall be very fortunate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 37]: They soon arrived at the end of the point of land , and found that Ready was not wrong in his supposition ; the water was deep , and there was a passage many yards wide .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 31]: The sea was so smooth , and the water so clear , that they could see down to the rocky bottom , and watched the fish as they darted along .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 5]: `` Look there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 20]: said Willy , pointing out about fifty yards from the beach , `` a great shark , Ready ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 65]: `` Yes , I see him , sir , '' replied Ready : `` there 's plenty of them here , depend upon it ; and you must be very careful how you get into the water : the sharks always keep to the leeward of the island , and for one where Juno bathed your little brother , you will find fifty here .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 38]: I 'm quite satisfied now , William , we shall do very well , and all we have now to think of is moving away from the other side of the island as fast as possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 8]: `` Shall we go back to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 15]: `` Yes , I think so , for we shall only be idle here .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 18]: It is not twelve o'clock , I should think , and we shall have plenty of time .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 28]: I think we had better start at once ; we will leave the spade and axe here , for it is no use taking them back again .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 7]: The musket I will take along .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 20]: But first let us go back and look at the spring , and see how the water flows . ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 82]: As they walked along the edge of the sandy beach they found the sea-birds hovering close to them : all of a sudden a large shoal of fish threw themselves high and dry on the sand , and they were followed by several of a larger size , which also lay flapping on the beach , while the sea-birds , darting down close to the feet of William and Ready , and seizing up the fish , flew away with them .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 6]: `` How very strange ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 5]: said William , surprised .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 35]: `` Yes , sir ; but you see how it is - the small fish were chased by the larger ones , which are bonettas , and in their fright ran upon the beach .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 26]: These bonettas were so anxious to catch them , that they came on shore also , and then the gannets picked them all up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 25]: They found the hole which Ready had dug quite full of water , and , tasting it , it proved very sweet and good .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 42]: Overjoyed at this discovery , they covered up the articles they agreed to leave behind them with some boughs under the notched cocoa-nut trees , and , calling the dogs , set off on their journey back again to the cove .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 50]: Chapter XVII Guided by the marks made on the trees , William and Ready made rapid progress in their return , and in less than two hours found themselves almost clear of the wood which had taken them nearly eight hours to force their way through the day before .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 34]: `` I feel the wind now , Ready , '' observed William , `` and we must be nearly through the wood ; but it appears to me to be very dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 12]: `` I was just thinking the same , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 27]: `` I should not wonder if there is a storm brewing up ; and if so , the sooner we are back again the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 83]: As they proceeded , the rustling and waving of the boughs of the trees , and ever and anon a gust of wind , followed by a moaning and creaking sound , proved that such was the fact ; and as they emerged from the grove , they perceived that the sky , as it became visible to them , was of one dark leaden hue , and no longer of the brilliant blue which it usually had presented to their sight .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 48]: `` There is indeed a gale coming on , '' said Ready , as they cleared the wood : `` let us go on to the tents as fast as possible , for we must see that all is as secure as we can make it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 46]: The dogs now bounded forward ; and at their appearance at the tents Mr. Seagrave and Juno came out , and seeing Ready and William advancing , made known the welcome tidings to Mrs. Seagrave , who , with the children , had remained within .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 13]: In a moment more William was pressed in his mother 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 40]: `` I am glad that you are come back , Ready , '' said Mr. Seagrave , shaking him by the hand after he had embraced William , `` for I fear that bad weather is coming on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 20]: `` I am sure of it , '' replied Ready , `` and we must expect a blusterous night .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 15]: This will be one of the storms which are forerunners of the rainy season .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 26]: However , we have good news for you , and must only take this as a warning to hasten our departure as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 23]: We shall have fine weather after this for a month or so , although we must expect a breeze now and then .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 66]: But we must work hard and do our best ; and now , if you please , you and Juno , William and I , will go and haul up the boat as far from the beach as we possibly can , for the waves will be high and run a long way up , and our boat will be our main dependence soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 60]: The four went down as soon as Ready had sawed the ends of the spars which had been cut off , into three rollers , to fix under the keel ; with the help afforded by them , the boat was soon hauled up high into the brushwood , where it was considered by Ready to be perfectly safe .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 81]: `` I meant to have worked upon her immediately , '' observed Ready ; `` but I must wait now till the gale is over ; and I did hope to have got on board once more , and looked after some things which I have since remembered would have been useful ; but I strongly suspect , '' continued he , looking at the weather , `` that we shall never go on board of the poor vessel again .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 61]: Hear the moaning of the coming storm , sir ; look how the sea-birds wheel about and scream , as if to proclaim her doom ; but we must not wait here - the tents must be made more secure , for they will have to hold up against no small force of wind , if I mistake not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 81]: Ready , assisted by Mr. Seagrave , now got out some heavy canvas and lines , and commenced putting it as a double cover over the tents , to keep out the rain ; they also secured the tents with guys and stays of rope , so as to prevent them being blown down ; while Juno with a shovel deepened the trench which had been made round the tents , so that the water might run off more easily .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 38]: During the time they were at work , Ready had made Mr. Seagrave acquainted with what they had discovered and done during the exploring expedition , and the adventure with the pigs made them all laugh heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 48]: As the sun went down , the weather threatened still more ; the wind blew strong , and the rocky beach was lashed by the waves and white with spray , while the surf roared as it poured in and broke upon the sand in the cove .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 25]: The whole family had retired to bed except Ready , who said that he would watch the weather a little before he turned in .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 54]: The old man walked towards the beach , and leaned against the gunnel of the boat , and there he remained with his keen gray eye fixed upon the distance , which was now one opaque mass , except where the white foam of the waters gleamed through the darkness of the night !
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 54]: thought he ; `` the winds and the waves are summoned to do his bidding , and evenly do they work together - as one rises , so does the other ; when one howls , the other roars in concert - hand in hand they go in their fury and their force .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 30]: Had they been called up but one week since , where would have been those who have now been , as it were , intrusted to my weak help ?
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 49]: The father , the mother , the children , the infant at the breast , and I , the gray-headed old man , - all buried fathoms deep , awaiting our summons ; but they were restrained by his will , and by his will we were saved .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 14]: Will those timbers which bore us here so miraculously hold together till morning ?
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 5]: I should think not .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 48]: What are the iron bolts and fastenings of weak man , compared with the force of God 's elements : they will snap as yarns ; and by to-morrow 's dawn , the fragments of the stout ship will be washing and tossing on the wild surf .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 52]: Well , it will be a kindness to us , for the waters will perform the labour which we could not ; they will break up the timbers for our use , and throw on shore from the hold those articles which we could not reach with our little strength . ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 21]: A sharp flash of lightning struck upon the old man 's eyes , and obstructed his vision for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 32]: `` The storm will soon be at its height , '' thought he ; `` I will watch the tents , and see how they stand up against its force . ''
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 15]: Then the rain came pattering down , and the wind howled louder than before .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 22]: In a minute or two the darkness became so intense that he could hardly find his way back to the tents .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 18]: He turned round , but could not see , for he was blinded by the heavy rain .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 32]: As nothing could be done , he went into the tent and sheltered himself from the storm , although he would not lie down , lest his services might be required .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 25]: The others had retired to bed , but with the exception of Tommy and the children , they had not taken off their clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 35]: Chapter XVIII The storm now raged furiously , the lightning was accompanied by loud peals of thunder , and the children awoke and cried with fright , till they were hushed to sleep again .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 22]: The wind howled as it pressed with all its violence against the tents , while the rain poured off in torrents .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 48]: One moment the canvas of the tents would bulge in , and the cords which held it strain and crack ; at another , an eddy of wind would force out the canvas , which would flap and flap , while the rain found many an entrance .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 24]: The tent in which Mrs. Seagrave and the children reposed was on the outside of the others , and therefore the most exposed .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 13]: About midnight the wind burst on them with greater violence than before .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 42]: A loud crash was heard by Ready and Mr. Seagrave , followed by the shrieks of Mrs. Seagrave and Juno ; the pegs of the tent had given way , and the inmates were exposed to the fury of the elements .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 11]: Ready rushed out , followed by Mr. Seagrave and William .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 34]: So strong was the wind and beating rain , and such was the darkness , that it was with some difficulty that by their united efforts the women and children could be extricated .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 21]: Tommy was the first taken up by Ready : his courage had all gone , and he was bellowing furiously .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 24]: William took Albert in charge and carried him into the other tent , where Tommy sat in his wet shirt roaring most melodiously .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 43]: Juno , Mrs. Seagrave , and the little girl were at last carried away and taken into the other tent : fortunately no one was hurt , although the frightened children could not be pacified , and joined in chorus with Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 50]: Nothing more could be done except to put the children into bed , and then the whole party sat up the remainder of the night listening to the noise of the wind , the roaring of the sea , and the loud patter of the rain against the canvas .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 155]: At dawn of day , Ready went out , and found that the gale had spent its force , and had already much abated ; but it was not one of those bright glorious mornings to which they had been accustomed since their arrival at the island : the sky was still dark , and the clouds were chasing each other wildly ; there was neither sun nor blue sky to be seen : it still rained , but only at intervals , and the earth was soft and spongy ; the little cove , but the day before so beautiful , was now a mass of foaming and tumultuous waves , and the surf was thrown many yards upon the beach : the horizon was confused - you could not distinguish the line between the water and the sky , and the whole shore of the island was lined with a white foam .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 56]: Ready turned his eyes to where the ship had been fixed on the rocks : it was no longer there - the whole frame had disappeared ; but the fragments of it , and the contents of the holds , were floating about in every direction , or tossing amongst the surf on the beach .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 44]: `` I thought as much , '' said Ready , pointing to where the ship had lain , as he turned round and found that Mr. Seagrave had followed him ; `` look , sir , this gale has broken her up entirely .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 34]: This is a warning to us not to remain here any longer : we must make the most of the fine weather which we may have before the rainy season sets in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 34]: `` I agree with you , Ready , '' replied Mr. Seagrave , - `` and there is another proof of it , '' pointing to the tent which had been blown down .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 13]: `` It was a mercy that none of them were hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 20]: `` Very true , sir ; but the gale is breaking , and we shall have fine weather to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 25]: Let us now see what we can do with the tent , while William and Juno try if they can get any breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 5]: They set to work .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 30]: Ready and Mr. Seagrave made it fast with fresh cords and pegs , and very soon had it all ready ; but the beds and bedding were wet through .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 24]: They hauled over the wet canvas , and then left it to go to their breakfast , to which Juno had summoned them .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 30]: `` We need do no more at present , '' said Ready , `` by night-time it will not be so wet , and we can handle it easier .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 14]: I see a break in the sky now which promises fine weather soon .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 39]: And now we had better work hard to-day , for we may save a great many things , which may be dashed to pieces on the rocks , if we do not haul them on the beach . ''
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 9]: Chapter XIX They went down to the beach .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 49]: Ready first procured from the stores a good stout rope ; and as the waves threw up casks and timbers of the vessel , they stopped them from being washed back again , and either rolled or hauled them up with the rope until they were safely landed .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 46]: This occupied them for the major part of the day ; and yet they had not collected a quarter of the articles that were in their reach , independent of the quantity which floated about out at sea and at the entrance of the cove .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 48]: `` I think , '' said Ready , `` we have done a good day 's work ; tomorrow we shall be able to do much more , for the sea is going down , and the sun is showing himself from the corner of that cloud .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 22]: Now we will go to supper , and then see if we can make ourselves more comfortable for the night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 30]: The tent which had not been blown down was given to Mrs. Seagrave and the children , and the other was fitted up as well as it could be .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 61]: The bedding being all wet , they procured some sails from the stores , which , being stowed away farther in the grove , had not suffered much from the tempest ; and , spreading the canvas , they lay down , and the night passed without any disaster , for the wind was now lulled to a pleasant breeze .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 31]: The next morning the sun shone bright - the air was fresh and bracing ; but a slight breeze rippled the waters , and there was little or no surf .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 42]: The various fragments of the wreck were tossed by the little surf that still remained ; many things were lying on the beach which had landed during the night , and many more required but a little trouble to secure them .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 34]: There appeared to be a sort of in draught into the cove , as all the articles which had been floating out at sea were now gradually coming on shore in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 21]: Ready and Mr. Seagrave worked till breakfast-time , and had by that time saved a great many casks and packages .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 14]: After breakfast they went down again to the beach and resumed their labours .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 10]: `` Look , Ready ; what is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 20]: said William , who was with them , as he pointed to a white-looking mass floating in the cove .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 37]: `` That , sir , is the poor cow ; and if you look again , you will see the sharks are around , making a feast of her : do n't you see them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 11]: `` Yes , I do - what a quantity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 46]: `` Yes , there 's no want of them , William ; so be very careful how you get into the water , and never let Tommy go near it , for they do n't care how shallow it is when they see their food .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 42]: But now , sir , '' said Ready , `` I must leave you and William to do what you can in saving any more of the wreck , while I set to and put the boat in proper repair . ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 15]: Ready left them at their own employment , and went away for his tools .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 29]: During this time Mr. Seagrave and William occupied themselves in collecting the different articles thrown on shore , and rolling up the casks as far as they could .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 67]: As it would take some days for Ready to put the boat into proper order , Mr. Seagrave determined that he would go to the other side of the island with William , that he might examine it himself ; and , as Mrs. Seagrave had no objection to be left with Ready and Juno , on the third day after the gale they set off .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 28]: William led the way , guiding his footsteps through the grove by the blazing of the cocoa-nut trees ; and in two hours they reached their destination .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 9]: `` Is not this beautiful , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 3]: said William .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 16]: `` Yes , indeed it is , my dear boy , '' replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 31]: `` I fancied that nothing could be more beautiful than the spot where we reside , but this surpasses it , not only in variety , but in extent . ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 22]: `` And now let us examine the spring , father , '' said William , leading the way to the ravine .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 12]: The spring was full and flowing , and the water excellent .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 24]: They then directed their steps towards the sandy beach , and , having walked some time , sat down upon a coral rock .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 49]: `` Who would have ever imagined , William , '' said Mr. Seagrave , `` that this island , and so many more which abound in the Pacific Ocean , could have been raised by the work of little insects not bigger than a pin 's head ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 6]: `` Insects , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 3]: replied William .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 5]: `` Yes , insects .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 10]: Give me that piece of dead coral , William .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 14]: Do you see that on every branch there are a hundred little holes ?
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 29]: Well , in every one of these little holes once lived a sea-insect ; and as these insects increase , so do the branches of the coral-trees . ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 22]: `` Yes , I understand that ; but how do you make out that this island was made by them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 21]: `` Almost all the islands in these seas have been made by the labour and increase of these small animals .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 93]: The coral grows at first at the bottom of the sea , where it is not disturbed by the winds or waves : by degrees , as it increases , it advances higher and higher to the surface , till at last it comes near to the top of the water ; then it is stopped in its growth by the force of the winds and waves , which break it off , and of course it never grows above the water , for if it did the animals would die . ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 10]: `` Then how does it become an island ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 77]: `` By very slow degrees ; the time , perhaps , much depending upon chance : for instance , a log of wood floating about , and covered with barnacles , may ground upon the coral reefs ; that would be a sufficient commencement , for it would remain above water , and then shelter the coral to leeward of it , until a flat rock had formed , level with the edge of the water .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 81]: The sea-birds are always looking for a place to rest upon , and they would soon find it , and then their droppings would , in course of time , form a little patch above water , and other floating substances would be thrown on it ; and land-birds , who are blown out to sea , might rest themselves on it , and the seeds from their stomachs , when dropped , would grow into trees or bushes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 6]: `` I understand that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 42]: `` Well then , William , you observe there is an island commenced , as it were , and , once commenced , it soon increases , for the coral would then be protected to leeward , and grow up fast .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 41]: Do you observe how the coral reefs extend at this side of the island , where they are protected from the winds and waves ; and how different it is on the weather side , which we have just left ?
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 146]: Just so the little patch above water protects the corals to leeward , and there the island increases fast ; for the birds not only settle on it , hut they make their nests and rear their young , and so every year the soil increases ; and then , perhaps , one cocoa-nut in its great outside shell at last is thrown on these little patches - it takes root , and becomes a tree , every year shedding its large branches , which are turned into mould as soon as they decay , and then dropping its nuts , which again take root and grow in this mould ; and thus they continue , season after season , and year after year , until the island becomes as large and as thickly covered with trees as the one we are now standing upon .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 9]: Is not this wonderful , my dear boy ?
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 36]: Is not he a great and good God who can make such minute animals as these work his pleasure , and at the time he thinks fit produce such a beautiful island as this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 6]: `` Indeed he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 3]: exclaimed William .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 19]: `` We only need use our eyes , William , and we shall love as well as adore .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 11]: Look at that shell - is it not beautifully marked ?
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 13]: - could the best painter in the world equal its colouring ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 12]: `` No , indeed , - I should think not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 19]: `` And yet there are thousands of them in sight , and perhaps millions more in the water .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 40]: They have not been coloured in this way to be admired , like the works of man ; for this island has been till now probably without any one upon it , and no one has ever seen them .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 19]: It makes no difference to Him , who has but to wish , and all is complete . ''
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 16]: For a few minutes after this conversation , Mr. Seagrave and William were both silent .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 41]: Mr. Seagrave then rose from where he was sitting : `` Come , William , let us now find our way back again ; we have three hours ' daylight left , and shall be home in good time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 17]: Chapter XX Everything was now preparing for their removal to the leeward side of the island .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 22]: Ready had nearly completed the boat ; he had given it a thorough repair , and fitted a mast and sail .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 89]: William and Mr. Seagrave continued to collect and secure the various articles thrown on shore , particularly such as would be injured by their exposure to the weather : these they rolled or carried into the cocoa-nut grove , so as to be sheltered from the sun ; but there were so many things thrown on shore day after day , that they hardly knew what they had : but they secured case and cask one after another , waiting for a better opportunity to examine their contents .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 39]: At last they collected a great many articles together , and , with their shovels , covered them over with sand , it being impossible to get them from the beach without more time than they could spare .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 17]: Neither was Mrs. Seagrave , who was now getting quite strong , or Juno , idle .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 15]: They had made up everything that they could in packages , ready for moving .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 41]: On the eighth day after the gale , they were ready , and it was arranged that Ready should put into the boat the bedding and canvas of one tent , and should take William with him on his expedition .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 77]: Having transported this safe , he should return for a load of the most necessary articles , and then the family should walk through the grove to the other side of the island , and remain there with Mr. Seagrave while Ready and William returned for the other tent ; and after that , the boat should make as many trips as the weather would permit , till they had brought all the things absolutely required .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 46]: It was a lovely calm morning when Ready and William pushed off in the boat , which was well loaded ; and as soon as they were clear of the cove they hoisted the sail , and went away before the wind along the coast .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 65]: In two hours they had run to the eastern end of the island , and hauled up close inshore : the point which ran out , and at the end of which there was an inlet , was not a mile from them , and in a very short time they had lowered the sail , and were pulling in for the sandy beach .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 37]: `` You see , William , it is fortunate for us that we shall always have a fair wind when we come down loaded , and only have to pull our empty boat back again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 5]: `` Indeed it is .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 19]: How many miles do you think it is from the cove to this part of the island ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 20]: `` About six or seven , not more : the island , you see , is long and narrow .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 26]: Now let us get the things out and carry them up , and then we will be back to the cove long before dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 17]: The boat was soon unloaded , but they had some way to carry up the things .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 42]: `` We shall not mind such a gale as we had the other day when our tents are pitched here , William , '' said Ready , `` for we shall be protected by the whole width of the cocoa-nut grove .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 22]: We shall hardly feel the wind , although we shall the rain , for that will come down in torrents . ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 25]: `` I must go and see how our spring gets on , '' said William , `` and get a drink from it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 23]: Willy reported the spring to be up to the brim with water , and that he had never drunk water so excellent .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 43]: They then pushed off the boat , and , after rowing for about two hours or more , found themselves at the entrance of the cove , and Mrs. Seagrave , with Tommy by her side , waving her handkerchief to them .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 43]: They very soon pulled in to the beach , and , landing , received the congratulations of the whole party at their first successful voyage , and all expressed their delight at its having proved so much shorter than had been anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 12]: `` Tommy will go next time , '' said Master Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 16]: `` By and by , when Tommy grows a little taller , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 17]: `` Massa Tommy , you come help me to milk the goats , '' said Juno .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 18]: `` Yes , Tommy milk the goats , '' said the little urchin , running after Juno .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 50]: `` You must be almost tired of eating nothing but salt meat and biscuit , ma'am , '' said Ready , as they sat down to their meal ; `` but when we are all safe on the other side of the island we hope to feed you better .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 11]: At present it is hard work and hard fare . ''
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 54]: `` As long as the children are well , I care very little about it ; but I must say that , after the last gale , I am as anxious as you to be on the other side of the island , especially after the account William has given me of it .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 6]: It must be a paradise !
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 7]: When do we set off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 35]: `` Not till the day after to-morrow , ma'am , I should think ; for you see I must have another trip for the cooking utensils and the bundles which you have made up .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 28]: If you will spare Juno to walk through the wood with William to-morrow , we will then have the tent ready for you and the children . ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 51]: Chapter XXI Old Ready had his boat loaded and had made sail for the other side of the island long before the family were up ; indeed , before they were dressed he had landed his whole cargo on the beach , and was sitting down quietly taking his breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 61]: As soon as he had eaten the beef and biscuit which he had taken with him , he carried up the things which he had brought , and commenced arrangements for setting up the tent , intending to await the arrival of William and Juno , that they might assist him in getting up the spars and canvas over it .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 22]: About ten o'clock William made his appearance , leading one of the goats by a string , followed by the others .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 23]: Juno came after with the sheep , also holding one with a cord ; the rest had very quietly joined the procession .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 8]: `` Here we are at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 41]: said William laughing ; `` we have had terrible work in the woods , for Nanny would run on one side of a tree when I went on the other , and then I had to let go the string .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 16]: We fell in with the pigs again , and Juno gave such a squall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 11]: `` I tink 'em wild beast , '' said Juno .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 5]: what a nice place !
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 8]: Missis will like to live here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 30]: `` Yes , it is a very nice place , Juno ; and you 'll be able to wash here , and never mind about saving the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 34]: `` I am thinking , '' said William , `` how we are to get the fowls here ; they are not very wild , but still we can not catch them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 12]: `` I 'll bring them with me to-morrow , William . ''
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 9]: `` But how will you catch them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 20]: `` Wait till they are gone to roost , and then you may catch them when you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 14]: `` And I suppose the pigeons and the pigs must run wild ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 11]: `` The best thing we can do with them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 13]: `` Then we shall have to shoot them , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 27]: `` Well , William , so we shall ; and the pigeons also , when they have become plentiful , if we remain here so long .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 11]: We shall soon be well stocked and live in plenty .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 45]: But now you must help me to get the tent up and everything in order , so that your mamma may find things comfortable on her arrival , for she will be very tired , I dare say , walking through the wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 13]: `` Mamma is much better than she was , '' replied William .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 23]: `` I think she will soon be quite strong again , especially when she comes to live at this beautiful place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 45]: `` We have a great deal of work to do , more than we can get through before the rainy season ; which is a pity , but it ca n't helped ; by this time next year we shall be more comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 19]: `` Why , what have we to do besides putting up the tents and shifting over here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 20]: `` In the first place we have to build a house , and that will take a long while .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 23]: Then we ought to make a little garden , and sow the seeds which your father brought from England with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 3]: `` 0h !
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 14]: that will be nice ; where shall we make it , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 26]: `` We must put a fence across that point of land , and dig up all the brushwood ; the mould is very good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 6]: `` Then what next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 49]: `` Then we shall want a storehouse for all the things we have got , and all that are in the wood and on the beach : and consider what a many trips we shall have to make with the little boat to bring them all round . ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 10]: `` Yes , that is very true , Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 8]: Have we anything more to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 24]: `` Plenty ; we have to build a turtle-pond and a fish-pond , and a bathing-place for Juno to wash the children in .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 35]: But first we must make a proper well at the spring , so as to have plenty of fresh water : now there 's enough for a year 's hard work at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 20]: `` Well , let us once get mamma and the children here , and we will work hard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 18]: `` I should wish very much to see it all done , William , '' said Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 18]: `` I hope my life will be spared till it is done , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 10]: `` But why do you say that , Ready ?
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 14]: you are an old man , but you are strong and healthy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 13]: `` I am so now ; but what does the Book say ?
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 13]: - ` In the midst of life we are in death ' .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 23]: You are young and healthy , and promise a long life ; but who knows but you may be summoned away tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 19]: Can I , then , an old man , worn out with hardships , expect to live long ?
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 6]: No - no , William !
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 25]: Still I should like to remain here as long as I can be useful , and then I trust I may depart in peace .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 23]: I never wish to leave this island ; and I have a kind of feeling that my bones will remain on it .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 7]: God 's will be done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 38]: For some time after Ready had finished , neither of them said a word , but continued their employment , stretching out the canvas of the tent , and fastening it down to the ground with pegs .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 7]: At last William broke the silence .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 14]: `` Ready , did you not say your Christian name was Masterman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 8]: `` So it is , William . ''
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 9]: `` It is a very odd Christian name !
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 9]: You were called after some other person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 16]: `` Yes , I was , William ; he was a very rich man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 37]: `` Do you know , Ready , I should like very much if you will one day tell me your history - I mean your whole life , from the time you were a boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 38]: `` Well , perhaps I may , William ; for there are many parts of my life which would prove a lesson to others : but that must be after we have got through our work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 9]: `` How old are you , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 15]: `` I am turned of sixty-four ; a very old age for a seaman .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 24]: I could not obtain employment on board of a vessel if it were not that I am well known to several captains . ''
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 14]: `` But why do you say ` old for a seaman ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 44]: `` Because sailors live faster than other people , partly from the hardships which they undergo , and partly from their own fault in drinking so much spirits ; and then they are too often reckless and care nothing for their healths . ''
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 9]: `` But you never drink spirits now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 19]: `` No , never , William ; but in my early days I was as foolish as others .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 11]: Now , Juno , you may bring in the bedding .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 17]: We have two or three hours yet , William ; what shall we do next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 14]: `` Had we not better make the fireplace all ready for cooking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 15]: `` It was what I was going to propose , if you had not .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 25]: I shall be here to-morrow long before any of you , and I will take care that supper is ready on your arrival . ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 40]: `` I brought a bottle of water in my knapsack , '' replied William , `` not so much for the water , as because I want to milk the goats and take back the milk for baby . ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 41]: `` You proved yourself not only thoughtful but kind , William : now while you and Juno fetch the stones for the fireplace , I will stow away under the trees the things I have brought in the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 13]: `` Shall we let the goats and sheep loose , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 33]: `` Oh , yes , - there is no fear of their straying ; the herbage here is better than on the other side , and there is plenty of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 16]: `` Well , I will let Nanny go as soon as Juno has milked her .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 17]: Now , Juno , let us see how many stones we can carry at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 36]: In an hour the fireplace was made , Ready had done all that he could , the goats were milked and let loose , and then William and Juno set off on their journey back .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 7]: Ready went down to the beach .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 29]: On his arrival there , he observed a small turtle : creeping up softly he got between it and the water , and succeeded in turning it over .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 37]: `` That will do for to-morrow , '' said he , as he stepped into the boat ; and laying hold of the oars , he pulled out of the bay to return to the cove .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 32]: Chapter XXII Ready arrived at the cove , and proceeded to the tents , where he found the whole party listening to William , who was detailing what had been done .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 15]: The arrangements for the next day were made as soon as Ready joined them .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 38]: They then separated for the night , but Ready and William remained until it was dark , to catch the fowls and tie their legs , ready for their being put in the boat the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 31]: At daylight all were summoned to dress themselves as soon as possible , as Ready wanted to take down the tent in which Mrs. Seagrave and the children had slept .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 26]: For , with the exception of Tommy , the others had slept upon some canvas , which they had spread out under the cocoa-nut trees .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 26]: As soon as Mrs. Seagrave was dressed , the tent was taken down , and , with all the bedding , put into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 44]: Then , when they had breakfasted , the plates , knives and forks , and some other necessaries , were also put in ; Ready laid the fowls on the top of all , and set off by himself for their new location .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 19]: After he was gone , the rest of the party prepared for their journey through the cocoa-nut grove .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 38]: William led the way , with the three dogs close to his heels , Mr. Seagrave with the baby in his arms , Juno with little Caroline , and Mrs. Seagrave with Master Tommy holding her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 32]: They cast a last look round at the cove , and the fragments of the wreck and cargo , strewed about in every direction , and then turned into the wood .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 22]: Ready arrived at the point , and was again on shore in less than two hours after he had set off .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 43]: As soon as the boat was safe in , he did not wait to land his cargo , but going up to the turtle which he had turned the day before , he killed it , and cleaned it on the beach .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 91]: He then went to where they had built up the fireplace with stones , made a fire , filled the iron saucepan full of water , and set it on to boil ; he then cut up a portion of the turtle , and put it into the pot , with some slices of salt pork , covered it up , and left it to boil ; and having hung up the rest of the turtle in the shade , he went back to the beach to unload the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 15]: He released the poor fowls , and they were soon busy seeking for food .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 50]: It was two or three hours before he had carried everything up , for it was a good distance , and some of the articles were heavy , and the old man was not sorry when he had finished his task , and could sit down to rest himself .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 23]: `` It 's almost time they arrived , '' thought Ready ; `` they must have started nearly four hours ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 30]: Ready remained a quarter of an hour more watching the fire , and occasionally skimming the top of the pot , when the three dogs came bounding towards him .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 15]: `` Well , they are not far off now , '' observed Old Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 18]: In six or seven minutes afterwards the party made their appearance , very hot and very fatigued .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 117]: It appeared that poor little Caroline had been tired out , and Juno had to carry her ; then Mrs. Seagrave complained of fatigue , and they had to rest a quarter of an hour ; then Tommy , who refused to remain with his mamma , and had been running backwards and forwards from one to the other , had declared that he was tired , and that someone must carry him ; but there was no one to carry him , so he began to cry until they stopped for another quarter of an hour till he was rested ; then as soon as they went on again he again complained of being tired .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 60]: William then carried him pickaback for some time , and in so doing he missed the blaze-cut on the trees , and it was a long while before he could find it again ; then baby became hungry , and he cried , and little Caroline was frightened at being so long in the wood , and she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 47]: But finally they got on better , and arrived at last so warm and exhausted , that Mrs. Seagrave went into the tent with the children to repose a little , before she could even look at the place which was to be their future residence .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 35]: `` I think , '' said Mr. Seagrave , `` that this little journey of to-day has been a pretty good proof of how helpless we should have been without you , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 31]: `` I am glad that you are here , sir , '' replied Ready , `` it is a weight off my mind ; now you will get on better .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 21]: I think that after a while you may live very comfortably here ; but still we have much to do .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 34]: As soon as Madam has rested , we will have our dinner and then fix up our own tent , which will be quite enough after such a hard day 's work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 13]: `` Do you go back to the cove to-morrow , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 41]: `` Yes , sir , we want our stores here ; it will take about three trips to empty our storehouses ; and as to the other things , we can examine them and bring them down at our leisure .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 21]: As soon as I have made those three trips in the boat , we can then work here altogether . ''
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 11]: `` But I can do something in the meantime . ''
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 13]: `` Oh yes , there is plenty for you to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 26]: Mr. Seagrave went into the tent , and found his wife much refreshed ; but the children had all fallen fast asleep on the beds .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 21]: They waited another half-hour , and then woke Tommy and Caroline , that they might all sit down to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 29]: `` Dear me , '' exclaimed William , as Ready took the cover off the saucepan , `` what is it that you have so good there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 16]: `` It 's a treat I have prepared for you all , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 22]: `` I know that you are tired of salt meat , so now you are going to feed like aldermen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 10]: `` Why , what is it , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 11]: said Mrs. Seagrave ; `` it smells very good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 39]: `` It is turtle-soup , ma'am ; and I hope you will like it ; for , if you do , you may often have it , now that you are on this side of the island . ''
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 15]: `` Indeed , it really is excellent ; but it wants a little salt .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 8]: Have you any salt , Juno ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 7]: `` Got a little , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 8]: Very little left , '' replied Juno .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 13]: `` What shall we do when all our salt is gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 4]: said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 11]: `` Juno must get some more , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 6]: `` How I get salt ?
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 13]: - hab none left , '' replied Juno , looking at Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 19]: `` There 's plenty out there , Juno , '' said Mr. Seagrave , pointing to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 16]: `` I do n't know where , '' said Juno , looking in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 10]: `` What do you mean , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 4]: inquired Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 48]: `` I only mean if we want salt we can have as much as we please by boiling down salt-water in the kettle , or else making a salt-pan in the rocks , and obtaining it by the sun drying up the water and leaving the salt .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 16]: Salt is always procured in that way , either by evaporation , or boiling . ''
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 29]: `` I 'll soon arrange that for you , ma'am , '' said Ready , `` and show Juno how to get it when she wants it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 42]: `` I am very glad to hear you say so ; for I should feel the want of salt very much , '' replied Mrs. Seagrave , `` I really never enjoyed a dinner so much as I have to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 8]: The soup was pronounced excellent by everybody .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 39]: As soon as they had finished , Mrs. Seagrave remained with the children ; and Ready and Mr. Seagrave , assisted by Juno and William , got the second tent up , and everything ready for the night .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 34]: They then all assembled , and returned thanks to God for their having gained their new abode ; and , tired out with the fatigue of the day , were soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 51]: Chapter XXIII Mr. Seagrave was the first up on the ensuing morning ; and when Ready came out of the tent , he said to him , `` Do you know , Ready , I feel much happier and my mind much more at ease since I find myself here .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 52]: On the other side of the island everything reminded me that we had been shipwrecked ; and I could not help thinking of home and my own country ; but here we appear as if we had been long settled , and as if we had come here by choice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 27]: `` I trust that feeling will be stronger every day , sir ; for it 's no use , and indeed sinful , to repine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 10]: `` I acknowledge it , and with all humility .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 14]: What is the first thing which you wish we should set about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 31]: `` I think , sir , the first object is to have a good supply of fresh water ; and I therefore wish you and William - Here he is .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 30]: Good-morning , William - I was saying that I thought it better that Mr. Seagrave and you should clear out the spring while I am away in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 33]: I brought another shovel with me yesterday , and you both can work ; perhaps we had better go there , as Juno , I see , is getting the breakfast ready .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 45]: You observe , Mr. Seagrave , we must follow up the spring till we get among the cocoa-nut trees , where it will be shaded from the sun ; that is easily done by digging towards them , and watching how the water flows .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 76]: Then , if you will dig out a hole large enough to sink down in the earth one of the water-casks which lie on the beach , I will bring it down with me this afternoon ; and then , when it is fixed in the earth in that way , we shall always have the cask full of water for use , and the spring filling it as fast as we empty it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 21]: `` I understand , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` that shall be our task while you are absent . ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 36]: `` Now , I have nothing more to do than to speak to Juno about dinner , '' replied Ready ; `` and then I 'll just take a mouthful , and be off . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 68]: Ready directed Juno to fry some pork in the frying-pan , and then to cut off some slices from the turtle , and cook turtle-steaks for dinner , as well as to warm up the soup which was left ; and then , with a biscuit and a piece of beef in his hand , he went down to the boat and set off for the cove .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 30]: Mr. Seagrave and William worked hard ; and , by twelve o'clock , the hole was quite large and deep enough , according to the directions Ready had given .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 11]: They then left their work and went to the tent .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 34]: `` You do n't know how much happier I am now that I am here , '' said Mrs. Seagrave , taking her husband 's hand , as he seated himself by her .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 19]: `` I trust it is a presentiment of future happiness , my dear , '' said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 20]: `` I assure you that I feel the same , and was saying so to Ready this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 35]: `` I feel that I could live here for ever , it is so calm and beautiful ; but I miss one thing - there are no birds singing here as at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 16]: `` I have seen no birds except sea-birds , and of them there is plenty .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 6]: Have you , William ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 6]: `` Only once , father .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 9]: I saw a flight a long way off .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 30]: Ready was not with me , and I could not tell what they were ; but they were large birds , as big as pigeons , I should think .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 12]: There is Ready coming round the point , '' continued William .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 8]: `` How fast that little boat sails !
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 20]: It is a long pull , though , for the old man when he goes to the cove . ''
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 22]: `` Let us go down and help Ready carry up some of the things before dinner , '' said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 18]: They did so ; and William rolled up the empty water-cask which Ready had brought with him .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 30]: The turtle-steaks were as much approved of as the turtle-soup ; indeed , after having been so long on salt meat , a return to fresh provisions was delightful .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 19]: `` And now to finish our well , '' said William , as soon as dinner was over .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 10]: `` How hard you do work , William ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 4]: said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 7]: `` So I ought , mother .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 9]: I must learn to do everything now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 12]: `` And that you will very soon , '' said Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 31]: They rolled the cask to the spring , and , to their astonishment , found the great hole which they had dug not two hours before quite full of water .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 25]: `` Oh dear , '' said William , `` we shall have to throw all the water out to get the cask down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 28]: `` Think a little , William , '' said Mr. Seagrave , `` for the spring runs so fast that it will not be an easy task .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 8]: Can not we do something else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 17]: `` Why , father , the cask will float , you know , '' replied William .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 21]: `` To be sure it will as it is ; but is there no way of making it sink ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 4]: `` Oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 24]: I know - we must bore some holes in the bottom , and then it will fill and sink down of itself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 7]: `` Exactly , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 20]: `` I expected that we should have to do that , and have the big gimlet with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 31]: Ready bored three or four holes in the bottom of the cask , and as it floated the water ran into it , and by degrees it gradually sank down .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 30]: As soon as the top of the cask was level with the surface they filled in all round with the spade and shovel , and the well was completed .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 104]: Chapter XXIV The next morning , as soon as breakfast was over , Mr. Seagrave observed : `` Now that we have so many things to do , I think , Ready , we ought to lay down a plan of operations ; method is everything when work is to be done : now tell me what you propose shall be our several occupations for the next week , for to-morrow is Sunday ; and although we have not yet been able to honour the day as we should , I think that now we must and ought to keep it holy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 45]: `` To-morrow we will rest from our labour , and ask God 's blessing upon our endeavours during the six days of the week ; and now , as to your proposition , Mr. Seagrave , shall we begin first with the lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 28]: `` You must not consider that you have ladies with you now , Ready , '' said Mrs. Seagrave , `` at least , not fine ladies .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 16]: My health and strength are recovering fast , and I mean to be very useful .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 45]: I propose to assist Juno in all the domestic duties , such as the cookery and washing , to look after and teach the children , mend all the clothes , and make all that is required , to the best of my ability .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 9]: If I can do more I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 17]: `` I think we may be satisfied with that , Mr. Seagrave , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 58]: `` Now , sir , the two most pressing points , with the exception of building the house , are to dig up a piece of ground , and plant our potatoes and seeds ; and to make a turtle-pond , so as to catch the turtle and put them in before the season is over . ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 20]: `` You are right , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` but which ought to be done first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 25]: `` I should say the turtle-pond , as it will be only a few days ' work for you , Juno , and William .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 11]: I shall not want your assistance for this next week .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 71]: I shall fix upon some spot , not far from here , where the trees are thickest in the grove , and cut them down so as to clear out a space in which we will , by and by , build our storerooms ; and , as soon as the rainy season has gone by , we can remove all our stores from the other side of the island .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 43]: It will occupy me the whole of the week , cutting down the trees and sawing them into proper lengths , ready for building the house , and then we must all join our strength and get it up without delay . ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 12]: `` Can you really manage to get it up in time ?
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 12]: How soon do you expect the rains will come on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 7]: `` In three or four weeks .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 20]: After next week , I shall probably have the assistance of two of you , if not of all .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 14]: Now I think of it , I must return to the cove . ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 26]: `` Do n't you recollect , sir , your two-wheeled carriage , packed up in matting , which was thrown on shore in the gale ?
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 61]: You laughed when you saw it , and said it would be of little use now ; but the wheels and axle will he very useful , as we can make a wide path to the place when I cut down the trees , and wheel out the logs much more easily than we can drag or carry them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 7]: `` That is an excellent idea .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 10]: It will save a great deal of labour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 9]: `` I expect that it will , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 17]: William and I will go away early on Monday morning , and be back before breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 28]: To-day we will fix upon the spots where our garden is to be , our turtle-pond to be made , and the trees to be cut down .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 24]: That shall be our business , Mr. Seagrave ; and William and Juno may put things a little more to rights here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 105]: Mr. Seagrave and Ready then walked down to the beach , and , after surveying the reefs for some time , Ready said , `` You see , Mr. Seagrave , we do not want too much water for a turtle-pond , as , if it is too deep , there is a difficulty in catching them when we want them : what we want is a space of water surrounded by a low wall of stones , so that the animals can not escape , for they can not climb up , although they can walk on the shelving sand with their flippers .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 44]: Now the reef here is high out of the water , and the space within the reef and the beach is deep enough , and the rocks on the beach nearly fill up that side and prevent them crawling away by the shore .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 27]: We have , therefore , little more to do than to fill up the two other sides , and then our pond will be complete . ''
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 25]: `` I see it will not be a long job either , if we can find loose rocks enough , '' replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 49]: `` Almost all those which are on the beach are loose , '' replied Ready , `` and there are plenty close to us : some of them will be too heavy to carry , but they can be brought here by the aid of handspikes and crowbars .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 17]: Suppose we make a signal for William and Juno , and set them to work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 17]: Mr. Seagrave called and waved his hat , and Juno and William came down to them .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 21]: Juno was ordered to go back for two handspikes , while Ready explained to William what was to be done .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 45]: Having stayed with them and assisted them for some time after Juno had returned with the implements , Mr. Seagrave and Ready proceeded to the point , to fix upon a spot for a garden , leaving William and Juno to continue their labour .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 34]: Chapter XXV Mr. Seagrave and Ready then continued their way along the beach , until they arrived at the point which the latter had considered as a convenient place to make the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 30]: They found a sufficiency of mould ; and as the point was narrow at its joining on to the mainland , no great length of enclosure would be required .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 46]: `` You see , sir , '' said Ready , `` we can wait till after the rainy season is over before we put up the fence , and we can prepare it in the meantime , when the weather will permit us to work .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 38]: The seeds and potatoes will not come up until after the rains are finished ; so all we have to do is to dig up the ground , and put them in as fast as we can .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 29]: We can not make a large garden this year ; but our potatoes we must contrive to get in , if we can not manage anything else . ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 39]: `` If we have no fence to make , '' replied Mr. Seagrave , `` I think we shall be able to clear away quite enough ground in a week to put in all that we require . ''
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 37]: `` The first job will be to pull up the small brushwood , '' said Ready , `` and turn up the ground ; the larger plants we must leave , if we have not time .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 39]: Tommy might be of some use here in taking away the shrubs as you pull them up ; but we had better now go on to the grove , and choose the spot for cutting down the trees .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 7]: I have made my mark . ''
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 43]: Ready and Mr. Seagrave proceeded in the direction which the former had pointed out , until they arrived at a spot on a rising ground , where the trees were so thick that it was not very easy to pass through them .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 10]: `` There is the place , '' said Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 40]: `` I propose to cut all the timber we want for the houses out of this part of the grove , and to leave an open square place , in the centre of which we will build our storerooms .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 51]: You see , sir , if necessary , with a very little trouble we might turn it into a place of protection and defence , as a few palisades here and there between the trees would make it , what they call in the East Indies , a stockade . ''
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 18]: `` Very true , but I trust we shall not require it for such a purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 28]: `` I hope so too , but there is nothing like being prepared ; however , we have plenty to do before we can think of that .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 24]: Now , sir , as dinner is ready , suppose we return , and after dinner we will both commence our tasks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 13]: Juno and William returned to the dinner which Mrs. Seagrave had prepared .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 22]: They were both very warm with their work , which was very hard , but very eager to finish their task .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 61]: After dinner was over , Mrs. Seagrave requested her husband , as he was about to go down to the point , with the spade and a small hatchet in his hand , to take Tommy with him , as she had a great deal to do , and could not watch him as well as the baby and Caroline .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 31]: So Mr. Seagrave took Tommy by the hand , and led him to the point , and made him sit down close to him while he cleared away the brushwood .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 44]: Mr. Seagrave worked very hard , and when he had cut down and cleared a portion of the ground , he made Tommy carry away to a little distance , and pile in a heap , the bushes which he had cleared away .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 37]: When Mr. Seagrave had cleared away a large piece of ground with his hatchet , he then took his spade to dig at the roots and turn up the mould , leaving Tommy to amuse himself .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 68]: What Tommy did for about an hour , during which Mr. Seagrave worked very diligently , his father did not observe ; but all of a sudden he began to cry ; and when his father asked him the reason , he did not answer , but only cried the more , until at last he put his hands to his stomach , and roared most lustily .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 35]: As he appeared to be in very great pain , his father left off work , and led him up to the tent , when Mrs. Seagrave came out , alarmed at his cries .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 30]: Ready , who had heard Tommy screaming for so long a while , thought that there might be something serious , and left his work to ascertain the cause .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 26]: When he heard what had passed , he said : `` Depend upon it , the child has eaten something which has made him ill .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 16]: Tell me , Tommy , what did you eat when you were down there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 7]: `` Berries , '' roared Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 12]: `` I thought as much , ma'am , '' said Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 12]: `` I must go and see what the berries were . ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 17]: And the old man hastened down to the place where Mr. Seagrave had been at work .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 29]: In the meantime Mrs. Seagrave was much alarmed lest the child should have poisoned himself , and Mr. Seagrave went to search among the medicines for some castor-oil .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 30]: Ready returned just as he came back to the tent with the bottle of castor-oil , and he told Ready that he was about to give Tommy a dose .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 41]: `` Well , sir , '' replied Ready , who had a plant in his hand , `` I do n't think you should give him any , for it appears to me that he has taken too much already .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 27]: This is , if I recollect right , the castor-oil plant , and here are some of the castor-oil beans which Master Tommy has been eating .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 11]: Tell me , Tommy , did you eat them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' cried Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 34]: `` I thought so : give him a little warm drink , ma'am , and he 'll soon be better : it will teach him not to eat berries or beans again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 26]: What Ready said was true ; nevertheless Master Tommy was very ill for the whole of the day , and was put early to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 74]: Chapter XXVI The next day , when Mr. Seagrave , William , Juno , and Ready were all at work at their allotted tasks , Mrs. Seagrave was sitting down at the front of the tent , the little baby , Albert , crawling close to her , Caroline trying to work with her needle , and Tommy was making holes in the ground , and putting a small stone into each hole .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 9]: `` What are you doing , Tommy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 4]: said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 11]: `` I 'm making a garden , '' replied Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 5]: `` Making a garden !
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 11]: Then you ought to plant some trees in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 20]: `` No ; I 'm sowing seeds : look here , '' replied Tommy , pointing to the stones .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 10]: `` But these are stones , not seeds . ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 18]: `` Well , but I pretend , and that 's the same thing , '' replied Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 31]: `` Not exactly , Tommy ; suppose , instead of eating those beans yesterday , you had only pretended to eat them , would n't it have been better ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 12]: `` I wo n't eat any more , '' replied Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 41]: `` No , not of those beans ; but if you saw anything else which you thought you would like , I am afraid you would eat it , and be as ill and even worse than you were . ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 12]: `` I like cocoa-nuts ; why do n't we have some ?
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 8]: there 's plenty upon the trees . ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 12]: `` But who is to climb up so high , Tommy ?
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 4]: Can you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 17]: `` No ; but why do n't Ready climb , or papa , or William ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 26]: `` I suppose they will get some by and by , when they are not so busy , but they have no time now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 9]: `` I like turtle-soup , '' replied Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 36]: `` William and Juno are making a pond to put turtle in , and then we shall have it oftener ; but we can not have everything we like when we wish for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 20]: `` I like fried fish , '' said Tommy ; `` why do n't we have fried fish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 13]: `` Because every one is too busy to catch them just now .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 24]: Tommy , go and bring your brother Albert back ; he has crawled too near to Billy , and he butts sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 35]: Tommy went after the baby , who was crawling towards the kid , which had now grown pretty large , and as he took up his brother he kicked at the goat 's head .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 19]: `` Do n't do that , Tommy ; he 'll butt at you , and hurt you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 24]: `` I do n't care , '' replied Tommy , holding the baby by one hand while he continued to kick at Billy .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 33]: Billy , however , would not stand it ; he lowered his head , made a butt at Tommy , and he and Albert rolled on the ground one over the other .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 10]: The baby roared , and Tommy began to whimper .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 41]: Mrs. Seagrave ran up to them and caught up the baby ; and Tommy , alarmed , caught hold of his mother 's dress for protection , looking behind him at Billy , who appeared inclined to renew the attack .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 14]: `` Why do n't you mind what is said to you , Tommy ?
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 18]: I told you that he would butt you , '' said Mrs. Seagrave , pacifying the child .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 21]: `` I do n't care for him , '' replied Tommy , who perceived that the goat was walking away .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 30]: `` No , you are very brave now that he has gone ; but you 're a very naughty boy not to mind what is said to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 13]: `` Billy never butts at me , mamma , '' said Caroline .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 31]: `` No , my dear , because you do not tease him ; but your brother is very fond of teasing animals , and so he gets punished and frightened .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 26]: It is very wrong of him to do so , especially as he is told by his father and me that he ought not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 20]: `` You said I was a good boy when I learnt my lesson this morning , '' replied Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 15]: `` Yes , but you should always be good , '' replied his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 19]: `` I ca n't be always good , '' said Tommy ; `` I want my dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 25]: `` It is dinner-time , Tommy , that is certain , but you must wait until they all come home from their work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 17]: `` There 's Ready coming , with a bag on his shoulder , '' replied Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 17]: Ready soon came up to where Mrs. Seagrave was sitting , and laid down the bag .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 26]: `` I 've brought you some young cocoa-nuts , and some old ones also , from the trees that I have been cutting down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 7]: cocoa-nuts - I like cocoa-nuts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 3]: cried Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 25]: `` I told you , Tommy , that we should have some by and by , and they have come sooner than we thought .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 8]: You are very warm , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 32]: `` Yes , ma'am , '' replied Ready , wiping his face ; `` it is rather warm work , for there is no breeze in the grove to cool one .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 23]: Is there anything you want from the other side of the island , for I shall go there directly after dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 28]: `` I must bring the wheels to get the timber out ; for I must clear it away as I go , until the path is finished .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 9]: I must have William to help me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 12]: `` William will like the trip , I do not doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 18]: I do not recollect anything in particular that we want , Ready , '' replied Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 37]: `` There he comes with Juno , and I see Mr. Seagrave has laid down his spade ; so Caroline , dear , take care of Albert , while I get the dinner for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 46]: Ready assisted Mrs. Seagrave , and the dinner was spread out on the ground , for they had not brought the chairs and tables with them to their new residence , as they thought that they could do without them till the house was built .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 16]: William reported that Juno and he would have the turtle-pond complete by the next day .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 42]: Mr. Seagrave had cleared sufficient ground to plant the half-sack of potatoes that they had saved , so that in a day or two they would be able to put all their strength upon the cutting and drawing of the timber .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 39]: After dinner , William and Ready set off in the boat , and , before it was dark , returned with the wheels and axle of the carriage , and several other articles to make up their load .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 59]: Chapter XXVII `` Now , William , '' said Ready , `` if you are not very sleepy , perhaps you would like to come with me to-night , and see if we can not turn some of the turtle , for the season is going away fast , and they will leave the island very soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 24]: As soon as the sun had disappeared , William and Ready went down to the beach , and sat quietly on a rock .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 44]: In a short time , Ready perceived a turtle crawling on the sand , and , desiring William to follow him without speaking , walked softly down by the water 's edge , so as to get between the animal and the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 37]: As soon as the turtle perceived them , it made for the water , but they met it ; and Ready , seizing hold of one of its fore-flippers , turned it over on its back .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 40]: `` You see , William , that is the way to turn a turtle : take care that he does not catch you with his mouth , for , if he did , he would bite the piece out .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 45]: Now the animal can not get away , for he ca n't turn over again , and we shall find him here to-morrow morning ; so we will now walk along the beach , and see if we can not find some more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 13]: Ready and William remained till past midnight , and turned sixteen turtle .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 32]: `` I think that will do , William , for once : we have made a good night 's work of it , for we have provided food for many days .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 11]: Tomorrow we must put them all into the pond . ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 10]: `` How shall we carry such large animals ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 35]: `` We need not carry them ; we must put some old canvas under them , and haul them along by that means ; we can easily do that on the smooth sand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 11]: `` Why do n't we catch some fish , Ready ?
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 9]: We might put them into the turtle-pond . ''
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 21]: `` They would not stay there long , William , nor could we easily get them out if they did .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 49]: I have often thought of getting some lines ready , and yet the time has never come , for I feel sleepy after our day 's work ; but as soon as the house is built , we will have them , and you shall be fisherman-in-chief . ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 14]: `` But the fish will bite at night , will they not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 14]: `` Oh yes , and better than they do in the daytime . ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 51]: `` Well , then , if you will get me a line and show me how , I will fish for an hour or so after the work is done ; I know mamma is getting tired of salt meat , and does not think it good for Caroline . ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 21]: `` Well , then , I will get a bit of candle to-morrow night , and fit up two fishing-lines .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 9]: But I must go with you , William .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 12]: We do n't use much candle , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 30]: `` No , we are too glad to go to bed : but there are two or three boxes of one sort or another up in the cove . ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 17]: The next morning before breakfast all hands were employed in getting the turtle into the pond .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 34]: After breakfast , William and Juno finished the pond where the walls had not been raised high enough ; and , when they returned to dinner , reported that their task was completed .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 60]: Mr. Seagrave also said that he had , he thought , cleared quite ground enough for the present ; and as Mrs. Seagrave wanted Juno to help her to wash the linen that afternoon , it was agreed that William , Ready , and Mr. Seagrave should all go down to the garden , and put in the potatoes .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 27]: Ready worked with the spade , while Mr. Seagrave and William cut the potatoes in pieces , so as to have an eye in each piece .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 42]: When they had finished this work , Mr. Seagrave said - `` Now that we have finished cutting the potatoes , let us go and assist Ready in planting them and the seeds which we have brought down with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 34]: Chapter XXVIII That night Ready sat up for two or three hours working by candle-light -LRB- William keeping him company -RRB- , very busily engaged fitting up the fishing-lines with leads and hooks .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 6]: At last two were complete .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 10]: `` What bait must we use , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 40]: `` I should think that the best would be one of the fish out of the shells which are in the sand ; but a piece of pork fat will , I dare say , do as well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 10]: `` And whereabouts would you fish , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 39]: `` The best place , I should think , would be at the farthermost end of the point , where I got the boat through the reef - the water is deep there close to the rocks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 19]: `` I was thinking , Ready , if those gannets and men-of-war birds would be good eating . ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 26]: `` Not very , William ; they are very tough and very fishy : we must try for those when we can get nothing better .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 25]: Now that we have got in the seeds and potatoes , we must all set to to-morrow morning to fell and carry the timber .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 48]: I think Mr. Seagrave had better use the axe with me ; and you and Juno can , when I have shown you how , hang the timber to the axle , and wheel it out to the place where we have decided upon building the house .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 10]: And now we had better go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 111]: William , however , had made up his mind to do otherwise : he knew that his mother would be very glad to have some fish , and he determined , as the moon shone bright , to try if he could not catch some before he went to bed ; so he waited very quietly till he thought Ready was asleep as well as the others , and then went out with the lines , and went down to the beach , where he picked up three or four shells , and , breaking them between two pieces of rock , took out the fish and baited his hooks .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 7]: He then walked to the point .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 21]: It was a beautiful night ; the water was very smooth , and the moonbeams pierced deep below the surface .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 111]: William threw in his line , and as soon as the lead touched the bottom he pulled it up about a foot , as Ready had instructed him ; and he had not held his line more than half a minute , when it was jerked so forcibly , that not expecting it he was nearly hauled into the water ; as it was , the fish was so strong that the line slipped through his hand and scored his fingers ; but after a time he was able to pull it in , and he landed on the beach a large silver-scaled fish , weighing nine or ten pounds .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 38]: As soon as he had dragged it so far away from the edge of the rocks as to prevent its flapping into the water again , William took out the hook and determined to try for another .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 60]: His line was down as short a time as before , when it was again jerked with violence ; but William was this time prepared , and he let out the line and played the fish till it was tired , and then pulled it up , and found that the second fish was even larger than the first .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 58]: Satisfied with his success , he wound up his lines , and , running a piece of string through the gills of the fish , dragged them back to the tents , and hanged them to the pole , for fear of the dogs eating them ; he then went in , and was soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 26]: The next morning William was the first up , and showed his prizes with much glee ; but Ready was very much displeased with him .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 16]: `` You did very wrong , William , to run the risk which you did .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 23]: If you were resolved to catch fish , why did you not tell me , and I would have gone with you ?
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 77]: You say , yourself , that the fish nearly hauled you into the water ; suppose it had done so , or suppose a small shark instead of one of these gropers -LRB- as we call them -RRB- had taken the bait , you must have been jerked in ; and the rocks are so steep there , that you would not have been able to get out again before a shark had hold of you .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 30]: Think a moment what would have been the distress of your father and the agony and despair of your poor mother , when this news should have arrived . ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 31]: `` I was very wrong , Ready , '' replied William , `` now that I think of it ; but I wanted to surprise and please my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 27]: `` That reason is almost sufficient to plead your pardon , my dear boy , '' replied Ready ; `` but do n't do so again .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 41]: And now let us say no more about it ; nobody will know that you have been in danger , and there 's no harm done ; and you must n't mind an old man scolding you a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 28]: `` No , indeed , Ready , I do not , for I was very thoughtless ; but I had no idea that there was danger . ''
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 15]: `` There 's your mother coming out of her tent , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 5]: `` Good-morning , madam .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 12]: Do you know what William has done for you last night ?
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 21]: Look , here are two beautiful fish , and very excellent eating they are , I can tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 11]: `` I am quite delighted , '' replied Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 32]: Tommy clapped his hands and danced about , crying , `` Fried fish for dinner ; '' and Juno said , `` Have very fine dinner to-day , Missy Caroline . ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 34]: After breakfast they all set out for the grove , where Ready had been cutting down the trees , taking with them the wheels and axle , and a couple of stout ropes .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 32]: Mr. Seagrave and Ready cut down the trees and slung them to the axle , and Juno and William dragged them to the spot where the house was to be built .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 16]: They were not sorry when dinner was ready , for it was very hard work .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 20]: That night , tired as they were , Ready and William went out , and turned eight more turtle .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 36]: They continued felling the cocoa-nut trees and dragging the timber for the remainder of the week , when they considered that they had nearly enough , and on Tuesday morning they commenced building the house .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 23]: Chapter XXIX Ready had cut out and prepared the door-posts and window-frames from timber which he had towed round from the cove .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 112]: He now fixed four poles in the earth upright at each corner , and then , with the assistance of Mr. Seagrave , notched every log of cocoa-nut wood on both sides , where it was to meet with the one crossing it , so that , by laying log upon log alternately , they fitted pretty close , and had only to have the chinks between them filled in with cocoa-nut leaves twisted very tight , and forced between them : this was the work of William and Juno when no more logs were ready for carrying ; and , by degrees , the house rose up from its foundation .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 40]: The fireplace could not be made at once , as they had either to find clay , or to burn shells into lime and build it up with rocks and mortar ; but a space was left for it .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 52]: For three weeks they worked very hard : as soon as the sides were up , they got on the whole of the roof and rafters ; and then , with the broad leaves of the cocoa-nut trees which had been cut down , Ready thatched it very strong and securely .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 42]: At the end of the three weeks the house was secure from the weather ; and it was quite time , for the weather had begun to change , the clouds now gathered thick , and the rainy season was commencing .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 17]: `` We have no time to lose , sir , '' said Ready to Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 17]: `` We have worked hard , but we must for a few days work harder still .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 25]: We must fit up the inside of the house , so as to enable Madam to get into it as soon as possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 63]: The earth in the inside of the house was then beaten down hard , so as to make a floor ; and a sort of bedstead , about two feet from the ground , running the whole length of the house , was raised on each side of the interior : these were fitted with canvas screens to let down by night .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 35]: And then Ready and William took the last trip in the boat to fetch the chairs and tables , which they did just before the coming on of the first storm of the season .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 31]: The bedding and all the utensils were now taken into the house ; and a little outhouse was built up to cook in , until the fireplace could be made .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 76]: It was late on the Saturday night that the family shifted into the new house ; and fortunate it was that they had no further occasion for delay , for on the Sunday the first storm burst upon them ; the wind blew with great force ; and , although they were shielded from it , still the cocoa-nut trees ground and sawed each other 's stems as they bent their heads to its force .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 19]: The lightning was vivid , and the thunder appalling , while the rain descended in a continual torrent .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 30]: The animals left the pastures , and sheltered themselves in the grove ; and , although noonday , it was so dark that they could not see to read .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 21]: `` This , then , is the rainy season which you talked about , Ready , '' said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 7]: `` Is it always like this ?
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 9]: If so , what shall we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 19]: `` No , madam ; the sun will shine sometimes , but not for long at a time .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 40]: We shall be able to get out and do something every now and then almost every day , but still we shall have rain , perhaps , for many days without intermission , and we must work indoors . ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 26]: `` How thankful we ought to be that we have a house over our heads ; we should have been drowned in the tents . ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 28]: `` That I knew , madam , and therefore I was anxious to get a house over your head ; let us thank God for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 26]: `` Indeed we ought , '' observed Mr. Seagrave ; `` and it is , indeed , time for us to read the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 11]: The morning service was then performed in the new house .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 19]: Violent as the rain was , it did not penetrate through the thatch which had been put on .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 25]: Ready and William went out to secure the boat , which they were afraid would be injured , and returned wet to the skin .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 54]: The storm continued without intermission the whole of the night , but they slept dry and safe ; and , when awakened by the noise of the thunder and the pelting of the rain , they thanked God that they had found a dwelling in the wilderness upon which they had been cast .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 24]: Chapter XXX When they all rose up the next morning , the clouds had cleared off , and the sun was shining bright .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 40]: Ready and Juno were the first out of the house - Ready with the telescope under his arm , which he always took with him when he went his rounds , as he termed it , in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 20]: `` Well , Juno , '' said Ready , `` this is a fine morning after the rain . ''
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 39]: `` Yes , Massa Ready , very fine morning ; but how I get fire light , and make kittle boil for breakfast , I really do n't know - stick and cocoa-nut trash all so wet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 42]: `` Before I went to bed last night , Juno , I covered up the embers with ashes , put some stones over them , and then some cocoa-nut branches , so I think you will find some fire there yet .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 19]: I was going my morning 's round , but I will stay a little and help you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 14]: `` Tank you , Massa Ready ; plenty rain fell last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 38]: `` Yes , not a little , Juno ; you must not expect to find the water at the well very clear this morning ; indeed , I doubt if you will see the well at all .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 11]: Here 's some stuff which is not very wet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 32]: `` I got plenty of fire , too , '' replied Juno , who had removed the branches and stones , and was now on her knees blowing up the embers .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 30]: `` You 'll do very well now , Juno , '' said Ready ; `` besides , William will be out directly - so I 'll leave you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 21]: Ready whistled to the dogs , who came bounding out , and then set off on his round of inspection .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 63]: He first directed his steps to the well in the ravine ; but , instead of the gushing spring and the limpid clear water , with which the cask sunk for a well had been filled , there was now a muddy torrent , rushing down the ravine , and the well was covered with it , and not to be distinguished .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 28]: `` I thought as much , '' said Ready , musing over the impetuous stream ; `` well , better too much water than too little . ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 22]: Ready waded through , as he wished to examine the turtle-pond , which was on the other side of the stream .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 59]: Finding all right , he again crossed the water , where it was now spread wide over the sandy beach , until he came to the other point where he had moored his boat , both by the head and stern , with a rope , and a heavy stone made fast to it , as an anchor .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 78]: From this point , as usual , he surveyed the horizon with his telescope ; not that he thought that there was a chance of a vessel arriving among these islands ; but , still , as it was possible , he took the trouble ; but never except when he went out in the morning alone , as he was aware that the very circumstance of his so doing would make Mr. Seagrave melancholy and unsettled .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 26]: As usual , he dropped the telescope on his arm , after his survey , saying to himself , `` Little use doing that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 26]: The gale having blown offshore , the boat had dragged her moorings , and was so far out that Ready could not get at her .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 28]: `` Here 's a puzzle , '' said the old man ; `` how foolish of me not to have made a line fast to the shore !
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 15]: I 'll not trust myself to John Shark by swimming to the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 6]: `` Let me see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 36]: Ready took the halyards and sheets belonging to the boat 's sails , which be had left on the beach , and bent one on to the other until he had sufficient length of rope .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 40]: He then made a piece of wood , about two feet long , fast by the middle to the end of the rope , and , after one or two attempts , contrived to throw it into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 23]: The piece of wood caught under one of the thwarts , and this enabled him to draw the boat to the shore .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 23]: Having baled out the water which had fallen into her during the storm , he then landed again and examined the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 23]: `` Now to find the sheep and goats , '' said Ready , `` and then my morning 's walk is over .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 58]: Now , Romulus , now , Remus , boys , find them out , '' continued he ; and the dogs , who appeared to know what he was in search of , went away in pursuit , and soon found the sheep and two of the goats , but the third goat was not with them .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 10]: `` Why , where can Black Nanny be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 35]: muttered Ready , stopping a little while ; at last he heard a bleat , in a small copse of brush wood , to which he directed his steps , followed by the dogs .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 27]: `` I thought as much , '' said he , as be perceived Nanny lying down in the copse with two new-born kids at her side .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 26]: `` Come , my little fellows , we must find some shelter for you , '' said he , taking one up under each arm .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 6]: `` Come , Nanny . ''
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 17]: Ready walked back to the house , and brought in the kids , followed by Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 12]: He found Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave and the children all dressed .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 23]: Caroline and Tommy gave a scream of delight when they saw the little kids , and even little Albert clapped his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 21]: As soon as Ready put them down on the ground , Tommy and Caroline had each their arms round one .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 38]: `` I 've brought an addition to our family , Mrs. Seagrave , '' said Ready : `` we must allow them to remain in the house until I can knock up a little shelter for them .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 15]: This is only a beginning ; I expect we shall soon have more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 33]: As soon as the children could be persuaded to part with the kids , Nanny was tied up in a corner , and was very content with fondling and nursing her progeny .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 48]: Juno and William brought in the breakfast , and as soon as it was over , Mr. Seagrave said , `` Now , Ready , I think we must hold a council , and make arrangements as to our allotted duties and employments during the rainy season .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 15]: We have a great deal to do , and must not be idle . ''
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 31]: `` Yes , sir , we have a great deal to do , and , to get through our work , we must have order and method in our doings .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 17]: I 've lived long enough to know how much can be done by regularity and discipline .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 28]: Why , sir , there is more work got out of men in a well-conducted man-of-war than there can in the merchant service in double the time .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 4]: And why so ?
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 16]: Because everything is in its place , and there is a place for everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 16]: `` I agree with you , '' said Mrs. Seagrave ; `` method is everything .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 19]: While one careless little girl is looking for her thimble , another will have finished her work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 30]: `` I assure you I never should have known what can be done by order and arrangement , if I had not been pressed on board of a man-of-war .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 9]: I found that everything was done in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 42]: Every man was to his post ; everyone had a rope to haul upon , or a rope to let go ; the boatswain piped , and in a few seconds every sail was set or taken in as was required .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 9]: It seemed to me at first like magic .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 22]: And you observe , Mr. Seagrave , that when there is order and discipline , every man becomes of individual importance .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 32]: If I learnt nothing else on board of a man-of-war , I learnt to make the most of time , and the most of the strength which you could command . ''
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 22]: `` You are very right , Ready ; you must teach us to do the same , '' replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 45]: `` We have so much to do , that I hardly know where to begin ; yet , sir , we must work at present how we can , and when we can , until we have got things into a little better order .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 10]: We have done well up to the present . ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 12]: `` What do you think we ought to do first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 65]: `` Well , sir , our first job will be to haul up the boat and secure her from harm ; we will half-dock her in the sand , and cover her over , for I do not think it will be safe to go in her now to the other side of the island , where the sea will always be rough . ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 8]: `` There I perfectly agree with you .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 7]: Now what is the next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 92]: `` Why , sir , we must not leave the tents where they are , but take them down , and as soon as they are dry , stow them away , for we may want them by and by ; then , sir , we must build a large outhouse for our stores and provisions , with a thatched roof , and a floor raised about four feet from the ground ; and then , under the floor , the sheep and goats will have a protection from the weather .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 19]: Then there is the fish-pond to make , and also a salt-pan to cut out of the rock .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 8]: Then we have two more long jobs .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 102]: One is , to go through the woods and examine the stores we have left on the other side of the island , sort and arrange them all ready for bringing here after the rains are over ; and we must also explore the island a little , and find out what it produces ; for at present we know nothing of it : we may find a great many things useful to us , a great many trees and fruits , and I hope and trust we may be able to find some more grass for our live stock . ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 27]: `` I agree with you in all you say , Ready , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` now how shall we divide our strength ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 14]: `` We will not divide at present , sir , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 49]: Juno has plenty to do indoors with Mrs. Seagrave ; William , and you , and I , will first secure the boat and stow away the tents and gear ; after that , we will set about the outbuilding , and work at it when we can .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 45]: If Juno has any time to spare , she had better collect the cocoa-nut leaves , and pile them up for fuel ; and Tommy will , I dare say , go with her , and show her how to draw them along . ''
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 17]: `` Yes , I 'll show her , '' said Tommy , getting on his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 26]: `` Not just now , Tommy , '' said Ready , `` but as soon as your mamma can spare her to go with you .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 36]: Come , sir , a few hours of weather like this is not to be lost , '' continued Ready ; `` we shall have more rain before the day is over , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 26]: I will first go to the tent for the shovels ; then I will haul the boat round to the beach and meet you there .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 35]: You and William can take some cord , tie up a large bundle of cocoa-nut boughs , sling it to the wheels , and draw it down to the beach and meet me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 36]: Chapter XXXI As so many cocoa-nut trees had been cut down to build the house , there were plenty of boughs lying in every direction , and William and Mr. Seagrave had soon procured sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 46]: In a very short time the boat was drawn up about ten yards from the water 's edge , which Ready said was quite sufficient ; they then dug from under with their shovels until the boat was sunk about half down in the sand .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 38]: Having filled in the sand all round her up to her gunnel , the boat was then carefully covered over with the boughs , which were weighed down with sand that they might not be blown away .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 29]: `` I do n't see why you should cover the boat up in this way , Ready ; the rain wo n't hurt her , '' observed William .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 45]: `` No , sir , the rain wo n't do her any harm , but the sun will , when it bursts out occasionally ; for it 's very powerful when it does shine , and it would split her all to pieces . ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 9]: `` I forgot that , '' replied William .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 8]: `` What shall we do now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 28]: `` Suppose , as we have two hours to dinner-time , you run for the lines , William , and we 'll try for some fish . ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 19]: `` We can not all three of us fish with only two lines , '' said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 35]: `` No , sir ; and as William knows how to catch them , suppose you remain with him , and I will go up and collect wood and chips for Juno 's fire .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 27]: She was hard pressed for it this morning , it was so wet ; but , if once piled up , it will soon be dry .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 26]: Be careful , Mr. Seagrave , not to hold the lines tight in your hands , or you may be jerked into the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 33]: Mr. Seagrave and William were very fortunate ; before the two hours were expired they had caught eight large fish , which they brought up to the house slung on the boat-hook .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 46]: Tommy hallooed loudly for fish for dinner , and as they had caught so many , it was agreed that the dinner should be put off until some could be got ready , and they were not sorry to eat them instead of salt pork .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 44]: They had hardly sat down to table , when the rain came pattering down on the roof , and in a quarter of an hour the storm was as violent , and the thunder and lightning as terrific as on the day before .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 7]: All outdoor labour was again suspended .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 32]: Mrs. Seagrave , Juno , and Caroline took their work , for there was plenty to do with the needle and thread , and Ready soon found employment for the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 22]: William and Mr. Seagrave unlaid some thick rope , that Ready might make smaller and more useful rope with the yarns .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 37]: Ready took up his sailing needles , and worked eyelet-holes in the canvas screens -LRB- which they had put up in a hurry -RRB- , so that they might be drawn to and fro as required .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 38]: As soon as Ready had hung up the curtains , he looked under the bedsteads for a large bundle , and said , as he opened it , `` I shall now decorate Madam Seagrave 's sleeping-place .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 10]: It ought to be handsomer than the others . ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 36]: The bundle was composed of the ship 's ensign , which was red , and a large , square , yellow flag with the name of the ship Pacific in large black letters upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 33]: These two flags Ready festooned and tied up round the bed-place , so as to give it a very gay appearance , and also to hide the rough walls of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 33]: `` Indeed , Ready , I am much obliged to you , '' said Mrs. Seagrave , when he had finished ; `` it is really quite grand for this place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 19]: `` It 's the best use we can put them to now , madam , '' said Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 13]: `` I am afraid so , '' replied Mr. Seagrave , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 46]: `` Ready , '' said William , after the candles were lighted , `` you once half-promised me that you would tell me your history ; I wish you would tell us some of it now , as it will pass away the evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 17]: `` Well , William , I did say so , and I shall keep my word .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 47]: When you have heard my story , you will say that I have been very foolish in my time ; and so I have ; but if it proves a warning to you , it will , at all events , be of some use . ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 13]: Ready then commenced his history as follows : History of Old Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 20]: `` Of course , you wish to know who my father and mother were : that is soon told .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 45]: My father was the captain of a merchant vessel , which traded from South Shields to Hamburg , and my poor mother , God bless her , was the daughter of a half-pay militia captain , who died about two months after their marriage .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 54]: The property which the old gentleman had bequeathed to my mother was added to that which my father had already vested in the brig , and he then owned one-third of the vessel ; the other two-thirds were the property of a very rich ship-builder and owner , of the name of Masterman .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 25]: What with the profits of the share he held of the vessel and his pay as captain , my father was well to do .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 48]: Mr. Masterman , who had a very high opinion of my father , and gained much money by his exertions and good management , was present at the marriage , and when I was born , about a year afterwards , he stood for me as godfather .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 37]: Every one considered that this was a most advantageous circumstance for me , and congratulated my father and mother ; for Mr. Masterman was a bachelor , of nearly sixty years , without any near relations .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 36]: It is true , that he was very fond of money ; but that , they said , was all the better , as he could not take it away with him when he died .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 67]: An end , however , was soon put to all their worldly ideas , for a year after I was born , my father was drowned at sea , his vessel and the whole of her crew being lost on the Texel sands ; and my mother found herself a widow , with a child scarcely weaned , when she was but twenty-two years of age .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 56]: `` It was supposed that my mother would still have sufficient to live upon , as the ship had been insured at two-thirds of her value ; but , to the astonishment of everybody , Mr. Masterman contrived to make it appear that it was his two-thirds of the vessel which had been insured . ''
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 6]: `` What is insurance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 3]: inquired William .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 47]: `` Insurance , my dear boy , is paying a certain sum to people who are called underwriters , that in case the vessel or cargo is lost or damaged , the loss or damage is made good to the owners of the vessel or cargo .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 9]: You pay in proportion to the risk incurred .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 67]: Supposing you wished to insure one thousand pounds on a vessel or cargo , and ten per cent was required , you would , if the vessel came home safe , pay the underwriters one hundred pounds ; if , on the contrary , the vessel was lost , the underwriters would have to pay you one thousand pounds , the sum which you had insured .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 11]: I beg your pardon for the interruption , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 18]: `` No need , Mr. Seagrave ; we never should lose an opportunity of teaching the young .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 81]: Well , how far the assertion of Mr. Masterman was correct or not , it was impossible at the time to say ; but I do know that everybody cried out ` shame ' , and that if he did deprive the widow , he had much to answer for ; for the Bible says , ` Pure religion is to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction , and to keep yourself unspotted in the world ' .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 45]: The consequence was , that my mother had little or nothing to live upon ; but she found friends who assisted her , and she worked embroidery , and contrived to get on somehow until I was eight or nine years of age . ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 16]: `` But did not your godfather come forward to the assistance of your mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 4]: inquired Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 21]: `` No , sir , strange to say , he did not ; and that made people talk the more .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 49]: I believe it was the abuse of him , which he did not fail to hear , and which he ascribed to my mother , which turned him away from us ; perhaps it was his own conscience , for we always dislike those we have injured . ''
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 34]: `` Unfortunately , there is great truth in that remark of yours , Ready , '' observed Mr. Seagrave ; `` still , it is strange that he did not do something . ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 40]: `` It was very strange , sir , - at least , so it appeared at the time , but he was very fond of money , and irritated at the reports and observations which were made about him .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 41]: But , to go on , sir , I was a strong , hardy boy , and , whenever I could escape from my mother or school , was always found by the water-side or on board of the vessels .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 18]: In the summer-time I was half the day in water , and was a very good swimmer .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 22]: My mother perceived my fondness for the profession , and tried all she could to divert my thoughts some other way .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 27]: She told me of the dangers and hardships which sailors went through , and always ended with my father 's death and a flood of tears .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 38]: `` We certainly are of a perverse nature , as I have often heard the clergyman say , for it appears to me that we always wish to do that which we are told not to do .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 24]: If my mother had not been always persuading me against going to sea , I really believe I might have stayed at home .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 15]: I 've often thought since , how selfish and unfeeling I must have been .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 27]: I was too young to know what pain I was giving my mother , and how anxiety was preying upon her , all on my account .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 27]: Children can not feel it ; if they did , they would do otherwise , for our hearts are seldom hard until we grow older . ''
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 13]: `` I agree with you , Ready , '' said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 34]: `` If children really knew how much their parents suffer when they behave ill , how alarmed they are at any proofs of wickedness in them , they would be much better . ''
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 19]: `` We never find that out , sir , till it is too late , '' continued Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 77]: `` Well , sir , I was little more than nine years old , when , on a very windy day , and the water rough , a hawser , by which a vessel was fast to the wharf , was carried away with a violent jerk , and the broken part , as it flew out , struck a person who was at the edge of the wharf , and knocked him into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 45]: I heard the crying out , and the men from the wharf and from the ships were throwing ropes to him , but he could not catch hold of them ; indeed , he could not swim well , and the water was rough .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 17]: I caught a rope that had been hauled in again , and leapt off the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 26]: `` Young as I was , I swam like a duck , and put the rope into his hands just as he was going down .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 42]: He clung to it as drowning men only can cling , and was hauled to the piles , and soon afterwards a boat , which had been lowered from the stern of one of the vessels , picked us both up .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 37]: We were taken to a public-house , and put into bed till dry clothes could be sent for us ; and then I found that the person I had saved was my godfather , Mr. Masterman .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 32]: Everyone was loud in my praise ; and , although perhaps I ought not to say it , it was a bold act for so young a boy as I was .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 73]: The sailors took me home to my mother in a sort of triumphal procession ; and she , poor thing , when she heard what I had done , embraced me over and over again , one moment rejoicing at my preservation , and the next weeping bitterly at the thoughts of the danger I had encountered , and the probability that my bold spirit would lead me into still greater . ''
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 14]: `` But she did not blame you for what you had done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 41]: `` Oh no , William ; she felt that I had done my duty towards my neighbour , and perhaps she felt in her own heart that I had returned good for evil ; but she did not say so .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 30]: The next day Mr. Masterman called upon us ; he certainly looked very foolish and confused when he asked for his godson , whom he had so long neglected .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 62]: My mother , who felt how useful he might be to me , received him very kindly ; but I had been often told of his neglect of me and my mother , and of his supposed unfair conduct towards my father , and had taken a violent dislike to him ; his advances towards me were therefore very coolly received .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 76]: I felt glad that I had saved him ; but although I could not exactly understand my own feelings at the time , I am ashamed to say that my pleasure was not derived from having done a good action , so much as indulging a feeling of revenge in having put one under an obligation who had treated me ill ; this arose from my proud spirit , which my mother could not check .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 37]: So you see , William , there was very little merit in what I had done , as , after I had done it , I indulged those feelings which I ought to have checked . ''
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 22]: `` I think I could not have helped feeling the same , Ready , under such circumstances , '' replied William .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 33]: `` The impulse which induced me to act was good , '' replied Ready ; `` but the feeling which I indulged in afterwards took away the whole merit of the deed .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 30]: I am stating what I believe to be the truth ; and an old man like me can look upon the past without bias , but not without regret .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 53]: Mr. Masterman made but a short visit ; he told my mother that he would now take care of me and bring me up to the business of a ship-builder as soon as I was old enough to leave school , and that in the meantime he would pay all my expenses .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 46]: My poor mother was very grateful , and shed tears of joy ; and when Mr. Masterman went away , she embraced me , and said that now she was happy , as I should have a profession on shore and not go to sea .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 57]: I must do justice to Mr. Masterman ; he kept his word and sent money to my mother , so that she became quite cheerful and comfortable , and everyone congratulated her , and she used to fondle me , and say , it was all through me that she was relieved from her distress . ''
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 12]: `` How happy that must have made you , Ready ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 3]: said William .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 14]: `` Yes , it did , but it made me also very proud .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 22]: Strange to say , I could not conquer my dislike to Mr. Masterman ; I had nourished the feeling too long .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 46]: I could not bear that my mother should be under obligations to him , or that he should pay for my schooling ; it hurt my foolish pride , young as I then was ; and although my mother was happy , I was not .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 40]: Besides , as I was put to a better school , and was obliged to remain with the other boys , I could no longer run about the wharfs , or go on board the vessels , as before .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 46]: I did not see then , as I do now , that it was all for my good but I became discontented and unhappy , merely because I was obliged to pay attention to my learning , and could no longer have my own way .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 15]: The master complained of me ; and Mr. Masterman called and scolded me well .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 11]: I became more disobedient , and then I was punished .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 18]: This irritated me , and I made up my mind that I would run away to sea .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 44]: You see , William , I was all in the wrong ; and so will all boys be who think they know better than those who have charge of them ; and now only see what I probably lost by my foolish conduct .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 117]: I say <i> probably </i> , for no one can calculate or foresee what is to take place ; but , as far as appearances went , I had every prospect of receiving a good education - of succeeding Mr. Masterman in his business , and , very probably , of inheriting his large fortune ; so that I might have been at this time a rich and well-educated man , surrounded with all the comforts and luxuries of life ; perhaps with an amiable wife and large family round me , to make me still happier , instead of being what I now am , a poor , worn-out old seaman upon a desert isle .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 63]: I point this out to you , William , to show how one false and foolish step in the young may affect their whole prospects in life ; and , instead of enabling them to sail down with the stream of prosperity , may leave them to struggle against the current of adversity , as has been the case with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 17]: `` It is , indeed , a good lesson , Ready , '' said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 23]: `` It is ; not that I repine at my lot , even while I regret the errors that led to it .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 34]: An all-wise and gracious God disposes of us as he thinks best ; and I can now say with perfect sincerity , ` Thy will , not mine , be done ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 50]: `` Your misfortunes have , however , proved an incalculable benefit to us , Ready , '' observed Mrs. Seagrave ; `` for had you not gone to sea , and been on board the ship when the crew deserted us , what would have become of us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 25]: `` Well , madam , it is some comfort to think that a worn-out old seaman like myself has been of some use . ''
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 16]: Chapter XXXII The bleating of the kids woke them the next morning earlier than usual .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 21]: The weather was again fine , and the sun shining brightly , and Ready turned out Nanny and her progeny .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 67]: They had an excellent breakfast of fried fish , and then Mr. Seagrave , Ready , and William went out to their work : the two first took down the tents , and spread the canvas on the ground , that it might be well dried , while William went in pursuit of the fowls , which had not been seen for a day or two .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 22]: After half-an-hour 's search in the cocoa-nut grove , he heard the cock crow , and soon afterwards found them all .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 14]: He threw them some split peas , which he had brought with him .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 25]: They were hungry enough and followed him home to the house , where he left them and went to join Ready and his father .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 59]: `` William , '' said Ready , `` I think , now that we have spread out the tents , we will , if Mr. Seagrave approves , all set to at once and knock up a fowl-house ; it wo n't be more than a day 's job , and then the creatures will have a home .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 28]: There are four very thick cocoa-nut trees close to the house ; we will build it under them ; it will be a good job over . ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 11]: Mr. Seagrave assented , and they set immediately to work .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 52]: There were many thin poles left , the tops of the cocoa-nut trees which had been cut down to build the house ; these they nailed to the trunks of the four trees , so as to make a square , and then they ran up rafters for a pitched roof .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 55]: `` Now , sir , this is only rough work ; we will first put up a perch or two for them , and then close in the side , and thatch the roof with cocoa-nut branches ; but there 's Juno taking in the dinner , so we 'll finish it afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 36]: After their meal the work was renewed ; Mr. Seagrave collected the branches while William and Ready worked upon the sides and roof , and before the evening closed in , the fowl-house was complete .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 18]: William enticed the fowls down to it with some more split peas , and then walked away .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 34]: `` Now , sir , the creatures will soon find their way in ; and by and by , when I have time , I 'll make a door to the entrance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 38]: `` And now , '' said William , `` I think we had better roll up the canvas of the tents ; we have had a splendid day , and may not be so fortunate to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 25]: `` Very true ; we will get them housed , and stow them away under the bed-places ; there is plenty of room . ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 33]: By the time that they had folded up the canvas , and William had brought in Nanny and the kids , the sun had set , and they went into the house .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 46]: Ready was requested to go on with his history , which he did as follows : -- `` I said last night that I determined to run away from school and go to sea , but I did not tell you how I managed it .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 22]: I had no chance of getting out of the school unperceived , except after the boys were all put to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 61]: The room that I slept in was at the top of the house - the doors I knew were all locked ; but there was a trap-door which led out on the roof , fastened by a bolt inside , and a ladder leading up to it ; and I determined that I would make my escape by that way .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 25]: As soon as all the other boys were fast asleep , I arose and dressed myself very quietly , and then left the room .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 21]: `` The moon shone bright , which was lucky for me , and I gained the trap-door without any noise .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 37]: I had some difficulty in forcing it up , as it was heavy for a boy of my age ; but I contrived to do so at last , and gained the roof of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 58]: I then began looking about me , to see how I was to get to the ground , and after walking to and fro several times , I decided that I could slip down by a large water-pipe ; it was so far detached from the bricks , that I could get my small fingers round it .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 32]: I climbed over the parapet , and , clinging to the pipe firmly with my hands and knees , I slid down , and arrived at the bottom in safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 19]: `` It 's a wonder you did not break your neck , Ready , '' observed Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 8]: `` It was , indeed , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 38]: As soon as I was landed in the flowerbed , which was below , I hastened to the iron gates at the entrance , and soon climbed up and got to the other side into the road .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 133]: I started as fast as I could towards the port , and when I arrived at the wharf , I perceived that a vessel had her topsails loose , and meant to take advantage of the ebb-tide which had just made ; the men were singing ` Yo heave yo ' , getting the anchor up ; and as I stood watching , almost making up my mind that I would swim off to her , I perceived that a man pushed off in her jolly-boat , and was sculling to a post a little higher up , where a hawser had been made fast ; I ran round , and arrived there before he had cast off the rope ; without saying a word , I jumped into the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 9]: ` What do you want , youngster ? '
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 5]: said the seaman . ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 25]: ` I want to go to sea , ' said I , breathless ; ` take me on board - pray do . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 25]: ` Well , ' said he , ` I heard the captain say he wanted an apprentice , and so you may come . '
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 19]: `` He sculled the boat back again to the vessel , and I climbed up her side . ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 6]: ` Who are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 4]: said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 13]: `` I told him that I wanted to go to sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 11]: ` You are too little and too young . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 25]: ` No , I am not , ' replied I. '' ` Why , do you think that you dare go aloft ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 28]: ` I 'll show you , ' replied I ; and I ran up the rigging like a cat , and went out at the topgallant yard-arm .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 48]: `` When I came down , the captain said , ` Well , I think you 'll make a sharp seaman by and by ; so I 'll take you , and , as soon as I get to London , I 'll bind you apprentice . '
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 37]: `` The ship , which was a collier , was soon out of port , and before the day had dawned I found myself on the wide ocean , which was hereafter to be my home .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 99]: `` As soon as the hurry and confusion were over , I was examined by the captain , who appeared to me to be a very rough , harsh man ; indeed , before the day was over I almost repented of the step which I had taken , and when I sat down cold and wet upon some old sail at night , the thoughts of my mother , and what distress I should occasion her , for the first time rushed into my mind , and I wept bitterly ; but it was too late then .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 40]: I have often thought , Mr. Seagrave , that the life of hardship which I have since gone through has been a judgment on me for my cruelty to my mother , in leaving her the way I did .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 18]: It broke her heart ; a poor return , William , for all her care and kindness !
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 5]: God forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 18]: Old Ready left off for some little time , and the remainder of the party kept silence .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 40]: Then he said - `` I 'll leave off now , if you please : I do n't feel inclined to go on ; my heart is full when I recall that foolish and wicked deed of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 71]: Chapter XXXIII The next morning was fine , and as soon as breakfast was over , they took the wheels down to the turtle-pond , and Ready having speared one of the largest by means of a pike with a barb to it , which he had made on purpose , they hauled it on shore , slung it under the wheels , and took it up to the house .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 89]: Having killed the turtle , and cut it up , Juno , under the directions of Ready , chose such portions as were required for the soup ; and when the pot was on the fire , Ready , Mr. Seagrave , and William set off with the cross-cut saw and hatchets , to commence felling the cocoa-nut trees for the building of the outhouse , which was to hold their stores , as soon as they could be brought round from the other side of the island .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 103]: `` I mean this to be our place of refuge in case of danger , sir , '' observed Ready ; `` and therefore I have selected this thick part of the wood , as it is not very far from the house , and by cutting the path to it in a zigzag , it will be quite hidden from sight ; and we must make the path just wide enough to allow the wheels to pass , and stump up the roots of the trees which we are obliged to cut down , otherwise the stumps would attract attention . ''
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 23]: `` I agree with you , Ready , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` there is no saying what may happen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 38]: `` You see , sir , it is often the custom for the natives , in this part of the world , to come in their canoes from one island to another , merely to get cocoa-nuts .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 33]: I ca n't say that the other islands near us are inhabited , but still it is probable , and we can not tell what the character of the people may be .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 24]: I tell you this , but we had better not say a word to Mrs. Seagrave , as it may distress her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 18]: Mr. Seagrave agreed , and Ready continued : `` We are now near the spot , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 33]: You see , when we have got over this hill , where the trees are so very thick , the fall in the ground will assist in the concealment of the building .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 14]: I should say we are very near right where we now stand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 10]: `` How far are we now from the house ?
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 8]: We must not be too distant . ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 29]: `` I reckon we are not 150 yards in a straight line , although the road will , by its turning , make it double the distance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 12]: `` Then I think this spot will do very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 37]: `` I 'll just mark out the trees which are to stand , Mr. Seagrave , and those which are to be cut down , so as to leave about four feet of stump standing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 28]: As soon as they had planned the building , the axes and saw were in full use , and tree after tree fell one upon the other .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 23]: They worked hard till dinner-time , and were not sorry at the prospect of sitting down to a rich mess of turtle-soup .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 19]: `` My dear William , and you too , Mr. Seagrave , how very warm you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 13]: said Mrs. Seagrave ; `` you must not work so hard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 32]: `` Cutting down trees is very warm work , mother , '' replied William , `` and hard work will never hurt any one , especially when he dines off turtle-soup .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 12]: Why , Tommy , what 's the matter with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 13]: `` Tommy and I are at variance , '' replied Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 36]: `` I had my thimble this morning , and had commenced my sewing , when I was called out by Juno , and Caroline went with me , and Tommy was left in the house .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 45]: When I came back I found him outside , and on going back to my work , there was no thimble to be found ; I asked him if he had touched it , and his answer was that he would look for it .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 39]: He did look , and said he could not find it ; I have asked him several times if he took it away , and his only answer is that he will find it by and by . ''
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 10]: `` Tommy , did you take the thimble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 6]: said Mr. Seagrave , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 12]: `` I 'll find it by and by , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 7]: `` That 's not an answer .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 7]: Did you take the thimble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 17]: `` I 'll find it by and by , papa , '' said Tommy , whimpering .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 16]: `` That 's all the answer he will give me , '' said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 22]: `` Well , then , he shall have no dinner till the thimble makes its appearance , '' replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 9]: Master Tommy began to cry at this intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 20]: Juno appeared with the turtle-soup ; and Tommy cried louder when they had said grace and commenced their dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 34]: They were all very hungry , and William sent his plate for another portion , which he had not commenced long before he put his finger in his mouth and pulled out something .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 17]: `` Why , mother , here 's the thimble in my soup , '' cried William .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 41]: `` No wonder he said he would find it by and by , '' said Ready , smiling ; `` he meant to have fished it up , I suppose , from what was left of the soup after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 41]: Well , Mrs. Seagrave , I do n't mean to say that Tommy is a good boy , but still , although be would not tell where the thimble was , he has not told a falsehood about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 11]: `` No , he has not , '' replied William .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 22]: `` I think , now that the thimble is found , if he begs pardon , papa will forgive him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 11]: `` Tommy , come here , '' said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 13]: `` Tell me why you put that thimble into the soup ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 8]: `` I wanted to taste the soup .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 22]: I wanted to fill the thimble ; the soup burnt my fingers , and I let the thimble drop in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 17]: `` Well , a thimbleful was n't much , at all events , '' observed Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 15]: `` And why did n't you tell your mamma where the thimble was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 20]: `` I was afraid mamma throw all the soup away , and then I get none for dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 7]: that was it , was it ?
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 49]: Well , sir , I said you should have no dinner till the thimble was found , so , as it is found , you may have your dinner ; but if you ever refuse to answer a question again , I shall punish you more severely . ''
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 49]: Tommy was glad the lecture was over , and more glad to get his turtle-soup ; he finished one plate , and , as he asked for another , he said , `` Tommy wo n't put thimble in again ; put tin pot in next time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 18]: After dinner they went to their work again , and did not come in again till sunset .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 21]: `` The clouds are gathering fast , sir , '' observed Ready ; `` we shall have rain to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 16]: `` I fear we shall ; but we must expect it now , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 18]: `` Yes , sir ; and by and by we shall have it for days together . ''
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 26]: `` Ready , '' said Mrs. Seagrave , `` if you are not too tired , perhaps you will go on with your history . ''
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 14]: `` Certainly , ma'am , if you wish it , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 18]: `` When I left off , I was on board of the collier , bound to London .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 12]: We had a very fair wind , and a quick passage .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 44]: I was very sick until we arrived in the Nore , and then I recovered , and , as you may suppose , was astonished at the busy scene , and the quantity of vessels which were going up and down the river .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 65]: But I did not like my captain ; he was very severe and brutal to the men ; and the apprentice who was on board told me to run away , and get into another vessel , and not to bind myself apprentice to this captain , or I should be beat all day long , and be treated as bad as he was .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 19]: I knew this was the case , as the captain kicked and cuffed him twenty times a day .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 42]: The men said that he did not do so to me , for fear I should refuse to be his apprentice ; but that , as soon as my indentures were signed , he would treat me in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 37]: `` Well , I made up my mind that I would not remain in the collier ; and , as the captain had gone on shore , I had plenty of time to look about me .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 53]: There was a large ship , which was ready to sail , lying in the stream ; I spoke to two boys who were at the stairs in her boat , and they told me that they were very comfortable on board , and that the captain wanted two or three apprentices .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 11]: I went on board with them , and offered myself .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 28]: The captain asked me a great many questions , and I told him the truth , and why I did not like to remain in the collier .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 42]: He agreed to take me ; and I went on shore with him , signed my indentures , and received from him a sufficient supply of clothes ; and , two days afterwards , we sailed for Bombay and China . ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 15]: `` But you wrote to your mother , Ready , did you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 3]: said William .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 47]: `` Yes , I did ; for the captain desired me to do so , and he put a few lines at the bottom to comfort her ; but , unfortunately , the letter , which was sent on shore by the cook , never arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 42]: Whether he dropped it , or forgot it till after the ship sailed , and then tore it up , I do not know ; but , as I found out afterwards , it never did get to her hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 19]: `` It was not your fault that the letter did not arrive safe , '' said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 19]: `` No , madam , that was not my fault ; the fault had been committed before . ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 30]: `` Do n't dwell any more upon that portion of your history , Ready ; but tell us what took place after you sailed for the East Indies . ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 9]: `` Be it so , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 34]: I certainly was very smart and active for my age , and soon became a great favourite on board , especially with the lady passengers , because I was such a little fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 26]: We arrived safely at Bombay , where our passengers went on shore , and in three weeks afterwards we sailed down the straits for China .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 52]: It was war time , and we were very often chased by French privateers ; but as we had a good crew and plenty of guns , none of them ventured to attack us , and we got safe to Macao , where we unloaded our cargo and took in teas .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 16]: We had to wait some time for a convoy , and then sailed for England .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 46]: When we were off the Isle of France , the convoy was dispersed in a gale ; and three days afterwards , a French frigate bore down upon us , and after exchanging a few broadsides , we were compelled to haul down our colours .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 25]: A lieutenant was sent on board with forty men to take charge of us , for we were a very rich prize to them .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 50]: The captain and most of the crew were taken on board of the frigate , but ten Lascars and the boys were left in the Indiaman , to assist in taking her into the Isle of France , which was at that time in the hands of the French .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 37]: I thought it hard that I was to go to prison at twelve years old ; but I did not care much about it , and very soon I was as gay and merry as ever .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 104]: We had made the island , and were on a wind beating up to the port , when a vessel was seen to windward , and although I could not understand what the Frenchmen said , I perceived that they were in a great fluster and very busy with their spy-glasses , and Jack Romer , one of my brother ` prentices who had been three years at sea , said to me , ` I do n't think we 'll go to prison after all , Ready , for that vessel is an English man-of-war , if I 'm not mistaken . '
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 20]: At last she came down within three miles of us , and hoisted English colours and fired a gun .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 115]: The Frenchmen put the ship before the wind , but it was of no use ; the man-of-war came up with us very fast , and then the Frenchmen began to pack up their clothes , together with all the other things which they had collected out of the property of our captain and crew ; a shot was fired which went clean over our heads , and then they left the helm , and Jack Romer went to it , and , with my help , hove the ship up in the wind ; a boat came on board and took possession , and so there was one escape , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 58]: `` They sent a midshipman as prize-master on board of the vessel , and left all us , who had been taken prisoners by the French , in the vessel , to help to work her into port , as the captain did not wish to part with any more men of his own than was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 31]: We soon made sail for England , quite delighted at having escaped a French prison , but , after all , we only exchanged it for a Dutch one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 7]: `` How do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 28]: `` I mean that , two days afterwards , as we were rounding the Cape , another French vessel bore down upon us , and captured us .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 50]: This time we did not find any friend in need , and were taken into Table Bay ; for at that time the Cape of Good Hope was in the possession of the Dutch , who , as well as the French , were at war with England . ''
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 10]: `` How very unfortunate you were , Ready ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 4]: said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 21]: `` Yes , madam , we were , and I ca n't say much in favour of a Dutch prison .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 23]: However , I was very young at that time , and did not care much - I had a light heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 49]: Chapter XXXIV A heavy storm came on soon after they had retired to rest ; the lightning was so vivid that its flashes penetrated through the chinks of the door and windows , and the thunder burst upon them with a noise which prevented them obtaining any sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 25]: The children cried and trembled as they lay in the arms of Mrs. Seagrave and Juno , who were almost as much alarmed themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 22]: `` This is very awful , '' said Mr. Seagrave to Ready , for they had both risen from their beds .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 18]: `` It is indeed , sir ; I never knew a more terrible storm than this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 5]: `` Merciful Heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 75]: As he spoke , they were both thrown back half-stunned ; a crash of thunder burst over the house , which shook everything in it ; a sulphurous smell pervaded the building , and soon afterwards , when they recovered their feet , they perceived that the house was full of smoke , and they heard the wailing of the women and the shrieks of the children in the bed-places on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 8]: `` God have mercy on us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 43]: exclaimed Ready , who was the first to recover himself , and who now attempted to ascertain the injury which had been done : `` the lightning has struck us , and I fear that the house is on fire somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 8]: `` My wife - my children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 11]: exclaimed Mr. Seagrave ; `` are they all safe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 6]: `` Yes , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 19]: cried Mrs. Seagrave , `` all safe ; Tommy has come to me ; but where is Juno ?
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 3]: Juno ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 4]: Juno answered not .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 20]: William darted to the other side of the house , and found Juno lying on her side , motionless .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 11]: `` She is dead , father , '' cried William .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 34]: `` Help me to carry her out of the house , Mr. Seagrave , '' said Ready , who had lifted up the poor girl ; `` she may be only stunned . ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 22]: They carried Juno out of the house , and laid her on the ground ; the rain poured down in torrents .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 36]: Ready left them for a minute , to ascertain if the house was on fire ; he found that it had been in flames at the further corner , but the rain had extinguished it .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 15]: He then went back to Mr. Seagrave and William , who were with Juno .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 42]: `` I will attend to the girl , sir , '' said Ready ; `` go you and Master William into the house ; Mrs. Seagrave will be too much frightened if she is left alone at such an awful time .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 4]: See , sir !
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 22]: Juno is not dead - her chest heaves - she will come to very soon ; thank God for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 19]: William and Mr. Seagrave returned to the house ; they found Mrs. Seagrave fainting with anxiety and fear .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 20]: The information they brought , that Juno was not killed by the lightning , did much to restore her .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 21]: William soothed little Albert , and Tommy in a few minutes was fast asleep again in his father 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 55]: The storm now abated , and as the day began to break , Ready appeared with Juno , who was sufficiently recovered to he able to walk in with his support ; she was put into her bed , and then Ready and Mr. Seagrave went to examine if further mischief had been done .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 26]: The lightning had come in at the further end of the house , at the part where the fireplace was intended to have been made .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 13]: `` We have been most mercifully preserved , '' said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 18]: `` Yes , sir , thanks be to God for all his goodness , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 19]: `` I think we have a large roll of copper wire , Ready ; have we not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 4]: said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 24]: `` Yes , sir , I was just thinking of it myself ; we will have a lightning-conductor up the first thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 6]: It was now broad daylight .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 40]: Mrs. Seagrave dressed herself and the children , and as soon as she was ready , Mr. Seagrave read such portions of the Psalms as were appropriate , and they earnestly joined in a prayer of thankfulness and humility .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 26]: William went out to prepare the breakfast , and Ready procured the coil of copper wire from those stores which were stowed under the bed-places .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 27]: This he unrolled , and stretched it out straight , and then went for the ladder , which was at the outhouse they had commenced building .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 38]: As soon as breakfast was over , Ready and Mr. Seagrave went out again to fix up the lightning-conductor , leaving William to do the work of Juno , who still remained fast asleep in her bed .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 46]: `` I think , '' said Ready , `` that one of those two trees which are close together will suit the best ; they are not too near the house , and yet quite near enough for the wire to attract the lightning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 17]: `` I agree with you , Ready ; but we must not leave both standing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 29]: `` No , sir , but we shall require them both to get up and fix the wire ; after that we will cut down the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 132]: Ready put his ladder against one of the trees , and , taking with him the hammer and a bag of large spike-nails , drove one of the nails into the trunk of the tree till it was deep enough in to bear his weight ; he then drove in another above it , and so he continued to do , standing upon one of them while he drove in another above , till he had reached the top of the tree , close to the boughs ; he then descended , and , leaving the hammer behind him , took up a saw and small axe , and in about ten minutes he had cut off the head of the cocoa-nut tree , which remained a tall , bare pole .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 17]: `` Take care , Ready , how you come down , '' said Mr. Seagrave anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 36]: `` Never fear , sir , '' replied Ready ; `` I 'm not so young as I was , but I have been too often at the mast-head , much higher than this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 36]: Ready came down again , and then cut down a small pole , to fix with a thick piece of pointed wire at the top of it , on the head of the cocoa-nut tree .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 34]: He then went up , lashed the small pole to the head of the tree , made the end of the copper wire fast to the pointed wire , and then he descended .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 36]: The other tree near to it was then cut down , and the lower end of the wire buried in the ground at the bottom of the tree on which the lightning-conductor had been fixed .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 26]: `` That 's a good job done , sir , '' said Ready , wiping his face , for he was warm with the work .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 27]: `` Yes , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` and we must put up another near the outhouse , or we may lose our stores . ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 7]: `` Very true , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 12]: `` You understand this , William , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 4]: said his father .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 37]: `` O yes , papa ; lightning is attracted by metal , and will now strike the point instead of the house , run down the wire , and only tear up the ground below . ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 32]: `` It 's coming on again , sir , as thick as ever , '' observed the old man ; `` we shall do no work to-day , I 'm afraid .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 12]: I 'll just go and see where the stock are . ''
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 21]: Juno was now up again , and said that she was quite well , with the exception of a headache .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 27]: As Ready had predicted , the rain now came on again with great violence , and it was impossible to do any work out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 10]: At the request of William he continued his narrative .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 5]: Narrative of Old Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 37]: `` Well , William , as soon as they had let go their anchor in Table Bay , we were all ordered on shore , and sent up to a prison close to the Government Gardens .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 59]: We were not very carefully watched , as it appeared impossible for us to get away , and I must say we were well treated in every respect ; but we were told that we should be sent to Holland in the first man-of-war which came into the bay , and we did not much like the idea .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 49]: `` There were , as I told you , some other boys as well as myself , who belonged to the Indiaman , and we kept very much together , not only because we were more of an age , but because we had been shipmates so long .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 73]: Two of these boys , one of whom I have mentioned as Jack Romer , and the other Will Hastings , were my particular friends ; and one day , as we were sitting under the wall warming ourselves , for it was winter time , Romer said , ` How very easy it would be for us to get away , if we only knew where to go to ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 38]: ` Yes , ' replied Hastings ; ` but where are we to go to , if it is not to the Hottentots and wild savages ; and when we get there , what can we do ?
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 9]: - we ca n't get any further . '
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 26]: ` Well , ' said I , ` I would rather be living free among savages , than be shut up in a prison . '
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 62]: That was our first talk on the subject , but we had many others afterwards ; and as the one or two Dutch soldiers who stood sentry spoke English , and we could talk a little Dutch , we obtained a good deal of information from them ; for they had very often been sent to the frontiers of the colony .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 28]: We continued to ask questions , and to talk among ourselves for about two months , and at last we resolved that we would make our escape .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 25]: We should have done much better if we had remained where we were ; but there is no putting old heads upon young shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 88]: We saved up our provisions , bought some long Dutch knives , tied our few clothes up in bundles , and one dark night we contrived to remain in the yard without being perceived , when the prisoners were locked up ; and raising a long pole , which lay in the yard , to the top of the wall , with a good deal of scrambling we contrived to get over it , and made off as fast as we could for the Table Mountain . ''
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 12]: `` What was your reason for going there , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 136]: `` Why , Hastings , who was the oldest , and , I will say , the sharpest of the three , said that we had better stay up there for a few days , till we had made up our minds what to do , and try if we could not procure a musket or two , and ammunition ; for , you see , we had money , as , when the Indiaman was first taken , the captain divided a keg of rupees , which was on board , among the officers and men , in proportion to the wages due to them , thinking it was better for the crew to have the money than to leave it for the Frenchmen ; and we had spent very little while in prison .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 70]: There was also another reason why he persuaded us to go to the Table Mountain , which was , that as soon as our escape was found out , they would send parties to look for us ; thinking , of course , that we had made for the interior ; and we should have less chance of being retaken if we travelled after the first search was over .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 53]: The soldiers had told us of the lions , and other wild animals , and how dangerous it was to travel , and Hastings said , that not finding us , they would suppose we had been destroyed by the wild beasts , and would not look for us any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 29]: `` Foolish indeed , '' observed Mrs. Seagrave , `` to set off you knew not where , in a country full of wild beasts and savages . ''
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 10]: `` True enough , madam , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 54]: `` We ran at first until we were out of breath , and then we walked on as fast as we could - not going right up the mountain , but keeping a slanting direction to the south-west , so as to get away from the town , and more towards False Bay .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 33]: `` We had walked about four hours , and began to feel very tired , when the day dawned , and then we looked out for a place to conceal ourselves in .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 28]: We soon found a cave with a narrow entrance , large enough inside to hold half-a-dozen of such lads as we were , and we crawled in .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 59]: It was quite dry , and , as we were very tired , we lay down with our heads on our bundles , intending to take a nap ; but we had hardly made ourselves comfortable and shut our eyes , when we heard such a screaming and barking that we were frightened out of our lives almost .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 9]: We could not think what it could be .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 72]: At last Hastings peeped out , and began to laugh ; so Homer and I looked out also , and there we saw about one hundred and fifty large baboons leaping and tumbling about in such a way as I never saw ; they were bigger than we were - indeed , when they stood on their hind legs they were much taller , and they had very large white tusks .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 23]: Some of them were females , with young ones on their backs , and they were just as active as the males .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 41]: At last they played such antics , that we all burst out into a loud laugh , and we had not ceased when we found the grinning face of one of the largest of those brutes close to our own .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 12]: He had dropped from the rock above us , like magic .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 27]: We all three backed into the cave , very much frightened , for the teeth of the animal were enormous , and he looked very savage .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 24]: He gave a shrill cry , and we perceived all the rest of the herd coming to him as fast as they could .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 36]: I said that the cave was large enough to hold six of us ; but there was a sort of inner cave which we had not gone into , as the entrance was much smaller .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 72]: Homer cried out , ` Let us go into the inside cave - we can get in one by one ; ' and he backed in ; Hastings followed with his bundle , and I hurried in after him just in time ; for the baboons , who had been chattering to each other for half a minute , came into the outer cave just as I crawled into the inner .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 15]: Five or six of them came in , all males , and very large .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 47]: The first thing they did was to lay hold of Homer 's bundle , which they soon opened - at once they seized his provisions and rammed them into their pouches , and then they pulled out the other things and tore them all to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 22]: As soon as they had done with the bundle , two of them came towards the inner cave and saw us .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 31]: One put his long paw in to seize us ; but Hastings gave him a slash with his knife , and the animal took his paw out again fast enough .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 65]: It was laughable to see him hold out his hand to the others , and then taste the blood with the tip of his tongue , and such a chattering I never heard - they were evidently very angry , and more came into the cave and joined them ; then another put in his hand , and received a cut just as before .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 30]: At last , two or three at once tried to pull us out , but we beat them all off with our knives , wounding them all very severely .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 28]: For about an hour they continued their attempts , and then they went away out of the cave , but remained at the mouth shrieking and howling .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 54]: We began to be very tired of this work , and Homer said that he wished he was back in prison again ; and so did I , I can assure you ; but there was no getting out , for had we gone out the animals would have torn us to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 36]: We agreed that we had no chance but the animals becoming tired and going away ; and most anxious we were , for the excitement had made us very thirsty , and we wanted water .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 46]: We remained for two hours in this way imprisoned by baboons , when all of a sudden a shrill cry was given by one of the animals , and the whole herd went galloping off as fast as they could , screaming louder than ever .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 63]: We waited for a short time to see if they would return , and then Hastings crawled out first , and looking out of the cave very cautiously , said that they were all gone , and that he could see nothing but a Hottentot sitting down watching some cattle ; we therefore all came out , very happy at our release .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 24]: That was our first adventure ; we had plenty afterwards ; but I think it is now time we should go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 21]: It is my opinion we shall have a fine day to-morrow , sir ; but there 's no saying . ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 19]: `` I do so want to hear what happened to you afterwards , Ready , '' said William .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 47]: `` Well , so you shall ; but there 's a time for everything , and this is bed-time , unless you like to go with me ; the weather has cleared up , and I want to catch a fish or two for to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 23]: Chapter XXXV As Ready had predicted , the weather set in fine after the violent storm of which we have made mention .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 65]: For a fortnight , with little intermission , it continued fine , and during that time , Ready , Mr. Seagrave , and William worked from daylight till dusk at the storehouse , which they were so anxious to complete , and were so tired when their work was over , that even William did not ask Ready to go on with his history .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 64]: At last the storehouse was complete , thatched and wattled in on three sides , leaving one open for ventilation ; the lower part , which had been arranged for the folding of the stock at night and during the rainy season , was also wattled in with cocoa-nut boughs on three sides , and made a very comfortable retreat for the animals .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 29]: The winding path to the storehouse was also cut through the cocoa-nut grove , but the stumps were not removed , as they could not spare the time .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 26]: All the stores that they had brought round were put into the storehouse , and they were now ready to take up some other job .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 32]: It was , however , agreed that , on the day after the building was finished , they should all have a day 's holiday , which they certainly did require .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 28]: William caught some fish , a turtle was speared and wheeled up to the house ; and they not only had a holiday , but a feast .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 63]: Mr. Seagrave and William had been walking on the beach with Mrs. Seagrave and the children , while Ready was assisting Juno in cutting up the turtle ; they had shown Mrs. Seagrave the storehouse , and the goats with the four kids had been led there , as there was no longer any occasion for them to remain in the house .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 15]: The weather was beautiful , and they agreed to go and examine the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 16]: They found that the seeds had not yet commenced sprouting , notwithstanding the heavy rains .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 21]: `` I should have thought that so much rain would have made them come up , '' said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 44]: `` No , my dear , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` they require more of the sun than they will have till the rainy season is nearly over ; a few days like this , and they will soon be above-ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 19]: `` Let us sit down on this knoll , it is quite dry , '' said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 22]: `` I little thought , '' continued she , `` that I could have been so happy in a desert island .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 28]: I thought I should feel the loss of books very severely , but I really do not think that I could have found time to read . ''
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 15]: `` Employment is a source of happiness , especially when you are usefully employed .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 39]: An industrious person is always a happy person , provided he is not obliged to work too hard ; and even where you have cause for unhappiness , nothing makes you forget it so soon as occupation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 23]: `` But , mamma , we shall not always have so much to do as we have now , '' said William .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 24]: `` Of course not , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` and then we shall find our books a great source of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 50]: I am anxious to go to the other side of the island , and see what have been spared to us , and whether they have been much damaged ; but that can not be until after the rains are over , and we can use the boat again .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 32]: `` Look at this minute insect which is crawling on my finger , '' said Mr. Seagrave , turning to William : `` what a number of legs it has ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 13]: `` Yes , I have seen something like it in old books .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 17]: How fast it runs with its little legs ; thinner than hairs - how wonderful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 34]: `` Yes , William , '' replied Mr. Seagrave , `` we have only to examine into any portion , however small , of creation , and we are immediately filled with wonder .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 37]: There is nothing which points out to us the immensity and the omniscience of the Almighty more than the careful provision which has been made by Him for the smallest and most insignificant of created beings .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 27]: This little animal is perhaps one of many millions , who have their term of existence , and their enjoyment , as well as we have .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 59]: - an insect of the minutest kind , a nothing in creation ; yet has the same care been bestowed upon its formation : these little legs , hardly visible , have their muscles and their sinews ; and every other portion of its body is as complete , as fearfully and wonderfully fashioned , as our own .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 26]: Such is his will ; and what insects we ought to feel ourselves , when compared to the God of power and of love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 29]: `` Let me also point out to you , William , '' continued Mr. Seagrave , `` the infinity of his creative power , displayed in endless variety .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 65]: Amongst the millions of men that have been born , and died , if ever yet were there seen two faces or two bodies exactly alike ; nay , if you could examine the leaves upon the trees , although there may be millions upon millions in a forest , you could not discover two leaves of precisely the same form and make . ''
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 37]: `` I have often tried in vain , '' replied William ; `` yet some animals are so much alike , that I can not perceive any difference between them - sheep , for instance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 80]: `` Very true ; you can not tell the difference , because you have not examined them ; but a shepherd , if he has seven hundred sheep under his care , will know every one of them from the others ; which proves that there must be a great difference between them , although not perceptible to the casual observer ; and the same , no doubt , is the case with all other classes of animals . ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 63]: `` Yes , William , '' observed Ready ; `` I have often wondered over the things that I have seen , and I have even in my ignorance felt what your papa has now told you ; and it has brought into my mind the words of Job : ` When I consider , I am afraid of him ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 34]: `` Papa , '' said William , after a pause in the conversation , `` you have referred to the variety - the wonderful variety - shown in the works of the Deity .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 10]: Tell me some other prominent feature in creation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 13]: `` One of the most remarkable , William , is order . ''
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 19]: `` Point out to me , papa , where and in what that quality is most observable . ''
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 109]: `` Everywhere and in everything , my dear boy ; whether we cast our eyes up to the heavens above us , or penetrate into the bowels of the earth , the principle of order is everywhere - everything is governed by fixed laws , which can not be disobeyed : we have order in the seasons , in the tides , in the movement of the heavenly bodies , in the instinct of animals , in the duration of life assigned to each ; from the elephant who lives more than a century , to the ephemeral fly , whose whole existence is limited to an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 11]: `` Inanimate nature is subject to the same unvarying laws .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 81]: Metals , and rocks , and earths , and all the mineral kingdom follow one law in their crystallization , never varying from the form assigned to them ; each atom depositing itself in the allotted place , until that form is complete : we have order in production , order in decay ; but all is simple to him by whom the planets were thrown out into space , and were commanded to roll in their eternal orbits . ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 26]: `` Yes ; the stars in the heavens are beautiful , '' said William , `` but they are not placed there in order . ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 87]: `` The fixed stars do not appear to us to be in order - that is , they do not stud the heavens at equal distances from each other as we view them ; but you must recollect that they are at very different distances from this earth , spreading over all infinity of space ; and we have reason to suppose that this our earth is but a mere unit in the multitude of created worlds , only one single portion of an infinite whole .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 36]: As the stars now appear to us , they are useful to the mariner , enabling him to cross the trackless seas ; and to the astronomer , who calculates the times and seasons . ''
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 29]: `` What do you mean , papa , by saying that this world of ours is supposed to be but one of a multitude of created worlds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 31]: `` Our little knowledge is bounded to this our own earth , which we have ascertained very satisfactorily to be but one of several planets revolving round our own sun .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 55]: I say our own sun , because we have every reason to suppose that each of those fixed stars , and myriads now not visible to the naked eye , are all suns , bright and glorious as our own , and of course throwing light and heat upon unseen planets revolving round them .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 21]: Does not this give you some idea of the vastness , the power , and the immensity of God ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 16]: `` One almost loses one 's self in the imagination , '' said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 104]: `` Yes , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` and it has been surmised by some , who have felt in their hearts the magnificence of the Great Architect , that there must be some point of view in space where all those glorious suns , which seem to us confused in the heavens above us , will appear all symmetrically arranged , will there be viewed in regular order , whirling round in one stupendous and perfect system of beauty and design ; and where can that be , if it is not in that heaven which we hope to gain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 26]: There was a silence for a few moments , when William said , `` They say that there are people who are atheists , papa .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 12]: How can they be so if they only look around them ?
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 19]: I am sure a mere examination of the works of God ought to make them good Christians . ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 18]: `` No , my child , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` there you are in error .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 26]: Few deny the existence of a Deity , and an examination of his works may make them good and devout men , but not Christians .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 28]: There are good men to be found under every denomination , whether they be Jews , Mahomedans , or Pagans ; but they are not Christians . ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 7]: `` Very true , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 62]: `` Faith in things seen , if I may use the term , my dear child , may induce men to acknowledge the power and goodness of the Almighty , but it will not make them wise to salvation ; for that end , it is necessary , as the Apostle saith , to have faith in things not seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 25]: Chapter XXXVI `` Well , Ready , '' said Mr. Seagrave , after breakfast , `` which is to be our next job ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 33]: `` Why , sir , I think we had better all set to , to collect the branches and ends of the cocoa-nut trees cut down , and stack them for fuel .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 39]: Tommy and Juno have already made a good large pile , and I think , by to-night , we shall have made the stack , and so arranged it that the rain will not get into it much .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 48]: After that , as the weather will not permit us to leave the house for any time , we will cut our salt-pan and make our fish-pond ; they will take a week at least , and then we shall have little more to do near home .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 36]: I think the strength of the rains is over already , and perhaps in a fortnight we may venture to walk through the wood , and examine what we have saved from the wreck . ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 16]: `` And we are to explore the island ; are we not , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 3]: said William .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 8]: `` I long to do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 36]: `` Yes , William , but that must be almost the last job ; for we shall be away for two or three nights , perhaps , and we must look out for fine weather .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 18]: We will , however , do that before we bring the stores round in the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 12]: `` But how are we to make the salt-pan , Ready ?
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 11]: We must cut it out of the solid rock . ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 55]: `` Yes , William ; but I have three or four of what they call cold chisels , and with one of them and a hammer , we shall get on faster than you think ; for the coral rock , although hard at the surface , is soft a little below it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 16]: The whole of that day was employed in piling up the cocoa-nut branches and wood .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 32]: Ready made a square stack , like a haystack , with a gable top , over which he tied the long branches , so that the rain would pour off it .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 57]: `` There , '' said Ready , as he came down the ladder , `` that will be our provision for next year ; we have quite enough left to go on with till the rainy season is over , and we shall have no difficulty in collecting it afterwards when the weather is dry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 45]: Mr. Seagrave sighed and looked grave ; Ready observed it , and said , `` Mr. Seagrave , it is not that we may want it ; but still we must prepare for the next rainy season , in case we do want it .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 52]: That Captain Osborn , if he lives , will send to look for us , I have no doubt ; nay , I believe that Mackintosh will do the same ; but still you must not forget that they all may have perished , although we have been so mercifully preserved .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 11]: We must put our trust in God , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 18]: `` We must , Ready ; and if it is his will , we must not murmur .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 23]: I have schooled myself as much as possible ; but thoughts will come in spite of my endeavours to restrain them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 34]: `` Of course they will , sir ; that 's natural : however , sir , you must hope for the best ; fretting is no good , and it is sinful . ''
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 33]: `` I feel it is , Ready ; and when I see how patient , and even happy , my wife is under such privations , I am angry with myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 13]: `` A woman , sir , bears adversity better than a man .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 52]: A woman is all love , and if she has but her husband and children with her , and in good health , she will make herself happy almost anywhere : but men are different : they can not bear being shut out of the world as you are now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 38]: `` It is our ambition which makes us unhappy , Ready , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` but let us say no more about it : God must dispose of me as he thinks fit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 14]: After supper , Ready , being requested by William , continued his narrative .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 34]: `` I left off , if I recollect right , William , just as the Hottentot , with the cattle under his care , had frightened away the baboons who were tormenting us .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 34]: Well , we came out of the cave and sat down under the rock , so that the Hottentot could not see us , and we had a sort of council of war .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 51]: Romer was for going back and giving ourselves up again ; for he said it was ridiculous to be wandering about without any arms to defend ourselves against wild beasts , and that we might fall in with something worse than the baboons very soon ; and he was right .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 44]: It would have been the wisest thing which we could have done ; but Hastings said , that if we went back we should be laughed at , and the idea of being laughed at made us all agree that we would not .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 40]: Bear this in mind , William , and never let the fear of ridicule induce you to do what is wrong ; or if you have done wrong , prevent you from returning to what is your duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 22]: `` Many thanks for your advice , Ready ; I hope William will not forget it , '' said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 47]: `` Well , sir , such was our reason for not giving up our mad scheme ; and having so decided , the next point of consultation between us was , how we were to procure arms and ammunition , which we could not do without .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 47]: As we were talking this over , I peeped from behind the rock to see where the Hottentot might be ; I perceived that he had laid himself down , and wrapped himself up in his kross , a mantle of sheep-skins which they always wear .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 53]: Now we had observed that he carried his musket in his hand , when we first saw him , as the Hottentots always go out armed , and I pointed out to Hastings and Romer that if he was asleep , we might get possession of his musket without his perceiving it .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 27]: This was a good idea , and Hastings said he would crawl to him on his hands and knees , while we remained behind the rock .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 44]: He did so very cautiously , and found the man 's head covered up in his kross and fast asleep ; so there was no fear , for the Hottentots are very hard to wake at any time ; that we knew well .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 49]: Hastings first took the musket and carried it away out of the reach of the Hottentot , and then he returned to him , cut the leather thong which slung his powder-horn and ammunition , and retreated with all of them without disturbing the man from his sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 36]: We were quite overjoyed at this piece of good luck , and determined to walk very cautiously some distance from where the Hottentot lay , that in case he awoke he should not see us .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 35]: Keeping our eyes about in every direction , lest we should meet with anybody else , we proceeded nearly a mile towards Table Bay , when we fell in with a stream of water .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 40]: This was another happy discovery , for we were very thirsty ; so we concealed ourselves near the stream after we had quenched our thirst , and made a dinner off the provisions we had brought with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 18]: `` But , Ready , did you not do wrong to steal the Hottentot 's musket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 17]: `` No , William ; in that instance it could not be considered as a theft .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 50]: We were in an enemy 's country , trying to escape ; we were therefore just as much at war with the country as we were when they took us prisoners , and we no more stole the musket than they could be said to have stolen our ship .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 9]: Am I not right , Mr. Seagrave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 26]: `` I believe you are justified in what may seem extreme acts for the recovery of your liberty , after you have been made prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 8]: It has always been so considered . ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 29]: `` Well , sir , to go on : we waited till dusk , and then we continued our march towards False Bay as fast as we could .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 36]: We knew that there were farmers down in the valley , or rather on the sides of the hills , and we hoped to obtain , by some means or other , two more muskets .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 55]: It was near twelve o'clock at night , with a bright moon , when we had a sight of the water in False Bay , and soon afterwards we heard the baying of a large dog , and not far from us we distinguished two or three farmhouses , with their cattle-folds and orchards .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 25]: We then looked for a hiding-place , where we might remain till the morning ; we found one between some large pieces of rock .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 26]: We agreed that one should watch while the other two slept ; this Hastings undertook to do , as he was not inclined to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 14]: At daylight he woke Romer and me , and we made our breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 27]: From the place we were concealed in , we had a bird 's - eye view of the farmhouse , and of what was going on .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 21]: `` The farmhouse and buildings just below us were much smaller than the other two , which were more distant .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 9]: We watched the people as they went about .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 41]: In about an hour the Hottentots came out , and we perceived that they were yoking the oxen to the waggon ; they yoked twelve pair , and then the Hottentot driver got in and drove off towards Cape Town .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 34]: Soon after that , another Hottentot drove the cows up the valley to feed ; and then a Dutch woman came out of the house with two children , and fed the poultry .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 30]: `` We watched for another hour , and then the farmer himself made his appearance , with a pipe in his mouth , and sat down on a bench .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 26]: When his pipe was out , he called to the house , and a Hottentot woman came to him with more tobacco and a light .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 40]: During the whole of the day we did not see any other people about the house , so we concluded that there were no more than the farmer , his wife , the Hottentot woman , and two children .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 59]: About two hours after noon the farmer went to the stable and led out his horse , mounted , mid rode away ; we saw him speak to the Hottentot woman when he rode off , and she soon after went down the valley with a basket on her head , and a long knife in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 65]: Then Hastings said it was time that we moved , for there was but one woman in the house , and we could easily overpower her and get what we wanted ; still there was a great risk , as she might give the alarm , and we should have to escape in the day-time , and might be seen and taken prisoners again .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 29]: However , as it was our only chance , we resolved to go down to the farmhouse very cautiously , and be all ready to seize any opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 85]: We crept down the hill , and gained the fence , which was at the back of the farmhouse , without being discovered : we remained there for about a quarter of an hour , when , to our great joy , we observed the farmer 's wife go out of the house , leading a child in each hand ; apparently she was going to visit one of her neighbours , for she went in the direction of one of the other farms .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 40]: As soon as she was a hundred yards off , Hastings crept softly through the fence , and entered the farmhouse by the back-door ; he came out again , and made a sign for us to come in .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 49]: We found him already in possession of a rifle and a musket , which had been hanging over the fire-place , and we soon handed down the powder-horns and ammunition pouches , which were hung up at a different part of the room , away from the fire-place .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 35]: `` Having gained these , Hastings set me to watch at the front door , lest anybody should return , while Romer and he looked out for something else in the way of provisions .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 20]: We got possession of three hams , and a large loaf of bread as big as a small washing-tub .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 13]: With these articles we made our way safe back to our retreat .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 22]: We then looked round , and could see nobody in any direction , so we presumed that we were not discovered .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 75]: As there was a sort of ravine full of rocks dividing the hill , which we were obliged to pass before we could get into the valley , unless we went down close to the farmhouse , we agreed that it would be better at once to cross it during the day-time , so that we should get that difficulty over , and , at the same time , be further from the farmhouse .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 32]: We did so ; and found a very secure hiding-place , where we lay down , waiting for the sun to set before we started on our journey into the interior .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 18]: I think I had better leave off now , William , as it is getting late . ''
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 10]: Chapter XXXVII The fishpond was commenced the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 60]: Ready , Mr. Seagrave , and William went down together to the beach , and , after much examination , chose a spot about one hundred yards from the turtle-pond as most eligible for the purpose ; the water being shallow , so that at the part farthest from the shore there would not be more than three feet .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 78]: `` Now , sir , '' said Ready , `` this is a very simple job ; all we have to do is to collect small rocks and stones , pile them up wall-fashion inside , and with a slope outside , so as to break the force of the waves when the water is a little rough ; of course , the water will find its way through the stones , and will be constantly changed .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 76]: It 's very true , that we can at most times catch fish when we want them , but it is not always that we can spare the time , so it 's just as well to have always a certain quantity at hand , to take out at a moment 's warning ; and we can , of course , catch them and put them in here when we have nothing else to do .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 27]: Juno will be able to come down and take them out with a spear , when we are away and she wants something for dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 25]: `` But there are few stones about here , Ready ; we shall have to fetch them a long way , '' said William .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 27]: `` Well , then , William , let us get the wheels down here , and then we can carry a quantity at a time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 11]: `` But how shall we carry them , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 43]: `` We will sling a tub on the axle ; I will go up and get that ready and bring it down ; in the meantime , you and Mr. Seagrave can collect all the stones which are near at hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 50]: Ready soon returned with the wheels , and the tub slung with rope on the axle , and by that means they found that they could collect the stones very fast ; Mr. Seagrave and William bringing them , and Ready in the water , building up the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 30]: `` We have quite forgot another job which we must put in hand , sir , '' observed Ready ; `` but the fish-pond reminds me of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 8]: `` What is that , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 33]: `` A bathing-place for the children , and indeed for us all ; we shall want it when the hot weather comes on , but we will put it off till then .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 49]: I can tell you , sir , that although I do n't mind building this wall in the shallow water , I shall be very careful when the water is up to my knees , for you do n't know how bold the sharks are in these latitudes .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 21]: When I was at St. Helena , not very long ago , we had a melancholy proof of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 9]: `` Tell us the story , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 30]: `` Well , two soldiers were standing on the rocks at St. Helena ; the rocks were out of the water , but the swell just broke over them .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 38]: Two sharks swam up to them , and one of them , with a blow of his tail , turning round the same way , tripped one of them into the water , which was very deep .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 17]: His comrade was very much frightened , and ran to the barracks to tell the story .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 102]: About a week afterwards , a schooner was in Sandy Bay , on the other side of the island , and the people seeing a very large shark under the stern , put out a hook with a piece of pork , and caught him ; they opened him , and found inside of him , to their horror , the whole of the body of the soldier , except the legs below the knees : the monster had swallowed him whole , with the exception of his legs , which it had nipped off when it closed its jaws . ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 15]: `` I really had no idea that they were so bold , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 36]: `` It is a fact , I assure you ; and therefore we can not be too careful how we go into the water : you saw how soon the poor pig was despatched . ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 15]: `` I wonder how the pigs get on , Ready , '' said William .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 21]: `` I dare say they have littered by this time , sir ; they have no want of food . ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 9]: `` But can they eat the cocoa-nuts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 31]: `` Not the old ones , but they can the young ones , which are constantly dropping from the trees , and then there 's plenty of roots for them .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 48]: If we stay long here we shall soon have good sport hunting them ; but we must be very careful ; for although they were tame pigs when we brought them on shore , they will be wild and very savage in a very short time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 8]: `` How must we hunt them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 4]: said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 14]: `` Why , sir , with the dogs , and then shoot them .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 17]: I am glad that Vixen will have pups soon ; we shall want more dogs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 15]: `` Shall we not have more mouths than we can find food for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 18]: `` Never fear that , sir , as long as we have the sea to fish in .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 14]: Dogs live very well upon fish , even if it is raw . ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 15]: `` We shall have some lambs soon , Ready , shall we not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 10]: `` Yes , sir , I expect very soon .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 67]: I wish we had more food for the animals : they are put rather hard to it just now ; but next year , if we find more food on the island , we must keep the grass near home , to make hay and stack it for the winter time - or the rainy season rather , for there is no winter in these latitudes .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 40]: I 'm pretty sure we shall find some clear land on the south of the island , for the cocoa-nut grove does not extend so close to the water on that side as it does on the north . ''
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 16]: `` I do so long to go on our exploring party , '' said William .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 38]: `` We must wait a little , '' replied Ready ; `` but I do n't know whether you will go ; we must not all three go at once , and leave Mrs. Seagrave alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 25]: `` No , '' replied Mr. Seagrave , `` that would not be fair ; either you or I must remain , William . ''
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 23]: William made no reply , but it was evident that he was annoyed at the idea of not being of the party .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 17]: They worked very hard that day , and the walls rose fast out of the water .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 8]: After supper , Ready continued his narrative .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 52]: `` We remained concealed until it was dark , and then Hastings and Romer , each with a musket on his shoulders and a ham at his back ; and I , being the smallest , with the rifle and the great loaf of bread , set off on our journey .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 53]: Our intention was to travel north , as we knew that was the road leading from the colony ; but Hastings had decided that we should first go to the eastward , so as to make what we sailors call a circumbendibus , which would keep us out of the general track .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 47]: We passed through the deep sands of False Bay , and after that gradually ascended , getting among brushwood and young trees ; but we saw no signs of cultivation , nor did we pass one house after we had left False Bay astern of us .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 33]: About twelve o'clock we were very much fatigued , and longed for a drink of water , but we did not find any , although the moon shone as bright as day .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 41]: We distinctly heard , however , what we did not much like , the howling and cries of the wild beasts which increased as we went on ; still we did not see any , and that was our comfort .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 18]: At last we were so tired that we all sat down on the ledge of a rock .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 22]: We dared not go to sleep , so we remained there till daylight , listening to the howling of the animals .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 46]: We none of us spoke , and I presume that Hastings ' and Romer 's thoughts were the same as my own , which were , that I would have given a great deal to find myself safe and sound again within the prison walls .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 59]: However , daylight came at last ; the wild beasts did not prowl any more ; we walked on till we found a stream of water , where we sat down and took our breakfast , after which our courage revived , and we talked and laughed as we walked on , just as we had done before .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 25]: We now began to ascend the mountains , which Hastings said must be the Black Mountains that the soldiers had talked to us about .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 49]: They were very desolate ; and when night came on we collected brushwood , and cut down branches with our knives , that we might make a fire , not only to warm ourselves , but to scare away the wild beasts , whose howling had already commenced .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 44]: We lighted our fire and ate our supper ; the loaf was half gone , and the hams had been well cut into - we knew , therefore , that very soon we should have to trust to our guns for procuring food .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 32]: As soon as we had finished our meal , we lay down by the fire , with our muskets loaded close to us , and our ammunition placed out of danger .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 11]: We were so tired that we were soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 40]: It had been agreed that Romer should keep the first watch , and Hastings the middle , and I the morning ; but Romer fell asleep , and the consequence was , that the fire was not kept up .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 48]: It was about midnight that I was awakened by something breathing hard in my face , and just as I could recall my senses and open my eyes , I found myself lifted up by my waistband , and the teeth of some animal pinching my flesh .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 49]: I tried to catch at my musket , but I put out my wrong hand , and laid hold of a still lighted brand out of the fire , which I darted into the animal 's face ; it let me drop directly , and ran away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 7]: `` What a providential escape ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 4]: said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 14]: `` Yes , it was , ma'am ; the animal was a hyena .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 50]: Fortunately they are a very cowardly sort of beast ; still , had it not been for the lighted stick , it would have carried me off , for I was very small then , and it lifted me up as if I was a feather in its mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 14]: The shout I gave woke Hastings , who seized his musket and fired .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 11]: I was very much frightened , as you may suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 20]: As for Romer , he never woke till we pushed him hard , he was so completely knocked up .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 30]: This affair , of course , made us more cautious , and afterwards we lighted two fires , and slept between them , one always remaining on the watch .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 25]: For a week we travelled on , and as soon as we were over the mountains , we turned our heads to the northward .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 47]: Our provisions were all gone , and we were one day without any ; but we killed an antelope called a spring-bock , which gave us provisions for three or four days : there was no want of game after we had descended into the plain .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 28]: I forgot to mention , however , a narrow escape we had , just before we had left an extensive forest on the side of the mountain .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 33]: We had walked till past noon , and were very much tired ; we decided upon taking our dinner under a large tree , and we threw ourselves down in the shade .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 81]: Hastings was lying on his back , with his eyes looking upwards , when he perceived on the lower branch of the tree a panther , which lay along it , his green eyes fixed upon us , and ready to spring ; he seized his musket , and fired it without taking aim , for there was no time ; but the ball entered the stomach of the animal , and , as it appeared , divided its back-bone .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 63]: Down came the beast , within three or four feet of where we lay , with a loud roar , and immediately crouched to spring upon Romer ; but it could not , for the back-bone being broken , it had not any power in its hinder quarters , so it raised up its fore quarters , and then dropped down again .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 14]: I never saw such rage and fury in an animal in my life .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 33]: At first we were too much frightened to fire ; but , perceiving that the beast could not spring , Hastings snatched the musket from Romer and shot it through the head .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 18]: `` We were now obliged to hunt for our livelihood , and we became bolder than ever .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 39]: Our clothes were all in rags ; but we had plenty of powder and ammunition ; there were hundreds and hundreds of antelopes and gnus in the plain - indeed , sometimes it was impossible to count them .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 34]: But this plentiful supply of game was the cause of our being in greater danger , for now , for the first time , we heard the roar of the lions every night .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 23]: We made large fires to keep them off , but they often made us tremble when they came near to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 12]: `` Did you ever meet with one in the day-time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 3]: said William .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 27]: `` Yes , sir ; we often saw them , but they never attacked us , and we were too much afraid to fire at them .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 8]: Once we met one face to face .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 24]: We had killed an antelope called a hartebeest , and , with our muskets on our shoulders , were running to secure it .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 56]: Just as we came up to the spot , we beard a roar , and found ourselves not ten yards from a lion , who was lying on the top of the beast we had killed , his eyes flashing fire at us , and half raising himself , as if ready for a spring .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 12]: We all took to our heels as fast as we could .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 31]: I never looked back till I was out of breath : but the lion was content with our running away , and did not take the trouble to follow us .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 53]: Well , sir , we had been travelling , we really hardly knew where , but certainly in a northerly direction , for three weeks , and were quite worn out : we now all agreed that we had done a very foolish thing , and would gladly have gone back again .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 53]: For my part , I declare that I was willing to lie down and die , if I could have so done , and I became quite indifferent to the roaring of the lions , and felt as if I should be glad if one would have made a meal of me .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 15]: At length , one morning , we fell in with a party of natives .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 36]: They were of the Karroo tribe , as they told us by pointing to themselves , and saying , ` Karroos ' , and then they pointed to us , and said ` Dutch ' .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 27]: We shot game , and gave it to them , which pleased them very much , and they remained with us for five or six days .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 43]: We tried by signs to inquire of them , if there were any Dutch settlement about there ; and they understood us , and said that there was , in a direction which they pointed out to us , to the north-east .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 13]: We offered them a present if they would show us the way .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 25]: Two of the men agreed to go with us ; the rest of the tribe , with the women and children , went southward .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 33]: The next day we arrived at a Dutch settlement of three or four farmhouses , called Graaff Reinet ; but I must leave off now , for it is past bed-time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 20]: Chapter XXXVIII The construction of the fish-pond proceeded rapidly , and on the third day it was nearly complete .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 56]: As soon as all the walls were finished , Ready threw out sand and shingle , so as to make the part next to the beach nearly as deep as the other ; so that there might be sufficient water to prevent the gulls and man-of-war birds from darting down , and striking the fish .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 35]: While Ready was thus employed , Mr. Seagrave and William collected more rocks , so as to divide the pond into four parts , at the same time allowing a communication between each part .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 43]: These inside walls , as well as the outside , were made of sufficient width to walk upon ; by which means they would have all the fish within reach of the spear , in case they wished to take them out .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 11]: The day after the pond was completed the weather changed .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 38]: The rain poured down with great force , but it was not accompanied with such terrific thunder and lightning , nor were the storms of so long continuance , as at the commencement of the rainy season .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 27]: In the intervals of fine weather they caught a great many fish , which they put into the pond , so that it was well stocked .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 40]: But a circumstance occurred , which was the occasion of great alarm to them all ; which was , that one evening William was taken with a shivering , and complained very much of a pain in his head .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 20]: Ready had promised to continue his narrative on that evening , but William was too ill to sit up .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 17]: He was put into bed , and the next morning he was in a violent fever .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 69]: Mr. Seagrave was much alarmed , as the symptoms were worse every hour ; and Ready , who had sat up with him during the night , called Mr. Seagrave out of the house , and said , `` This is a bad case , sir : William was working yesterday with his hat off , and I fear that he has been struck by the sun . ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 23]: The poor boy was for many days in great danger ; and the cheerful house was now one of gloom and silence .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 31]: How fervent were now the morning and evening prayers ; how often during the day did his parents offer up a petition to heaven for their dear boy 's recovery .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 66]: The weather became finer every day , and it was almost impossible to keep Tommy quiet : Juno went out with him and Albert every morning , and kept them with her while she cooked ; and , fortunately , Vixen had some young ones , and when Juno could no longer amuse them , she brought them two of the puppies to play with .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 39]: As for the quiet , meek little Caroline , she would remain during the whole day holding her mother 's hand , and watching her brother , or working with her needle by the side of his bed .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 110]: Ready , who could not be idle , had taken the hammer and cold chisel to make the salt-pan , at which he worked during those portions of the day in which his services were not required indoors ; and as he sat chipping away the rock , his thoughts were ever upon William , for he dearly loved the boy for his amiable disposition and his cleverness ; and many a time during the day would he stop his work , and the tears would run down his cheeks as he offered up his petition to the Almighty that the boy might be spared to his afflicted parents .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 77]: And those prayers were heard , for on the ninth day William was pronounced by Ready and Mr. Seagrave to have much less fever , and shortly afterwards it left him altogether ; but he was so weak that he could not raise himself in his bed for two or three days ; and it was not till more than a fortnight after the fever had left him that he could go out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 29]: The joy that was expressed by them all when the change took place may be imagined : nor were the thanksgivings less fervent than had been the prayers .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 40]: During his convalescence , as there was nothing else to do , Mr. Seagrave and Ready , who now went gladly to their work , determined , as the salt-pan was finished , that they would make a bathing-place .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 47]: Juno came to their assistance , and was very useful in assisting to drag the wheels which brought the rocks and stones ; and Tommy was also brought down , that he might be out of the way while Mrs. Seagrave and Caroline watched the invalid .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 30]: By the time that William was able to go out of the house , the bathing-place was finished , and there was no longer any fear of the sharks .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 71]: William came down to the beach with his mother , and looked at the work which had been done ; he was much pleased with it , and said , `` Now , Ready , we have finished everything at home for the present ; all we have to do is to explore the island , and to go to the cove and examine our collection from the wreck . ''
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 39]: `` Very true , William ; and the weather has been so fine , that I think we may venture upon one or the other in a few days more ; but not till you are stronger . ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 11]: `` I shall soon be strong again , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 27]: `` I have no doubt of it , William ; and we have good reason to thank God , for we could ill spare you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 48]: `` It 's a long while since you have gone on with your story , Ready , '' said William , after they had taken their supper ; `` I wish you would do so now , as I am sure I shall not be tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 30]: `` With pleasure , William , '' replied Ready ; `` but can you remember where I left off , for my memory is none of the best ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 37]: `` Oh , yes ; if you recollect , you had just arrived at a Dutch farmer 's house , in company with the savages , at a place called Graaff Reinet , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 22]: `` Well then , the Dutch farmer came out when he saw us coming , and asked us who we were .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 21]: We told him that we were English prisoners , and that we wished to give ourselves up to the authorities .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 44]: He took away our arms and ammunition , and said that he was the authority in that part , which was true enough ; and then he said , ` You 'll not run away without arms and ammunition , that 's certain .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 38]: As for sending you to the Cape , that I may not be able to do for months ; so if you wish to be fed well , you must work well while you 're here . '
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 26]: We replied , that we should be very glad to make ourselves useful , and then he sent us some dinner by a Hottentot girl .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 35]: But we soon found out that we had to deal with an ill-tempered , brutal fellow ; and that he gave us plenty of hard work , but by no means plenty of food .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 39]: He would not trust us with guns , so the Hottentots went out with the cattle , but he gave us plenty of work to do about the house ; and at last he treated us very cruelly .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 42]: When he was short of provisions for the Hottentots and other slaves , of whom he bad a good many , he would go out with the other farmers who lived near him , and shoot quaggas for them to eat .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 11]: Nobody but a Hottentot could live upon such flesh . ''
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 6]: `` What is quagga ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 32]: `` A wild ass , partly covered with stripes , but not so much as the zebra ; a pretty animal to look at , but the flesh is very bad .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 49]: At last he would give us nothing to eat but quaggas , the same as the Hottentots , while he and his family - for he had a wife and five children - lived upon mutton and the flesh of the antelope , which is very excellent eating .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 30]: We asked him to allow us a gun to procure better food , and he kicked Romer so unmercifully , that he could not work for two days afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 28]: Our lives became quite a burden to us ; we were employed all day on the farm , and every day he was more brutal towards us .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 20]: At last we agreed that we would stand it no longer , and one evening Hastings told him so .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 51]: This put him into a great rage , and he called two of the slaves , and ordered them to tie him to the waggon wheel , swearing that he would cut every bit of skin off his body , and he went into his house to get his whip .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 43]: The slaves had hold of Hastings , and were tying him up , for they dared not disobey their master , when he said to us , ` If I am flogged this way , it will be all over with us .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 35]: Now 's your time ; run back behind the house , and when he comes out with the whip , do you go in and seize the muskets , which are always ready loaded .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 19]: Hold him at bay till I get clear , and then we will get away somehow or other .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 39]: You must do it , for I am sure he will flog me till I am dead , and he will shoot you , as runaway prisoners , as he did his two Hottentots the other day . '
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 41]: As Romer and I thought this very probable , we did as Hastings told us ; and when the Dutchman had gone towards him where he was tied up , about fifty yards from the house , we went in .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 25]: The farmer 's wife was in bed , having just had an addition to her family , and the children we cared not for .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 40]: We seized two muskets and a large knife , and came out just as the Dutchman had struck the first blow with the rhinoceros whip , which was so severe , that it took away poor Hastings ' breath .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 22]: We went up ; he turned round and saw us : we levelled our muskets at him , and he stopped .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 14]: ` Another blow , and we 'll shoot you , ' cried Romer .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 22]: ` Yes , ' cried I ; ` we are only boys , but you 've Englishmen to deal with . '
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 30]: When we came up , Romer kept his piece levelled at the Dutchman , while I passed him , and with the knife cut the thongs which bound Hastings .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 20]: The Dutchman turned pale and did not speak , he was so frightened , and the slaves ran away .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 43]: As soon as Hastings was free , he seized a large wooden mallet , used for driving in stakes , and struck the Dutchman down to the earth , crying out , ` That for flogging an Englishman , you rascal ! '
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 43]: `` While the man lay senseless or dead - I did n't know which at the time - we tied him to the waggon wheels , and returning to the house , seized some ammunition and other articles which might be useful .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 46]: We then went to the stables , and took the three best horses which the Dutchman had , put some corn in a sack for each of them , took some cord for halters , mounted , and rode away as fast as we could .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 60]: As we knew that we should be pursued , we first galloped away as if we were going eastward to the Cape ; and then , as soon as we were on ground which would not show the tracks of our horses ' hoofs , we turned round to the northward , in the direction of the Bushman country .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 36]: It was dark soon after we had altered our course ; but we travelled all night , and although we heard the roaring of the lions at a distance , we met with no accident .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 30]: At daylight we rested our horses , and gave them some corn , and then sat down to eat some of the provision we had brought with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 13]: `` How long were you with the farmer at Graaff Reinet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 31]: `` Nearly eight months , sir ; and during that time we could not only speak Dutch , but we could make ourselves understood by the Hottentots and other natives .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 13]: While we were eating we held a consultation how we should proceed .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 69]: We were aware that the Dutchmen would shoot us if they came up with us , and that they would come out in strong force against us ; and we were afraid that we had killed the man , and if so , they would hang us as soon as we got to the Cape ; so we were at a great loss to know how to act .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 27]: At last we decided that we would cross the country of the Bushmen , and get to the sea-side , to the northward of the Cape .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 37]: We determined that it would be better to travel at night , as there would be less fear of the wild beasts , or of being seen ; so we went fast asleep for many hours .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 24]: Towards the evening , we found water for the horses , and then we fed them again , and proceeded on our journey .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 54]: I wo n't tell what passed every day for a fortnight , by which time we had pretty well killed our horses , and we were compelled to stop among a tribe of Gorraguas , a very mild , inoffensive people , who supplied us with milk , and treated us very kindly .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 7]: We had some adventures , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 45]: One day as we were passing by a tuft of small trees , a rhinoceros charged upon my horse , which very narrowly escaped by wheeling short round and getting behind him ; the beast then made off without meddling with us any more .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 39]: Every day we used to shoot some animal or other , for provision : sometimes it was a gnu , something between an antelope and a bull ; at other times it was one of the antelope kind .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 68]: `` Well , we stayed for three weeks with these people , and gave our horses time to refresh themselves ; and then we set off again , keeping more towards the coast as we went southward , for the Gorraguas told us that there was a fierce native tribe , called Kaffers , to the northward , who would certainly kill us if we went there .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 12]: The fact is , we did not know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 32]: We had left the Cape without any exact idea where we should go to , like foolish boys as we were , and we became more entangled with difficulties every day .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 36]: At last we decided that it would be better to find our way back to the Cape , and deliver ourselves up as prisoners , for we were tired out with fatigue and constant danger .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 80]: All that we were afraid of was that we had killed the Dutch farmer at Graaff Reinet , who had treated us so brutally ; but Hastings said he did not care ; that was his business , and he would take his chance : so when we bade adieu to the Gorraguas , we turned our horses ' heads to the south-east , so as to make the sea and go to the southward at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 13]: `` I have now to mention a most melancholy event which occurred .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 28]: Two days after we had recommenced our travels , in passing through some high grass , we stumbled on a lion , which was devouring a gnu .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 50]: Romer , who happened to be some ten yards foremost of the three , was so alarmed that he fired at the animal , which we had agreed never to do , as it was folly to enrage so powerful a beast , when our party was so small .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 39]: The lion was slightly wounded ; he gave a roar that might have been heard for a mile , sprang upon Romer , and with one blow of his paw knocked him off the saddle into the bushes .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 22]: Our horses , which were frightened , wheeled round and fled , for the animal was evidently about to attack us .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 69]: As it was , he did make one bound in our direction ; we could not pull up until we had gone half a mile ; and when we did , we saw the lion had torn down the horse which Romer had ridden , and was dragging away the carcass to the right at a sort of a canter , without any apparent effort on his part .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 43]: We waited till he was well off , and then rode back to the spot where Romer had fallen : we soon found him , but he was quite dead ; the blow with the lion 's paw had fractured his skull .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 32]: `` I ought to have said that the Gorraguas told us not to travel by night , but by day ; and we had done so in consequence of their advice .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 70]: I believe it was very good advice , notwithstanding this unfortunate accident , for we found that when we had travelled all night the lions had more than once followed us the whole time ; and indeed I have often thought since that we were altogether indebted to his mercy who ordereth all things , both in heaven and earth , that we escaped so well as we did .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 15]: Three days after poor Romer 's death we first saw the wide ocean again .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 48]: We kept near the coast , but we soon found that we could not obtain the supply of game , or fuel for our fires at night , so well as we could in the interior , and we agreed to get away from the coast again .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 37]: We had a dreary plain to pass over , and we were quite faint for want of food - for we had been without any for nearly two days - when we came upon an ostrich .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 25]: Hastings put his horse to his speed , but it was of no use - the ostrich ran much faster than the horse could .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 22]: I remained behind , and , to my great joy , discovered his nest , with thirteen large eggs in it .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 14]: Hastings soon came back , with his horse panting and out of wind .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 37]: We sat down , lighted a fire , and roasted two of the eggs : we made a good dinner of them , and having put four more on our saddle-bows , we continued our journey .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 31]: At last , one forenoon , we saw the Table Mountain , and were as glad to see it as if we had seen the white cliffs of Old England .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 42]: We pushed on our horses with the hopes of being once more comfortably in prison before night ; when , as we neared the bay , we noticed that English colours were flying on board of the vessels in the road .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 34]: This surprised us very much ; but soon after that we met an English soldier , who told us that the Cape had been taken by our forces more than six months ago .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 11]: This was a joyful surprise , as you may suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 42]: We rode into the town , and reported ourselves to the main guard ; the governor sent for us , heard our story , and sent us to the admiral , who took us on board of his own ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 31]: Chapter XXXIX The next morning , as there was no particular work on hand , Ready and Mr. Seagrave took the lines to add to the stock of the fish-pond .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 23]: As the weather was fine and cool , William accompanied them , that he might have the benefit of the fresh air .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 34]: As they passed the garden , they observed that the seeds sown had already sprung up an inch or two above the ground , and that , apparently none of them had missed .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 37]: While Ready and Mr. Seagrave were fishing , and William sitting near them , William said to his father -- `` Many of the islands near us are inhabited ; are they not , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 13]: `` Yes , but not those very near us , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 29]: At all events , I never heard any voyagers mention having seen inhabitants on the isles near which we suppose the one we are on to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 13]: `` What sort of people are the islanders in these seas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 5]: `` They are various .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 10]: The New Zealanders are the most advanced in civilization .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 32]: The natives of Van Diemen 's Land and Australia are some portions of them of a very degraded class - indeed , little better than the beasts of the field . ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 36]: `` I have seen them , '' said Ready ; `` and I think I can mention a people , not very numerous indeed , who are still more like the beasts of the field .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 21]: I saw them once ; and , at first , thought they were animals , and not human beings . ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 11]: `` Indeed , Ready ; where may that be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 16]: `` In the Great Andaman Isles , at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 37]: I once anchored in distress in Port Cornwallis , and the morning after we anchored , we saw some black things going upon all fours under the trees that came down to the water 's edge .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 21]: We got the telescope , and perceived then that they were men and women , for they stood upright . ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 11]: `` Did you ever come into contact with them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 43]: `` No , sir , I did not ; but I met , at Calcutta , a soldier who had ; for at one time the East India Company intended making a settlement on the island , and sent some troops there .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 52]: He said that they caught two of them ; that they were not more than four feet high , excessively stupid and shy ; they had no houses or huts to live in , and all that they did was to pile up some bushes to keep the wind off . ''
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 7]: `` Had they any arms ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 32]: `` Yes , sir , they had bows and arrows ; but so miserably made , and so small , that they could not kill anything but very small birds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 15]: `` Where did the people come from who inhabited these islands , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 59]: `` That is difficult to say , William ; but it is supposed that they have become inhabited in much the same way as this our island has been - that is , by people in canoes or boats driven out to sea , and saving their lives by effecting a landing , as we have done . ''
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 45]: `` I believe that 's the truth , '' replied Ready ; `` I heard say that the Andaman Isles were supposed to have been first inhabited by a slaver full of negroes , who were wrecked on the coast in a typhoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 9]: `` What is a typhoon , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 25]: `` It is much the same as a hurricane , William ; it comes on in India at the change of the monsoons . ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 7]: `` But what are monsoons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 28]: `` Winds that blow regular from one quarter so many months during the year , and then change round and blow from another just as long . ''
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 21]: `` And what are the trade-winds , which I heard poor Captain Osborn talking about after we left Madeira ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 32]: `` The trade-winds blow on the equator , and several degrees north and south of it , from the east to the west , following the course of the sun . ''
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 11]: `` Is it the sun which produces these winds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 37]: `` Yes , the extreme heat of the sun between the tropics rarefies the air as the earth turns round , and the trade-winds are produced by the rushing in of the less heated air . ''
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 20]: `` Yes , William ; and the trade-winds produce what they call the Gulf Stream , '' observed Ready .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 5]: `` How is that ?
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 10]: I have heard it spoken of , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 67]: `` The winds , constantly following the sun across the Atlantic Ocean , and blowing from east to west , have great effect upon the sea , which is forced up into the Gulf of Mexico -LRB- where it is stopped by the shores of America -RRB- , so that it is many feet higher in the Gulf than in the eastern part of the Atlantic .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 68]: This accumulation of water must of course find a vent somewhere , and it does in what is called the Gulf Stream , by which the waters are poured out , running very strong to the northward , along the shores of America , and then eastward , passing not far from Newfoundland , until its strength is spent somewhere to the northward of the Azores . ''
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 53]: `` The Gulf Stream , William , '' said Ready , `` is always several degrees warmer than the sea in general , which is , they say , owing to its waters remaining in the Gulf of Mexico so long , where the heat of the sun is so great . ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 24]: `` What do you mean by the land and sea breezes in the West Indies , and other hot climates , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 37]: `` It is the wind first blowing off from the shore , and then blowing from the sea towards the shore , during certain hours of the day , which it does regularly every twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 12]: This is also the effect of the heat of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 28]: The sea breeze commences in the morning , and in the afternoon it dies away , when the land breeze commences , which lasts till midnight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 44]: `` There are latitudes close to the trade-winds , '' said Ready , `` where the wind is not certain , where ships have been becalmed for weeks ; the crews have exhausted the water on board , and they have suffered dreadfully .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 14]: We call them the Horse latitudes - why , I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 21]: But it is time for us to leave off , and for Master William to go into the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 14]: They returned home , and after supper Ready went on with his narrative .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 30]: `` I left off at the time that I was sent on board of the man-of-war , and I was put down on the books as a supernumerary boy .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 43]: I was on board of her for nearly four years , and we were sent about from port to port , and from clime to clime , until I grew a strong , tall lad , and was put into the mizen-top .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 6]: I found it very comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 69]: I did my duty , and the consequence was , I never was punished ; for a man may serve on board of a man-of-war without fear of being punished , if he only does his duty , and the duty is not very hard either ; not like on board of the merchant vessels , where there are so few hands - there it is hard work .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 54]: Of course , there are some captains who command men-of-war who are harsh and severe ; but it was my good fortune to be with a very mild and steady captain , who was very sorry when he was obliged to punish the men , although he would not overlook any improper conduct .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 28]: The only thing which was a source of constant unhappiness to me was , that I could not get to England again , and see my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 35]: I had written two or three letters , but never had an answer ; and at last I became so impatient that I determined to run away the very first opportunity which might offer .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 49]: We were then stationed in the West Indies , and I had very often consultations with Hastings on the subject , for he was quite as anxious to get away as I was ; and we had agreed that we would start off together the very first opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 30]: At last we anchored in Port Royal , Jamaica , and there was a large convoy of West India ships , laden with sugar , about to sail immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 41]: We knew that if we could get on board of one , they would secrete us until the time of sailing , for they were short-handed enough , the men-of-war having pressed every man they could lay their hands upon .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 41]: There was but one chance , and that was by swimming on board of one of the vessels during the night-time , and that was easy enough , as they were anchored not a hundred yards from our own ship .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 17]: What we were afraid of was the sharks , which were so plentiful in the harbour .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 37]: However , the night before the convoy was to sail we made up our minds that we would run the risk , for we were so impatient to escape that we did not care for anything .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 62]: It was in the middle watch - I recollect it , and shall recollect it all my life , as if it were last night - that we lowered ourselves down very softly from the bows of the ship , and as soon as we were in the water we struck out for one of the West Indiamen close to us .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 66]: The sentry at the gangway saw the light in the water made by our swimming through it , and he hailed , of course ; we gave no answer , but swam as fast as we could ; for after he had hailed we heard a bustle , and we knew that the officer of the watch was manning a boat to send after us .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 54]: I had just caught hold of the cable of the West Indiaman , and was about to climb up by it , for I was a few yards before Hastings , when I heard a loud shriek , and , turning round , perceived a shark plunging down with Hastings in his jaws .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 35]: I was so frightened , that for a short time I could not move : at last I recovered myself , and began to climb up by the cable as fast as I could .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 48]: I was just in time , for another shark made a rush at me ; and although I was clear out of the water more than two feet , he sprung up and just caught my shoe by the heel , which he took down with him .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 63]: Fear gave me strength , and in a second or two afterwards I was up at the hawse-holes , and the men on board , who had been looking over the bows , and had witnessed poor Hastings ' death , helped me on board , and hurried me down below , for the boat from our ship was now nearly alongside .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 36]: When the officer of the boat came on board , they told him they had perceived us both in the water , close to their vessel , and that the sharks had taken us down .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 29]: As the shriek of Hastings was heard by the people in the boat , the officer believed that it was the case , and returned to the ship .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 61]: I heard the drum beat to quarters on board of the man-of-war , that they might ascertain who were the two men who had attempted to swim away , and a few minutes afterwards they beat the retreat , having put down D. D. against my name on the books , as well as against that of poor Hastings . ''
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 8]: `` What does D. D. mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 36]: `` D. stands for discharged from the service ; D. D. stands for dead , '' replied Ready ; `` and it was only through the mercy of Providence that I was not so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 13]: `` It was a miraculous escape indeed , '' observed Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 18]: `` Yes , indeed , sir ; I can hardly describe my sensations for some hours afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 14]: I tried to sleep , but could not - I was in agony .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 43]: The moment I slumbered , I thought the shark had hold of me , and I would start up and shriek ; and then I said my prayers and tried to go to sleep again , but it was of no use .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 42]: The captain of the West Indiaman was afraid that my shrieks would be heard , and he sent me down a tumbler of rum to drink off ; this composed me , and at last I fell into a sound sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 43]: When I awoke , I found that the ship was under weigh and with all canvas set , surrounded by more than a hundred other vessels ; the men-of-war who took charge of the convoy , firing guns and making signals incessantly .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 14]: It was a glorious sight , and we were bound for Old England .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 49]: I felt so happy , that I thought I would risk the jaws of another shark to have regained my liberty , and the chance of being once more on shore in my own country , and able to go to Newcastle and see my poor mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 31]: `` I am afraid that your miraculous escape did you very little good , Ready , '' observed Mrs. Seagrave , `` if you got over it so soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 30]: `` Indeed , madam , it was not so ; that was only the feeling which the first sight of the vessels under weigh for England produced upon me .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 14]: I can honestly say that I was a better and more serious person .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 56]: The very next night , when I was in my hammock , I prayed very fervently ; and there happened to be a very good old Scotchman on board , the second mate , who talked very seriously to me , and pointed out how wonderful had been my preservation , and I felt it .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 28]: It was he who first read the Bible with me , and made me understand it , and , I may say , become fond of it .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 23]: I did my duty on our passage home as a seaman before the mast , and the captain was pleased with me .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 27]: The ship I was in was bound to Glasgow , and we parted company with the convoy at North Foreland , and arrived safe in port .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 41]: The captain took me to the owners , who paid me fifteen guineas for my services during the voyage home ; and as soon as I received the money , I set off for Newcastle as fast as I could .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 26]: I had taken a place on the outside of the coach , and I entered into conversation with a gentleman who sat next to me .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 25]: I soon found out that he belonged to Newcastle , and I first inquired if Mr. Masterman , the ship-builder , was still alive .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 12]: He told me that he had been dead about three months .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 11]: ` And to whom did he leave his money ? '
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 16]: I asked , ` for he was very rich , and had no kin . '
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 25]: ` He had no relations , ' replied the gentleman , ` and he left all his money to build an hospital and almshouses .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 35]: He had a partner in his business latterly , and he left the yard and all the stores to him , I believe , because he did not know whom to leave it to .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 44]: There was a lad whom I knew for certain he intended to have adopted and to have made his heir - a lad of the name of Ready ; but he ran away to sea , and has never been heard of since .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 18]: It is supposed that he was lost in a prize , for he was traced so far .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 6]: Foolish boy that he was .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 12]: He might now have been a man of fortune . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 20]: ` Very foolish indeed , ' replied I. '' ` Yes ; but he has harmed more than himself .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 41]: His poor mother , who doted upon him , as soon as she heard that he was lost , pined away by degrees , and -- ' '' ` You do n't mean to say that she is dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 11]: interrupted I , seizing the gentleman by the arm . ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 24]: ` Yes , ' replied he , looking at me with surprise ; ` she died last year of a broken heart . '
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 25]: `` I fell back on the luggage behind me , and should have fallen off the coach if the gentleman had not held me .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 39]: He called to the coachman to pull up the horses , and they took me down , and put me inside ; and as the coach rolled on , I cried as if my heart would break . ''
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 21]: Ready appeared so much affected , that Mr. Seagrave proposed that he should leave off his history for the present .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 24]: `` Thank you , sir , it will be better ; for I feel my old eyes dim with tears , even now .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 43]: It 's a dreadful thing in after-life to reflect upon , that your foolish conduct has hastened the death of a most kind mother ; but so it was , William , and I give you the truth for your advantage . ''
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 27]: Chapter XL A few mornings afterwards , Juno came in before breakfast with six eggs in her apron , which she had found in the hen-house .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 33]: `` Look , Missy Seagrave - fowls lay eggs - soon have plenty - plenty for Master William - make him well again - and plenty for chickens by and by . ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 18]: `` You have n't taken them all out of the nests , Juno ; have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 15]: `` No ; leave one in each nest for hen to see . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 28]: ` Well , then , we will keep them for William , and I hope , as you say , they will make him strong again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 33]: `` I am getting quite strong now , mother , '' replied William ; `` I think it would be better to leave the eggs for the hens to sit upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 19]: `` No , no , William ; your health is of more consequence than having early chickens . ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 41]: For a few days Mr. Seagrave and Ready were employed at the garden clearing away the weeds , which had begun to sprout up along with the seeds which had been sown ; during which time William recovered very fast .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 26]: The two first days , Juno brought in three or four eggs regularly ; but on the third day there were none to be found .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 31]: On the fourth day the hens appeared also not to have laid , much to the surprise of Mrs. Seagrave ; as when hens commence laying eggs they usually continue .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 28]: On the fifth morning , when they sat down to breakfast , Master Tommy did not make his appearance , and Mrs. Seagrave asked where he was .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 29]: `` I suspect , madam , '' said Old Ready , laughing , `` that Tommy will not come either to his breakfast or his dinner to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 9]: `` What can you mean , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 4]: said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 10]: `` Why , madam , I will tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 33]: I thought it very odd that there were no eggs , and I thought it probable that the hens might have laid astray ; so I went about yesterday evening to search .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 53]: I could not find any eggs , but I found the egg-shells , hid under some cocoa-nut leaves ; and I argued , that if an animal , supposing there was any on the island , had taken the eggs , it would not have been so careful to hide the egg-shells .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 58]: So , this morning , I fastened up the door of the hen-house , and only left open the little sliding door , by which the fowls go in to roost ; and then , after you were up , I watched behind the trees , and saw Tommy come out , and go to the hen-house .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 19]: He tried the door , and finding it fast , crept into the hen-house by the little sliding-door .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 31]: As soon as he was in I let down the slide , and fastened it with a nail ; so there he is , caught in his own trap . ''
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 14]: `` And there shall he remain all day , the little glutton ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 4]: said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 23]: `` Yes , it will serve him right , '' replied Mrs. Seagrave ; `` and be a lesson to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 30]: Mr. Seagrave , Ready , and William , as usual , went down to their work ; Mrs. Seagrave and Juno , with little Caroline , were busy indoors .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 28]: Tommy remained very quiet for an hour , when he commenced roaring ; but it was of no use , no one paid any attention to him .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 36]: At dinner-time he began to roar again , but with as little success : it was not till the evening that the door of the hen-house was opened , and Tommy permitted to come out .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 14]: He looked very foolish ; and sat down in a corner without speaking .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 16]: `` Well , Tommy , how many eggs did you suck to-day '' said Ready .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 14]: `` Tommy wo n't suck eggs any more , '' said the urchin .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 42]: `` No , you had better not , '' replied Mr. Seagrave , `` or you will find , in the end , that you will have less to eat , instead of more , as you have this day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 20]: Tommy waited very quietly and very sulkily till supper was ready , when he made up for lost time .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 7]: After which Ready continued his narrative .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 34]: `` I told you , William , that I was informed by the gentleman on the coach that my mother had died of a broken heart , in consequence of my supposed death .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 22]: I was in agony until I arrived at Newcastle , where I could ascertain all the facts connected with her decease .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 46]: When the coach stopped , the gentleman , who had remained outside , came to the coach door , and said to me , ` If I mistake not , you are Masterman Ready , who ran away to sea ; are you not ? '
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 17]: ` Yes , sir , ' replied I , very sorrowfully , ` I am . '
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 40]: ` Well , my man , ' said he , ` cheer up ; when you went away you were young and thoughtless , and certainly had no idea that you would have distressed your mother as you did .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 30]: It was not your going to sea , but the report of your death , which preyed so much upon her mind ; and that was not your fault .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 17]: You must come with me , as I have something to say to you . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 34]: ` I will call upon you to-morrow , sir , ' replied I ; ` I can not do anything until I talk to the neighbours and visit my poor mother 's grave .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 27]: It is very true that I did not intend to distress my mother ; and that the report of my death was no fault of mine .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 25]: But I can not help feeling that , if I had not been so thoughtless , she would be still alive and happy . '
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 17]: The gentleman gave me his address , and I promised to call upon him next morning .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 13]: I then went to the house my mother used to live in .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 21]: I knew that she was not there ; yet I was disappointed and annoyed when I heard merry laughter within .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 55]: I looked in , for the door was open ; in the corner where my mother used to sit , there was a mangle , and two women busily at work ; others were ironing at a large table ; and when they cried out to me , ` What do you want ? '
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 30]: and laughed at me , I turned away in disgust , and went to a neighbouring cottage , the inmates of which had been very intimate with my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 22]: I found the wife at home , but she did not know me ; and I told her who I was .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 26]: She had attended my mother during her illness , till the day of her death ; and she told me all I wished to know .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 55]: It was some little relief to my mind to hear that my poor mother could not have lived , as she had an incurable cancer ; but at the same time the woman told me that I was ever in her thoughts , and that my name was the last word on her lips .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 21]: She also said that Mr. Masterman had been very kind to my mother , and that she had wanted nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 14]: I then asked her to show me where my mother had been buried .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 24]: She put on her bonnet , and led me to the grave , and then , at my request , she left me .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 27]: I seated myself down by the mound of turf which covered her , and long and bitterly did I weep her loss and pray for forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 26]: `` It was quite dark when I left the spot and went back to the cottage of the kind woman who had attended my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 27]: I conversed with her and her husband till late , and then , as they offered me a bed , I remained with them that night .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 34]: Next morning I went to keep my appointment with the gentleman whom I had met in the coach : I found by the brass plate on the door that he was a lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 110]: He desired me to sit down , and then he closed the door carefully , and having asked me many questions , to ascertain if I was really Masterman Ready , he said he was the person employed at Mr. Masterman 's death , and that he had found a paper which was of great consequence , as it proved that the insurance of the vessel which had belonged to my father and Mr. Masterman , and which had been lost , had not been made on Mr. Masterman 's share only , but upon my father 's as well , and that Mr. Masterman had defrauded my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 104]: He said he had found the paper in a secret drawer some time after Mr. Masterman 's death , and that my mother being dead , and I being supposed to be dead , he did not see any use in making known so disagreeable a circumstance ; but that , now I had re-appeared , it was his duty so to do , and that he would arrange the matter for me , if I pleased , with the corporation of the town , to whom all Mr. Masterman 's property had been left in trust to build an hospital and almshouses .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 49]: He said that the insurance on the vessel was three thousand pounds , and that one-third of the vessel belonged to my father , so that a thousand pounds were due to him , which the interest for so many years would increase to above two thousand pounds .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 19]: This was good news for me , and you may suppose I readily agreed to all he proposed .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 47]: He set to work at once , and having called together the mayor and corporation of the town , and proved the document , they immediately agreed that I was entitled to the money , and that it should be paid to me without any contest .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 17]: Thus you see , Master William , was a new temptation thrown in my way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 8]: `` How do you mean a temptation ?
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 12]: It surely was very fortunate , Ready , '' said William .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 66]: `` Yes , William , it was , as people say , fortunate , according to the ideas of the world ; every one congratulated me , and I was myself so inflated with my good fortune , that I forgot all the promises of amendment , all the vows of leading a good life , which I made over my poor mother 's grave .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 15]: Now do you perceive why I called it a temptation , Master William ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 41]: `` My dear child , '' said Mr. Seagrave , `` riches and prosperity in this world prove often the greatest of temptations ; it is adversity that chastens and amends us , and which draws us to God . ''
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 29]: `` As soon as the money was in my own hands , '' continued Ready , `` I began to squander it away in all manner of folly .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 26]: Fortunately , I had not received it more than ten days , when the Scotch second mate came like a guardian angel to save me .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 55]: As soon as I had made known to him what had taken place , he reasoned with me , pointed out to me that I had an opportunity of establishing myself for life , and proposed that I should purchase a part of a vessel , on condition that I was captain of her .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 63]: I liked this idea very much , and being convinced that I had been making a fool of myself , I resolved to take his advice ; but one thing only restrained me : I was still very young , not more than twenty years old ; and although I could navigate at one time , I had latterly paid no attention .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 51]: I told Sanders this , and he replied , that if I would take him as my first mate , that difficulty would be got over , as he could navigate well , and that I could learn to do so in the first voyage ; so all was arranged .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 15]: `` Fortunately , I had not spent above one hundred pounds of the money .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 26]: I set off for Glasgow in company with Sanders , and he busied himself very hard in looking about for a vessel that would suit .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 34]: At last , he found that there was one ready for launching , which , in consequence of the failure of the house for which it was built , was to be sold .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 43]: He made inquiries , and having found who was likely to purchase her - that it was a very safe and respectable firm - he made a proposal for me that I should take one-fourth share of her , and command her .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 33]: As Sanders was very respectable , and well known to be a steady man , his recommendation was attended to so far that the parties wished to see and speak to me .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 17]: They were satisfied with me , young as I was , and the bargain was made .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 39]: I paid down my two thousand pounds for my share , and as soon as the vessel was launched , was very busy with Sanders , whom I had chosen as first mate , in fitting her out .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 27]: The house which had purchased her with me was a West India firm , and the ship was of course intended for the West India trade .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 100]: I had two or three hundred pounds left , after I had paid my share of the vessel , and this I employed in purchasing a venture on my own account , and providing nautical instruments , & c. I also fitted myself out , for you see , William , although Sanders had persuaded me to be rational , I was still puffed up with pride at the idea of being captain of my own ship ; it was too great a rise for one who had just before been a lad in the mizen-top of a man-of-war .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 16]: I dressed myself very smart - wore white shirts , and rings on my fingers .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 33]: Indeed , as captain and part owner of a fine vessel , I was considered as somebody , and was often invited to the table of the other owners of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 33]: I was well off , for my pay was ten pounds a month , independent of what my own venture might produce , and my quarter-share of the profits of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 46]: This may be considered as the most prosperous portion of my life ; and so , if you please , we will leave off here for to-night , for I may as well tell you at once that it did not last very long . ''
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 61]: Chapter XLI For several days after , they were employed in clearing away the stumps of the cocoa-nut trees in the winding path to the storehouse ; and as soon as that work was finished , Ready put up a lightning-conductor at the side of the storehouse , like the one which he had put up near to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 19]: They had now got through all the work that they had arranged to do during the rainy season .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 20]: The ewes had lambed , but both the sheep and the goats began to suffer for want of pasture .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 29]: For a week they had no rain , and the sun burst out very powerfully ; and Ready was of opinion that the rainy season was now over .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 22]: William had become quite strong again , and he was very impatient that they should commence the survey of the island .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 36]: After a great deal of consultation , it was at last settled , that Ready and William should make the first survey to the southward , and then return and report what they had discovered .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 19]: This was decided upon on the Saturday evening , and on the Monday morning they were to start .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 20]: The knapsacks were got ready , and well filled with boiled salt pork , and flat cakes of bread .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 31]: They were each to have a musket and ammunition , and a blanket was folded up to carry on the shoulders , that they might sleep on it at night .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 25]: Ready did not forget his compass , or the small axes , for them to blaze the trees as they went through the wood .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 11]: The whole of Saturday was occupied in making their preparations .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 29]: After supper , Ready said , `` Now , William , before we start on our travels , I think I may as well wind up my history .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 42]: I have n't a great deal more to tell , as my good fortune did not last long ; and after my remaining so long in a French prison , my life was one continued chapter of from bad to worse .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 14]: Our ship was soon ready , and we sailed with convoy for Barbadoes .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 34]: Sanders proved a good navigator , and from him , before we arrived at Barbadoes , I gained all the knowledge which I required to enable me to command and navigate my vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 42]: Sanders attempted to renew our serious conversation , but my property had made me vain ; and now that I felt I could do without his assistance , I not only kept him at a distance , but assumed the superior .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 23]: This was a very ungrateful return for his kindness to me ; but it is too often the case in this world .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 26]: Sanders was very much annoyed , and on our arrival at Barbadoes , he told me that it was his intention to quit the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 35]: I replied very haughtily , that he might do as he pleased ; the fact is , I was anxious to get rid of him , merely because I was under obligations to him .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 17]: Well , sir , Sanders left me , and I felt quite happy at his departure .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 23]: My ship was soon with a full cargo of sugar on board of her , and we waited for convoy to England .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 30]: When at Barbadoes , I had an opportunity to buy four brass guns , which I mounted on deck , and had a good supply of ammunition on board .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 59]: I was very proud of my vessel , as she had proved in the voyage out to be a very fast sailer : indeed , she sailed better than some of the men-of-war which convoyed us ; and now that I had guns on board , I considered myself quite safe from any of the enemies ' privateers .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 43]: While we were waiting for convoy , which was not expected for a fortnight , it blew a very heavy gale , and my ship , as well as others , dragged their anchors , and were driven out of Carlisle Bay .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 19]: We were obliged to make sail to beat into the bay again , it still blowing very fresh .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 66]: What with being tired waiting so long for convoy , and the knowledge that arriving before the other West Indiamen would be very advantageous , I made up my mind that , instead of beating up into the bay again , I would run for England without protection , trusting to the fast sailing of my vessel and the guns which I had on board .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 38]: I forgot at the time that the insurance on the vessel was made in England as ` sailing with convoy ' , and that my sailing without would render the insurance void , if any misfortune occurred .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 19]: Well , sir , I made sail for England , and for three weeks everything went on well .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 53]: We saw very few vessels , and those which did chase us could not come up with us ; but as we were running with a fair wind up channel , and I had made sure of being in port before night , a French privateer hove in sight and gave chase .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 21]: We were obliged to haul our wind , and it blowing very fast , we carried away our main-top mast .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 53]: This accident was fatal ; the privateer came alongside of us and laid us by the board , and that night I was in a French prison , and , I may say , a pauper ; for the insurance of the vessel was void , from my having sailed without convoy .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 38]: I felt that I had no one to thank but myself for the unfortunate position I was in ; at all events , I was severely punished , for I remained a prisoner for nearly six years .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 39]: I contrived to escape with three or four others ; we suffered dreadfully , and at last arrived in England , in a Swedish vessel , without money , or even clothes that would keep out the weather .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 58]: Of course , I had nothing to do but to look out for a berth on board of a ship , and I tried for that of second mate , but without success ; I was too ragged and looked too miserable ; so I determined , as I was starving , to go before the mast .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 38]: There was a fine vessel in the port ; I went on board to offer myself ; the mate went down to the captain , who came on deck , and who should he be but Sanders ?
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 20]: I hoped that he would not remember me , but he did immediately , and held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 14]: I never did feel so ashamed in my life as I did then .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 12]: Sanders perceived it , and asked me down into the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 40]: I then told him all that had happened , and he appeared to forget that I had behaved so ill to him ; he offered me a berth on board , and money in advance to fit me out .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 26]: But if he would not remember my conduct , I could not forget it , and I told him so , and begged his forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 18]: Well , sir , that good man , as long as he lived , was my friend .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 16]: I became his second mate before he died , and we were again very intimate .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 28]: My misfortunes had humbled me , and I once more read the Bible with him ; and I have , I trust , done so ever since .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 17]: When he died , I continued second mate for some time , and then was displaced .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 72]: Since that , I have always been as a common seaman on board of different vessels ; but I have been well treated and respected , and I may add , I have not been unhappy , for I felt that property would have only led me into follies , and have made me forget , that in this world we are to live so as to prepare ourselves for another .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 28]: Now , William , you have the history of Masterman Ready ; and I hope that there are portions of it which may prove useful to you .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 31]: To-morrow we must be off betimes , and as we are all to breakfast early together , why , I think the sooner we go to bed the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 20]: `` Very true , '' replied Mr. Seagrave , `` William , dear , bring me the Bible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 18]: Chapter XLII They were all up early the next morning , and breakfasted at an early hour .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 42]: The knapsacks and guns , and the other requisites for the journey , were all prepared ; William and Ready rose from the table , and taking an affectionate leave of Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave , they started on their journey .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 38]: The sun was shining brilliantly , and the weather had become warm ; the ocean in the distance gleamed brightly , as its waters danced , and the cocoa-nut trees moved their branches gracefully to the breeze .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 69]: They set off in high spirits , and having called the two shepherd dogs , and driven back Vixen , who would have joined the party , they passed the storehouse , and ascending the hill on the other side , they got their hatchets ready to blaze the trees ; and Ready having set his course by his pocket compass , they were fairly on their way .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 30]: For some time they continued to cut the bark of the trees with their hatchets , without speaking , and then Ready stopped again to look at his compass .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 17]: `` I think the wood is thicker here than ever , Ready , '' observed William .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 36]: `` Yes , sir , it is ; but I suspect we are now in the thickest part of it , right in the middle of the island ; however , we shall soon see .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 11]: We must keep a little more away to the southward .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 11]: We had better get on as fast as we can .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 17]: We shall have less work by and by , and then we can talk better . ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 44]: For half-an-hour they continued their way through the wood , and , as Ready had observed , the trees became more distant from each other ; still , however , they could not see anything before them but the stems of the cocoa-nuts .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 20]: It was hard work , chopping the trees every second , and their foreheads were moist with the exertion .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 21]: `` I think we had better pull up for a few minutes , William ; you will be tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 30]: `` I have not been so used to exercise , Ready , and therefore I feel it more , '' replied William , wiping his face with his handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 10]: `` I should like to stop a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 17]: How long do you think it will be before we are out of the wood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 18]: `` Not half-an-hour more , sir , I should think ; even before that , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 11]: `` What do you expect to find , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 9]: `` That 's a difficult question to answer .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 70]: I can tell you what I hope to find , which is , a good space of clear ground between the beach and the wood , where we may pasture our sheep and goats ; and perhaps we may find some other trees besides cocoa-nuts : at present , you know , we have seen only them and the castor-oil beans , that Tommy took such a dose of .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 28]: You see , William , there is no saying what new seeds may have been brought here by birds , or by the winds and waves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 8]: `` But will those seeds grow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 29]: `` Yes , William ; I have been told that seeds may remain hundreds of years under-ground , and come up afterwards when exposed to the heat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 52]: They continued their way , and had not walked for more than a quarter of an hour , when William cried out , `` I see the blue sky , Ready ; we shall soon be out ; and glad shall I be , for my arm aches with chopping . ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 9]: `` I dare say it does , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 40]: I am just as glad as you are , for I 'm tired of marking the trees ; however , we must continue to mark , or we shall not find our way back when we want it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 36]: In ten minutes more they were clear of the cocoa-nut grove , and found themselves among brushwood higher than their heads ; so that they could not see how far they were from the shore .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 34]: `` Well , '' said William , throwing down his hatchet , `` I 'm glad that 's over ; now let us sit down a little before we go any further . ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 46]: `` I 'm of your opinion , sir , '' replied Ready , sitting down by the side of William ; `` I feel more tired to-day than I did when we first went through the wood , after we set off from the cove .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 7]: I suppose it 's the weather .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 9]: Come back , dogs ; lie down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 10]: `` The weather is very fine , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 35]: `` Yes , now it is ; but I meant to have said that the rainy season is very trying to the health , and I suppose I have not recovered from it yet .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 36]: You have had a regular fever , and , of course , do not feel strong ; but a man may have no fever , and yet his health suffer a great deal from it .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 15]: I am an old man , William , and feel these things now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 25]: `` I think that before we go on , Ready , we had better have our dinner ; that will do us good . ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 81]: `` Well , we will take an early dinner , and we shall get rid of one bottle of water , at all events ; indeed , I think that , as we must go back by the same way we came , we may as well leave our knapsacks and everything but our guns under these trees ; I dare say we shall sleep here too , for I told Mr. Seagrave positively not to expect us back to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 19]: I did not like to say so before your mother , she is so anxious about you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 28]: They opened their knapsacks , and made their meal , the two dogs coming in for their share ; after which they again started on their discoveries .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 39]: For about ten minutes they continued to force their way through the thick and high bushes , till at last they broke out clear of them , and then looked around them for a short time without speaking .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 89]: The sea was about half a mile distant , and the intervening land was clear , with fresh blades of grass just bursting out of the earth , composing a fine piece of pasture of at least fifty acres , here and there broken with small patches of trees and brushwood ; there was no sandy beach , but the rocks rose from the sea about twenty to thirty feet high , and were in one or two places covered with something which looked as white as snow .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 32]: `` Well , Ready , '' said William , `` there will be no want of pasture for our flock , even if it increases to ten times its number . ''
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 50]: `` No , '' replied Ready , `` we are very fortunate , and have great reason to be thankful ; this is exactly what we required ; and now let us go on a little , and examine these patches of wood , and see what they are .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 28]: I see a bright green leaf out there , which , if my eyes do not fail me , I have seen many a time before . ''
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 24]: When they arrived at the clump of trees which Ready had pointed out , he said , `` Yes , I was right .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 43]: Look there , this is the banana ; it is just bursting out now , and will soon be ten feet high , and bearing fruit which is excellent eating ; besides which the stem is capital fodder for the beasts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 27]: `` Here is a plant I never saw before , '' said William , pulling off a piece of it , and showing it to Ready .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 7]: `` But I have , William .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 20]: It is what they call the bird 's - eye pepper ; they make Cayenne pepper out of it .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 24]: Look , the pods are just formed ; it will be useful to us in cooking , as we have no pepper left .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 38]: You see , William , we must have some birds on the island ; at least it is most probable , for all the seeds of these plants and trees must have been brought here by them .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 12]: The banana and the pepper are the food of many birds .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 26]: What a quantity of bananas are springing up in this spot ; there will be a little forest of them in a few weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 14]: `` What is that rough-looking sort of shrub out there , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 20]: `` I ca n't see so well as you , William , so let us walk up to it .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 20]: Oh , I know it now ; it is what they call the prickly pear in the West Indies .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 19]: I am very glad to have found that , for it will be very useful to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 9]: `` Is it good eating , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 33]: `` Not particularly ; and the little spikes run into your fingers , and are very difficult to get rid of ; but it is not bad by way of a change .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 38]: No , the use it will be to us is to hedge in our garden , and protect it from the animals ; it makes a capital fence , and grows very fast , and without trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 18]: Now let us go on to that patch of trees , and see what they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 9]: `` What is this plant , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 9]: `` I do n't know , William . ''
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 32]: `` Then I think I had better make a collection of all those you do n't know , and take them back to father ; he is a good botanist . ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 15]: William pulled a branch of the plant off , and carried it with him .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 19]: On their arrival at the next patch of trees , Ready looked at them steadfastly for some time .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 12]: `` I ought to know that tree , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 10]: `` I have often seen it in hot countries .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 8]: Yes , it 's the guava . ''
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 11]: is it the fruit they make guava jelly of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 3]: said William .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 8]: `` Yes , the very same . ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 43]: `` Let us now walk in the direction of those five or six trees , '' said William ; `` and from there down to the rocks ; I want to find out how it is that they are so white . ''
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 13]: `` Be it so , if you wish , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 10]: `` Why , Ready , what noise is that ?
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 2]: Hark !
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 10]: such a chattering , it must be monkeys . ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 34]: `` No , they are not monkeys ; but I 'll tell you what they are , although I can not see them ; they are parrots - I know their noise well .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 45]: You see , William , it 's not very likely that monkeys should get here , but birds can , and it is the birds that we have to thank for the bananas and guavas , and other fruits we may find here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 51]: As soon as they came under the trees , there was a great rioting and fluttering , and then away flew , screaming as loud as they could , a flock of about three hundred parrots , their beautiful green and blue feathers glistening in the beams of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 21]: `` I told you so ; well , we 'll have some capital pies out of them , William . ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 3]: `` Pies !
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 9]: do they make good pies , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 26]: `` Yes , excellent ; and very often have I had a good dinner from one in the West Indies , and in South America .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 22]: Stop , let us come a little this way ; I see a leaf which I should like to examine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 16]: `` The ground is very swampy just here , Ready ; is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 15]: `` Yes ; there 's plenty of water below , I do n't doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 18]: So much the better for the animals ; we must dig some pools when they come here .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 7]: I thought I was not wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 2]: Look !
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 21]: this is the best thing I have found yet - we now need not care so much about potatoes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 10]: `` Why , what are they , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 14]: `` Yams , which they use instead of potatoes in the West Indies .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 16]: Indeed , potatoes do not remain potatoes long , when planted in hot climates . ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 9]: `` How do you mean , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 25]: `` They turn into what they call sweet-potatoes , after one or two crops : yams are better things , in my opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 24]: At this moment the dogs dashed among the broad yam leaves , and commenced baying ; there was a great rustling and snorting .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 22]: cried William , who had been stooping down to examine the yam plant , and who was startled at the noise .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 4]: Ready laughed heartily .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 17]: `` It is n't the first time that they 've made you jump , William . ''
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 13]: `` Why , it 's our pigs , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 3]: replied William .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 24]: `` To be sure ; they 're in the yam patch , very busy feeding on them , I 'll be bound . ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 59]: Ready gave a shout , and a grunting and rushing were heard among the broad leaves , and , very soon , out rushed , instead of the six , about thirty pigs large and small ; who , snorting and twisting their tails , galloped away at a great rate , until they gained the cocoa-nut grove .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 9]: `` How wild they are , Ready ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 3]: said William .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 28]: `` Yes , and they 'll be wilder every day ; but we must fence these yams from them , or we shall get none ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 14]: `` But they 'll beat down the fence before it grows up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 16]: `` We must pale it with cocoa-nut palings , and plant the prickly pears outside .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 11]: Now , we 'll go down to the sea-side . ''
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 61]: As they neared the rocks , which were bare for about fifty yards from the water 's edge , Ready said , `` I can tell you now what those white patches on the rocks are , William ; they are the places where the sea-birds come to every year to make their nests , and bring up their young .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 17]: They always come to the same place every year , if they are not disturbed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 22]: They soon arrived at the spot , and found it white with the feathers of birds , mixed up with dirt .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 15]: `` I see no nests , Ready , nor the remains of any . ''
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 75]: `` No , they do not make any nests , further than scratching a round hole , about half an inch deep , in the soil , and there they lay their eggs , sitting quite close to one another ; they will soon be here , and begin to lay , and then we will come and take the eggs , if we want any , for they are not bad eating . ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 17]: `` Why , Ready , what a quantity of good things we have found out already !
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 11]: This has been a very fortunate expedition of ours . ''
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 27]: `` Yes , it has ; and we may thank God for his goodness , who thus provides for us so plentifully in the wilderness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 23]: `` Do you know , Ready , I can not help thinking that we ought to have built our house here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 35]: `` Not so , William ; we have not the pure water , recollect , and we have not the advantages of the sandy beach , where we have our turtle - and fish-pond .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 52]: No ; we may feed our stock here ; we may gather the fruit , taking our share of it with the poor birds ; we may get our yams , and every other good provided for us ; but our house and home must be where it is now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 16]: `` You are right , Ready ; but it will be a long walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 28]: `` Not when we are accustomed to it , and have made a beaten path ; besides , we may bring the boat round , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 45]: Then they walked along the sea-side for about a quarter of a mile , until they came to where the rocks were not so high , and there they discovered a little basin , completely formed in the rocks , with a narrow entrance .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 14]: `` See , William , what a nice little harbour for our boat !
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 47]: we may here load it with yams and take it round to the bay , provided we can find an entrance through the reefs on the southern side of it , which we have not looked for yet , because we have not required it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 20]: `` Yes , Ready - it is , indeed , a nice , smooth little place for the boat .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 11]: What is that thing on the bottom , there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 8]: said William , pointing in the direction .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 15]: `` That is a sea crawfish , quite as good eating as a lobster .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 21]: I wonder if I could make a lobster-pot ; we should catch plenty , and very good they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 13]: `` And what are those little rough things on the rock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 29]: `` They are a very nice little sort of oyster ; not like those we have in England , but much better - they are so delicate . ''
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 29]: `` Why , Ready , we have two more good things for our table , again , '' replied William ; `` how rich we shall be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 25]: `` Yes ; but we have to catch them , recollect : there is nothing to be had in this world without labour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 38]: `` Ready , '' said William , `` we have good three hours ' daylight ; suppose we go back and tell what we have seen : my mother will be so glad to see us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 8]: `` I agree with you , William .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 21]: We have done well for one day ; and may safely go back again , and remain for another week .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 26]: There are no fruits at present , and all I care about are the yams ; I should like to protect them from the pigs .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 15]: But let us go home and talk the matter over with Mr. Seagrave . ''
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 35]: They found out the spot where they had left their knapsacks and hatchets , and again took their path through the cocoa-nut trees , following the blaze which they had made in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 45]: One hour before sunset they arrived at the house , where they found Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave sitting outside , and Juno standing on the beach with the two children , who were amusing themselves with picking up the shells which were strewed about .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 26]: William gave a very clear account of all they had seen , and showed his father the specimens of the plants which he had collected .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 28]: `` This , '' said Mr. Seagrave , `` is a well-known plant ; and I wonder Ready did not recognize it ; it is hemp . ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 16]: `` I never saw it except in the shape of rope , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 9]: `` I know the seed well enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 22]: `` Well , if we require it , I can tell you how to dress it , '' replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 11]: `` Now , William , what is the next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 8]: `` This odd-looking , rough thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 14]: `` That 's the egg-plant : it bears fruit of a blue colour .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 12]: I am told they eat it in the hot countries . ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 21]: `` Yes , sir , they do ; they fry it with pepper and salt ; they call it bringal .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 8]: I think it must be that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 15]: `` I do not doubt but you are right , '' replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 11]: `` Why , William , you should know this . ''
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 8]: `` It is like the grape-vine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 23]: `` Yes , and it is so ; it is the wild grape ; we shall eat them by and bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 14]: `` I have only one more , papa : what is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 40]: `` You do n't know it , because it has sprung up so high , William ; but it is the common mustard plant , - what we use in England , and is sold as mustard and cress .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 24]: I think you have now made a famous day 's work of it ; and we have much to thank God for . ''
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 142]: As soon as they had returned to the house , a consultation was held as to their future proceedings ; and , after some debate , it was agreed that it would be advisable that they should take the boat out of the sand ; and , as soon as it was ready , examine the reef on the southward , to see if they could find a passage through it , as it would take a long while to go round it ; and , as soon as that was accomplished , Mr. Seagrave , Ready , William , and Juno should all go through the wood , carrying with them a tent to pitch on the newly-discovered piece of ground : and that they should set up a flag-staff at the little harbour , to point out its position .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 34]: Of course , that would be a hard day 's work ; but that they would , nevertheless , return the same night , and not leave Mrs. Seagrave alone with the children .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 49]: Having accomplished this , Ready and William would then put the wheels and axle in the boat , and other articles required , such as saw , hatchets , and spades , and row round to the south side of the island , to find the little harbour .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 24]: As soon as they had landed them , and secured the boat , they would then return by the path through the wood .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 44]: The next job would be to rail in the yam plantation to keep off the pigs , and , at the same time , to drive the sheep and goats through the wood , that they might feed on the new pasture ground .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 46]: Ready and William were then to cut down cocoa-nut trees sufficient for the paling , fix up the posts , and when that was done , Mr. Seagrave was to come to them and assist them in railing it in , and drawing the timber .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 57]: This they expected would be all done in about a month ; and during that time , as Mrs. Seagrave and Juno would be , for the greatest part of it , left at the house , they were to employ themselves in clearing the garden of weeds , and making preparation for fencing it in .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 59]: As soon as this important work had been completed , the boat would return to the bay with a load of prickly pears for the garden fence , and then they were to direct their attention to the stores which had been saved from the wreck , and were lying in the cove where they had first landed .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 36]: When they had examined them , and brought round what were required , and secured them in the storehouse , they would then have a regular survey of the island by land and by water .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 29]: But man proposes and God disposes , as will be shown by the interruption of their intended projects which we shall have to narrate in the ensuing chapter .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 46]: Chapter XLIII As usual , Ready was the first up on the following morning , and having greeted Juno , who followed him out of the house , he set off on his accustomed rounds , to examine into the stock and their other possessions .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 10]: He was standing in the garden at the point .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 91]: First he thought that it would be necessary to get ready some sticks for the peas , which were now seven or eight inches out of the ground ; he had proceeded a little farther , to where the calivances , or French haricot beans , had been sown , and had decided upon the propriety of hoeing up the earth round them , as they were a very valuable article of food , that would keep , and afford many a good dish during the rainy or winter season .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 26]: He had gone on to ascertain if the cucumber seeds had shown themselves above-ground , and was pleased to find that they were doing well .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 65]: He said to himself , `` We have no vinegar , that I know of , but we can preserve them in salt and water , as they do in Russia ; it will be a change , at all events ; '' and then he raised his eyes and looked out to the offing , and , as usual , scanned the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 19]: He thought he saw a ship to the north-east , and he applied his telescope to his eye .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 10]: He was not mistaken - it was a vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 33]: The old man 's heart beat quick ; he dropped his telescope on his arm , and fetched some heavy breaths before he could recover from the effect of this unexpected sight .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 35]: After a minute , he again put his telescope to his eye , and then made her out to be a brig , under top-sails and top-gallant sails , steering directly for the island .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 18]: Ready walked to the rocky point , from which they fished , and sat down to reflect .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 24]: Could it be that the vessel had been sent after them , or that she had by mere chance come among the islands ?
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 30]: He decided after a short time that it must be chance , for none could know that they were saved , much less that they were on the island .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 28]: Her steering towards the island must then be either that she required water or something else ; perhaps she would alter her course and pass by them .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 41]: `` At all events , '' thought the old man , `` we are in the hands of God , who will , at his own time and in his own way , do with us as he thinks fit .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 13]: I will not at present say anything to Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 13]: It would be cruel to raise hopes which might end in disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 6]: A few hours will decide .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 15]: And yet I can not do without help - I must trust William . ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 17]: Ready rose , examined the vessel with his telescope , and then walked towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 13]: William was up , and the remainder of the family were stirring .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 42]: `` William , '' said Ready to him , as they walked away from the house , `` I have a secret to tell you , which you will at once see the necessity of not telling to anyone at present .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 9]: A few hours will decide the question . ''
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 6]: William readily gave his promise .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 26]: `` There is a vessel off the island ; she may be the means of rescuing us , or she may pass without seeing us .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 21]: It would be too cruel a disappointment to your father and mother , if the latter were the case . ''
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 19]: William stared at Ready , and for a moment could not speak , his excitement was so great .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 10]: `` Oh , Ready , how grateful I am !
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 29]: I trust that we may he taken away , for you have no idea how my poor father suffers in silence - and so does my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 32]: `` I know it , William , I know it , and it is natural ; they do their best to control their yearnings , and they can do no more .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 13]: But now we must be quick , and at work before breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 11]: But stop , I will show you the vessel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 30]: Ready caught the vessel in the field of the telescope , which he leant against the trunk of a cocoa-nut , and William put his eye to the glass .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 7]: `` Do you see her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 14]: `` Oh yes , Ready , and she is coming this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 11]: `` Yes , she is steering right for the island .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 17]: I will put the telescope down here , and we will go about our work . ''
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 11]: William and Ready went to the storehouse for the axe .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 39]: Ready selected a very slight cocoa-nut tree nearest to the beach , which he cut down , and as soon as the top was taken off with the assistance of William he carried it down to the point .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 25]: `` Now , William , go for a shovel and dig a hole here , that we may fix it up as a flag-staff .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 33]: When all is ready , I will go for a small block and some rope for halyards to hoist up the flags as soon as the vessel is likely to see them .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 30]: At breakfast-time , I shall propose that you and I get the boat out of the sand and examine her , and give Mr. Seagrave some work indoors . ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 15]: `` But the flags , Ready ; they are round my mother 's bed .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 7]: How shall we get them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 35]: `` Suppose I say that it is time that the house should be well cleaned , and that the canvas hangings of the beds should he taken out to be aired this fine day .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 27]: Ask your father to take the direction of the work while we dig out the boat ; that will employ them all inside the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 10]: `` Yes , that will do , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 24]: During breakfast-time , Ready observed that he intended to get the boat out of the sand , and that William should assist him .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 11]: `` And what am I to do , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 4]: said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 96]: `` Why , sir , I think , now that the rains are over , it would not be a bad thing if we were to air bedding , as they say at sea ; it is a fine , warm day ; and if all the bedding was taken out of the house and well shaken , and then left out to air , it would be a very good job over ; for you see , sir , I have thought more than once that the house does smell a little close . ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 38]: `` It will be a very good thing , Ready , '' observed Mrs. Seagrave ; `` and , at the same time , Juno and I will give the house a thorough cleaning and sweeping . ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 17]: `` Had we not better have the canvas screens down , and air them too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' replied Ready ; `` we had better air everything .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 41]: We will assist in taking down the screens and flags , and spread them out to air , and then , if Mr. Seagrave has no objection , we will leave him to superintend and assist Madam and Juno . ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 11]: `` With all my heart , '' replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 16]: `` We have done breakfast , and will begin as soon as you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 58]: Ready and William took down the canvas screens and flags , and went out of the cottage with them ; they spread out the canvas at some distance from the house , and then William went down to the beach with the flags , while Ready procured the block and small rope to hoist them up with .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 6]: Ready 's stratagem answered well .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 67]: Without being perceived by those in the cottage , the flag-staff was raised , and fixed in the ground , and the flags all ready for hoisting ; then Ready and William returned to the fuel-stack , and each carried down as much stuff as they could hold , that they might make a smoke to attract the notice of those on board of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 23]: All this did not occupy much more than an hour , during which the brig continued her course steadily towards the island .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 30]: When Ready first saw her the wind was light , but latterly the breeze had increased very much , and at last the brig took in her top-gallant sails .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 36]: The horizon behind the vessel , which had been quite clear , was now banked up with clouds , and the waves curled in white foam over the reefs of rocks extending from the island .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 48]: `` The breeze is getting up strong , William , '' said Ready , `` and she will soon be down , if she is not frightened at the reefs , which she can see plainer now the water is rough , than she could before . ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 13]: `` I trust she will not be afraid , '' replied William .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 12]: `` How far do you think she is off now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 8]: `` About five miles ; not more .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 20]: The wind has hauled round more to the southward , and it is banking up fast , I see .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 18]: I fear that we shall have another smart gale ; however , it wo n't last long .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 29]: Come , let us hoist the flags ; we must not lose a chance ; the flags will blow nice and clear for them to see them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 29]: William and Ready hoisted up the ensign first , and below it the flag , with the ship 's name , Pacific , in large letters upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 33]: `` Now then , '' said Ready , as he made fast the halyards , `` let us strike a light and make a smoke ; that will attract their notice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 30]: As soon as the cocoa-nut leaves were lighted , Ready and William threw water upon them , so as to damp them and procure a heavy column of smoke .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 41]: The vessel approached rapidly , and they were watching her in silent suspense , when they perceived Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave , Juno carrying Albert , with Tommy and Caroline running down as fast as they could to the beach .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 43]: The fact was , that Tommy , tired of work , had gone out of the house and walked towards the beach ; there he perceived , first , the flags hoisted , and then he detected the vessel off the island .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 14]: He immediately ran back to the house , crying out , `` Papa !
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 2]: Mamma !
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 13]: Captain Osborn come back - come back in a big ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 41]: At this announcement , Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave ran out of the house , perceived the vessel and the flags flying , and ran as fast as they could down to where William and Ready were standing by the flag-staff .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 12]: Ready , why did you not tell us this before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 38]: `` I wish you had not known it now , sir , '' replied Ready ; `` but , however , it ca n't be helped ; it was done out of kindness , Mr. Seagrave . ''
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 10]: `` Yes , indeed it was , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 13]: Mrs. Seagrave dropped down on the rock , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 6]: Mr. Seagrave was equally excited .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 9]: `` Does she see us , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 5]: exclaimed he at last .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 27]: `` No , sir , not yet , and I waited till she did , before I made it known to you , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 13]: `` She is altering her course , Ready , '' said William .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 24]: `` Yes , sir , she has hauled to the wind ; she is afraid of coming too near to the reefs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 9]: `` Surely she is not leaving us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 14]: `` No , madam ; but she does not see us yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 4]: `` She does !
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 4]: she does ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 17]: cried William , throwing up his hat ; `` see , she hoists her ensign . ''
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 11]: `` Very true , sir ; she does see us .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 6]: Thanks be to God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 27]: Mr. Seagrave embraced his wife , who threw herself sobbing into his arms , kissed his children with rapture , and wrung old Ready 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 7]: He was almost frantic with joy .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 5]: William was equally delighted .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 42]: As soon as they were a little more composed , Ready observed : `` Mr. Seagrave , that they have seen us is certain , and what we must now do is to get our own boat out of the sand .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 13]: We know the passage through the reefs , and they do not .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 23]: I doubt if they will , however , venture to send a boat on shore , until the wind moderates a little .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 15]: You see , sir , it is blowing up very strong just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 14]: `` But you do n't think it will blow harder , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 13]: `` I am sorry to say , sir , that I do .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 27]: It looks very threatening to the southward , and until the gale is over , they will not venture near an island so surrounded with rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 9]: It would be very imprudent if they did .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 11]: However , sir , a few hours will decide . ''
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 28]: `` But , surely , '' said Mrs. Seagrave , `` even if it does blow , they will not leave the island without taking us off .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 10]: They will come after the gale is over . ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 35]: `` Yes , madam , if they can , I do think they will ; but God knows , some men have hard hearts , and feel little for the misery of others . ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 43]: The brig had , in the meantime , kept away again , as if she was running in ; but very soon afterwards she hauled to the wind , with her head to the northward , and stood away from the island .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 12]: `` She is leaving us , '' exclaimed William , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 5]: `` Hard-hearted wretches ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 7]: said Mr. Seagrave , with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 50]: `` You are wrong to say that , sir , '' replied Ready : `` excuse me , Mr. Seagrave , for being so bold ; but the fact is , that if I was in command of that vessel , I should do just as they have done .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 20]: The gale rises fast , and it would be very dangerous for them to remain where they now are .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 39]: It does not at all prove that they intend to leave us ; they but consult their own safety , and , when the gale is over , we shall , I trust , see them again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 10]: No reply was made to Ready 's judicious remarks .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 16]: The Seagraves only saw that the vessel was leaving them , and their hearts sank .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 23]: They watched her in silence , and as she gradually diminished to the view , so did their hopes depart from them .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 28]: The wind was now fierce , and a heavy squall , with rain , obscured the offing , and the vessel was no longer to be distinguished .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 14]: Mr. Seagrave turned to his wife , and mournfully offered her his arm .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 25]: They walked away from the beach without speaking ; the remainder of the party , with the exception of old Ready , followed them .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 17]: Ready remained some time with his eyes in the direction where the vessel was last seen .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 26]: At last he hauled down the ensign and flag , and , throwing them over his shoulder , followed the disconsolate party to the house .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 27]: Chapter XLIV When Ready arrived , he found them all plunged in such deep distress , that he did not consider it advisable to say anything .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 11]: The evening closed in ; it was time to retire .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 13]: The countenance of Mr. Seagrave was not only gloomy , but morose .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 34]: The hour for retiring to rest had long passed when Ready broke the silence by saying , `` Surely , you do not intend to sit up all night , Mr. Seagrave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 5]: `` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 17]: there 's no use sitting up now , '' replied Mr. Seagrave , rising up impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 13]: `` Come , my dear , let us go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 11]: Mrs. Seagrave rose , and retired behind the canvas screen .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 27]: Her husband seemed as if he was about to follow her , when Ready , without speaking , laid the Bible on the table before him .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 36]: Mr. Seagrave did not appear to notice it ; but William touched his father 's arm , pointed to the book , and then went inside of the screen , and led out his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 6]: `` God forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 45]: `` In my selfishness and discontent I had forgotten -- '' `` Yes , sir , you had forgotten those words , ` Come unto me , all ye who are weary and heavy laden , and I will give you rest . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 16]: `` I am ashamed of myself , '' said Mrs. Seagrave , bursting into tears .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 11]: Mr. Seagrave opened the Bible , and read the psalm .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 27]: As soon as he had closed the book , `` good night '' were all the words that passed , and they all retired to rest .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 13]: During the night , the wind howled and the rain beat down .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 36]: The children slept soundly , but Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave , Ready , and William were awake during the whole of the night , listening to the storm , and occupied with their own thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 17]: Ready was dressed before daylight , and out on the beach before the sun had risen .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 24]: The gale was at its height ; and after a careful survey with his telescope , he could see nothing of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 21]: He remained on the beach till breakfast-time , when he was summoned by William , and returned to the house .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 24]: He found Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave up , and more composed than they were the evening before ; and they welcomed him warmly .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 22]: `` I fear , Ready , '' said Mr. Seagrave , `` that you have no good news for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 19]: `` No , sir ; nor can you expect any good news until after the gale is over .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 28]: The vessel could not remain here during the gale - that is certain ; and there is no saying what the effects of the gale may be .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 36]: She may lie to , and not be far from us when the gale is over ; or she may be obliged to scud before the gale , and run some hundred miles from us .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 6]: Then comes the next chance .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 47]: I think , by her running for the island , that she was short of water ; the question is , then , whether she may not find it necessary to run for the port she is bound to , or water at some other place .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 15]: A captain of a vessel is bound to do his best for the owners .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 21]: At the same time I do think , that if she can with propriety come back for us she will .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 32]: The question is , first , whether she can ; and , secondly , whether the captain is a humane man , and will do so at his own inconvenience . ''
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 15]: `` There is but poor comfort in all that , '' replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 34]: `` It is useless holding out false hopes , sir , '' replied Ready ; `` but even if the vessel continues her voyage , we have much to be thankful for . ''
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 7]: `` In what , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 69]: `` Why , sir , no one knew whether we were in existence or not , and probably we never should have been searched for ; but now we have made it known , and by the ship 's name on the flag they know who we are , and , if they arrive safe in port , will not fail to communicate the intelligence to your friends .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 11]: Is not that a great deal to be thankful for ?
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 25]: We may not be taken off by this vessel , but we have every hope that another will be sent out to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 33]: `` Very true , Ready ; I ought to have seen that before ; but my despair and disappointment were yesterday so great , that it almost took away my reason . ''
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 22]: The gale continued during the day , and showed no symptoms of abatement , when they again retired for the night .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 19]: The following day Ready was up early , as usual , and William accompanied him to the beach .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 17]: `` I do n't think that it blows so hard as it did , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 27]: `` No , William , it does not ; the gale is breaking , and by night , I have no doubt , will be over .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 21]: It is , however , useless looking for the vessel , as she must be a long way from this .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 35]: It would take her a week , perhaps , to come back to us if she was to try to do so , unless the wind should change to the northward or westward . ''
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 3]: `` Ready !
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 3]: Ready ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 17]: exclaimed William , pointing to the south-east part of the reef ; `` what is that ?
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 2]: Look !
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 6]: it 's a boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 8]: Ready put his telescope to his eye .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 16]: `` It 's a canoe , William , and there are people in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 10]: `` Why , where can they have come from ?
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 2]: See !
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 11]: they are among the breakers ; they will be lost .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 9]: Let us go towards them , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 28]: They hastened along the beach to the spot nearest to where the canoe was tossing on the surf , and watched it as it approached the shore .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 42]: `` William , this canoe must have been blown off from the large island , which lies out there ; '' and Ready again looked through his telescope : `` there are two people in it , and they are islanders .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 3]: Poor things !
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 26]: they struggle hard for their lives , and seem much exhausted ; but they have passed through the most dangerous part of the reef . ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 27]: `` Yes , '' replied William , `` they will soon be in smoother water ; but the surf on the beach is very heavy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 22]: `` They wo n't mind that , if their strength do n't fail them - they manage the canoe beautifully . ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 12]: During this conversation the canoe had rapidly come towards the land .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 18]: In a moment or two afterwards , it passed through the surf and grounded on the beach .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 31]: The two people in it had just strength enough left to paddle through the surf , and then they dropped down in the bottom of the canoe , quite exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 11]: `` Let 's drag the canoe higher up , William .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 3]: Poor creatures !
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 6]: they are nearly dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 32]: While dragging it up , Ready observed that the occupants were both women : their faces were tattooed all over ; otherwise they were young , and might have been good-looking .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 14]: `` Shall I run up and get something for them , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 22]: `` Do , William ; ask Juno to give you some of whatever there is for breakfast ; anything warm . ''
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 34]: William soon returned with some thin oatmeal porridge , which Juno had been preparing for breakfast ; and a few spoonfuls being forced down the throats of the two natives they gradually revived .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 19]: William then left Ready , and went up to acquaint his father and mother with this unexpected event .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 37]: William soon returned with Mr. Seagrave , and as the women were now able to sit up , they hauled up the canoe as far as they could , to prevent her being beat to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 24]: They found nothing in the canoe , except a piece of matting and the two paddles which had been used by the natives .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 72]: `` You see , sir , '' said Ready , `` it is very clear that these two poor women , having been left in charge of the canoe , have been blown off from the shore of one of the islands to the south-east ; they must have been contending with the gale ever since the day before yesterday , and , as it appears , without food or water .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 11]: It 's a mercy that they gained this island . ''
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 26]: `` It is so , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` but to tell the truth , I am not over pleased at their arrival .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 28]: It proves what we were not sure of before , that we have very near neighbours , who may probably pay us a very unwelcome visit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 34]: `` That may be , sir , '' replied Ready ; `` still these two poor creatures being thrown on shore here does not make the matter worse , or the danger greater .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 42]: Perhaps it may turn to our advantage ; for if these women learn to speak English before any other islanders visit us , they will interpret for us , and be the means , perhaps , of saving our lives . ''
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 13]: `` Would their visit be so dangerous , then , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 41]: `` Why , sir , a savage is a savage , and , like a child , wishes to obtain whatever he sees ; especially he covets what he may turn to use , such as iron , & c .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 48]: If they came , and we concealed a portion , and gave up the remainder of our goods , we might escape ; but still there is no trusting to them , and I would infinitely prefer defending ourselves against numbers to trusting to their mercy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 12]: `` But how can we defend ourselves against a multitude ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 28]: `` We must be prepared , sir : if we can fortify ourselves , with our muskets we would be more than a match for hundreds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 5]: Mr. Seagrave turned away .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 34]: After a pause he said , `` It is not very pleasant to be now talking of defending ourselves against savages , when we hoped two days ago to be leaving the island .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 12]: Oh , that that brig would make its appearance again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 24]: `` The wind is going down fast , sir , '' observed Ready ; `` it will be fine weather before the evening .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 24]: We may look out for her ; at all events , for the next week I shall not give up all hopes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 7]: `` A whole week , Ready !
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 14]: how true it is , that hope deferred maketh the heart sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 19]: `` It is a severe trial , Mr. Seagrave ; but we must submit when we are chastened .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 19]: We had better get these poor creatures up to the house , and let them recover themselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 21]: Ready then beckoned to them to get on their feet , which they both did , although with some difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 45]: He then went in advance , making a sign for them to follow ; they understood him , and made the attempt , but were so weak , that they would have fallen if they had not been supported by Mr. Seagrave and William .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 13]: It required a long time for them to arrive at the house .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 27]: Mrs. Seagrave , who knew what had happened , received them very kindly , and Juno had a mess ready , which she put before them .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 15]: They ate a little and then lay down , and were soon sound asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 29]: `` It is fortunate for us that they are women , '' observed Mr. Seagrave : `` we should have had great difficulty had they been men . ''
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 28]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied Ready ; `` but still we must not trust women too much at first , for they are savages . ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 11]: `` Where shall we put them to-night , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 12]: `` Why , sir , I have been thinking about that .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 26]: I wish we had a shed close to us ; but as we have not , we must let them sleep in the storehouse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 18]: We must now pass over a space of fifteen days , in which there was nothing done .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 17]: The expectation of the vessel returning was still alive , although each day decreased these hopes .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 29]: Every morning Ready and William were at the beach with the telescope , and the whole of the day was passed in surmises , hopes , and fears .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 28]: In fact , the appearance of the vessel and the expectation of leaving the island had completely overturned all the regularity and content of our island party .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 30]: No other subject was broached - not any of the work proposed was begun , as it was useless to do anything if they were to leave the island .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 32]: After the first week had passed , they felt that every day their chances were more adverse , and at the end of the fortnight all hopes were very unwillingly abandoned .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 22]: The Indian women had , in the meantime , recovered their fatigues , and appeared to be very mild and tractable .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 21]: Whatever they were able to do , they did cheerfully , and had already gained a few words of English .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 30]: The party to explore was again talked over , and arranged for the following Monday , when a new misfortune fell on them , which disconcerted all their arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 31]: On the Saturday morning , when Ready , as usual , went his rounds , as he walked along the beach , he perceived that the Indian canoe was missing .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 19]: It had been hauled up clear of the water , so that it could not have floated away .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 34]: Ready 's heart misgave him ; he looked through his telescope in the direction of the large island , and thought he could distinguish a speck on the water at a great distance .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 12]: As he was thus occupied , William came down to him .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 19]: `` William , '' said Ready , `` I fear those island women have escaped in their canoe .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 27]: Run up , and see if they are in the outhouse , or anywhere else , and let me know as soon as you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 49]: William in a few minutes returned , breathless , stating that the women were not to be found , and that they had evidently carried away with them a quantity of the large nails and other pieces of iron which were in the small kegs in the storehouse .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 18]: `` This is bad , William ; this is worse than the vessel not coming back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 12]: `` Why , we can do without them , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 55]: `` Yes ; but when they get back to their own people , and show them the iron they have brought with them , and describe how much more there is to be had , depend upon it , we shall have a visit from them in numbers , that they may obtain more .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 13]: I ought to have known better than to leave the canoe here .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 22]: We must go and consult with Mr. Seagrave , for the sooner we begin to work now , the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 12]: They communicated the intelligence to Mr. Seagrave when they were outside .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 93]: He at once perceived their danger , so they held a council , and came to the following resolutions : -- That it would be necessary that they should immediately stockade the storehouse , so as to render it impossible for any one to get in ; and that , as soon as the fortification was complete , the storehouse should be turned into their dwelling-house ; and such stores as could not be put within the stockade should be removed to their present house , or concealed in the cocoa-nut grove .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 58]: It was decided that nothing should be begun on that day , Saturday ; that Sunday should be spent in devout prayer for help and encouragement from the Almighty , who would do towards them as his wisdom should ordain ; and that on Monday , with the blessing of God , they would recommence their labour .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 36]: `` I do n't know why , but I feel more courage now that there is a prospect of danger , than I felt when there was little or none , '' said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 14]: `` How little do we know what the day may bring forth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 13]: `` How joyful were our anticipations when the vessel hoisted her colours !
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 13]: we felt sure that we were to be taken off the island .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 16]: The same gale that drove the vessel away brought down to us the island women .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 46]: The fair weather after the gale , which we hoped would have brought back the vessel to our succour , on the contrary enabled the women to escape in the canoe , and make known our existence to those who may come to destroy us .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 29]: How true it is that man plans in vain ; and that it is only by the Almighty will and pleasure that he can obtain his ends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 17]: Chapter XLV But although they resolved as stated in the last chapter , nothing was done .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 78]: Finally , one morning at sunrise , as they were looking round with the telescope , close to the turtle-pond , Masterman Ready said to Mr. Seagrave , `` Indeed , sir , we must no longer remain in this state of idleness ; I have been thinking a great deal of our present position and prospects ; as to the vessel coming back , we must , at present , give up all hopes of it .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 63]: I only wish that we were quite as sure that we shall not have a visit from the savages : that is my great fear , and it really haunts me ; the idea of our being surprised some night , and Mrs. Seagrave and the dear children , perhaps , murdered in their beds , is awful to reflect upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 6]: `` God help us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 9]: exclaimed Mr. Seagrave , covering up his face .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 76]: `` God will help us , Mr. Seagrave , but at the same time it is necessary that we should help ourselves ; he will give his blessing to our exertions , but we can not expect that miracles will be performed for us ; and if we remain as we now are , inactive , and taking no steps to meet the danger which threatens us , we can not expect the divine assistance .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 28]: We have had a heavy shock , but it is now time that we recover from it , and put our own shoulders to the wheel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 27]: `` I agree with you , Ready , '' replied William ; `` indeed I have been thinking the same thing for many days past . ''
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 53]: `` We have all been thinking of it , I believe , '' said Mr. Seagrave ; `` I 'm sure I have lain awake night after night , considering our position and what we ought to do , but I have never been able to come to any satisfactory resolution . ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 55]: `` No more have I till last night , Mr. Seagrave , but I think that I have now something to propose which , perhaps , will meet with your approval , '' replied Ready ; `` so now , sir , suppose we hold another council , and come to a decision . ''
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 47]: `` I am most willing , Ready , '' said Mr. Seagrave , sitting down upon a rock ; `` and as you are the oldest , and moreover the best adviser of the three , we will first hear what you have to propose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 54]: `` Well then , Mr. Seagrave , it appears to me that it will not do to remain in the house , for we may , as I have said , be surprised by the savages at any hour in the night , and we have no means of defence against numbers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 18]: `` I feel that , and have felt it for some time , '' replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 16]: `` What shall we do , then ; shall we return to the cove ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 75]: `` I should think not , sir , '' said Ready ; `` what I propose is this : we have made a discovery on the south of the island , which is of great importance to us ; not that I consider the fruit and other plants of any great value , as they will only serve to increase our luxuries , if I may so call them , during the summer season .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 45]: One great advantage to us , is the feed which we have found for our live stock , and the fodder for them during the rainy season ; but principally , the patch of yams , which will afford us food during the winter .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 35]: They are of great importance to us , and we can not too soon protect them from the pigs , which will certainly root them all up , if we do not prevent them .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 76]: Now , sir , you know what we had arranged to do , but which we have not done ; I think the cocoa-nut rails will take too much time , and it will be sufficient to make a ditch and hedge round the yams ; but it will be very tedious if we are to go backwards and forwards to do the work , and Mrs. Seagrave and the children will be left alone .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 105]: I therefore propose , as the weather is now set in fair , and will remain so for months , that we pitch our tents on that part of the island , and remove the whole family there ; we shall soon be very comfortable , and at all events much safer there than if we remain here , without any defence , '' `` It is an excellent plan , Ready ; we shall , as you say , be removed from danger for the time , and when there , we may consider what we had best do by and by . ''
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 79]: Those women may not have gained the other island , it is true , for they had the wind right against them for several days after they went away in the canoe , and , moreover , the current sets strong this way ; but if they have , we must expect that the savages will pay us a visit ; they will , of course , come direct to the house , if they do come . ''
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 30]: `` But , Ready , you do n't mean to say that we are to leave this side of the island altogether , and all our comfortable arrangements ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 3]: said William .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 20]: `` No , William , not altogether ; for now I come to the second part of my proposition .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 118]: As soon as we have done our work at the yam plantation , and made everything as comfortable there as we can , I think we may then leave Mrs. Seagrave and the children in the tents , and work here , As we before agreed , let us abandon the house in which we live at present , and fit out the outhouse which is concealed in the cocoa-nut grove , as a dwelling-house , and fortify it so as to be secure against any sudden attack of the savages : for , return here we must , to live , as we can not remain in the tents after the rainy season sets in . ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 12]: `` How do you propose to fortify it , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 10]: said Mr. Seagrave ; `` I hardly know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 13]: `` That I will explain to you by and by , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 55]: Then , if the savages come here , at all events we should be able to defend ourselves with fire-arms ; one man behind a stockade is better than twenty who have no other arms but spears and clubs ; and we may , with the help of God , beat them off . ''
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 27]: `` I think your plan is excellent , Ready , '' said Mr. Seagrave , `` and that the sooner we begin , the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 10]: `` That there is no doubt of , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 91]: Now , the first job is for William and me to try for the passage through this side of the reef with the boat , and then we will look for the little harbour which we discovered ; as soon as that is done , we will return and take the tents and all we require round in the boat , and when we have pitched the tents and all is arranged , Mrs. Seagrave and the children can walk through the wood with us , and take possession . ''
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 23]: `` Let us not lose an hour , Ready ; we have lost too much time already , '' replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 8]: `` What shall we do to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 18]: `` After breakfast , William and I will take the boat , and try for the passage .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 19]: You can remain here , packing up the tents and such articles as must first be carried round .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 12]: We shall be back , I hope , by dinner-time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 65]: They then rose , and walked towards the house ; all felt relieved in their minds , after they had made this arrangement , satisfied that they would be using all human endeavours to ward off the danger which threatened them , and might then put their confidence in that Providence who would , if he thought fit , protect them in their need .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 32]: Chapter XLVI The subject was introduced to Mrs. Seagrave , while they were at breakfast , and as she perceived how much more secure they would be , she cheerfully consented .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 53]: In less than an hour afterwards , William and Ready had prepared the boat , and were pulling out among the rocks of the reef to find a passage , which , after a short time , and by keeping two or three cables from the point , they succeeded in doing .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 27]: `` This is very fortunate , William , '' observed Ready ; `` but we must now take some marks to find our way in again .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 53]: See , the large black rock is on a line with the garden point : so , if we keep them in one , we shall know that we are in the proper channel ; and now for a mark abreast of us , to find out when we enter it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 23]: `` Why , Ready , the corner of the turtle-pond just touches the right wall of the house , '' replied William .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 31]: `` So it does ; that will do ; and now let us pull away as hard as we can , so as to be back in good time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 18]: They soon were on the south side of the island , and pulling up along the shore .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 15]: `` How far do you think that it is by water , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 27]: `` I hardly know ; but at least four or five miles , so we must make up our minds to a good hour 's pull .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 22]: At all events , we shall sail back again with this wind , although there is but little of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 18]: `` We are in very deep water now , '' observed William , after a long silence .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 21]: `` Yes , on this side of the island we must expect it ; the coral grows to leeward only .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 16]: I think that we can not be very far from the little harbour we discovered .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 15]: Suppose we leave off rowing for a minute , and look about us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 34]: `` There are two rocks close to the shore , Ready , '' said William , pointing , `` and you recollect there were two or three rocks outside of the harbour . ''
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 20]: `` Very true , William , and I should not wonder if you have hit upon the very spot .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 6]: Let us pull in . ''
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 28]: They did so ; and , to their satisfaction , found that they were in the harbour , where the water was as smooth as a pond .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 21]: `` Now , then , William , we will step the mast , and sail back at our leisure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 12]: `` Stop one moment , Ready ; give me the boat-hook .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 11]: I see something between the clefts of the rocks . ''
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 39]: Ready handed the boat-hook to William , who , lowering it down into the water , drove the spike of iron at the end of it into a large crayfish , which he hauled up into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 63]: `` That will be an addition to our dinner , '' said Ready ; `` we do not go back empty-handed , and , therefore , as the saying is , we shall be more welcome ; now , then , let us start , for we must pull here again this afternoon , and with a full cargo on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 36]: They stepped the mast , and as soon as they had pulled the boat clear of the harbour , set sail , and in less than an hour had rejoined the party at the house .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 37]: William had brought up the crayfish , which had only one claw , and Juno put on another pot of water to boil it , as an addition to the dinner , which was nearly ready .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 62]: Tommy at first went with his sister Caroline to look at the animal , and as soon as he had left off admiring it , he began , as usual , to tease it ; first he poked its eyes with a stick , then he tried to unfold his tail , but the animal flapped , and he ran away .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 45]: At last he was trying to put his stick into the creature 's mouth , when it raised its large claw , and caught him by the wrist , squeezing him so tight that Tommy screamed and danced about as the crayfish held on .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 43]: Fortunately for him , the animal had been so long out of water , and had been so much hurt by the iron spike of the boat-hook , that it was more than half-dead , or he would have been severely hurt .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 55]: Ready ran to him , and disengaged the crayfish ; but Tommy was so frightened , that he took to his heels , and did not leave off running until he was one hundred yards from the house , while Juno and Ready were laughing at him till the tears came into their eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 22]: When he saw the crayfish on the table , he appeared to be afraid of it , although it was dead .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 23]: `` Well , Tommy , '' said Mr. Seagrave , `` I suppose you wo n't eat any of the crayfish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 6]: `` Wo n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 3]: replied Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 14]: `` I 'll eat him , for he tried to eat me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 13]: `` Why did you not leave the animal alone , Tommy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 31]: said Mr. Seagrave ; `` if you had not tormented it , it would not have bitten you ; I do n't know whether you ought to have any . ''
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 17]: `` I do n't like it ; I wo n't have any , '' replied Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 8]: `` I like salt pork better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 42]: `` Well , then , if you do n't like it , you shall not have it forced upon you , Tommy , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` so now we 'll divide it among the rest of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 51]: Tommy was not very well pleased at this decision , for he really did wish to have some of it , so he turned very sulky for the rest of the dinner-time , especially when old Ready told him that he had had his share of the crayfish before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 43]: Chapter XLVII As soon as the meal was over , Mr. Seagrave and Juno assisted them in carrying down the canvas and poles for the tent , with shovels to clear away , and the pegs to fix the tents up properly .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 67]: Before they started , William observed , `` I think it would be a good thing , if Ready and I were to take our bedding with us , and then we could fix up one tent this evening , and sleep there ; to-morrow morning we might set up the other , and get a good deal of work over before we come back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 43]: `` You are right , William , '' replied Ready ; `` let us see what Juno can give us to eat , and then we will do as you say , for the sooner we are all there the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 38]: As Mr. Seagrave was of the same opinion , Juno packed up a piece of salt pork and some flour-cakes , which , with three or four bottles of water , they took down to the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 39]: Ready having thrown in a piece of rope to moor the boat with , they shoved off and were soon through the reef , and , after a smart pull , they arrived again at the small harbour .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 57]: As soon as they had landed all the things , they made the boat fast by the rope , and then carried a portion of the canvas and tent-poles up to the first copse of trees , which were the guavas ; they then returned for the remainder , and after three trips everything was up .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 36]: `` Now , William , we must see where to pitch the tent ; we must not be too near the cocoa-nut grove , or we shall have too far to go for water . ''
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 16]: `` Do n't you think that the best place will be close to the bananas ?
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 22]: the ground is higher there , and the water is , you know , between the bananas and the yams . ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 26]: `` Very true , I think it will not be a bad place ; let us walk there first , and reconnoitre the ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 31]: They walked to where the bananas were now throwing out their beautiful large green leaves , and decided that they would fix the tents upon the north side of them .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 38]: `` So here let it be , '' said Ready ; `` and now let us go and fetch all the things ; it is a nice dry spot , and I think will do capitally . ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 25]: They were soon hard at work , and long before sunset one tent was ready , and they had put their bedding in it .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 34]: `` Well , now , I suppose you are a little tired , '' said Ready ; `` I 'm sure you ought to be , for you have worked hard to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 22]: `` I do n't feel very tired , Ready , but it 's not time to go to bed yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 37]: `` No ; and I think we had better take our shovels and dig the pits for the water , and then we shall know by to-morrow morning whether the water is good or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 16]: `` Yes , Ready , we can do that before we get our supper . ''
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 48]: They walked to where the ground between the bananas and yam patch was wet and swampy , and dug two large holes about a yard deep and square ; the water trickled in very fast , and they were up to their ankles before they had finished .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 20]: `` There 'll be no want of water , Ready , if it is only fit to drink . ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 12]: `` I 've no fear of that , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 24]: They returned to the tent and made their supper off the salt pork and flour-cakes , and then lay down on the mattresses .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 21]: They were soon fast asleep , for they were tired out with the hard work which they had gone through .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 56]: The next morning , at sunrise , they were up again ; the first thing they did was to go and examine the holes they had dug for water ; they found them full and running over , and the water had settled quite clear ; they tasted it , and pronounced it very good .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 28]: As soon as they had washed themselves , they went back and made their breakfast , and then set to work to get up the other tent .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 24]: They then cleared all the ground near the tents of brushwood and high grass , and levelled it nicely with their shovels inside .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 30]: `` Now , William , we have another job , which is to prepare a fireplace for Juno : we must go down to the beach for stones . ''
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 17]: In another hour the fireplace was completed , and Ready and William looked at their work .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 15]: `` Well , I call this a very comfortable lodging-house , '' said Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 16]: `` And I am sure , '' replied William , `` it 's very pretty .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 8]: Mamma will be delighted with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 27]: `` We shall have no want of bananas in a few weeks , '' said Ready ; `` look , they are all in blossom already .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 16]: Well , now I suppose we had better leave everything here , and go back .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 14]: We must have another trip this afternoon , and sleep here to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 40]: They went down to the boat , and sailed back as before ; by ten o'clock in the morning they had regained the house , and then they made arrangements for their work during the remainder of the day .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 64]: It was agreed that the provisions necessary for a day or two , the table and chairs , the cooking utensils , and a portion of their clothes , should be taken round that afternoon , that Ready and William should come back early the next morning , and then they should all set off together through the wood to the new location .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 42]: The sheep and lambs -LRB- for they had four lambs -RRB- , the goats and kids , were to be driven through the wood by Mr. Seagrave ; William and Ready and the dogs would be very useful in driving them .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 28]: As for the fowls and chickens , it was decided they should be left , as Ready and William could look after them on their occasional visits .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 29]: Chapter XLVIII The boat was well loaded that afternoon , and they had a heavy pull round , and hard work afterwards to carry all the articles up .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 29]: William and Ready were , therefore , not sorry when their work was done , and they went to bed as soon as they had taken their supper .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 35]: At sunrise , they went back to the bay in the boat , which they hauled up , and then proceeded to the house , where they found that everyone was ready to start .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 54]: Mr. Seagrave had collected all the animals , and they set off ; the marks on the trees were very plain , and they had no difficulty in finding their way ; but they had a good deal of trouble with the goats and sheep , and did not get on very fast .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 21]: It was three hours before they got clear of the cocoa-nut grove , and Mrs. Seagrave was quite tired out .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 19]: At last they arrived , and Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave could not help exclaiming `` How beautiful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 28]: When they came to where the tents were pitched by the side of the bananas , they were equally pleased : it was quite a fairy spot .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 84]: Mrs. Seagrave went into her tent to repose after her fatigue ; the goats and sheep were allowed to stray away as they pleased ; the dogs lay down , panting with their long journey ; Juno put Albert on the bed while she went with William to collect fuel to cook the dinner ; Ready went to the pits to get some water , while Mr. Seagrave walked about , examining the different clumps of trees with which the meadow was studded .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 20]: When Ready returned with the water , he called the dogs , and went back towards the yam plantation .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 61]: Tommy followed them ; the dogs went into the yams , and were soon barking furiously , which pleased Tommy very much ; when , of a sudden , out burst again in a drove all the pigs , followed by the dogs , and so close to Tommy that he screamed with fright , and tumbled head over heels .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 30]: `` I thought you were there , my gentlemen , '' said Ready , looking after the pigs ; `` the sooner we fence you out the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 17]: The pigs scampered away , and went into the cocoa-nut grove as they had done before .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 16]: The dogs followed the pigs , and did not return for a long while afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 21]: It was late before the dinner was ready , and they were all very glad to go early to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 40]: At day dawn , William and Ready had again started , and walked through the cocoa-nut grove back to the house , to bring round in the boat the articles of furniture and the clothes which had been left .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 58]: Having collected everything in the house , and procured some more pork and flour from the storehouse , they completed the load by spearing one of the turtles which remained , and putting it into the bottom of the boat ; they then set off again for their new residence , and arrived in time for breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 9]: `` What a delightful spot this is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 4]: said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 26]: `` I think we ought always to make it our summer residence , and only go back to the house during the rainy season . ''
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 32]: `` It is much cooler here , madam , during the summer , and much more pleasant ; but we are more protected in the house by the cocoa-nut grove . ''
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 27]: `` Yes ; that is true , and it is very valuable during the rainy season ; but it makes it warmer in the summer time .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 20]: I like the change , Ready , and shall be sorry when we have to go back again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 19]: `` Now I must go , and help Juno to cut up the turtle , '' said Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 12]: `` We must make our larder among the banana trees . ''
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 12]: `` But what are we all to do , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 4]: said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 8]: `` We must not be idle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 41]: `` No , sir ; but I think we must give up this day to putting everything to rights , and making everything comfortable inside the tents ; to-morrow we will commence the ditch and hedge round the yam plantation .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 46]: We need not work very hard at it , for I do n't think the pigs will venture here again , as I mean to tie up all the dogs round the yam patch every night , and their barking will keep them off . ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 11]: `` That will be a very good plan , Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 12]: What beautiful food there is for the sheep and goats ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 17]: `` Yes ; this must be their future residence for the best part of the year .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 57]: I think to-morrow we will begin a piece of the ditch , and show William how to put in the cuttings of prickly pear for the hedge , and then , I should propose that you and I go to the cove to examine the stores and select what it will be necessary to bring round .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 11]: I think you said that you must go yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 10]: `` Yes , Ready , I wish to go .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 34]: When we have made our selection , I will return , and then you and William , who is more used to the boat than I am , can bring the stores round .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 10]: I presume we shall not bring them here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 14]: `` No , sir , we will take them round to the storehouse .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 18]: When we have done that job , we must then commence our alterations and our stockade . ''
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 20]: Chapter XLIX The next morning they went with their shovels to the yam plantation , and commenced their work .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 14]: As the ground was soft and swampy , the labour was very easy .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 19]: The ditch was dug nearly a yard wide , and the earth thrown up on a bank inside .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 28]: They then went to where the large patch of prickly pears grew , and cut a quantity , which they planted on the top of the bank .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 17]: Before night , they had finished about nine or ten yards of the hedge and ditch .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 47]: `` I do n't think that the pigs will get over that when it is finished , '' said Ready , `` and William will be able to get on by himself when we are gone , as well as if we were with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 18]: `` I 'll try if I can not shoot a pig or two , '' said William .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 18]: `` Let it be a young one , then ; we must not kill the old ones .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 10]: Now I think we may as well go back .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 8]: Juno is carrying in the supper . ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 21]: Before Mr. Seagrave and Ready started on the following morning , the latter gave William directions as to the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 37]: The provisions and the knapsack having been already prepared , they took leave of Mrs. Seagrave , and set off , each armed with a musket , and Ready with his axe slung over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 34]: They had a long walk before them , as they had first to find their way back to the house , and from thence had to walk through the wood to the cove .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 17]: In two hours after leaving the house they reached the spot where they had first landed .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 25]: The rocks near to it were strewed with timber and planks , which lay bleaching in the sun , or half-buried in the sand .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 52]: Mr. Seagrave sat down , and sighed deeply as he said , `` Ready , the sight of these timbers , of which the good ship Pacific was built , recalls feelings which I had hoped to have dismissed from my mind ; but I can not help them rising up .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 53]: The remains of this vessel appear to me as the last link between us and the civilised world , which we have been torn from , and all my thoughts of home and country , and I may say all my longing for them , are revived as strong as ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 16]: `` And very natural that they should , Mr. Seagrave ; I feel it also .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 53]: I am content , it is true , because I have nothing to wish or look forward to ; but still I could not help thinking of poor Captain Osborn and my shipmates , as I looked upon the wreck , and wishing that I might take them by the hand again .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 10]: It is very natural that one should do so .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 17]: Why , sir , do you know that I feel unhappy even about the poor ship .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 26]: We sailors love our vessels , especially when they have good qualities , and the Pacific was as fine a vessel as ever was built .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 19]: Now , sir , I feel quite melancholy when I see her planks and timbers lying about here .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 34]: But , sir , if we can not help feeling as we do , it is our duty to check the feeling , so that it does not get the mastery over us .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 7]: We can do no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 43]: `` Very true , Ready , '' said Mr. Seagrave , rising up ; `` it is not only useless , but even sinful to indulge in them , as they only can lead to our repining at the decrees of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 24]: Let us now examine the rocks , and see if anything has been thrown up that may be of use to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 26]: They walked round , but , with the exception of spars and a barrel or two of tar , they could find nothing of value .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 35]: There was no want of staves and iron hoops of broken casks , and these , Ready observed , would make excellent palings for the garden when they had time to bring them round .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 40]: After they had returned , they sat down to rest themselves , and then they went to the tents in the cocoa-nut grove , in which they had collected the articles thrown up when the ship went to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 12]: `` Why , the pigs have been at work here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 64]: said Ready ; `` they have contrived to open one cask of flour somehow or another ; look , sir - I suppose it must have been shaky , or they could not have routed into it ; the canvas is not good for much , I fear ; fortunately , we have several bolts of new , which I brought on shore .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 14]: Now , sir , we will see what condition the stores are in .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 26]: All these are casks of flour , and we run no risk in opening them , and seeing if they are in good order . ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 36]: The first cask which was opened had a cake round it as hard as a board ; but when it was cut through with the axe , the inside was found in a good state .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 37]: `` That 's all right , sir ; and I presume the others will be the same ; the salt water has got in so far and made a crust , which has preserved the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 14]: But now let us go to dinner , and to work afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 9]: Chapter L After dinner they resumed their labour .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 10]: `` I wonder what 's in this case ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 11]: said Mr. Seagrave , pointing to the first at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 37]: Ready set to work with his axe , and broke off the lid , and found a number of pasteboard boxes full of tapes , narrow ribbons , stay-laces , whalebones , and cottons on reels .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 17]: `` This has been sent out for some Botany Bay milliner , '' said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 20]: `` I presume , however , we must confiscate it for the benefit of Mrs. Seagrave and Miss Caroline .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 14]: We will take them to them as soon as we have time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 29]: The next was a box without a lock ; the lid was forced up , and they found a dozen half-gallon square bottles of gin stored in divisions .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 23]: `` That 's Hollands , sir , I know , '' said Ready ; `` what shall we do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 54]: `` We will not destroy it , Ready , but at the same time we will not use it but as a medicine , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` we have been so long used to spring-water , that it would be a pity to renew a taste for spirituous liquors . ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 23]: `` I trust we shall never want to drink a drop of it , sir , either as a medicine or otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 9]: Now for this cask with wooden hoops . ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 18]: The head was soon out , and discovered a dinner set of painted china with gold edges .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 20]: `` This , Mr. Seagrave , may be useful , for we are rather short of plates and dishes .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 9]: Common white would have served as well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 15]: `` And be more suitable with our present outfit , '' replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 27]: `` Here 's a box with your name on it , sir , '' said Ready ; `` do you know what is in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 17]: `` I have no idea , Ready ; but your axe will decide the point . ''
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 53]: When the box was opened , everything appeared in a sad mouldy state from the salt water which had penetrated ; but on removing the brown paper and pasteboard , it was found to contain stationery of all sorts , and , except on the outside , it was very little injured .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 9]: `` This is indeed a treasure , Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 37]: I recollect now ; this is paper , pens , and everything requisite for writing , besides children 's books , copy-books , paint-boxes , and a great many other articles in the stationery line . ''
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 9]: `` Well , sir , that is fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 29]: Now we may set up our school , and as the whole population of the island will attend it , it will really be a National School . ''
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 6]: `` Very true , Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 6]: Now for that cask . ''
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 26]: `` I can tell what that is by the outside ; it is oil , and very acceptable , for our candles are nearly out .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 13]: Now we come to the most valuable of all our property . ''
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 8]: `` What is that , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 54]: `` All the articles which I brought on shore in the different trips I took in the boat before the ship went to pieces ; for you see , sir , iron do n't swim , and , therefore , what I looked after most was ironware of all sorts , and tools .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 41]: Here are three kegs of small nails , besides two bags of large , and there are several axes , hammers , and other tools , besides hanks of twine , sailing needles , and bees ' - wax . ''
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 9]: `` They are indeed valuable , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 14]: `` Here 's some more of my plunder , as the Americans say .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 63]: All these are wash-deck buckets , this a small harness cask for salting meat , and here 's the cook 's wooden trough for making bread , which will please Miss Juno ; and in it , you see , I have put all the galley-hooks , ladles , and spoons , and the iron trivets , and here 's two lamps .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 22]: I think I put some cotton wicks somewhere - I know I did ; we shall find them by and by .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 25]: Here 's the two casks , one of cartridges made up , and the other of gunpowder , and the other six muskets . ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 19]: `` These are really treasures , Ready , and yet how well we have done without them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 68]: `` Very true , sir , but we shall do better with them , and when we fit up the storehouse for a dwelling , Mr. Seagrave , we shall be able to make it a little more comfortable in every respect than the present one ; for you see there , all the fir-planking and deals , which William and I buried in the sand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 10]: `` I really had quite forgotten them , Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 31]: If I could but get the fear of the savages coming over out of my head , I really think we might live very comfortably even on this island . ''
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 32]: `` Do you know , Mr. Seagrave , I am glad to hear you say that , for it proves that you are more contented and resigned than you were . ''
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 46]: `` I am so , Ready - at least I think so ; but perhaps it is , that the immediate danger from the savages so fills my thoughts , that I no longer dwell so much upon our being taken off the island . ''
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 22]: `` I dare say it is as you state , sir ; but now let us go on with our search .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 19]: Here are the ship 's compasses , and deep sea line and reel , also the land lead .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 12]: The stuff will be very useful for our little boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 36]: `` And I am very glad of the compasses , Ready ; for with them I shall be able to make a sort of survey of the island , when I have a little time .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 9]: Your pocket compass is too small for surveying .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 23]: I shall take some bearings now , while I am here , as I may not be back again very soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 61]: `` Well , sir , I think if we open this other case , which I perceive has your name on it , it will be as much as we need do to-day , for the sun is going down ; we can then make up some kind of bed , eat our suppers , and go to sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 18]: `` I am very tired , Ready , and shall be glad to do as you propose .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 17]: That case contains books ; but what portion of my library I do not know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 19]: `` But you soon will , sir , '' replied Ready , wrenching it open with his axe .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 26]: `` They are a little stained on the outside , but they are jammed so tight that they do not appear to have suffered much .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 9]: Here are one or two , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 5]: `` Plutarch 's Lives .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 51]: I am glad I have them : they are excellent reading for young or old ; there is no occasion to open any more , as I know all the other books in the case are ` History ' ; perhaps the best case which could have been saved . ''
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 41]: Chapter LI Mr. Seagrave and Ready then set to work , and made a rough sort of bed of cocoa-nut branches ; and , after eating their supper , committed themselves to the divine protection , and went to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 55]: The next morning they resumed their labour , and opened every other case and package that had been saved from the wreck ; they found more hooks , four boxes of candles , three casks of rice , and several other useful articles , besides many others which were of no value to them .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 47]: A chest of tea , and two bags of coffee , which Ready had brought on shore , were , much to their delight , found in good order ; but there was no sugar , the little which they had saved having been melted away .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 8]: `` That 's unfortunate , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 23]: `` We can not expect to get things here , as though we were a hundred yards from a grocer 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 16]: Now let us go to where we covered up the other articles with sand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 30]: The sand was shovelled up , and the barrels of beef and pork and the deal boards found in good order , but many other things were quite spoilt .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 29]: About noon they had finished , and as they had plenty of time , Mr. Seagrave took the bearings of the different points of land with the compasses .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 13]: They then shouldered their muskets , and set off on their return .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 30]: They gained the house in the bay , and having rested a little while at the storehouse , they proceeded on their way to the tents in the meadow .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 25]: They had about half a mile to go , when Ready heard a noise , and made a sign to Mr. Seagrave to stop .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 91]: Ready , whispering to Mr. Seagrave that the pigs were all close to them , loaded his musket ; Mr. Seagrave did the same , and they walked very softly to where they now heard their grunting ; they did not see them till they were within twenty yards , and then they came upon the whole herd ; the pigs raised their heads ; the old ones gave a loud grunt , and then , just as Ready fired his musket , they all set off at full speed .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 24]: Mr. Seagrave had no opportunity of firing , but Ready had shot one , which lay kicking and struggling under a cocoa-nut tree .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 30]: `` A piece of fresh pork will be quite a treat , Mr. Seagrave , '' said Ready , as they walked up to where the animal was lying .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 26]: `` It will , indeed , Ready , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` we must contrive to carry the beast home between us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 19]: `` We will sling it on the musket , sir , and it will not be very heavy .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 20]: It is one of those born on the island , and a very fine fellow for his age . ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 13]: The pig was soon slung , and they carried it between them .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 30]: As they cleared the wood , they perceived Mrs. Seagrave and William , who had heard the report of the musket , and had come out to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 15]: William took the load from his father , who walked on with Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 11]: `` Well , William , what news have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 3]: said Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 8]: `` Why , very good , Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 56]: Yesterday evening , when I was tired of work , I thought I would take the boat , and try if there was any fish to he caught on this side of the island in the deep water , and I caught three large ones , quite different from those we took among the reefs .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 15]: We had one for breakfast and dinner to-day , and it was excellent . ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 12]: `` Did you go out in the boat by yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 9]: `` No ; I took Juno with me .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 8]: She pulls very well , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 9]: `` She is a handy girl , William .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 49]: Well , we have had our survey , and there will be plenty of work for you and me , I can tell you ; I do n't think we can bring everything round in a week ; so I suppose to-morrow we had better be off . ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 21]: `` Well , I like boating better than ditching , I can tell you , Ready , '' replied William .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 15]: `` I sha n't be sorry to leave that work to my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 26]: `` I suppose it must fall to him ; as he will , of course , prefer staying with Mrs. Seagrave and the children . ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 63]: As soon as they were at the tents , Ready hung up the pig to the cross pole of the tent in which he and William and Mr. Seagrave slept , and having propped the muskets up against the side of the tent , he went with William to get his knife and some stretchers of wood to open the pig with .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 59]: While he and William were away , Caroline and Tommy came out to look at it , and Tommy , after telling Caroline how glad he was that they were to have roast pig for dinner , took up one of the muskets , and said , `` Now , Caroline , I 'll shoot the pig . ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 21]: Tommy , you must not touch the gun , '' cried Caroline ; `` papa will be very angry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 10]: `` I do n't care , '' replied Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 12]: `` I 'll show you how to shoot the pig . ''
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 23]: `` Do n't , Tommy , '' cried Caroline ; `` if you do , I 'll go and tell mamma . ''
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 19]: `` Then I 'll shoot you , '' replied Tommy , trying to point the musket at her .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 39]: Caroline was so frightened , that she ran away as fast as she could , and then Tommy , using all his strength , contrived to get the musket up to his shoulder , and pulled the trigger .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 70]: It so happened that Tommy had taken up Mr. Seagrave 's musket , which had not been fired , and when he pulled the trigger it went off , and as he did not hold it tight to his shoulder , it recoiled , and hit him with the butt right on his face , knocking out two of his teeth , besides making his nose bleed very fast .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 57]: Tommy was so astonished and frightened at the musket going off , and the blow which he received , that he gave a loud yell , dropped the musket , and ran to the tent where his father and mother were , just as they had started up and had rushed out at hearing the report .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 34]: When Mrs. Seagrave saw Tommy all covered with blood , and screaming so loud , she was so alarmed that she could not stand , and fell fainting in Mr. Seagrave 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 86]: Ready and William , on hearing the musket go off , had run as fast as they could , fearing that some accident had happened ; and while Mr. Seagrave supported his wife , Ready went to Tommy , and wiping the blood off his face with the palm of his hand , perceived that there was no wound or serious mischief , and cried out to Mr. Seagrave , `` He 's not hurt , sir ; it 's only his nose bleeding . ''
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 20]: `` Musket knocked me down , '' cried Tommy , sobbing as the blood ran out of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 19]: `` Serve you right , Tommy ; you 'll take care not to touch the musket again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 14]: `` I wo n't touch it again , '' cried Tommy , blubbering .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 40]: Juno now came up with some water to wash his face ; Mrs. Seagrave had recovered , and gone back into the tent , on Mr. Seagrave telling her that it was only Tommy 's nose which was bleeding .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 45]: In about half-an-hour Tommy had ceased crying , and his nose had left off bleeding ; his face was washed , and then it was discovered that he had lost two front teeth , and that his cheek and lips were very much bruised .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 15]: He was undressed , and put to bed , and was soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 45]: `` I should not have left the muskets , '' said Ready to William ; `` it was my fault ; but I thought Tommy had been told so often not to touch fire-arms , that he would not dare to do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 24]: `` He pointed it at me , and tried to shoot me , '' said Caroline , `` but I ran away . ''
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 4]: `` Merciful heavens !
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 5]: what an escape ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 4]: cried Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 29]: `` He has been well punished this time , madam , and I 'll venture to say he will not touch a musket again in a hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 15]: `` Yes ; but he must be punished more , '' said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 7]: `` he must remember it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 38]: `` Well , sir , if he is to be punished more , I think you can not punish him better than by not allowing him to have any of the pig when it is cooked . ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 22]: `` I think so too , Ready ; and therefore that is a settled thing - no pig for Tommy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 14]: Chapter LII The next morning Tommy 's face presented a very woeful appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 23]: His cheek and lips were swelled and black , and the loss of his two front teeth made him look much worse .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 10]: Tommy looked very glum when he came to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 66]: There was the pig 's fry for breakfast , and the smell of it had been very inviting to Tommy ; but when his father scolded him , and told him that he was not to have one bit of the pig , he began to cry and roar so loud , that he was sent away from the tents till he had left off .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 46]: After breakfast , Ready proposed that he and William should take the boat , and begin their labour of carrying the articles round from the cove to the bay where the house was , pointing out that there was not a day to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 39]: Juno had , at his request , already baked a large piece of the pig for them to take with them , and boiled a piece of salt pork , so that they were all ready to start .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 23]: `` But , Ready , '' said Mrs. Seagrave , `` how long do you intend to remain absent with William ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 20]: `` Why , madam , this is Wednesday ; of course we shall be back on Saturday night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 43]: `` My dear William , I can not bear the idea of your being absent so long , and as you will be on the water every day , I shall be in a continual fright until I see you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 24]: `` Well , mamma , I suppose I must write by the penny post , to let you know how I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 9]: `` Do n't laugh at me , William .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 18]: I do wish there was a penny post , and that you could write every day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 11]: Ready and William made every preparation for a continued absence .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 27]: They took their blankets with them , and a small pot for cooking , and when all was prepared they bade Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave farewell .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 22]: They were now to pull to the bay , and leave their luggage , and then go round to the cove .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 14]: As they shoved off , William took the dog Remus into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 10]: `` Why do you take the dog , William ?
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 20]: he will be of use here in keeping the pigs away , but of no use to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 32]: `` Yes , he will , Ready ; I must take him ; for I have an idea come into my head , so let me have my own way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 37]: `` Well , William , you can always have your own way , as far as I 'm concerned ; if you wish to take the dog , there is an end of the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 23]: They hoisted the sail , and as the breeze was fresh , were round to the bay in a very short time .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 65]: They took their provisions and stores up to the house , and made fast the door , called the fowls , and gave them some damaged rice which Ready had brought from the cove , and found , to their great delight , that they had now upwards of forty chickens ; some , indeed , quite grown , and large enough to kill .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 66]: They then got into the boat again , and pulled away for the cove ; the wind was fresh , and against them , so they had a long pull ; but , as Ready observed , it was much better that it should be so , as , when the boat was loaded , they could very quickly sail back again to the bay .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 78]: As soon as they arrived at the cove , they lost no time in loading the boat ; the nails , and iron work of every description , with the twine and tools , composed the major part of the first cargo ; and calling Remus , who was lying on the sandy beach , they shoved off , hoisted their sail , and in an hour had regained the bay , and passed through the reef .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 21]: `` I am glad that this cargo has arrived safe , William , for it is very valuable to us .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 29]: Now we will take them all up , and that will be sufficient for to-day ; to-morrow , if we can , we will make two trips . ''
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 33]: `` We can , if we start early , '' replied William ; `` but now let us have our dinner , and carry the remainder of the things up afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 41]: As they were eating their dinner , and William was giving the bones to the dog , Ready said , `` Pray , William , what was the idea in your head which made you bring Remus with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 51]: `` I will tell you , Ready ; I mean him to carry a letter to mamma ; you know that he always goes back when he is ordered , and now I wish to see if he will not go back to the tents , if he is told .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 13]: I have brought a piece of paper and pencil with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 27]: William then wrote on the paper , `` Dear Mamma : -- We are quite well , and just returned with the first cargo quite safe .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 7]: Your affectionate son , WILLIAM . ''
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 87]: William tied the paper round the dog 's neck with a piece of twine , and then calling him out of the house , said to him , `` Remus , go back , sir - go back , sir ; '' the dog looked wistfully at William , as if not sure of what he was to do , but William took up a stone , and pretended to throw it at the dog , who ran away a little distance , and then stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 12]: `` Go back , Remus - go back , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 31]: William again pretended to throw the stone , repeating the order , and then the dog set off as fast as his legs could carry him through the cocoa-nut grove .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 21]: `` He is gone at all events , '' said William ; `` I think he will go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 36]: `` We shall see , sir , '' replied Ready ; `` and now that we have finished our dinner , we will bring up the things , and put them in the storehouse . ''
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 29]: Chapter LIII As soon as they had carried up the whole of the cargo , they secured the boat , and went up to the house to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 19]: Just as they went in , Remus came bounding up to them with a letter round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 22]: `` Here 's the dog , William , '' said Ready ; `` he wo n't go home after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 4]: `` How provoking !
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 13]: I made sure he would go back ; I really am disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 20]: We will give him nothing to eat , and then he will ; but , dear me , Ready !
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 11]: this is not the paper I tied round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 4]: I think not .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 5]: Let me see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 29]: William took the paper , opened it , and read -- `` Dear William : -- Your letter arrived safe , and we are glad you are well .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 18]: Write every day , and God bless you ; it was very clever of you and Remus .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 8]: Your affectionate mother , SELINA SEAGRAVE . ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 37]: `` Well , it is clever , '' said Ready ; `` I 'm sure I had no idea he had gone ; and his coming back again , too , when he was ordered . ''
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 30]: `` Dear Remus , good dog , '' said William , caressing it : `` now I 'll give you a good supper , for you deserve it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 7]: `` So he does , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 17]: Well , you 've established a post on the island , which is a great improvement .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 11]: Seriously , William , it may prove very useful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 15]: `` At all events it will be a great comfort to my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 27]: `` Yes , especially as we shall be obliged all three to be here when we fit up the storehouse , and make the proposed alterations .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 21]: Now I think we had better go to bed , for we must be up with the lark to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 26]: `` Here I suppose we ought to say , up with the parrots ; for they are the only land birds on the island . ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 18]: `` You forget the pigeons ; I saw one of them in the wood the other day .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 4]: Good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 10]: The next morning , they were off before breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 12]: The boat was soon loaded , and they returned under sail .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 48]: They then breakfasted , and having left the things they had brought on the beach , that they might lose no time , they set off again , and returned with another cargo two hours before dusk ; this they landed , and then secured the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 31]: As soon as they were in the house , William wrote on a piece of paper : -- `` Dear Mamma : -- We have brought round two cargoes to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 7]: All well , and very tired .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 5]: Yours , WILLIAM . ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 9]: Remus did not require any teaching this time .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 11]: William patted him , and said , `` Good dog .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 25]: Now , Remus , go back - go home , sir ; '' and the dog wagged his tail , and set off immediately .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 13]: Before they were in bed , the dog returned with the answer .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 9]: `` How fast he must run , Ready !
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 11]: he has not been away more than two hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 31]: So , now , Remus , you shall have plenty of supper , and plenty of patting and coaxing , for you are a clever , good little dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 27]: The next day , as they had to take the two cargoes up to the house , they could only make one trip to the cove .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 50]: On Saturday they only made one trip , as they had to return to the tents , which they did by water , having first put a turtle into the boat ; on their arrival , they found them all at the little harbour , waiting to receive them .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 23]: `` Well , William , you did keep your promise and send me a letter by post , '' said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 7]: `` How very delightful it is !
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 13]: I shall have no fear now when you are all away . ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 15]: `` I must teach Romulus and Vixen to do the same , mamma . ''
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 12]: `` And I 'll teach the puppies , '' said Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 28]: `` Yes , Tommy ; by the time you can write a letter , the puppies will be old enough to carry it , '' said Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 26]: `` Come , Albert , I 'll carry you up ; you and I have n't had a game of play for a long while .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 13]: How does the ditch and hedge get on , Mr. Seagrave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 19]: `` Pretty well , Ready , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` I have nearly finished two sides .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 17]: I think by the end of next week I shall have pretty well inclosed it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 30]: `` Well , sir , you must not work too hard , there is no great hurry ; William and I can get through a great deal together . ''
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 21]: `` It is my duty to work , Ready ; and I may add , it is a pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 17]: As they were at supper the conversation turned upon the cleverness shown by the dog Remus .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 32]: Mr. Seagrave narrated many instances of the sagacity of animals , when William asked the question of his father : `` What is the difference then between reason and instinct ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 44]: `` The difference is very great , William , as I will explain to you ; but I must first observe , that it has been the custom to say that man is governed by reason , and animals by instinct , alone .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 5]: This is an error .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 22]: Man has instinct as well as reason ; and animals , although chiefly governed by instinct , have reasoning powers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 15]: `` In what points does man show that he is led by instinct ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 51]: `` When a child is first born , William , it acts by instinct only : the reasoning powers are not yet developed ; as we grow up , our reason becomes every day more matured , and gains the mastery over our instinct , which decreases in proportion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 23]: `` Then when we have grown to a good old age , I suppose we have no instinct left in us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 30]: `` Not so , my dear boy ; there is one and a most powerful instinct implanted in man which never deserts him on this side of the grave .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 21]: It is the fear , not of death , but of utter annihilation , that of becoming nothing after death .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 41]: This instinctive feeling could not have been so deeply implanted in us , but as an assurance that we shall not be annihilated after death , but that our souls shall still exist , although our bodies shall have perished .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 13]: It may be termed the instinctive evidence of a future existence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 13]: `` That is very true , Mr. Seagrave , '' observed Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 55]: `` Instinct in animals , William , '' continued Mr. Seagrave , `` is a feeling which compels them to perform certain acts without previous thought or reflection ; this instinct is in full force at the moment of their birth ; it was therefore perfect in the beginning , and has never varied .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 32]: The swallow built her nest , the spider its web , the bee formed its comb , precisely in the same way four thousand years ago , as they do now .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 47]: I may here observe , that one of the greatest wonders of instinct is the mathematical form of the honeycomb of the bee , which has been proved by demonstration to be that by which is given the greatest possible saving of time and labour . ''
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 19]: `` But that is all pure instinct , papa ; now you said that animals had reasoning powers .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 14]: Will you point out to me how they show that they have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 18]: `` I will , my dear boy ; but we had better defer it till another evening .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 10]: It is now time to go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 17]: Chapter LIV The following day , being Sunday , was devoted to the usual religious exercises .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 53]: Tommy stole away out of the tent , while Mr. Seagrave was reading a sermon , to have a peep at the turtle-soup , which was boiling on the fire ; however , Juno suspected him , and had hold of him just as he was taking the lid off the pot .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 34]: He was well scolded , and very much frightened lest he should have no soup for his dinner ; however , as it was not a very heavy offence , he was forgiven .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 19]: In the evening , William requested his father to renew the conversation about the reasoning powers of animals .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 22]: `` With pleasure , William , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` it is a fit discourse for a Sunday evening .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 15]: Let us , however , first examine the various mental faculties discoverable in animals .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 23]: In the first place , they have memory , especially memory of persons and places , quite as tenacious as our own .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 12]: A dog will recognize an old master after many years absence .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 28]: An elephant , who had again escaped into the woods , after twenty years remaining in a wild state , recognized his old mahoot , or driver .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 20]: A dog will find his way back when taken more than a hundred miles from his master 's residence .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 16]: Another proof of memory in animals , were it required , is that they dream .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 33]: Now , a dream is a confused recollection of past events ; and how often do you not hear Romulus and Remus growling , barking , and whining in their sleep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 7]: `` Very true , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 9]: `` Well , then , they have attention .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 22]: See how patiently a cat will remain for hours before a hole , in watch for the mouse to come out .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 32]: A spider will remain for months watching for the fly to enter its web ; but this quality is to be observed in every animal in the pursuit of its prey .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 15]: They have also association of ideas , which is , in fact , reasoning .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 23]: A dog proves that ; he will allow a gentleman to come up to the door , but fly at a beggar .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 27]: When he is in charge of any property he will take no notice of a passer-by ; but if a man stops , he barks immediately .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 34]: In the elephant this association of ideas is even more remarkable ; indeed , he understands what is said to him better than any other animal ; his reasoning powers are most extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 11]: Promise him rewards , and he will make wonderful exertion .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 11]: He is also extremely alive to a sense of shame .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 12]: The elephants were employed to transport the heavy artillery in India .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 15]: One of the finest attempted in vain to force a gun through a swamp .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 17]: ` Take away that lazy beast , ' said the director ` and bring another . '
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 35]: The animal was so stung with the reproach , that it used so much exertion to force the gun on with its head , as to fracture its skull , and it fell dead .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 43]: When Chunee , the elephant which was so long in Exeter Change , was ordered as usual to take up a sixpence with his trunk , it happened one day that the sixpence rolled against the skirting-board , out of his reach .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 54]: Chunee stopped , and reflected a little while , and then , drawing the air into his trunk , he threw it out with all his force against the skirting-board ; the rebound of the air from the skirting-board blew the sixpence towards him , and he was enabled to reach it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 12]: `` That was very clever of him , '' replied William .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 18]: `` Yes ; it was a proof of thought , with a knowledge of cause and effect .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 36]: There was a curious instance of a horse , which , by the bye , I consider the most noble animal of creation , which was ridden round by his master , to deliver newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 58]: He invariably stopped at the doors where papers were to be left ; but it happened that two people , living at different houses , took in a weekly newspaper between them ; and it was agreed , that one should have the first reading of it on one week , and the other on the following .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 38]: After a short time the horse became accustomed to this arrangement , and stopped at the one house on the one week , and at the other house on the following , never making a mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 16]: `` That was very curious ; what a sagacious animal he must have been ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 3]: observed William .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 22]: `` Animals also are , as you know , capable of receiving instruction , which is another proof of reasoning powers .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 22]: The elephant , the horse , the dog , the pig , even birds may be taught a great deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 24]: `` But then , papa , I still wish to know where the line is to be drawn between reason and instinct . ''
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 13]: `` I was about to come to that very point , William .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 34]: When animals follow their instinct in providing their food , bringing up their young , and in their precautions against danger , they follow certain fixed rules , from which they never deviate .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 27]: But circumstances may occur against which their instinct can afford them no regular provision ; then it is that their reasoning powers are called into action .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 27]: I will explain this by stating a fact relative to the bee , one of the animals upon which instinct is most powerful in its action .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 22]: There is a certain large moth , called the Death 's - head moth , which is very fond of honey .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 19]: It sometimes contrives to force its way through the aperture of the hive , and gain an entrance .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 60]: The bees immediately attack it , and it is soon destroyed by their stings ; but the carcass is so large , that they can not carry it out of the hive , as they invariably do the bodies of the smaller insects which may have intruded , and it appears that their sense of smell is very acute .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 21]: What , then , do they do to avoid the stench arising from the dead body of this large moth ?
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 23]: Why , they embalm it , covering it entirely with wax , by which it no longer becomes offensive to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 17]: `` But , papa , might not their instinct have provided for such an event ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 3]: observed William .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 134]: `` If such an event could have occurred to the bees in their wild state , you certainly might have raised the question ; but recollect , William , that bees in their wild state live in the hollows of trees , and that the hole by which they enter is never more than sufficiently large to admit one bee at a time ; consequently , no animal larger than a bee could gain entrance , and if it did , could of course have been easily removed from the hive ; but the bees were here in a new position , in an artificial state , in a hive of straw with a large aperture , and therefore met with an exigence they were not prepared for , and acted accordingly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 11]: `` Yes , papa , I perceive the difference . ''
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 10]: `` I will conclude my observations with one remark .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 54]: It appears to me , that although the Almighty has thought proper to vary the intellectual and the reasoning powers of animals in the same way that he has varied the species and the forms , yet even in this arrangement he has not been unmindful of the interest and welfare of man .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 67]: For you will observe , that the reasoning powers are chiefly , if not wholly , given to those animals which man subjects to his service and for his use - the elephant , the horse , and the dog ; thereby making these animals of more value , as the powers given to them are at the service and under the control of man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 29]: Chapter LV On the Monday morning , William and Ready went away in the boat , as before , to bring round the various articles from the cove .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 32]: It had been arranged that they were not to return till the Saturday evening , and that the dog Remus was to bring intelligence of them and their welfare every afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 51]: They worked hard during the week , and on Saturday they had completed their task ; with the exception of a portion of the timbers of the ship , everything had been brought round , but had not been carried up to the storehouse , as that required more time .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 48]: On Saturday morning , they went for the last time to the cove , and Ready selected some heavy oak timber out of the quantity which was lying on the beach , part of which they put into the boat , and the remainder they towed astern .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 29]: It was a heavy load , and although the wind was fair to sail hack again to the bay , the boat went but slowly through the water .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 60]: `` Well , William , '' said Ready , `` we have done a good week 's work , and I must say it is high time that it is done ; for the boat is in rather a crazy condition , and I must contrive to patch her up by and by , when there is time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 46]: `` We shall not want to use her very much after this , Ready , '' replied William ; `` a few trips round to the little harbour will be all that will be required before we come back again to our old quarters . ''
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 30]: `` That 's true , William ; but she leaks very much , and at all events I 'll give her a coat of pitch as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 16]: For a slight-built little thing as she is , she has done hard duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 24]: `` Pray , Ready , why , when you speak of a ship or boat , do you always call it she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 22]: `` Well , William , I do n't know why , but it is certain that we sailors always do so .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 11]: I believe it is because a sailor loves his ship .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 33]: His ship is his wife , is a very common saying with us ; and then you see , Master William , a vessel is almost a thing of life in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 26]: I believe that 's the reason , and of course if a vessel is she , a little boat must be a she also . ''
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 14]: `` Well , I think you have explained it very well , Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 21]: I suppose on Monday we shall set to at the storehouse , and alter it for our future residence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 94]: `` Ca n't begin too soon , William , '' replied Ready ; `` I do n't doubt but Mr. Seagrave has finished the hedge and ditch round the yams by this time , and if so , I expect Madam will not like to be left in the tents alone with Juno and the children , and so we shall all move back to the house again until we have altered the storehouse ; I must say that I would rather your mamma remained in the tents until all was finished . ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 15]: `` Because you are afraid of a visit from the savages , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 13]: `` I am , sir , and that 's the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 44]: `` But , Ready , if they do come , we shall see them coming , and would it not be better that we should all be together , even if we are obliged to conceal ourselves in consequence of not being prepared ?
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 42]: Suppose the savages were to overrun the island , and find my mother , my little brother , and sister , defenceless , at the time we were obliged to retreat from our house ; how dreadful that would be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 11]: `` But I counted upon retreating to the tents . ''
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 16]: `` So we can all together , unless we are surprised in the night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 10]: `` That we must take care not to be .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 14]: There 's not three hours ' dark in this season of the year .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 38]: Well , William , I doubt not you may be right , and if they are all with us , Juno will be a great help , and we shall get through our work the faster . ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 16]: `` We had better let the question be decided by my father and mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 13]: `` Very true , William ; here 's the point at last .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 26]: We will haul the timber on the beach , and then be off as fast as we can , for it is getting late . ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 56]: It was , indeed , much later than they had usually arrived at the little harbour , owing to the heavy load , which made the boat so long in coming round from the cove ; and when they pulled in , they found Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave and the children all waiting for them .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 13]: `` You are very late , William , '' said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 15]: `` I was quite uneasy till I saw the boat at a distance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 29]: `` Yes , mamma ; but we could not help it ; we had a heavy load to bring round , and now our work is done . ''
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 22]: `` I am delighted to hear it , William ; for I can not bear you being away so long . ''
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 23]: `` And my work is done , '' said Mr. Seagrave ; `` the hedge and ditch were finished this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 27]: `` Well , then , '' observed Ready , `` we must hold another council , but I presume it will not take very long . ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 18]: `` No ; I expect not ; it seldom does when people are of the same mind .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 31]: Mrs. Seagrave wo n't be left here , Ready , and I do n't want to leave her , so I presume on Monday we all start home again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 13]: `` Yes , sir ; if you please , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 23]: `` Juno , I hope you have a good supper , '' said William ; `` for I 'm very hungry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 17]: `` Yes , Massa William ; plenty fried fish ; Massa catch 'em this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 32]: Chapter LVI The next day being Sunday was a day of repose , and as they had all worked so hard , they felt the luxury of a day of rest .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 28]: In the afternoon , they agreed that on Monday they should make every preparation for quitting the tents , and returning to the house at the bay .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 102]: They decided that the live stock should all be left there , as the pasturage was so plentiful and good , with the exception of one goat , which they would take back with them , to supply them with milk ; and they also agreed that the tents should be left standing , with some cooking utensils , that in case William and Ready went round for the bananas or yams , or to examine the live stock , they should not be compelled to sleep in the open air , and should have the means of dressing their dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 50]: William and Ready were to carry the beds , etc. , round to the bay in the boat , which they could do in two trips , and Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave , with the family , were to walk through the woods after taking a very early breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 35]: All these points being arranged , they had finished their supper , when William again brought up the conversation about animals , as he was delighted to bear Mr. Seagrave talk on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 29]: The conversation had not commenced more than a few minutes , when William said -- `` Papa , they always say ` as stupid as an ass ' .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 9]: Is an ass such a stupid animal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 36]: `` No , William ; it is a very sagacious one ; but the character has been given to the animal more on account of its obstinacy and untractableness , than on any other account .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 23]: It is usual to say , as stupid as an ass , or as stupid as a pig , or a goose .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 17]: Now , these three animals are very much maligned , for they are all sagacious animals .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 50]: But the fact is that , as regards the ass , we have only very sorry specimens of the animal in England ; they are stunted and small , and , from want of corn and proper food , besides being very ill-treated , are slow and dull-looking animals .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 106]: The climate of England is much too cold for the ass ; in the south of France and the Mediterranean , where it is much warmer , the ass is a much finer animal ; but to see it in perfection we must go to the Torrid Zone in Guinea , right on the equator , the hottest portion of the globe , where the ass , in its native state and in its native country , is a handsome creature and as fleet as the wind ; indeed , supposed to be , and mentioned in the Scriptures as the fleetest animal in creation .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 27]: The fact is , that in Asia , especially in Palestine and Syria , asses were in great repute , and used in preference to horses .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 19]: We must see an animal in its own climate to form a true estimate of its value . ''
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 13]: `` Does climate , then , make so great a difference ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 3]: said William .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 29]: `` Of course it does , not only with animals , but with trees , plants , and even man , until he is accustomed to the change .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 23]: With respect to animals , there are some which can bear the different varieties of climate , and even change of food .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 58]: The horse , for instance , although originally indigenous to Arabia , lives as well in the Temperate , and even in the Frigid Zones it may be said , for they endure the hard winters of Russia and North America ; so will domestic cattle , such as cows , sheep , pigs , & c .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 26]: It is a curious fact that , during the winter in Canada , a large proportion of the food of cattle consists of fish . ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 5]: `` Fish , papa !
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 5]: Cows eat fish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 12]: `` Yes , my dear boy , such is the fact .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 26]: It is a remarkable instance of a graminivorous or grass-eating animal being changed for a time into a flesh-eating , or rather into fish-eating animal .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 25]: But there are other animals which can live under any temperature , as the wolf , the fox , the hare , and rabbit .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 47]: It is a curious provision , - that the sheep and goats in the hottest climates throw off their warm covering of wool , and retain little better than hair ; while , removed to a cold climate , they recover their warm covering immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 11]: `` But a goat has no wool , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 11]: `` What are Cashmere shawls made of , William ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 7]: `` Very true , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 22]: `` Most animals have a certain increase of covering as they recede further from the warm climates to the cold ones .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 22]: Wolves and foxes , hares and rabbits , change the colour of their skins to white when they get far north .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 25]: The little English stoat , which is destroyed by the gamekeepers , becomes the beautiful snow-white ermine in Russia and other cold countries . ''
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 94]: `` Well , papa , I think it a great advantage to man , and a proof of the Almighty 's care of him and kindness to him , in permitting all the animals most useful to him to be able to live in any country ; but I do n't know whether I am wrong in saying so , papa : I can not see why an animal like the wolf should not have been kept to his own climate , like the lion and tiger , and other ferocious animals . ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 32]: `` You have started a question , William , which I am glad you have done , rather than it should have remained on your mind , and have puzzled you .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 43]: It is true that the shepherd might agree with you , that the wolf is a nuisance ; equally true that the husband man may exclaim , What is the good of thistles , and the various weeds which choke the soil ?
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 35]: But , my dear boy , if they are not , which I think they are , for the benefit of man , at all events they are his doom for the first transgression .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 63]: ` Cursed is the ground for thy sake - thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee - and by the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread , ' was the Almighty 's sentence ; and it is only by labour that the husbandman can obtain his crops , and by watchfulness that the shepherd can guard his flocks .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 25]: Labour is in itself a benefit : without exercise there would be no health , and without health there would be no enjoyment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 7]: `` I see now , papa .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 23]: You have mentioned the animals which can live in all climates ; will you not tell us something about other animals ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 66]: `` There is but one remark to make , William , which is , that animals indigenous to , that is , originally to be found in , any one portion of the globe , invariably are so fashioned as to be most fit for that country , and have the food also most proper for them growing or to be obtained in that country .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 36]: Take , for instance , the camel , an animal fashioned expressly for the country to which he is indigenous , and without whose aid all communication must have been stopped between Asia and Africa .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 22]: He is called the ` Ship of the Desert ' ; for the desert is a ` sea of sand ' .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 57]: His feet are so fashioned that he can traverse the sands with facility ; he can live upon the coarsest vegetable food and salt plants which are found there , and he has the capacity of carrying water in a sort of secondary stomach , for his own supply where no water is to be found .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 39]: Here is an animal wonderfully made by the Almighty for an express locality , and for the convenience of man in that country ; for , in England , or elsewhere , he would be of no value .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 26]: But it is late , my dear William ; so we will first thank him for all his mercies , and then to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 20]: Chapter LVII The next morning was one of bustle ; there was packing up and every preparation for departure .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 29]: Juno was called here and called there , and was obliged to ask little Caroline to look after the kettle and call to her if it boiled over .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 25]: Master Tommy , as usual , was in every one 's way , and doing more harm than good in his attempts to assist .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 22]: At last , Ready , to get rid of him , sent him down with a large bundle to the beach .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 50]: Tommy shouldered it with great importance , but when he came back , looking rather warm with the exertion , and Ready asked him to take down another , he said he was too tired , and sat down very quietly till breakfast-time , before which everything was ready .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 44]: Mrs. Seagrave and Juno packed up the breakfast and dinner things in a basket after breakfast was over , and then Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave and the family set off on their journey , accompanied by the dogs , through the cocoa-nut grove .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 32]: William and Ready lost no time in getting through their work ; the crockery , kitchen utensils , table , and chairs , were the first articles put into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 32]: The goat was then led down , and they set off with a full load , and arrived at the bay long before the party who were walking through the wood .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 26]: They landed the things on the beach , and then shoved off again to bring round the bedding , which was all that was left .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 48]: By three o'clock in the afternoon they had arrived at the bay with their second and last load , and found that the other party had been there about an hour , and Mr. Seagrave and Juno were very busy taking the articles up from the beach .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 47]: `` Well , William , '' said Ready , `` this is our last trip for some time , I expect ; and so much the better , for our little boat must have something done to her as soon as I can find time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 14]: `` Yes , indeed , Ready , she has done her work well .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 21]: Do you know I feel as if I were coming home , now that we are back to the bay .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 12]: I really feel quite glad that we have left the tents .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 21]: I found the pigeons among the peas , Ready , so we must pick them as soon as we can .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 9]: I think there were near twenty of them .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 12]: We shall have pigeon pies next year , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 25]: `` If it pleases God that we live and do well , '' replied Ready , who had his eyes fixed upon the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 43]: Before night everything was in its place again in the house , and as comfortable as before , and as they were very tired , they went very early to bed , having first arranged what they should do in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 36]: At daylight Ready and William went down to the turtle-pond and speared a turtle , for now the time was coming on for turning the turtle again , and the pond would soon be filled .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 32]: Having cut it up and put a portion of it into the pot , all ready for Mrs. Seagrave , as soon as breakfast was over they proceeded to the storehouse .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 44]: After a little consultation with Mr. Seagrave , Ready marked out a square of cocoa-nut trees surrounding the storehouse , so as to leave a space within them of about twenty yards each side , which they considered large enough for the inclosure .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 54]: These cocoa-nut trees were to serve as the posts between which were to be fixed other cocoa-nut trees cut down , and about fourteen feet high , so as to form a palisade or stockade , which could not be climbed over , and would protect them from any attack of the savages .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 45]: As soon as the line of trees had been marked out , they set to work cutting down all the trees within the line , and then outside to a distance of ten yards , so as to give them room for their work .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 46]: Ready cut out cross-pieces , to nail from tree to tree , and now they found the advantage of having saved so many of the large spike nails , without which they never could have made so good or so quick a job of it .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 30]: Mr. Seagrave cut down trees , William and Juno sawed them off at a proper length with one of the cross-cut saws , and then carried them to Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 48]: They soon had more cut out than be could use , and then they dragged away the tops and branches , and piled them at a distance on the ground , to use as winter fuel , while Mr. Seagrave helped Ready in fixing up the palisades .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 16]: They worked very hard that day , and were not sorry to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 12]: Ready , however , took an opportunity to speak to William .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 32]: `` I think , '' said he , `` that now we are here again , it will be necessary to keep a sort of night-watch , in case of accident .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 33]: I shall not go to bed till it is quite dark , which it will be by nine o'clock , and shall have my glass to examine the offing the last thing .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 143]: You see , there is little fear of the savages coming here in the night-time , but they may just before night or very early in the morning , so one of us must be up again before daybreak , that is between two and three o'clock in the morning , to see if there is anything to be seen of them ; if there is not , of course we may go to bed again , as they can not arrive till many hours afterwards ; and we must watch the wind and weather , if it is favourable for them to come to us , which , indeed , the wind will not be except at the commencement of the rainy season but it may be very light , and then they would not care for its being against them .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 99]: I 've been thinking of it , William , a great deal , and my idea is , that it will be at the beginning of the rainy season that we shall have a visit , if we have one at all ; for you see that the wind do n't blow regular from one quarter , as it does now , but is variable , and then they can make sail in their canoes , and come here easily , instead of pulling between thirty and forty miles , which is hard work against wind and current .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 17]: Still , we must not be careless and we must keep a good look-out even now .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 35]: I do n't want to fret your father and Mrs. Seagrave with my fears on the subject , but I tell you what I really think , and what we ought to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 33]: `` I agree with you , Ready , and I will take care to be up before daybreak , and examine very carefully with the spy-glass as soon as the day dawns .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 18]: You take the night part , and I will do the morning part of the watching . ''
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 29]: Chapter LVIII For nearly a fortnight , the work upon the stockade continued without any intermission , when a circumstance occurred which created the greatest alarm and excitement .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 26]: One day , as the party returned to dinner , Mrs. Seagrave said with surprise , `` Why , was not Tommy with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 36]: `` No , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` he has not been near us all day ; he went with us after breakfast , but did not remain a quarter of an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 23]: `` No , Missy ; I tell Massa Tommy to help carry cocoa-nut leaves , and then he go away directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 3]: `` Goodness !
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 6]: where can he be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 6]: exclaimed Mrs. Seagrave , alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 28]: `` I dare say he is picking up shells on the beach , ma'am , '' replied Ready , `` or perhaps he is in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 7]: I will go and see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 9]: `` I see him - oh , mercy !
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 27]: - I see him , '' said Juno , pointing with her finger ; `` he in the boat , and boat go to sea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 37]: It was but too true : there was Tommy in the boat , and the boat had drifted from the beach , and was now a cable 's length away from it , among the breakers .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 57]: William ran off like the wind , followed close by Mr. Seagrave and Ready , and at a distance by Mrs. Seagrave and Juno ; indeed , there was no time to be lost , for the wind was off the shore , and in a short time the boat would have been out to sea .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 23]: William , as soon as he arrived at the beach , threw off his hat and jacket and dashed into the water .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 32]: He was already up to his middle , when old Ready , who had followed him , caught him by the arm and said : `` William , go back immediately .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 5]: I insist upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 34]: Your going can do no good , as you do not understand the thing so well as I do ; and go I will , so there will be double risk for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 7]: Mr. Seagrave , order him back .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 5]: He will obey you .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 8]: I insist upon it , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 18]: `` William , '' said Mr. Seagrave , `` come back immediately , I command you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 38]: William obeyed , but before he was clear of the water Ready had swam across to the first rocks on the reef , and was now dashing through the pools between the rocks , towards the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 6]: `` Oh , father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 18]: said William , `` if that good old man is lost , I shall never forgive myself .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 17]: Look , father , one - two - three sharks , here , close to us .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 5]: He has no chance .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 9]: See , he is again in deep water .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 5]: God protect him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 45]: In the meantime , Mr. Seagrave , whose wife was now by his side , after glancing his eye a moment at the sharks , which were within a few feet of the beach , had kept his gaze steadily upon Ready 's movements .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 38]: If he passed through the passage of deep water between the rocks he might be considered safe , as the boat was now beating on a reef on the other side , where the water was shallow .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 8]: It was a moment of intense anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 22]: At last Ready had gained the reef , and had his hands upon the rocks , and was climbing on them .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 10]: `` He is safe , is he not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 5]: whispered Mrs. Seagrave faintly .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 35]: `` Yes ; now I think he is , '' replied Mr. Seagrave , as Ready had gained a footing on the rocks , where the water was but a little above his ankles .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 15]: `` I think there is no deep water between him and the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 18]: In another minute Ready was over the rocks , and had seized the gunnel of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 11]: `` He is in the boat , '' cried William .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 5]: `` Thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 17]: `` Yes , we must thank God , and that fervently , '' replied Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 33]: `` Look at those monsters , '' continued he , pointing to the sharks ; `` how quick they swim to and fro ; they have scented their prey on the water .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 8]: It is fortunate they are here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 21]: `` See , he has the boat-hook , and is pushing the boat off the reef into the deep water .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 7]: he is quite safe now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 9]: Such , however , was not the case .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 40]: The boat had been beating on the rocks of the reef , and had knocked a hole in her bottom , and as soon as Ready had forced the boat into deep water , she began to fill immediately .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 29]: Ready pushed as hard as he could with the boat-hook , and tearing off his neck-cloth , forced as much as he could of it into the hole .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 57]: This saved them ; but the boat was up to the thwarts with water , and the least motion on the part of Ready , or even Tommy , would have upset her immediately , and they had still to pass the deep water between the reef and the beach , where the sharks were swimming .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 29]: Ready , who perceived his danger , called out to them to throw large stones at the sharks as fast as they could , to drive them away .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 17]: This was immediately done by Mr. Seagrave and William , aided by Juno and Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 10]: The pelting of the stones had the desired effect .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 34]: The sharks swam away , and Ready passed through to the beach , and the boat grounded just as she was up to the gunnel in water , and about to turn over .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 16]: He handed out Tommy , who was so dreadfully frightened that he could not cry .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 25]: As soon as Ready landed , William sprang into his arms , crying , `` Thank God , you are safe , Ready ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 21]: Mrs. Seagrave , overpowered by her feelings , sank her head upon William 's shoulder , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 28]: `` It was touch and go , William , '' observed Ready , as they walked up to the house , preceded by Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 12]: `` How much mischief may be created by a thoughtless boy !
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 20]: However , one ca n't put old heads on young shoulders , and so Tommy must be forgiven . ''
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 36]: `` He has been punished enough , as far as fright goes , '' replied William ; `` I 'll answer for it , he 'll never get into the boat again by himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 7]: `` No , I think not .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 70]: But now , William , you saw how nearly I was swamped in the boat ; indeed , it was only by his mercy that I was preserved ; but taking the question merely as far as our endeavours could help us , do you think that if you had gained the boat instead of me , you would have brought her to the beach as I did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 31]: `` No , Ready ; I never could have managed her so skilfully as you did , and therefore I must have been swamped before I got on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 39]: `` Well , William , as I am an old sailor and you are not , therefore it is not vanity which makes me say that you could not have managed the boat so well as I did .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 24]: Now , as I had not three or four seconds to spare , you , as you say , must have been swamped .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 21]: I mention this to prove to you that I was right in desiring your father to order you back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 30]: `` Certainly , Ready ; but Tommy is my brother , and I felt that it was more my duty than yours to risk my life for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 34]: `` A very proper feeling , William ; but you have other duties , which are , to look after your father and mother , and be a comfort and solace to them .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 8]: Your life is more valuable than mine .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 34]: I am an old man on the brink of the grave , and a year or two makes no difference , but your life is , I hope , of more consequence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 18]: That evening the prayers were more than usually solemn , and the thanksgivings more heartfelt and sincere .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 16]: Exhausted with the exciting scene of the day , they all retired early to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 68]: Chapter LIX When Tommy was questioned on the following morning as to his inducement to get into the boat , to their great surprise he replied , that he wanted to go round to the tents again , to see if the bananas were ripe ; that he intended to eat some of them and be back before dinner-time , that he might not be found out .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 28]: `` I suspect , Tommy , you would have been very hungry before you ate any bananas if we had not perceived you , '' said Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 15]: `` I wo n't go into the boat any more , '' said Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 49]: `` I rather think you will keep to that resolution , Tommy , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` however , I must leave your mother to point out to you the danger you were in yourself , and in which you placed others by your folly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 74]: The stockade was now almost finished ; the door was the occasion of a good deal of consultation ; at last , it was agreed that it would be better to have a door of stout oak plank , but with second door-posts inside , about a foot apart from the door , between which could be inserted short poles one above the other , so as to barricade it within when required .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 15]: This would make the door as strong as any other portion of the stockade .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 40]: As soon as this was all complete , the storehouse was to be altered for a dwelling-house , by taking away the wattles of cocoa-nut boughs on the sides , and filling them up with logs of cocoa-nut trees .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 28]: Before the week was ended the stockade and door were complete , and they now began to fell trees , to form the sides of the house .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 62]: This was rapid work ; and while Mr. Seagrave , William , and Juno felled the trees , and brought them on the wheels to the side of the stockade , all ready cut to their proper lengths , Ready was employed in flooring the house with a part of the deal planks which they had brought round from the cove .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 22]: But this week they were obliged to break off for two days , to collect all their crops from the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 31]: A fortnight more passed away in continual hard work , but the house was at last finished , and very complete , compared to the one they were residing in .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 61]: It was much larger , and divided into three rooms by the deal planking : the middle room which the door opened into was the sitting and eating room , with a window behind ; the two side rooms were sleeping-rooms , one for Mrs. Seagrave and the children , and the other for the male portion of the family .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 60]: `` See , William , '' said Ready , when they were alone , `` what we have been able to do by means of those deal planks ; why , to have floored this house , and run up the partitions , would have taken us half a year if we had had to saw the wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 16]: `` Yes ; and what a comfort it is to have so many shelves about .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 9]: When shall we shift into this house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 6]: `` The sooner the better .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 19]: We have plenty of work still to do , but we can work outside of the stockade . ''
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 14]: `` And what do you propose to do with the old house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 3]: said William .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 30]: `` We had better put some of our stores of least value in it for the present , until we can fit up another storehouse inside the stockade . ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 20]: `` Then we 'll put those casks in , for they take up a great deal of room . ''
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 14]: `` All but that large one , William ; we shall want that .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 10]: I shall fix it up in a corner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 7]: `` What for , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 7]: `` To put water in . ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 17]: `` But we are closer to the spring than we were at the other house . ''
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 29]: `` I know that ; but , perhaps , we may not be able to go out of the stockade , and then we shall want water . ''
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 12]: `` I understand , Ready ; how thoughtful you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 20]: `` If at my age I did not think a little , William , it would be very odd .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 18]: You do n't know how anxious I am to see them all inside of this defence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 12]: `` But why should we not come in , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 49]: `` Why , sir , as there is still plenty of work , I do not like to press the matter , lest your mamma should be fidgeted , and think there was danger ; but danger there is ; I have a kind of forewarning of it .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 34]: I wish you would propose that they should come in at once ; the standing-bed places are all ready , except the canvas , and I shall nail on new by to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 40]: In consequence of this conversation , William proposed at dinnertime that the next day they should go into the new house , as it was so much more handy to work there and live there at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 21]: Mr. Seagrave was of the same opinion , but Mrs. Seagrave thought it better that everything should be tidy first .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 26]: `` Why , ma'am , '' said Ready , `` the only way to get things tidy is to go yourself and make them so .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 17]: Nothing will ever be in its place unless you are there to put it in . ''
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 28]: `` Well , Ready , '' said Mrs. Seagrave , `` since you are against me as well as all the rest , I give it up .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 11]: and if you please we will shift over to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 30]: `` Indeed , ma'am , I think it will be better ; this is the last month of fine weather , and we shall have plenty to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 25]: `` Be it so , Ready ; you are the best judge ; to-morrow we will take up our quarters in the stockade . ''
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 5]: `` Thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 5]: muttered Ready very softly .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 28]: The next day was fully employed in changing their residence , and shifting over the bedding and utensils ; and that night they slept within the stockade .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 133]: Ready had run up a very neat little outhouse of plank , as a kitchen for Juno , and another week was fully employed as follows : the stores were divided ; those of least consequence , and the salt provisions , flour , and the garden produce , & c. , were put into the old house ; the casks of powder and most of the cartridges were also put there for security ; but a cask of beef , of pork , and flour , all the iron-work and nails , canvas , & c. , were stowed away for the present under the new house , which had , when built as a storehouse , been raised four feet from the ground to make a shelter for the stock .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 22]: This was very spacious , and , of course , quite dry , and contained all they wished to put in .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 31]: Ready also took care , by degrees , to fill the large water-butt full of water , and had fixed into the bottom a spigot for drawing the water off .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 34]: `` Well , Mr. Seagrave , '' said Ready on the Saturday , `` we have done a good many hard weeks ' work lately , but this is the last of them .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 34]: We are now comfortably settled in our new house : our stores are all under cover , and safe from the weather , and so we may now take things a little easier .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 27]: William and I must repair the boat , so that we may take a trip round to examine how the stock and yams get on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 12]: `` And the bananas and the guavas , '' said Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 16]: `` Why , we have quite forgotten all about them , '' observed Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 50]: `` Yes , ma am ; we have been so busy , that it is no wonder ; however , there may be some left yet , and I will go round as soon as the boat is able to swim , and bring all I can find . ''
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 17]: `` We must put our seeds and potatoes in before the rainy season , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 42]: `` It will be better , sir , if we can find time , as we shall not have much more fine weather now ; at all events , we can get them in at intervals when the weather is fine .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 9]: Now I shall go my rounds for turtle .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 9]: Good-night , ma'am , - good-night , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 5]: Come , William . ''
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 41]: William and Ready succeeded in turning six more turtles to add to their stock , and having taken a careful survey with the telescope , they came back , fastened the door of the stockade , and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 27]: Chapter LX Another week passed away , during which Ready repaired the boat , and William and Mr. Seagrave were employed in digging up the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 21]: It was also a very busy week at the house , as they had not washed linen for some time .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 39]: Mrs. Seagrave and Juno , and even little Caroline were hard at work , and Tommy was more useful than ever he had been , going for the water as they required it , and watching little Albert .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 22]: Indeed , he was so active , that Mrs. Seagrave praised him before his papa , and Tommy was quite proud .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 24]: On the Monday William and Ready set off in the boat to the little harbour , and found all the stock doing well .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 23]: Many of the bananas and guavas had ripened and withered , but there were enough left to fill the boat half full .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 46]: `` We can not do better than to leave the stock where it is at present , William ; they can run into the cocoa-nut grove for shelter if there is a storm , and there is feed enough for ten times as many . ''
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 15]: `` Yes ; but will you not dig up a few yams first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 9]: `` I had quite forgotten it , William .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 8]: I will go for the spade . ''
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 12]: Having procured the yams , they set off on their return .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 16]: Before they arrived at the bay , the sky clouded over and threatened a storm .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 25]: It did not , however , rain till after they had landed , when a small shower announced the commencement of the rainy season .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 20]: The fruit was very welcome to all of them , it was so long since they had tasted any .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 18]: The following day was beautifully fine , and everything appeared refreshed by the rain which had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 33]: It was , however , agreed , that Ready and William should go round the next morning , bring home the tents , and as many yams as the boat could carry .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 23]: William and Ready went out at night as usual , when Ready observed that the wind had chopped round to the eastward .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 15]: `` That will be bad for us to-morrow , Ready , '' replied William .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 21]: `` We may sail to the harbour , but we shall have to pull back with the loaded boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 31]: `` I trust it will be no worse than that , at all events , '' replied Ready ; `` but we must now return , and go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 17]: I shall be up by daylight , so you need not wake without you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 24]: `` I ca n't help waking , '' replied William , `` and I shall , therefore , be up with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 13]: `` Very well , I am always glad of your company . ''
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 27]: The next morning , just before the day dawned , Ready and William unfastened the door of the stockade , and went down to the beach .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 19]: The wind was still to the eastward , and blowing rather fresh , and the sky was cloudy .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 27]: As the sun rose , Ready , as usual , had his telescope with him , and looked through it at the offing to the eastward .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 35]: As he kept the spy-glass to his eye for some time without speaking , William said : `` Do you see anything , Ready , that you look so long in that direction ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 29]: `` Either my old eyes deceive me , or I fear that I do , '' replied Ready ; `` but a few minutes more will decide . ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 47]: There was a bank of clouds on the horizon to the eastward , but as soon as the sun had risen above them , Ready , who had the telescope fixed in the same direction , said : `` Yes , William , I am right .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 15]: I thought that those dark patches I saw there were brown grass sails . ''
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 8]: `` Sails of what , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 5]: said William , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 13]: `` Of the Indian canoes ; I knew that they would come .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 19]: Take the glass and look yourself ; my eye is quite dim from straining it so long . ''
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 19]: `` Yes , I have them now , '' replied William , with his eye to the glass .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 22]: At last he said : `` Why , there are twenty or thirty of them , Ready , at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 14]: `` And with twenty or thirty men in each too , William . ''
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 8]: `` What must we do , Ready ?
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 8]: How frightened my poor mother will be !
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 13]: I 'm afraid we can do nothing against such a number . ''
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 20]: `` Yes , William , we can do a great deal , and we must do a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 61]: That there are hundreds of savages there is no doubt ; but recollect that we have a stockade , which they can not easily climb over , and plenty of firearms and ammunition , so that we can make a good fight of it , and perhaps beat them off , for they have nothing but clubs and spears . ''
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 20]: `` How fast they come down , Ready ; why , they will be here in an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 17]: `` No , sir , nor in two hours either ; those are very large canoes .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 10]: However , there is no time to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 64]: While I watch them for a few minutes till I make them more clearly out , do you run up to the house and beckon your father to come down to me ; and then , William , get all the muskets ready , and bring the casks of powder , and of made-up cartridges , from the old house into the stockade .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 9]: Call Juno , and she will help you .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 9]: We shall have time enough to do everything .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 16]: After you have done that , you had better come down and join us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 19]: In a very few minutes after William ran up to the house , Mr. Seagrave made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 29]: `` Ready , there is danger , I 'm sure ; William would not tell me , I presume , because he was afraid of alarming his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 42]: `` It is , Mr. Seagrave , that the savages are now coming down upon us in large force ; perhaps five or six hundred of them ; and that we shall have to defend ourselves with might and main . ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 14]: `` Do you think we have any chance against such a force ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 36]: `` Yes , sir , with God 's help I have no doubt but that we shall beat them off ; but we must fight hard , and for some days , I fear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 11]: Mr. Seagrave examined the fleet of canoes with the glass .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 13]: `` It is , indeed , dreadful odds to contend against . ''
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 30]: `` Yes , sir , but three muskets behind a stockade are almost a match for all their clubs and spears , provided none of us are wounded . ''
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 43]: `` Well , Ready , we must put our trust in the Lord , and do our best ; I will second you to the utmost of my power , and William , I 'm sure , will do his duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 30]: `` I think , sir , '' said Ready , `` we had better not wait here any more , as we have not long to prepare for them .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 46]: We have only to fix up some of our strong deal planks on the inside of the stockade for us to stand upon when we are attacked , that we may see what the enemy is about , and be able to fire upon them .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 49]: But first we had better go to the old house , and take out what provisions and other articles we shall most want , and roll the casks into the stockade , for to the old house they will go first , and perhaps destroy everything in it .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 14]: The casks they certainly will , for the sake of the iron hoops .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 10]: An hour 's work will do a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 55]: I believe we have everything we want in the stockade ; Juno has her fuel , the large butt of water will last us two or three weeks at least , and if we have time , we will get the wheels down , and spear a couple of turtles for fresh provisions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 12]: These observations were made as they walked up to the house .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 20]: As soon as they arrived , they found William and Juno had just brought in the powder and cartridges .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 12]: Mr. Seagrave went in to break the matter to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 45]: `` I was told that I had to expect this , my dear , '' replied Mrs. Seagrave , `` so that it has not come upon me altogether unawares , and anything that a poor weak woman can do , I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 21]: `` I am indeed greatly relieved , '' said Mr. Seagrave , `` by finding you thus prepared and supported .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 15]: I shall feel no anxiety - but we have work to be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 22]: Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave then joined William , Beady , and Juno , who had already proceeded to the old house .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 23]: The children were all still in bed and asleep , so that there was no occasion for any one to watch them .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 40]: Chapter LXI As they could have a very good view of the canoes from where the old house stood , Ready examined them with his glass every time that he returned from rolling up a cask to the stockade .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 30]: Every one worked hard ; even Mrs. Seagrave did all she could , either assisting in rolling the casks , or carrying up what she was able to lift .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 28]: In an hour they had got into the stockade all that they most cared for , and the canoes were still about six or seven miles off .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 39]: `` We have a good hour before they arrive , sir , '' said Ready , `` and even then the reefs will puzzle them not a little ; I doubt if they are disembarked under two hours .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 12]: We have plenty of time for all we wish to do .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 28]: Juno , go for the wheels , and William , come down with the spear , and we will have some of the turtle into the stockade .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 35]: Mr. Seagrave , I do not require your assistance , so if you will have the kindness to get out the muskets , and examine the flints , it will be as well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 16]: `` Yes ; and then you have to load them , '' replied Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 19]: `` Juno and I can do that at all events , ready for you to fire them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 11]: `` An excellent idea , madam , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 23]: In half an hour six turtles were brought up by Juno and William , and then Ready followed them into the stockade .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 47]: They then rolled the casks , and upheaded them by the sides of the stockade , and fixed up deal planks to stand upon , just high enough to enable them to see over the top of the palisades , and to fire at the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 19]: Mrs. Seagrave had been shown how to load a musket , and Juno was now taught the same .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 34]: `` Now , sir , we are all prepared , '' said Ready , `` and Madam and Juno can go and look a little after the children , and get breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 40]: As soon as the children were dressed , Mr. Seagrave called Ready , who was outside , watching the canoes , and they went to their morning devotions , and prayed heartily for succour in this time of need .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 21]: They then breakfasted in haste ; for , as may be supposed , they were almost too anxious to eat .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 13]: `` This suspense is worse than all , '' said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 10]: `` I wish now that they were come . ''
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 14]: `` Shall I go to Ready and hear his report , my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 10]: - I will not be away three minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 61]: In a short time Mr. Seagrave returned , saying that the canoes were close to the beach , that the savages evidently had a knowledge of the passages through the reefs , as they had steered right in , and had lowered their sails ; that Ready and William were on the look-out , but concealed behind the cocoa-nut trees .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 12]: `` I hope they will not stay out too long . ''
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 23]: `` No fear of that , my dear Selina ; but they had better watch their motions to the last minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 57]: During this conversation between Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave within the stockade , William and Ready were watching the motions of the savages , a large portion of whom had landed out of ten of the canoes , and the others were following their example as fast as they could , forcing their way through the reefs .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 28]: The savages were all painted , with their war-cloaks and feathers on , and armed with spears and clubs , evidently having come with no peaceable intentions .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 42]: William , who had taken the telescope to examine them more minutely , said to Ready , `` What a fierce , cruel set of wretches they appear to be ; if they overpower us they will certainly kill us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 23]: `` Of that there is no doubt , William ; but we must fight hard , and not let them overpower us .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 27]: Kill us they certainly will , and I am not sure that they may not eat us afterwards ; but that is of little consequence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 36]: William replied in a determined tone , `` I 'll fight as long as I have breath in my body ; but , Ready , they are coming up as fast as they can . ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 9]: `` Yes ; we must wait no longer .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 5]: Come , William . ''
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 26]: `` I thought I saw another vessel under sail , out away by the garden point , Ready , just as we turned away . ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 18]: `` Very likely , sir , a canoe which has separated from the others during the night .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 13]: Come , quick , William , they have begun to yell . ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 37]: Another half-minute , and they arrived at the door of the stockade ; they entered , shut the door , and then barricaded it with the cocoa-nut poles which they had fitted to the inner door-posts .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 41]: Chapter LXII The loud yells of the savages struck terror into the heart of Mrs. Seagrave ; it was well that she had not seen their painted bodies and fierce appearance , or she would have been much more alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 41]: Little Albert and Caroline clung around her neck with terror in their faces ; they did not cry , but looked round and round to see from whence the horrid noise proceeded , and then clung faster to their mother .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 37]: Tommy was very busy , finishing all the breakfast which had been left , for there was no one to check him as usual ; Juno was busy outside , and was very active and courageous .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 40]: Mr. Seagrave had been employed making the holes between the palisades large enough to admit the barrels of the muskets , so that they could fire at the savages without being exposed ; while William and Ready , with .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 12]: their muskets loaded , were on the look-out for their approach .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 27]: `` They are busy with the old house just now , sir , '' observed Ready , `` but that wo n't detain them long . ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 40]: `` Here they come , '' replied William ; `` and look , Ready , is not that one of the women who escaped from us in the canoe , who is walking along with the first two men ?
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 10]: Yes , it is , I am sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 13]: `` You are right , William , it is one of them .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 52]: they have stopped ; they did not expect the stockade , that is clear , and it has puzzled them ; see how they are all crowding together and talking ; they are holding a council of war how to proceed ; that tall man must be one of their chiefs .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 50]: Now , William , although I intend to fight as hard as I can , yet I always feel a dislike to begin first ; I shall therefore show myself over the palisades , and if they attack me , I shall then fire with a quiet conscience . ''
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 13]: `` But take care they do n't hit you , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 9]: `` No great fear of that , William .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 5]: Here they come . ''
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 56]: Ready now stood upon the plank within , so as to show himself to the savages , who gave a tremendous yell , and as they advanced a dozen spears were thrown at him with so true an aim that , had he not instantly dodged behind the stockade , he must have been killed .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 34]: Three or four spears remained quivering in the palisades , just below the top ; the others went over it , and fell down inside of the stockade , at the further end .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 56]: `` Now , William , take good aim ; '' but before William could fire , Mr. Seagrave , who had agreed to be stationed at the corner so that he might see if the savages went round to the other side , fired his musket , and the tall chief fell to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 23]: Ready and William also fired , and two more of the savages were seen to drop amidst the yells of their companions .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 62]: Juno handed up the other muskets which were ready loaded , and took those discharged , and Mrs. Seagrave , having desired Caroline to take care of her little brother , and Tommy to be very quiet and good , came out , turned the key of the door upon them , and hastened to assist Juno in reloading the muskets .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 33]: The spears now rushed through the air , and it was well that they could fire from the stockade without exposing their persons , or they would have had but little chance .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 60]: The yells increased , and the savages now began to attack on every quarter ; the most active , who climbed like cats , actually succeeded in gaining the top of the palisades , but , as soon as their heads appeared above , they were fired at with so true an aim that they dropped down dead outside .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 37]: This combat lasted for more than an hour , when the savages , having lost a great many men , drew off from the assault , and the parties within the stockade had time to breathe .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 44]: `` They have not gained much in this bout , at all events , '' said Ready ; `` it was well fought on our side , and William , you certainly behaved as if you had been brought up to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 11]: `` Do you think they will go away now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 4]: said Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 21]: `` Oh , no , madam , not yet ; they will try us every way before they leave us .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 28]: You see these are very brave men , and it is clear that they know what gunpowder is , or they would have been more astonished . ''
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 33]: `` I should think so too , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` the first time that savages hear the report of firearms , they are usually thrown into great consternation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 34]: `` Yes , sir ; but such has not been the case with these people , and therefore I reckon it is not the first time that they have fought with Europeans . ''
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 9]: `` Are they all gone , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 14]: said William , who had come down from the plank to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 28]: `` No ; I see them between the trees now ; they are sitting round in a circle , and , I suppose , making speeches . ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 26]: `` Well , I 'm very thirsty , at all events , '' said William ; `` Juno , bring me a little water . ''
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 24]: Juno went to the water-tub to comply with William 's request , and in a few moments afterwards came back in great consternation .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 5]: `` Oh , Massa !
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 4]: oh , Missy !
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 8]: no water ; water all gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 6]: `` Water all gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 10]: cried Ready and all of them in a breath .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 12]: `` Yes ; not one little drop in the cask . ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 10]: `` I filled it up to the top ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 25]: exclaimed Ready very gravely ; `` the tub did not leak , that I am sure of ; how can this have happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 39]: `` Missy , I tink I know now , '' said Juno ; `` you remember you send Massa Tommy , the two or three days we wash , to fetch water from the well in little bucket .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 30]: You know how soon be come back , and how you say what good boy he was , and how you tell Massa Seagrave when he come to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 32]: Now , Missy , I quite certain Massa Tommy no take trouble go to well , but fetch water from tub all the while , and so he empty it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 15]: `` I 'm afraid you 're right , Juno , '' replied Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 7]: `` What shall we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 16]: `` I go speak Massa Tommy , '' said Juno , running to the house .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 16]: `` This is a very awkward thing , Mr. Seagrave , '' observed Ready gravely .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 6]: Mr. Seagrave shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 48]: The fact was , that they all perceived the danger of their position : if the savages did not leave the island , they would perish of thirst or have to surrender ; and in the latter case , all their lives would most certainly be sacrificed .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 11]: Juno now returned : her suspicions were but too true .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 30]: Tommy , pleased with the praise of being so quick in bringing the water , had taken out the spigot of the cask , and drawn it all off .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 41]: `` Well , '' observed Mr. Seagrave , `` it is the will of Heaven that all our careful arrangements and preparations against this attack should be defeated by the idleness of a child , and we must submit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 30]: `` Very true , sir , '' replied Ready ; `` all our hopes now are that the savages may be tired out , and leave the island . ''
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 42]: `` If I had but a little for the children , I should not care , '' observed Mrs. Seagrave ; `` but to see those poor things suffer - is there not a drop left , Juno , anywhere ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 5]: Juno shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 19]: Mrs. Seagrave said she would go and examine , and went away into the house accompanied by Juno .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 15]: `` This is a very bad business , Ready , '' observed Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 21]: `` What would we give for a shower of rain now , that we might catch the falling drops ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 32]: `` There are no signs of it , sir , '' replied Ready ; `` we must , however , put our confidence in One who will not forsake us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 30]: `` I wish the savages would come on again , '' observed William ; `` for the sooner they come , the sooner the affair will be decided . ''
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 16]: `` I doubt if they will to-day ; at night-time I think it very probable .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 8]: We must make preparations for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 11]: `` Why , what can we do , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 40]: `` In the first place , sir , by nailing planks from cocoa-nut tree to cocoa-nut tree above the present stockade , we may make a great portion of it much higher , and more difficult to climb over .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 10]: Some of them were nearly in , this time .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 45]: If we do that , we shall not have so large a space to watch over and defend ; and then we must contrive to have a large fire ready for lighting , that we may not have to fight altogether in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 35]: It will give them some advantage in looking through the palisades , and seeing where we are , but they can not well drive their spears through , so it is no great matter .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 42]: We must make the fire in the centre of the stockade , and have plenty of tar in it , to make it burn bright , and we must not , of course , light it until after we are attacked .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 21]: We shall then see where they are trying for an entrance , and where to aim with our muskets . ''
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 38]: `` The idea is very good , Ready , '' said Mr. Seagrave ; `` if it had not been for this unfortunate want of water , I really should be sanguine of beating them off . ''
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 26]: `` We may suffer very much , Mr. Seagrave , I have no doubt ; but who knows what the morrow may bring forth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 5]: `` True , Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 8]: Do you see the savages now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 16]: `` No , sir ; they have left the spot where they were in consultation .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 13]: I suppose they are busy with their wounded and their dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 94]: As Ready had supposed , no further attack was made by the savages on that day , and he , William , and Mr. Seagrave , were very busy making their arrangements ; they nailed the planks on the trunks of the trees above the stockade , so as to make three sides of the stockade at least five feet higher , and almost impossible to climb up ; and they prepared a large fire in a tar-barrel full of cocoa-nut leaves mixed with wood and tar , so as to burn fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 42]: Dinner or supper they had none , for there was nothing but salt pork and beef and live turtle , and , by Ready 's advice , they did not eat , as it would only increase their desire to drink .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 19]: The poor children suffered much ; and little Albert wailed and cried for `` water , water . ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 65]: Ready remained on the look-out ; indeed , everything was so miserable inside of the house , that they were all glad to go out of it ; they could do no good , and poor Mrs. Seagrave had a difficult and most painful task to keep the children quiet under such severe privation , for the weather was still very warm and sultry .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 35]: Chapter LXIII But the moaning of the children was very soon after dusk drowned by the yells of the savages , who , as Ready had prognosticated , now advanced to the night attack .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 45]: Every part of the stockade was at once assailed , and their attempts now made were to climb into it ; a few spears were occasionally thrown , but it was evident that the object was to obtain an entrance by dint of numbers .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 86]: It was well that Ready had taken the precaution of nailing the deal planks above the original stockade , or there is little doubt but that the savages would have gained their object ; as it was , before the flames of the fire , which Juno had lighted by Ready 's order , gave them sufficient light , three or four savages had climbed up and had been shot by William and Mr. Seagrave , as they were on the top of the stockade .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 27]: When the fire burnt brightly , the savages outside were more easily aimed at , and a great many fell in their attempts to get over .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 37]: The attack continued more than an hour , when at last , satisfied that they could not succeed , the savages once more withdrew , carrying with them , as before , their dead and wounded .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 19]: `` I trust that they will now re-embark , and leave the island , '' said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 22]: `` I only wish they may , sir ; it is not at all impossible ; but there is no saying .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 22]: I have been thinking , Mr. Seagrave , that we might be able to ascertain their movements by making a look-out .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 78]: You see , sir , that cocoa-nut tree , '' continued Ready , pointing to one of those to which the palisades were fastened , `` is much taller than any of the others : now , by driving spike-nails into the trunk at about a foot apart , we might ascend it with ease , and it would command a view of the whole bay ; we then could know what the enemy were about . ''
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 22]: `` Yes , that is very true ; but will not anyone be very much exposed if he climbs up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 57]: `` No , sir ; for you see the cocoa-nut trees are cut down clear of the palisades to such a distance , that no savage could come at all near without being seen by anyone on the look-out , and giving us sufficient time to get down again before he could use his spear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 39]: `` I believe that you are right there , Ready ; but at all events I would not attempt to do it before daylight , as there may be some of them still lurking underneath the stockade . ''
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 18]: `` Certainly there may be , sir , and therefore until daylight we will not begin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 27]: Mr. Seagrave then went into the house ; Ready desired William to lie down and sleep for two or three hours , as he would watch .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 18]: In the morning , when Mr Seagrave came out , he would have a little sleep himself .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 8]: `` I ca n't sleep , Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 10]: I 'm mad with thirst , '' replied William .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 25]: `` Yes , sir ; it 's very painful - I feel it myself very much , but what must those poor children feel ?
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 6]: I pity them most . ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 34]: `` I pity my mother most , Ready , '' replied William ; `` it must be agony to her to witness their sufferings , and not be able to relieve them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 36]: `` Yes , indeed , it must be terrible , William , to a mother 's feelings ; but perhaps these savages will be off to-morrow , and then we shall forget our privations . ''
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 18]: `` I trust in God that they may , Ready , but they seem very determined . ''
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 22]: `` Yes , sir ; iron is gold to them , and what will civilized men not do for gold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 12]: In the meantime , Mr. Seagrave had gone into the house .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 30]: He found the children still crying for water , notwithstanding the coaxing and soothing of Mrs. Seagrave , who was shedding tears as she hung over poor little Albert .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 9]: Little Caroline only drooped , and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 42]: Mr. Seagrave remained for two or three hours with his wife , assisting her in pacifying the children , and soothing her to the utmost of his power ; at last he went out and found old Ready on the watch .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 42]: `` Ready , I had rather a hundred times be attacked by these savages and have to defend this place , than be in that house for even five minutes , and witness the sufferings of my wife and children . ''
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 44]: `` I do not doubt it , sir , '' replied Ready ; `` but cheer up , and let us hope for the best ; I think it very probable that the savages after this second defeat will leave the island . ''
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 29]: `` I wish I could think so , Ready ; it would make me very happy ; but I have come out to take the watch , Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 9]: Will you not sleep for a while ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 15]: `` I will , sir , if you please , take a little sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 28]: Call me in two hours ; it will then be daylight , and I can go to work , and you can get some repose yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 16]: `` I am too anxious to sleep ; I think so , at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 24]: `` William said he was too thirsty to sleep , sir , but , poor fellow , he is now fast enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 12]: `` I trust that boy will be spared , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 18]: `` I hope so too ; but we are all in the hands of the Almighty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 31]: Mr. Seagrave took his station on the plank , and was left to his own reflections ; that they were not of the most pleasant kind may easily be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 57]: He prayed earnestly and fervently that they might be delivered from the danger and sufferings which threatened them , and became calm and tranquil ; prepared for the worst , if the worst was to happen , and confidently placing himself and his family under the care of him who orders all as he thinks best .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 37]: At daylight Ready woke up and relieved Mr. Seagrave , who did not return to the house , but lay down on the cocoa-nut boughs , where Ready had been lying by the side of William .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 46]: As soon as Ready had got out the spike-nails and hammer , he summoned William to his assistance , and they commenced driving them into the cocoa-nut tree , one looking out in case of the savages approaching , while the other was at work .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 33]: In less than an hour they had gained the top of the tree close to the boughs , and had a very commanding view of the bay , as well as inland .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 21]: William , who was driving the last dozen spikes , took a survey , and then came down to Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 55]: `` I can see everything , Ready : they have pulled down the old house altogether , and are most of them lying down outside , covered up with their war-cloaks ; some women are walking to and fro from the canoes , which are lying on the beach where they first landed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 22]: `` They have pulled down the house to obtain the iron nails , I have no doubt , '' replied Ready .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 10]: `` Did you see any of their dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 19]: `` No ; I did not look about very much , but I will go up again directly .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 20]: I came down because my hands were jarred with hammering , and the hammer was so heavy to carry .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 12]: In a minute or two I shall go up light enough .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 16]: My lips are burning , Ready , and swelled ; the skin is peeling off .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 14]: I had no idea that want of water would have been so dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 21]: I was in hopes of finding a cocoa-nut or two on the tree , but there was not one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 24]: `` And if you had found one , it would not have had any milk in it at this season of the year .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 18]: However , William , if the savages do not go away to-day , something must be done .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 19]: I wish now that you would go up again , and see if they are not stirring . ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 37]: William again mounted to the top of the tree , and remained up for some minutes ; when he came down , he said , `` They are all up now , and swarming like bees .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 54]: I counted 260 of the men in their war-cloaks and feather head-dresses ; the women are passing to and fro from the well with water ; there is nobody at the canoes except eight or ten women , who are beating their heads , I think , or doing something of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 18]: I could not make it out well , but they seem all doing the same thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 21]: `` I know what they are about , William : they are cutting themselves with knives or other sharp instruments .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 8]: It is the custom of these people .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 31]: The dead are all put into the canoes , and these women are lamenting over them ; perhaps they are going away , since the dead are in the canoes .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 7]: but there is no saying . ''
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 21]: Chapter LXIV The second day was passed in keeping a look-out upon the savages , and awaiting a fresh attack .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 50]: They could perceive from the top of the cocoa-nut tree that the savages held a council of war in the forenoon , sitting round in a large circle , while one got up in the centre and made a speech , flourishing his club and spear while he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 33]: In the afternoon the council broke up , and the savages were observed to be very busy in all directions , cutting down the cocoa-nut trees , and collecting all the brushwood .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 18]: Ready watched them for a long while , and at last came down a little before sunset .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 96]: `` Mr. Seagrave , '' said he , `` we shall have , in my opinion , no attack this night , but to-morrow we must expect something very serious ; the savages are cutting down the trees , and making large faggots ; they do not get on very fast , because their hatchets are made of stone and do n't cut very well , but perseverance and numbers will effect everything , and I dare say that they will work all night till they have obtained as many faggots as they want . ''
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 24]: `` But what do you imagine to be their object , Ready , in cutting down trees , and making the faggots ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 43]: `` Either , sir , to pile them up outside the palisades , so large as to be able to walk up upon them , or else to pile them up to set fire to them , and burn us out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 9]: `` Do you think they will succeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 30]: `` Not without very heavy loss ; perhaps we may best them off , but it will be a hard fight ; harder than any we have had yet .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 21]: We must have the women to load the muskets , so that we may fire as fast as we can .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 20]: I should not think much of their attempt to burn us , if it were not for the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 50]: Cocoa-nut wood , especially with the bark on , as our palisades have , will char a long while , but not burn easily when standing upright ; and the fire , when the faggots are kindled , although it will be fierce , will not last long . ''
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 33]: `` But suffering as we are now , Ready , for want of water , how can we possibly keep up our strength to meet them in a suffocating smoke and flame ?
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 8]: we must drop with sheer exhaustion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 65]: `` We must hope for the best , and do our best , Mr. Seagrave , '' replied Ready ; `` and recollect that should anything happen to me during the conflict , and if there is any chance of your being overpowered , you must take advantage of the smoke to escape into the woods , and find your way to the tents .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 47]: I have no doubt that you will be able to do that ; of course the attack will be to windward if they use fire , and you must try and escape to leeward ; I have shown William how to force a palisade if necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 37]: The savages , if they get possession , will not think of looking for you at first , and , perhaps , when they have obtained all that the house contains , not even afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 15]: `` Why do you say if any accident happens to you , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 3]: said William .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 37]: `` Because , William , if they place the faggots so as to be able to walk to the top of the palisades , I may be wounded or killed , and so may you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 27]: `` Of course , '' replied William ; `` but they are not in yet , and they shall have a hard fight for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 19]: Ready then told Mr. Seagrave that he would keep the watch , and call him at twelve o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 37]: During these two days , they had eaten very little ; a turtle had been killed , and pieces fried , but eating only added to their thirst , and even the children refused the meat .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 15]: The sufferings were now really dreadful , and poor Mrs. Seagrave was almost frantic .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 26]: As soon as Mr. Seagrave had gone into the house , Ready called William , and said , `` William , water we must have .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 42]: I can not bear to see the agony of the poor children , and the state of mind which your poor mother is in ; and more , without water we never shall be able to beat off the savages to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 15]: We shall literally die of choking in the smoke , if they use fire .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 23]: Now , William , I intend to take one of the seven-gallon barricos , and go down to the well for water .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 26]: I may succeed , and I may not , but attempt it I must , and if I fall it can not be helped . ''
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 10]: `` Why not let me go , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 3]: replied William .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 31]: `` For many reasons , William , '' said Ready ; `` and the chief one is that I do not think you would succeed so well as I shall .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 54]: I shall put on the war-cloak and feathers of the savage who fell dead inside of the stockade , and that will be a disguise , but I shall take no arms except his spear , as they would only be in my way , and increase the weight I have to carry .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 52]: Now observe , you must let me out of the door , and when I am out , in case of accident put one of the poles across it inside ; that will keep the door fast , if they attack it , until you can secure it with the others .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 13]: Watch my return , and be all ready to let me in .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 6]: Do you understand me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 35]: `` Yes , perfectly , Ready ; but I am now , I must confess , really frightened ; if anything was to happen to you , what a misery it would be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 10]: `` There is no help for it , William .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 57]: Water must , if possible , be procured , and now is a better time to make the attempt than later , when they may be more on the watch ; they have left off their work , and are busy eating ; if I meet any one , it will only be a woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 19]: Ready went for the barrico , a little cask , which held six or seven gallons of water .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 75]: He put on the head-dress and war-cloak of the savage ; and , taking the barrico on his shoulder , and the spear in his hand , the poles which barred the door were softly removed by William , and after ascertaining that no one was concealed beneath the palisades , Ready pressed William 's hand , and set off across the cleared space outside of the stockade , and gained the cocoa-nut trees .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 25]: William , as directed , closed the door , passed one pole through the inner door-posts for security , and remained on the watch .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 47]: He was in an awful state of suspense , listening to the slightest noise , even the slight rustling by the wind of the cocoa-nut boughs above him made him start ; there he continued for some minutes , his gun ready cocked by his side .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 25]: It is time that he returned , thought William ; the distance is not 100 yards , and yet I have heard no noise .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 11]: At last he thought he heard footsteps coming very softly .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 6]: Yes , it was so .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 9]: Ready was returning , and without any accident .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 32]: William had his hand upon the pole , to slip it on one side and open the door , when he beard a scuffle and a fall close to the door .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 18]: He immediately threw down the pole , and opened it just as Ready called him by name .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 29]: William seized his musket and sprang out ; he found Ready struggling with a savage , who was uppermost , and with his spear at Ready 's breast .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 14]: In a second William levelled and fired , and the savage fell dead .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 17]: `` Take the water in quick , William , '' said Ready in a faint voice .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 12]: `` I will contrive to crawl in if I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 25]: William caught up the barrico of water , and took it in ; he then hastened to Ready , who was on his knees .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 60]: Mr. Seagrave , hearing the musket fired , had run out , and finding the stockade door open , followed William , and seeing him endeavouring to support Ready , caught hold of his other arm , and they led him tottering into the stockade ; the door was then immediately secured , and they went to his assistance .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 8]: `` Are you hurt , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 3]: said William .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 22]: `` Yes , dear boy , yes ; hurt to death , I fear : his spear went through my breast .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 7]: Water , quick , water ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 3]: `` Alas !
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 10]: that we had some , '' said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 19]: `` We have , papa , '' replied William ; `` but it has cost us dearly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 31]: William ran for a pannikin , and taking out the bung , poured some water out of the barrico and gave it to Ready , who drank it with eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 35]: `` Now , William , lay me down on these cocoa-nut boughs ; go and give some water to the others , and when you have all drunk , then come to me again .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 10]: Do n't tell Mrs. Seagrave that I 'm hurt .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 8]: Do as I beg of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 22]: `` Papa , take the water - do pray , '' replied William ; `` I can not leave Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 19]: `` I will , my boy , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` but first drink yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 50]: William , who was very faint , drank off the pannikin of water , which immediately revived him , and then , while Mr. Seagrave hastened with some water to the children and women , occupied himself with old Ready , who breathed heavily , but did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 42]: Chapter LXV After returning twice for water , to satisfy those in the house , Mr. Seagrave came to the assistance of William , who had been removing Ready 's clothes to ascertain the nature of the wound he had received .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 25]: `` We had better move him to where the other cocoa-nut boughs lie ; he will be more comfortable there , '' said William .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 8]: Ready whispered , `` More water . ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 24]: William gave him some more and then , with the assistance of his father , Ready was removed to a more comfortable place .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 22]: As soon as they laid him there , Ready turned on his side , and threw up a quantity of blood .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 35]: `` I am better now , '' said he in a low voice ; `` bind up the wound , William ; an old man like me has not much blood to spare . ''
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 18]: Mr. Seagrave and William then examined the wound ; the spear had gone deep into the lungs .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 27]: William threw off his shirt , tore it up into strips , and then bound up the wound so as to stop the effusion of blood .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 36]: Ready , who at first appeared much exhausted with being moved about , gradually recovered so as to be able to speak in a low voice , when Mrs. Seagrave came out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 10]: `` Where is that brave , kind man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 14]: cried she , `` that I may bless him and thank him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 13]: Mr. Seagrave went to her , and caught her by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 13]: `` He is hurt , my dear ; and very much hurt .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 10]: I did not tell you at the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 17]: Mr. Seagrave related what had occurred , and then led her to where Ready was lying .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 16]: Mrs. Seagrave knelt by his side , took his hand , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 34]: `` Do n't weep for me , '' said Ready ; `` my days have been numbered ; I 'm only sorry that I can not any more be useful to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 49]: `` Dear good man , '' said Mrs. Seagrave , `` whatever may be our fates , and that is for the Almighty to decide for us , as long as I have life , what you have done for me and mine shall never be forgotten . ''
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 20]: Mrs. Seagrave then bent over him , and kissing his forehead , rose and retired weeping into the house .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 25]: `` William , '' said Ready , `` I ca n't talk now ; raise my head a little , and then leave me .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 7]: You have not looked round lately .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 8]: Come again in about half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 18]: Leave me now , Mr. Seagrave ; I shall be better if I doze a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 26]: They complied with Ready 's request ; went up to the planks , and examined carefully all round the stockade ; at last they stopped .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 14]: `` This is a sad business , William , '' said Mr. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 5]: William shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 18]: `` He would not let me go , '' replied he ; `` I wish he had .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 9]: I fear that he is much hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 12]: `` I should say that he can not recover , William .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 11]: We shall miss him to-morrow if they attack us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 36]: `` I hardly know what to say , papa ; but I feel that since we have been relieved , I am able to do twice as much as I could have done before . ''
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 23]: `` I feel the same , but still with such a force against us , two people can not do much . ''
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 48]: `` If my mother and Juno load the muskets for us , '' replied William , `` we shall at all events do as much now as we should have been able to do if there were three , so exhausted as we should have been . ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 28]: `` Perhaps so ; at all events we will do our best , for we fight for our lives and for those most dear to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 27]: William went softly up to Ready , and found that he was dozing ; he therefore did not disturb him , but returned to his father .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 16]: Now that their thirst had been appeased , they all felt the calls of hunger .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 38]: Juno and William went and cut off steaks from the turtle , and fried them ; they all made a hearty meal , and perhaps never had they taken one with so much relish in their lives .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 25]: It was nearly daylight , when William , who had several times been softly up to Ready , found him with his eyes open .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 10]: `` How do you find yourself , Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 3]: said William .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 27]: `` I am quiet and easy , William , and without much pain ; but I think I am sinking , and shall not last long .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 26]: Recollect that if you are obliged to escape from the stockade , you take no heed of me , but leave me where I am .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 20]: I can not live , and were you to move me , I should only die the sooner . ''
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 15]: `` I had rather die with you , than leave you , Ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 30]: `` No , that is wrong ; you must save your mother , and your brothers and sister ; promise me that you will do as I wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 3]: William hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 11]: `` I point out to you your duty , William .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 29]: I know what your feelings are , but you must not give way to them ; promise me this , or you will make me very miserable . ''
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 14]: William squeezed Ready 's hand ; his heart was too full to speak .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 49]: `` They will come at daylight , William ; you have not much time to spare ; climb to the look-out , and wait there till day dawns ; watch them as long as you can , and then come and tell me what you have seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 13]: Ready 's voice became faint after this exertion of speaking so much .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 14]: William immediately climbed up the cocoa-nut tree , and waited there till daylight .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 43]: At the dawn of day , he perceived that the savages were at work , that they had collected all the faggots together opposite to where the old house had stood , and were very busy in making arrangements for the attack .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 32]: At last , every one shouldered a faggot , and commenced their advance towards the stockade ; William immediately descended and called his father , who was talking with Mrs. Seagrave .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 28]: The muskets were all loaded , and Mrs. Seagrave and Juno took their posts below the planking , to reload them as fast as they were fired .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 36]: `` We must fire upon them as soon as we are sure of not missing , William , '' said Mr. Seagrave , `` for the more we check their advance , the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 69]: When the first savages were within fifty yards , they both fired , and two of the men dropped ; they continued to fire as their assailants came up , with great success for the first ten minutes ; after which the savages advanced in a larger body , and took the precaution to hold the faggots in front of them , for some protection as they approached .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 16]: By these means they gained the stockade in safety , and commenced laying their faggots .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 22]: Mr. Seagrave and William still kept up an incessant fire upon them , but not with so much success as before .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 60]: Although many fell , the faggots were gradually heaped up , till they almost reached to the holes between the palisades , through which they pointed their muskets ; and as the savages contrived to slope them down from the stockade to the ground , it was evident that they meant to mount up and take them by escalade .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 30]: At last , it appeared as if all the faggots had been placed , and the savages retired farther back , to where the cocoa-nut trees were still standing .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 30]: `` They have gone away , father , '' said William ; `` but they will come again , and I fear it is all over with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 37]: `` I fear so too , my boy , '' replied Mr. Seagrave ; `` they are only retreating to arrange for a general assault , and they now will be able to gain an entrance .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 31]: I almost wish that they had fired the faggots ; we might have escaped as Ready pointed out to us , but now I fear we have no chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 36]: `` Do n't say a word to my mother , '' said William ; `` let us defend ourselves to the last , and if we are overpowered it is the will of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 31]: `` I should like to take a farewell embrace of your dear mother , '' said Mr. Seagrave ; `` but , no ; it will be weakness just now .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 10]: Here they come , William , in a swarm .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 21]: Well , God bless you , my boy ; we shall all , I trust , meet in Heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 39]: The whole body of savages were now advancing from the cocoa-nut wood in a solid mass ; they raised a yell , which struck terror into the hearts of Mrs. Seagrave and Juno , yet they flinched not .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 96]: The savages were again within fifty yards of them , when the fire was opened upon them ; the fire was answered by loud yells , and the savages had already reached to the bottom of the sloping pile of faggots , when the yells and the reports of the muskets were drowned by a much louder report , followed by the crackling and breaking of the cocoa-nut trees , which made both parties start with surprise ; another and another followed , the ground was ploughed up , and the savages fell in numbers .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 26]: `` It must be the cannon of a ship , father , '' said William ; `` we are saved - we are saved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 17]: `` It can be nothing else ; we are saved , and by a miracle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 7]: replied Mr. Seagrave in utter astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 64]: The savages paused in the advance , quite stupefied ; again , again , again , the report of the loud guns boomed through the air , and the round-shot and grape came whizzing and tearing through the cocoa-nut grove ; at this last broadside , the savages turned , and fled towards their canoes : not one was left to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 6]: `` We are saved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 31]: cried Mr. Seagrave , leaping off the plank and embracing his wife , who sank down on her knees , and held up her clasped hands in thankfulness to Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 84]: William had hastened up to the look-out on the cocoa-nut tree , and now cried out to them below , as the guns were again discharged : `` A large schooner , father ; she is firing at the savages , who are at the canoes ; they are falling in every direction : some have plunged into the water ; there is a boat full of armed men coming on shore ; they are close to the beach , by the garden-point .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 41]: Three of the canoes have got off full of men ; there go the guns again ; two of the canoes are sunk , father ; the boat has landed , and the people are coming up this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 12]: William then descended from the look-out as fast as he could .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 16]: As soon as he was down , he commenced unbarring the door of the stockade .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 17]: He pulled out the last pole just as he heard the feet of their deliverers outside .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 21]: He threw open the door , and , a second after , found himself in the arms of Captain Osborn .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 35]: Chapter LXVI Before we wind up this history , it will be as well to state to my young readers how it was that Captain Osborn made his appearance at so fortunate a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 35]: It will be recollected how a brig came off the island some months before this , and the great disappointment that the party on the island experienced in her not making her appearance again .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 81]: The fact was , that those on board of the brig had not only seen their signals , but had read the name of the `` Pacific '' upon the flag hoisted ; but the heavy gale which came on drove them so far to the southward , that the master of the brig did not consider that he should do his duty to his owners , if he lost so much time in beating up for the island again .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 17]: He therefore decided upon making all sail for Sydney , to which port he was bound .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 64]: When Captain Osborn was put into the boat by Mackintosh and the seamen of the Pacific , he was still insensible ; but he gradually recovered , and after a stormy night , Captain Osborn was so far recovered as to hear from Mackintosh what had taken place , and why it was that he found himself in an open boat at sea .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 32]: The next morning the wind moderated , and they were fortunate enough to fall in with a vessel bound to Van Diemen 's Land , which took them all on board .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 42]: From the account given by Mackintosh , Captain Osborn had no doubt in his mind but that the Seagrave family had perished , and the loss of the vessel , with them on board , was duly reported to the owners .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 55]: When at Van Diemen 's Land , Captain Osborn was so much taken with the beauty and fertility of the country , and perhaps not so well inclined to go to sea again after such danger as he had incurred in the last voyage , that he resolved to purchase land and settle there .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 71]: He did so , and had already stocked his farm with cattle , and had gone round to Sydney in a schooner to await the arrival of a large order from England which he had sent for , when the brig arrived and reported the existence of some white people on the small island , and also that they had hoisted a flag with the name Pacific worked on it .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 18]: Captain Osborn , hearing this , went to the master of the brig , and questioned him .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 41]: He found the latitude and longitude of the island to be not far from that of the ship when she was deserted , and he was now convinced that , by some miracle , the Seagrave family had been preserved .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 51]: He therefore went to the Governor of New South Wales , and made him acquainted with the facts which had been established , and the Governor instantly replied , that the government armed schooner was at his service , if he would himself go in quest of his former shipmates .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 29]: Inconvenient as the absence at that time was to Captain Osborn , he at once acquiesced , and in a few days the schooner sailed for her destination .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 70]: She arrived off the island on the same morning that the fleet of canoes with the savages effected their landing , and when William made the remark to Ready as they were hastening into the stockade , that there was another vessel under sail off the garden-point , had Ready had time to put his eye to the telescope , he would have discovered that it was the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 27]: The schooner stood in to the reefs , and then hauled off again , that she might send her boat in to sound for an anchorage .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 25]: The boat , when sounding , perceived the canoes and the savages , and afterwards heard the report of firearms on the first attack .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 34]: On her return on board the schooner , they stated what they had seen and heard , and their idea that the white people on the island were being attacked by the savages .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 38]: As the boat did not return on board till near dusk , they had not time to canvas , the question when the night attack was made , and they again heard the firing of the muskets .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 48]: This made Captain Osborn most anxious to land as soon as possible , but as the savages were in such numbers , and the crew of the schooner did not consist of more than twenty-five men , the commander considered it was rash to make the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 32]: He did , however , show the utmost anxiety to bring his schooner to an anchor , so as to protect his men , and then agreed that they should land .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 70]: The boat had reported deep water and good anchorage close to the garden-point , and every preparation was made for running at daylight on the following morning ; but unfortunately , it fell calm for the best part of the day , and it was not until the morning after , just as the savages were making their last attack upon the stockade , that she could get in .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 21]: As soon as she did , she opened the fire of her carronades , and the result is already known .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 25]: My readers must , if they can , imagine the joy of Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave when they beheld their old friend Captain Osborn .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 54]: All danger was now over ; the party who had landed with him went out under the command of the mate , to ascertain if there were any more of the savages to be found ; but , except the dead and dying , all had escaped in some of the smaller canoes .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 38]: Captain Osborn remained with the Seagraves , and they informed him of the state of poor old Ready , whom William had gone to attend as soon as Captain Osborn was engaged with his father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 26]: Captain Osborn hurried out to see him ; Ready knew his voice , for his eyes were already so dim that he could not see .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 17]: `` That is Captain Osborn , I know , '' said Ready in a faint voice .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 32]: `` You have come in good time , sir ; I knew you would come , and I always said so : you have the thanks of a dying man . ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 30]: `` I hope it is not so bad as that , Ready ; we have a surgeon on board , and I will send for him at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 29]: `` No surgeon can help me , sir , '' replied Ready ; `` another hour of time will not pass before I shall be in Eternity . ''
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 20]: The old man then joined his hands across his breast , and remained for some time in silent prayer .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 20]: Then he bade them farewell in a faint voice , which at last was changed to a mere whisper .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 37]: They still remained , in silence and in tears , standing round him , William only kneeling and holding his hand , when the old man 's head fell back , and he was no more !
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 34]: `` It is all over , '' said Mr. Seagrave mournfully , `` and he has , I have no doubt , gone to receive the reward of a good and just man .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 12]: ` Happy are those who die in the Lord . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 15]: Mr. Seagrave then led away his wife and children , leaving Juno and William .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 35]: William closed his eyes , and Juno went and fetched the ship 's ensign , which they laid over the body , after which they joined the rest of the party in the house .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 30]: It was decided that the following day should be passed in packing up and getting on board their luggage , and that the day after the family should embark .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 14]: William then mentioned the wish of poor old Ready as to his burial .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 32]: The commander of the schooner immediately gave directions for a coffin to be made , and for his men to dig the grave at the spot that William should point out .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 104]: Chapter LXVII The hurry and bustle of preparing for their departure from the island , and the rapid succession of events which had been crowded together within so very few days , had not allowed time for much thought or reflection to Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave and William ; at length , however , every preparation had been made , and they were no longer urged by the commander of the schooner to hasten their packing up and arrangements ; for everything had been sent on board during the afternoon , and it was proposed that they should sail on the following day .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 33]: Now they had time to feel , and bitterly did they lament the loss of their old friend , and deplore that he had not survived to sail with them to Sydney .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 37]: They had always indulged the hope that one day they should be taken off the island , and in that hope they had ever looked forward to old Ready becoming a part of their future household .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 43]: Now that their wishes had been granted - so much was the feeling of joy and gratitude mingled with regret - that could he have been restored to them , they felt as if they would have gladly remained on the island .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 46]: Captain Osborn , the commander , and the crew of the schooner had taken leave of them for the night , and had gone on board , having made arrangements for the interment of Ready , previous to their sailing , on the following day .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 42]: The children had been put to bed , and Juno had quitted the house ; Mr. and Mrs. Seagrave and William were sitting together in their now half-dismantled room , when Juno entered ; the poor girl had evidently been weeping .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 39]: `` Well , Juno , '' observed Mr. Seagrave , with a view to break the silence which had continued for some time previous to her entrance , `` are you not glad to leave the island ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 22]: `` One time I think I would be very glad , but now I not care much , '' replied Juno .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 13]: `` Island very nice place , all very happy till savage come .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 12]: Suppose they not kill old Ready , I not care . ''
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 82]: `` Yes , indeed , '' said Mrs. Seagrave , `` it is a sad blow to us all ; I did hope to have fostered the good old man , and to have been able to have shown him our gratitude , but -- '' `` It is the will of Heaven that it should be otherwise , '' continued Mr. Seagrave ; `` I would give half that I am possessed of , that he had not perished . ''
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 6]: `` Oh , Massa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 45]: said Juno , `` I sit by him just now ; I take off the flag and look at his face , so calm , look so happy , so good , I almost tink he smile at me , and then I cry .
