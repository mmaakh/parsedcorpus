Parsing [sent. 20 len. 8]: THE GREAT HARKLESS COMES HOME CHAPTER I .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 48]: THE YOUNG MAN WHO CAME TO STAY There is a fertile stretch of flat lands in Indiana where unagrarian Eastern travellers , glancing from car-windows , shudder and return their eyes to interior upholstery , preferring even the swaying caparisons of a Pullman to the monotony without .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 43]: The landscape lies interminably level : bleak in winter , a desolate plain of mud and snow ; hot and dusty in summer , in its flat lonesomeness , miles on miles with not one cool hill slope away from the sun .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 54]: The persistent tourist who seeks for signs of man in this sad expanse perceives a reckless amount of rail fence ; at intervals a large barn ; and , here and there , man himself , incurious , patient , slow , looking up from the fields apathetically as the Limited flies by .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 42]: Widely separated from each other are small frame railway stations -- sometimes with no other building in sight , which indicates that somewhere behind the adjacent woods a few shanties and thin cottages are grouped about a couple of brick stores .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 39]: On the station platforms there are always two or three wooden packing-boxes , apparently marked for travel , but they are sacred from disturbance and remain on the platform forever ; possibly the right train never comes along .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 52]: They serve to enthrone a few station loafers , who look out from under their hat-brims at the faces in the car-windows with the languid scorn a permanent fixture always has for a transient , and the pity an American feels for a fellow-being who does not live in his town .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 24]: Now and then the train passes a town built scatteringly about a court-house , with a mill or two humming near the tracks .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 22]: This is a county-seat , and the inhabitants and the local papers refer to it confidently as `` our city . ''
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 41]: The heart of the flat lands is a central area called Carlow County , and the county-seat of Carlow is a town unhappily named in honor of its first settler , William Platt , who christened it with his blood .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 24]: Natives of this place have sometimes remarked , easily , that their city had a population of from five to six thousand souls .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 16]: It is easy to forgive them for such statements ; civic pride is a virtue .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 12]: The social and business energy of Plattville concentrates on the Square .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 54]: Here , in summer-time , the gentlemen are wont to lounge from store to store in their shirt sleeves ; and here stood the old , red-brick court-house , loosely fenced in a shady grove of maple and elm -- `` slipp ` ry ellum '' -- called the `` Court-House Yard . ''
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 61]: When the sun grew too hot for the dry-goods box whittlers in front of the stores around the Square and the occupants of the chairs in front of the Palace Hotel on the corner , they would go across and drape themselves over the court-house fence , under the trees , and leisurely carve there initials on the top board .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 22]: The farmers hitched their teams to the fence , for there were usually loafers energetic enough to shout `` Whoa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 9]: if the flies worried the horses beyond patience .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 46]: In the yard , amongst the weeds and tall , unkept grass , chickens foraged all day long ; the fence was so low that the most matronly hen flew over with propriety ; and there were gaps that accommodated the passage of itinerant pigs .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 18]: Most of the latter , however , preferred the cool wallows of the less important street corners .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 34]: Here and there a big dog lay asleep in the middle of the road , knowing well that the easy-going Samaritan , in his case , would pass by on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 23]: Only one street attained to the dignity of a name -- Main Street , which formed the north side of the Square .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 42]: In Carlow County , descriptive location is usually accomplished by designating the adjacent , as , `` Up at Bardlocks ' , '' `` Down by Schofields ' , '' `` Right where Hibbards live , '' `` Acrost from Sol .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 15]: Tibbs 's , '' or , `` Other side of Jones 's field . ''
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 40]: In winter , Main Street was a series of frozen gorges land hummocks ; in fall and spring , a river of mud ; in summer , a continuing dust heap ; it was the best street in Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 21]: The people lived happily ; and , while the world whirled on outside , they were content with their own .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 40]: It would have moved their surprise as much as their indignation to hear themselves spoken of as a `` secluded community '' ; for they sat up all night to hear the vote of New York , every campaign .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 33]: Once when the President visited Rouen , seventy miles away , there were only few bankrupts -LRB- and not a baby amongst them -RRB- left in the deserted homes of Carlow County .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 21]: Everybody had adventures ; almost everybody saw the great man ; and everybody was glad to get back home again .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 37]: It was the longest journey some of them ever set upon , and these , elated as they were over their travels , determined to think twice ere they went that far from home another time .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 72]: On Saturdays , the farmers enlivened the commercial atmosphere of Plattville ; and Miss Tibbs , the postmaster 's sister and clerk , used to make a point of walking up and down Main Street as often as possible , to get a thrill in the realization of some poetical expressions that haunted her pleasingly ; phrases she had employed frequently in her poems for the `` Carlow County Herald . ''
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 56]: When thirty or forty country people were scattered along the sidewalks in front of the stores on Main Street , she would walk at nicely calculated angles to the different groups so as to leave as few gaps as possible between the figures , making them appear as near a solid phalanx as she could .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 46]: Then she would murmur to herself , with the accent of soulful revel , `` The thronged city streets , '' and , `` Within the thronged city , '' or , `` Where the thronging crowds were swarming and the great cathedral rose . ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 26]: Although she had never been beyond Carlow and the bordering counties in her life , all her poems were of city streets and bustling multitudes .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 35]: She was one of those who had been unable to join the excursion to Rouen when the President was there ; but she had listened avidly to her friends ' descriptions of the crowds .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 57]: Before that time her muse had been sylvan , speaking of `` Flow ` rs of May , '' and hinting at thoughts that overcame her when she roved the woodlands thro ' ; but now the inspiration was become decidedly municipal and urban , evidently reluctant to depart beyond the retail portions of a metropolis .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 86]: Her verses beginning , `` O , my native city , bride of Hibbard 's winding stream , '' -- Hibbard 's Creek runs west of Plattville , except in time of drought -- `` When thy myriad lights are shining , and thy faces , like a dream , Go flitting down thy sidewalks when their daily toil is done , '' were pronounced , at the time of their publication , the best poem that had ever appeared in the `` Herald . ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 16]: This unlucky newspaper was a thorn in the side of every patriot of Carlow County .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 45]: It was a poor paper ; everybody knew it was a poor paper ; it was so poor that everybody admitted it was a poor paper -- worse , the neighboring county of Amo possessed a better paper , the `` Amo Gazette . ''
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 34]: The `` Carlow County Herald '' was so everlastingly bad that Plattville people bent their heads bitterly and admitted even to citizens of Amo that the `` Gazette '' was the better paper .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 23]: The `` Herald '' was a weekly , issued on Saturday ; sometimes it hung fire over Sunday and appeared Monday evening .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 31]: In their pride , the Carlow people supported the `` Herald '' loyally and long ; but finally subscriptions began to fall off and the `` Gazette '' gained them .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 33]: It came to pass that the `` Herald '' missed fire altogether for several weeks ; then it came out feebly , two small advertisements occupying the whole of the fourth page .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 6]: It was breathing its last .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 25]: The editor was a clay-colored gentleman with a goatee , whose one surreptitious eye betokened both indolence of disposition and a certain furtive shrewdness .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 37]: He collected all the outstanding subscriptions he could , on the morning of the issue just mentioned , and , thoughtfully neglecting several items on the other side of the ledger , departed from Plattville forever .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 50]: The same afternoon a young man from the East alighted on the platform of the railway station , north of the town , and , entering the rickety omnibus that lingered there , seeking whom it might rattle to deafness , demanded to be driven to the Herald Building .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 56]: It did not strike the driver that the newcomer was precisely a gay young man when he climbed into the omnibus ; but , an hour later , as he stood in the doorway of the edifice he had indicated as his destination , depression seemed to have settled into the marrow of his bones .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 49]: Plattville was instantly alert to the stranger 's presence , and interesting conjectures were hazarded all day long at the back door of Martin 's Dry-Goods Emporium , where all the clerks from the stores around the Square came to play checkers or look on at the game .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 32]: -LRB- This was the club during the day ; in the evening the club and the game removed to the drug , book , and wall-paper store on the corner . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 19]: At supper , the new arrival and his probable purposes were discussed over every table in the town .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 22]: Upon inquiry , he had informed Judd Bennett , the driver of the omnibus , that he had come to stay .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 28]: Naturally , such a declaration caused a sensation , as people did not come to Plattville to live , except through the inadvertency of being born there .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 16]: In addition , the young man 's appearance and attire were reported to be extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 35]: Many of the curious , among them most of the marriageable females of the place , took occasion to pass and repass the sign of the `` Carlow County Herald '' during the evening .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 20]: Meanwhile , the stranger was seated in the dingy office upstairs with his head bowed low on his arms .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 11]: Twilight stole through the dirty window-panes and faded into darkness .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 5]: Night filled the room .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 5]: He did not move .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 30]: The young man from the East had bought the `` Herald '' from an agent ; had bought it without ever having been within a hundred miles of Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 7]: He had vastly overpaid for it .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 19]: Moreover , the price he had paid for it was all the money he had in the world .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 9]: The next morning he went bitterly to work .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 27]: He hired a compositor from Rouen , a young man named Parker , who set type all night long and helped him pursue advertisements all day .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 7]: The citizens shook their heads pessimistically .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 34]: They had about given up the idea that the `` Herald '' could ever amount to anything , and they betrayed an innocent , but caustic , doubt of ability in any stranger .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 20]: One day the new editor left a note on his door ; `` Will return in fifteen minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 42]: Mr. Rodney McCune , a politician from the neighboring county of Gaines , happening to be in Plattville on an errand to his henchmen , found the note , and wrote beneath the message the scathing inquiry , `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 42]: When he discovered this addendum , the editor smiled for the first time since his advent , and reported the incident in his next issue , using the rubric , `` Why Has the ` Herald ' Returned to Life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 23]: as a text for a rousing editorial on `` honesty in politics , '' a subject of which he already knew something .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 56]: The political district to which Carlow belonged was governed by a limited number of gentlemen whose wealth was ever on the increase ; and `` honesty in politics '' was a startling conception to the minds of the passive and resigned voters , who discussed the editorial on the street corners and in the stores .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 79]: The next week there was another editorial , personal and local in its application , and thereby it became evident that the new proprietor of the `` Herald '' was a theorist who believed , in general , that a politician 's honor should not be merely of that middling healthy species known as `` honor amongst politicians '' ; and , in particular , that Rodney McCune should not receive the nomination of his party for Congress .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 23]: Now , Mr. McCune was the undoubted dictator of the district , and his followers laughed at the stranger 's fantastic onset .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 53]: But the editor was not content with the word of print ; he hired a horse and rode about the country , and -LRB- to his own surprise -RRB- he proved to be an adaptable young man who enjoyed exercise with a pitchfork to the farmer 's profit while the farmer talked .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 72]: He talked little himself , but after listening an hour or so , he would drop a word from the saddle as he left ; and then , by some surprising wizardry , the farmer , thinking over the interview , decided there was some sense in what that young fellow said , and grew curious to see what the young fellow had further to say in the `` Herald . ''
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 26]: Politics is the one subject that goes to the vitals of every rural American ; and a Hoosier will talk politics after he is dead .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 45]: Everybody read the campaign editorials , and found them interesting , although there was no one who did not perceive the utter absurdity of a young stranger 's dropping into Carlow and involving himself in a party fight against the boss of the district .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 26]: It was entirely a party fight ; for , by grace of the last gerrymander , the nomination carried with it the certainty of election .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 37]: A week before the convention there came a provincial earthquake ; the news passed from man to man in awe-struck whispers -- McCune had withdrawn his name , making the hollowest of excuses to his cohorts .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 45]: Nothing was known of the real reason for his disordered retreat , beyond the fact that he had been in Plattville on the morning before his withdrawal and had issued from a visit to the `` Herald '' office in a state of palsy .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 29]: Mr. Parker , the Rouen printer , had been present at the close of the interview ; but he held his peace at the command of his employer .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 22]: He had been called into the sanctum , and had found McCune , white and shaking , leaning on the desk .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 34]: `` Parker , '' said the editor , exhibiting a bundle of papers he held in his hand , `` I want you to witness a verbal contract between Mr. McCune and myself .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 27]: These papers are an affidavit and copies of some records of a street-car company which obtained a charter while Mr McCune was in the State legislature .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 32]: They were sent to me by a man I do not know , an anonymous friend of Mr. McCune 's ; in fact , a friend he seems to have lost .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 19]: On consideration of our not printing these papers , Mr. McCune agrees to retire from politics for good .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 25]: You understand , if he ever lifts his head again , politically , We publish them , and the courts will do the rest .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 26]: Now , in case anything should happen to me -- '' `` Something will happen to you , all right , '' broke out McCune .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 33]: `` You can bank on that , you black -- '' `` Come , '' the editor interrupted , not unpleasantly `` why should there be anything personal , in all this ?
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 28]: I do n't recognize you as my private enemy -- not at all ; and I think you are getting off rather easily ; are n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 12]: You stay out of politics , and everything will be comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 12]: You ought never to have been in it , you see .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 30]: It 's a mistake not to keep square , because in the long run somebody is sure to give you away -- like the fellow who sent me these .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 11]: You promise to hold to a strictly private life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 26]: `` You 're a traitor to the party , '' groaned the other , `` but you only wait -- '' The editor smiled sadly .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 4]: `` Wait nothing .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 6]: Do n't threaten , man .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 6]: Go home to your wife .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 18]: I 'll give you three to one she 'll be glad you are out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 27]: `` I 'll give you three to one , '' said McCune , `` that the White Caps will get you if you stay in Carlow .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 17]: You want to look out for yourself , I tell you , my smart boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 11]: `` Good-day , Mr. McCune , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 16]: `` Let me have your note of withdrawal before you leave town this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 24]: The young man paused a moment , then extended his hand , as he said : `` Shake hands , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 13]: I -- I have n't meant to be too hard on you .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 41]: I hope things will seem easier and gayer to you before long ; and if -- if anything should turn up that I can do for you in a private way , I 'll be very glad , you know .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 3]: Good-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 14]: The sound of the `` Herald 's '' victory went over the State .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 6]: The paper came out regularly .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 12]: The townsfolk bought it and the farmers drove in for it .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 5]: Old subscribers came back .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 4]: Old advertisers renewed .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 16]: The `` Herald '' began to sell in Amo , and Gaines County people subscribed .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 11]: Carlow folk held up their heads when journalism was mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 43]: Presently the `` Herald '' announced a news connection with Rouen , and with that , and the aid of `` patent insides , '' began an era of three issues a week , appearing on Tuesdays , Thursdays , and Saturdays .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 8]: The Plattville Brass Band serenaded the editor .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 24]: During the second month of the new regime of the `` Herald , '' the working force of the paper received an addition .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 24]: One night the editor found some barroom loafers tormenting a patriarchal old man who had a magnificent head and a grand white beard .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 22]: He had been thrown out of a saloon , and he was drunk with the drunkenness of three weeks steady pouring .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 13]: He propped himself against a wall and reproved his tormentors in Latin .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 24]: `` I 'm walking your way , Mr. Fisbee , '' remarked the journalist , hooking his arm into the old man 's .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 12]: `` Suppose we leave our friends here and go home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 44]: Mr. Fisbee was the one inhabitant of the town who had an unknown past ; no one knew more about him than that he had been connected with a university somewhere , and had travelled in unheard-of countries before he came to Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 23]: A glamour of romance was thrown about him by the gossips , to whom he ever proved a fund of delightful speculation .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 28]: There was a dark , portentous secret in his life , it was agreed ; an opinion not too well confirmed by the old man 's appearance .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 50]: His fine eyes had a pathetic habit of wandering to the horizon in a questioning fashion that had a queer sort of hopelessness in it , as if his quest were one for the Holy Grail , perhaps ; and his expression was mild , vague , and sad .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 42]: He had a look of race and blood ; and yet , at the first glance , one saw that he was lost in dreams , and one guessed that the dreams would never be of great practicability in their application .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 44]: Some such impression of Fisbee was probably what caused the editor of the `` Herald '' to nickname him -LRB- in his own mind -RRB- `` The White Knight , '' and to conceive a strong , if whimsical , fancy for him .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 88]: Old Fisbee had come -LRB- from nobody knew where -RRB- to Plattville to teach , and had been principal of the High School for ten years , instructing his pupils after a peculiar fashion of his own , neglecting the ordinary courses of High School instruction to lecture on archaeology to the dumfounded scholars ; growing year by year more forgetful and absent , lost in his few books and his own reflections , until , though undeniably a scholar , he had been discharged for incompetency .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 22]: He was old ; he had no money and no way to make money ; he could find nothing to do .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 35]: The blow had seemed to daze him for a time ; then he began to drop in at the hotel bar , where Wilkerson , the professional drunkard , favored him with his society .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 15]: The old man understood ; he knew it was the beginning of the end .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 45]: He sold his books in order to continue his credit at the Palace bar , and once or twice , unable to proceed to his own dwelling , spent the night in a lumber yard , piloted thither by the hardier veteran , Wilkerson .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 28]: The morning after the editor took him home , Fisbee appeared at the `` Herald '' office in a new hat and a decent suit of black .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 41]: He had received his salary in advance , his books had been repurchased , and he had become the reportorial staff of the `` Carlow County Herald '' ; also , he was to write various treatises for the paper .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 31]: For the first few evenings , when he started home from the office , his chief walked with him , chatting heartily , until they had passed the Palace bar .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 7]: But Fisbee 's redemption was complete .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 7]: The old man had a daughter .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 22]: When she came to Plattville , he told her what the editor of the `` Herald '' had done for him .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 27]: The journalist kept steadily at his work ; and , as time went on , the bitterness his predecessor 's swindle had left him passed away .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 12]: But his loneliness and a sense of defeat grew and deepened .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 110]: When the vistas of the world had opened to his first youth , he had not thought to spend his life in such a place as Plattville ; but he found himself doing it , and it was no great happiness to him that the congressional representative of the district , the gentleman whom the `` Herald 's '' opposition to McCune had sent to Washington , came to depend on his influence for renomination ; nor did the realization that the editor of the `` Carlow County Herald '' had come to be McCune 's successor as political dictator produce a perceptibly enlivening effect on the young man .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 27]: The years drifted very slowly , and to him it seemed they went by while he stood far aside and could not even see them move .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 31]: He did not consider the life he led an exciting one ; but the other citizens of Carlow did when he undertook a war against the `` White Caps . ''
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 29]: The natives were much more afraid of the `` White Caps '' than he was ; they knew more about them and understood them better than he did .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 7]: THE STRANGE LADY IT was June .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 55]: From the patent inner columns of the `` Carlow County Herald '' might be gleaned the information -LRB- enlivened by cuts of duchesses -RRB- that the London season had reached a high point of gaiety ; and that , although the weather had grown inauspiciously warm , there was sufficient gossip for the thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 23]: To the rapt mind of Miss Selina Tibbs came a delicious moment of comparison : precisely the same conditions prevailed in Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 32]: Not unduly might Miss Selina lay this flattering unction to her soul , and well might the `` Herald '' declare that `` Carlow events were crowding thick and fast . ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 123]: The congressional representative of the district was to deliver a lecture at the court-house ; a circus was approaching the county-seat , and its glories would be exhibited `` rain or shine '' ; the court had cleared up the docket by sitting to unseemly hours of the night , even until ten o'clock -- one farmer witness had fallen asleep while deposing that he `` had knowed this man Hender some eighteen year '' -- and , as excitements come indeed when they do come , and it seldom rains but it pours , the identical afternoon of the lecture a strange lady descended from the Rouen Accommodation and was greeted on the platform by the wealthiest citizen of the county .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 24]: Judge Briscoe , and his daughter , Minnie , and -LRB- what stirred wonder to an itch almost beyond endurance -RRB- Mr. Fisbee !
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 42]: and they then drove through town on the way to the Briscoe mansion , all four , apparently , in a fluster of pleasure and exhilaration , the strange lady engaged in earnest conversation with Mr. Fisbee on the back seat .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 49]: Judd Bennett had had the best stare at her , but , as he immediately fell into a dreamy and absent state , little satisfaction could be got from him , merely an exasperating statement that the stranger seemed to have a kind of new look to her .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 26]: However , by means of Miss Mildy Upton , a domestic of the Briscoe household , the community was given something a little more definite .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 50]: The lady 's name was Sherwood ; she lived in Rouen ; and she had known Miss Briscoe at the eastern school the latter had attended -LRB- to the feverish agitation of Plattville -RRB- three years before ; but Mildy confessed her inadequacy in the matter of Mr. Fisbee .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 91]: He had driven up in the buckboard with the others and evidently expected to stay for supper Mr. Tibbs , the postmaster -LRB- it was to the postoffice that Miss Upton brought her information -RRB- suggested , as a possible explanation , that the lady was so learned that the Briscoes had invited Fisbee on the ground of his being the only person in Plattville they esteemed wise enough to converse with her ; but Miss Tibbs wrecked her brother 's theory by mentioning the name of Fisbee 's chief .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 34]: `` You see , Solomon , '' she sagaciously observed , `` if that were true , they would have invited him , instead of Mr. Fisbee , and I wish they had .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 21]: He is n't troubled with malaria , and yet the longer he lives here the sallower-looking and sadder-looking he gets .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 29]: I think the company of a lovely stranger might be of great cheer to his heart , and it will be interesting to witness the meeting between them .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 26]: It may be , '' added the poetess , `` that they _ have _ already met , on his travels before he settled here .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 14]: It may be that they are old friends -- or even more . ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 45]: `` Then what , '' returned her brother , `` what is he doin ' settin ' up in his office all afternoon with ink on his forehead , while Fisbee goes out ridin ' with her and stays for supper after_werds _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 43]: Although the problem of Fisbee 's attendance remained a mere maze of hopeless speculation , Mildy had been present at the opening of Miss Sherwood 's trunk , and here was matter for the keen consideration of the ladies , at least .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 42]: Thoughtful conversations in regard to hats and linings took place across fences and on corners of the Square that afternoon ; and many gentlemen wondered -LRB- in wise silence -RRB- why their spouses were absent-minded and brooded during the evening meal .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 22]: At half-past seven , the Hon. Kedge Halloway of Amo delivered himself of his lecture ; `` The Past and Present .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 15]: What we may Glean from Them , and Their Influence on the Future . ''
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 29]: At seven the court-room was crowded , and Miss Tibbs , seated on the platform -LRB- reserved for prominent citizens -RRB- , viewed the expectant throng with rapture .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 27]: It is possible that she would have confessed to witnessing a sea of faces , but it is more probable that she viewed the expectant throng .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 34]: The thermometer stood at eighty-seven degrees and there was a rustle of incessantly moving palm-leaf fans as , row by row , their yellow sides twinkled in the light of eight oil lamps .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 9]: The stouter ladies wielded their fans with vigor .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 51]: There were some very pretty faces in Mr. Halloway 's audience , but it is a peculiarity of Plattville that most of those females who do not incline to stoutness incline far in the opposite direction , and the lean ladies naturally suffered less from the temperature than their sisters .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 30]: The shorn lamb is cared for , but often there seems the intention to impart a moral in the refusal of Providence to temper warm weather to the full-bodied .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 55]: Old Tom Martin expressed a strong consciousness of such intention when he observed to the shocked Miss Selina , as Mr. Bill Snoddy , the stoutest citizen of the county , waddled abnormally up the aisle : `` The Almighty must be gittin '' a heap of fun out of Bill Snoddy to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 7]: `` Oh , Mr. Martin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 9]: exclaimed Miss Tibbs , fluttering at his irreverence .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 7]: `` Why , you would yourself .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 8]: Miss Seliny , '' returned old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 40]: Mr. Martin always spoke in one key , never altering the pitch of his high , dry , unctuous drawl , though , when his purpose was more than ordinarily humorous , his voice assumed a shade of melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 32]: Now and then he meditatively passed his fingers through his gray beard , which followed the line of his jaw , leaving his upper lip and most of his chin smooth-shaven .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 16]: `` Did you ever reason out why folks laugh so much at fat people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 3]: he continued .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 5]: `` No , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 6]: Neither 'd anybody else . ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 9]: `` Why is it , Mr. Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 4]: asked Miss Selina .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 17]: `` It 's like the Creator 's sayin ' , ` Let there be light . '
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 45]: He says , ` Let ladies be lovely -- ' '' -LRB- Miss Tibbs bowed -RRB- -- `` and ` Let men-folks be honest -- sometimes ; ' and , ` Let fat people be held up to ridicule till they fall off . '
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 15]: You ca n't tell why it is ; it was jest ordained that-a-way . ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 18]: The room was so crowded that the juvenile portion of the assemblage was ensconced in the windows .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 39]: Strange to say , the youth of Plattville were not present under protest , as their fellows of a metropolis would have been , lectures being well understood by the young of great cities to have instructive tendencies .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 10]: The boys came to-night because they insisted upon coming .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 5]: It was an event .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 26]: Some of them had made sacrifices to come , enduring even the agony -LRB- next to hair-cutting in suffering -RRB- of having their ears washed .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 42]: Conscious of parental eyes , they fronted the public with boyhood 's professional expressionlessness , though they communicated with each other aside in a cipher-language of their own , and each group was a hot-bed of furtive gossip and sarcastic comment .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 23]: Seated in the windows , they kept out what small breath of air might otherwise have stolen in to comfort the audience .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 47]: Their elders sat patiently dripping with perspiration , most of the gentlemen undergoing the unusual garniture of stiffly-starched collars , those who had not cultivated chin beards to obviate such arduous necessities of pomp and state , hardly bearing up under the added anxiety of cravats .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 54]: However , they sat outwardly meek under the yoke ; nearly all of them seeking a quiet solace of tobacco -- not that they smoked ; Heaven and the gallantry of Carlow County forbid -- nor were there anywhere visible tokens of the comforting ministrations of nicotine to violate the eye of etiquette .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 7]: It is an art of Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 17]: Suddenly there was a hum and a stir and a buzz of whispering in the room .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 17]: Two gray old men and two pretty young women passed up the aisle to the platform .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 21]: One old man was stalwart and ruddy , with a cordial eye and a handsome , smooth-shaven , big face .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 47]: The other was bent and trembled slightly ; his face was very white ; he had a fine high brow , deeply lined , the brow of a scholar , and a grandly flowing white beard that covered his chest , the beard of a patriarch .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 23]: One of the young women was tall and had the rosy cheeks and pleasant eyes of her father , who preceded her .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 7]: The other was the strange lady .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 16]: A universal perturbation followed her progress up the aisle , if she had known it .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 22]: She was small and fair , very daintily and beautifully made ; a pretty Marquise whose head Greuze should have painted .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 61]: Mrs. Columbus Landis , wife of the proprietor of the Palace Hotel , conferring with a lady in the next seat , applied an over-burdened adjective : `` It ai n't so much she 's han ` some , though she is , that -- but do n't you notice she 's got a kind of smart look to her ?
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 18]: Her bein ' so teeny , kind of makes it more so , somehow , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 31]: What stunned the gossips of the windows to awed admiration , however , was the unconcerned and stoical fashion in which she wore a long bodkin straight through her head .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 16]: It seemed a large sacrifice merely to make sure one 's hat remained in place .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 22]: The party took seats a little to the left and rear of the lecturer 's table , and faced the audience .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 30]: The strange lady chatted gaily with the other three , apparently as unconscious of the multitude of eyes fixed upon her as the gazers were innocent of rude intent .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 73]: There were pretty young women in Plattville ; Minnie Briscoe was the prettiest , and , as the local glass of fashion reflected , `` the stylishest '' ; but this girl was different , somehow , in a way the critics were puzzled to discover -- different , from the sparkle of her eyes and the crown of her trim sailor hat , to the edge of her snowy duck skirt .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 15]: Judd Bennett sighed a sigh that was heard in every corner of the room .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 16]: As everybody immediately turned to look at him , he got up and went out .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 37]: It had long been a jocose fiction of Mr. Martin , who was a widower of thirty years ' standing , that he and the gifted authoress by his side were in a state of courtship .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 28]: Now he bent his rugged head toward her to whisper : `` I never thought to see the day you 'd have a rival in my affections .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 9]: Miss Seliny , but yonder looks like it .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 29]: I reckon I 'll have to go up to Ben Tinkle 's and buy that fancy vest he 's had in stock this last twelve year or more .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 17]: Will you take me back when she 's left the city again ; Miss Seliny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 3]: he drawled .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 16]: `` I expect , maybe , Miss Sherwood is one of these here summer girls .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 12]: I 've heard of 'em but I never see one before .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 20]: You better take warning and watch me -- Fisbee wo n't have no clear field from now on . ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 26]: The stranger leaned across to speak to Miss Briscoe and her sleeve touched the left shoulder of the old man with the patriarchal white beard .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 32]: A moment later he put his right hand to that shoulder and gently moved it up and down with a caressing motion over the shabby black broadcloth her garment had touched .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 8]: `` Look at that old Fisbee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 7]: exclaimed Mr. Martin , affecting indignation .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 16]: `` Never be 'n half as spruced up and wide awake in all his life .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 29]: He 's prob ` ly got her to listen to him on the decorations of Nineveh -- it 's my belief he was there when it was destroyed .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 26]: Well , if I ca n't cut him out we 'll get our respected young friend of the ` Herald ' to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 4]: `` Sh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 4]: returned Miss Tibbs .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 6]: `` Here he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 52]: The seats upon the platform were all occupied , except the two foremost ones in the centre -LRB- one on each side of a little table with a lamp , a pitcher of ice-water , and a glass -RRB- reserved for the lecturer and the gentleman who was to introduce him .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 39]: Steps were audible in the hall , and every one turned to watch the door , where the distinguished pair now made their appearance in a hush of expectation over which the beating of the fans alone prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 33]: The Hon. Kedge Halloway was one of the gleaners of the flesh-pots , himself , and he marched into the room unostentatiously mopping his shining expanse of brow with a figured handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 25]: He was a person of solemn appearance ; a fat gold watch-chain which curved across his ponderous front , adding mysteriously to his gravity .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 33]: At his side strolled a very tall , thin , rather stooping -- though broad-shouldered -- rather shabby young man with a sallow , melancholy face and deep-set eyes that looked tired .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 38]: When they were seated , the orator looked over his audience slowly and with an incomparable calm ; then , as is always done , he and the melancholy young man exchanged whispers for a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 41]: After this there was a pause , at the end of which the latter rose and announced that it was his pleasure and his privilege to introduce , that evening , a gentleman who needed no introduction to that assemblage .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 50]: What citizen of Carlow needed an introduction , asked the speaker , to the orator they had applauded in the campaigns of the last twenty years , the statesman author of the Halloway Bill , the most honored citizen of the neighboring and flourishing county and city of Amo ?
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 53]: And , the speaker would say , that if there were one thing the citizens of Carlow could be held to envy the citizens of Amo , it was the Honorable Kedge Halloway , the thinker , to whose widely-known paper they were about to have the pleasure and improvement of listening .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 34]: The introduction was so vehemently applauded that , had there been present a person connected with the theatrical profession , he might have been nervous for fear the introducer had prepared no encore .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 17]: `` Kedge is too smart to take it all to himself , '' commented Mr. Martin .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 15]: `` He knows it 's half account of the man that said it . ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 5]: He was not mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 11]: Mr. Halloway had learned a certain perceptiveness on the stump .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 139]: Resting one hand upon his unfolded notes upon the table , he turned toward the melancholy young man -LRB- who had subsided into the small of his back in his chair -RRB- and , after clearing his throat , observed with sudden vehemence that he must thank his gifted friend for his flattering remarks , but that when he said that Carlow envied Amo a Halloway , it must be replied that Amo grudged no glory to her sister county of Carlow , but , if Amo could find envy in her heart it would be because Carlow possessed a paper so sterling , so upright , so brilliant , so enterprising as the `` Carlow County Herald , '' and a journalist so talented , so gifted , so energetic , so fearless , as its editor .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 13]: The gentleman referred to showed very faint appreciation of these ringing compliments .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 50]: There was a lamp on the table beside him , against which , to the view of Miss Sherwood of Rouen , his face was silhouetted , and very rarely had it been her lot to see a man look less enthusiastic under public and favorable comment of himself .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 18]: She wondered if he , also , remembered the Muggleton cricket match and the subsequent dinner oratory .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 4]: The lecture proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 57]: The orator winged away to soary heights with gestures so vigorous as to cause admiration for his pluck in making use of them on such a night ; the perspiration streamed down his face , his neck grew purple , and he dared the very face of apoplexy , binding his auditors with a double spell .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 28]: It is true that long before the peroration the windows were empty and the boys were eating stolen , unripe fruit in the orchards of the listeners .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 8]: The thieves were sure of an alibi .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 43]: The Hon. Mr. Halloway reached a logical conclusion which convinced even the combative and unwilling that the present depends largely upon the past , while the future will be determined , for the most part , by the conditions of the present .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 35]: `` The future , '' he cried , leaning forward with an expression of solemn warning , `` The future is in our own hands , ladies and gentlemen of the city of Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 5]: Is it not so ?
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 6]: We will find it so .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 8]: Turn it over in your minds . ''
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 23]: He leaned backward and folded his hands benevolently on his stomach and said in a searching whisper ; `` Ponder it . ''
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 47]: He waited for them to ponder it , and little Mr. Swanter , the druggist and bookseller , who prided himself on his politeness and who was seated directly in front , scratched his head and knit his brows to show that he was pondering it .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 19]: The stillness was intense ; the fans ceased to beat ; Mr. Snoddy could be heard breathing dangerously .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 52]: Mr. Swanter was considering the advisability of drawing a pencil from his pocket and figuring on it upon his cuff , when suddenly , with the energy of a whirlwind , the lecturer threw out his arms to their fullest extent and roared : `` It is a _ fact _ !
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 12]: It is carven on stone in the gloomy caverns of TIME .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 13]: It is writ in FIRE on the imperishable walls of Fate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 32]: After the outburst , his voice sank with startling rapidity to a tone of honeyed confidence , and he wagged an inviting forefinger at Mr. Snoddy , who opened his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 7]: `` Shall we take an example ?
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 17]: Not from the marvellous , my friends ; let us seek an illustration from the ordinary .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 5]: Is that not better ?
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 8]: One familiar to the humblest of us .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 6]: One we can all comprehend .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 6]: One from our every-day life .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 8]: One which will interest even the young .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 4]: The common house-fly .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 28]: On a window-sill we place a bit of fly-paper , and contiguous to it , a flower upon which the happy insect likes to feed and rest .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 5]: The little fly approaches .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 8]: See , he hovers between the two .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 20]: One is a fatal trap , an ambuscade , and the other a safe harbor and an innocuous haven .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 5]: But mystery allures him .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 5]: He poises , undecided .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 5]: That is the present .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 9]: That , my friends , is the Present !
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 5]: What will he do ?
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 5]: WHAT will he do ?
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 5]: What will he DO ?
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 14]: Memories of the past are whispering to him : ` Choose the flower .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 6]: Light on the posy . '
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 13]: Here we clearly see the influence of the past upon the present .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 30]: But , to employ a figure of speech , the fly-paper beckons to the insect toothsomely , and , thinks he ; ` Shall I give it a try ?
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 3]: Shall I ?
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 8]: Shall I give it a try ? '
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 12]: The future is in his own hands to make or unmake .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 24]: The past , the voice of Providence , has counselled him : ` Leave it alone , leave it alone , little fly .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 6]: Go away from there . '
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 6]: Does he heed the warning ?
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 9]: Does he heed it , ladies and gentlemen ?
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 3]: Does he ?
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 4]: Ah , no !
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 33]: He springs into the air , decides between the two attractions , one of them , so deadly to his interests and -- _ drops upon the fly-paper to perish miserably _ !
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 9]: The future is in his hands no longer .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 20]: We must lie upon the bed that we have made , nor can Providence change its unalterable decrees . ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 31]: After the tragedy , the orator took a swallow of water , mopped his brow with the figured handkerchief and announced that a new point herewith presented itself for consideration .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 15]: The audience sank back with a gasp of release from the strain of attention .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 20]: Minnie Briscoe , leaning back , breathless like the others , became conscious that a tremor agitated her visitor .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 28]: Miss Sherwood had bent her head behind the shelter of the judge 's broad shoulders ; was shaking slightly and had covered her face with her hands .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 8]: `` What is it , Helen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 6]: whispered Miss Briscoe , anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 5]: `` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 6]: Is something the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 5]: Nothing , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 8]: She dropped her hands from her face .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 14]: Her cheeks were deep crimson , and she bit her lip with determination .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 7]: `` Oh , but there is !
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 9]: Why , you 've tears in your eyes .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 4]: Are you faint ?
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 26]: `` It is only -- only -- '' Miss Sherwood choked , then cast a swift glance at the profile of the melancholy young man .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 17]: The perfectly dismal decorum of this gentleman seemed to inspire her to maintain her own gravity .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 18]: `` It is only that it seemed such a pity about that fly , '' she explained .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 43]: From where they sat the journalistic silhouette was plainly visible , and both Fisbee and Miss Sherwood looked toward it often , the former with the wistful , apologetic fidelity one sees in the eyes of an old setter watching his master .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 20]: When the lecture was over many of the audience pressed forward to shake the Hon. Mr. Halloway 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 17]: Tom Martin hooked his arm in that of the sallow gentleman and passed out with him .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 17]: `` Mighty humanizin ' view Kedge took of that there insect , '' remarked Mr. Martin .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 33]: `` I do n't recollect I ever heard of no mournfuller error than that ` n. I noticed you spoke of Halloway as a ` thinker , ' without mentioning what kind .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 18]: I did n't know , before , that you were as cautious a man as that . ''
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 11]: `` Does your satire find nothing sacred , Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 13]: returned the other , `` not even the Honorable Kedge Halloway ? ''
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 24]: `` I would n't presume , '' replied old Tom , `` to make light of the catastrophe that overtook the heedless fly .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 35]: When Halloway went on to other subjects I was so busy picturin ' the last moments of that closin ' life , stuck there in the fly-paper , I could n't listen to him .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 15]: But there 's no use dwellin ' on a sorrow we ca n't help .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 15]: Look at the moon ; it 's full enough to cheer us up . ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 30]: They had emerged from the court-house and paused on the street as the stream of townsfolk divided and passed by them to take different routes leading from the Square .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 12]: Not far away , some people were getting into a buckboard .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 11]: Fisbee and Miss Sherwood were already on the rear seat .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 12]: `` Who 's with him , to-night , Mr. Fisbee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 8]: asked Judge Briscoe in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 4]: `` No one .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 8]: He is going directly to the office .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 12]: To-morrow is Thursday , one of our days of publication . ''
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 9]: `` Oh , then it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 12]: Climb in , Minnie , we 're waiting for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 9]: The judge offered his hand to his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 11]: `` In a moment , father , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 18]: `` I 'm going to ask him to call , '' she said to the other girl .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 11]: `` But wo n't he -- '' Miss Briscoe laughed .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 9]: `` He never comes to see me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 22]: She walked over to where Martin and the young man were looking up at the moon , and addressed the journalist .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 48]: `` I 've been trying to get a chance to speak to you for a week , '' she said , offering him her hand ; `` I wanted to tell you I had a friend coming to visit me Wo n't you come to see us ?
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 5]: She 's here . ''
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 5]: The young man bowed .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 8]: `` Thank you , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 7]: `` Thank you , very much .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 7]: I shall be very glad . ''
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 30]: His tone had the meaningless quality of perfunctory courtesy ; Miss Briscoe detected only the courtesy ; but the strange lady marked the lack of intention in his words .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 10]: `` Do n't you include me , Minnie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 6]: inquired Mr Martin , plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 21]: `` I 'll try not to be too fascinatin ' , so as to give our young friend a show .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 9]: It was love at first sight with me .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 22]: I give Miss Seliny warning soon as your folks come in and I got a good look at the lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 78]: As the buckboard drove away , Miss Sherwood , who had been gazing steadfastly at the two figures still standing in the street , the tall ungainly old one , and the taller , loosely-held young one -LRB- he had not turned to look at her -RRB- withdrew her eyes from them , bent them seriously upon Fisbee , and asked : `` What did you mean when you said no one was with him to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 12]: `` That no one was watching him , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 4]: `` Watching him ?
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 6]: I do n't understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 20]: `` Yes ; he has been shot at from the woods at night and -- '' The girl shivered .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 7]: `` But who watches him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 8]: `` The young men of the town .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 19]: He has a habit of taking long walks after dark , and he is heedless of all remonstrance .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 53]: He laughs at the idea of curtailing the limit of his strolls or keeping within the town when night has fallen ; so the young men have organized a guard for him , and every evening one of them follows him until he goes to the office to work for the night .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 24]: It is a different young man every evening , and the watcher follows at a distance so that he does not suspect . ''
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 11]: `` But how many people know of this arrangement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 24]: `` Nearly every one in the county except the Cross-Roads people , though it is not improbable that they have discovered it . ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 24]: `` And has no one told him '' `` No ; it would annoy him ; he would not allow it to continue .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 8]: He will not even arm himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 20]: `` They follow and watch him night after night , and every one knows and no one tells him ?
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 20]: Oh , I must say , '' cried the girl , `` I think these are good people . ''
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 22]: The stalwart old man on the front seat shook out the reins and whined the whip over his roans ' backs .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 11]: `` They are the people of your State and mine .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 31]: Miss Sherwood , '' he said in his hearty voice , `` the best people in God 's world -- and I 'm not running for Congress , either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 11]: `` But how about the Six-Cross-Roads people , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 3]: asked Minnie .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 27]: `` We 'll wipe them clean out some day , '' answered her father -- `` possibly judicially , possibly -- '' `` Surely judiciously ? ''
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 4]: suggested Miss Sherwood .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 27]: `` If you care to see what a bad settlement looks like , we 'll drive through there to-morrow -- by daylight , '' said Briscoe .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 15]: `` Even the doctor does n't insist on being in that neighborhood after dark .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 21]: They are trying their best to get Harkless , and if they do -- '' `` If they do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 4]: repeated Miss Sherwood .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 7]: She clasped Fisbee 's hand gently .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 15]: His eyes shone and he touched her fingers with a strange , shy reverence .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 11]: `` You will meet him to-morrow , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 7]: She laughed and pressed his hand .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 6]: `` I 'm afraid not .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 12]: He was n't even interested enough to look at me . ''
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 63]: LONESOMENESS When the rusty hands of the office clock marked half-past four , the editor-in-chief of the `` Carlow County Herald '' took his hand out of his hair , wiped his pen on his last notice from the White-Caps , put on his coat , swept out the close little entry , and left the sanctum for the bright June afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 50]: He chose the way to the west , strolling thoughtfully out of town by the white , hot , deserted Main Street , and thence onward by the country road into which its proud half-mile of old brick store buildings , tumbled-down frame shops and thinly painted cottages degenerated .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 53]: The sun was in his face , where the road ran between the summer fields , lying waveless , low , gracious in promise ; but , coming to a wood of hickory and beech and walnut that stood beyond , he might turn his down-bent-hat-brim up and hold his head erect .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 38]: Here the shade fell deep and cool on the green tangle of rag and iron weed and long grass in the corners of the snake fence , although the sun beat upon the road so dose beside .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 28]: There was no movement in the crisp young leaves overhead ; high in the boughs there was a quick flirt of crimson where two robins hopped noiselessly .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 41]: No insect raised resentment of the lonesomeness : the late afternoon , when the air is quite still , had come ; yet there rested -- somewhere -- on the quiet day , a faint , pleasant , woody smell .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 47]: It came to the editor of the `` Herald '' as he climbed to the top rail of the fence for a seat , and he drew a long , deep breath to get the elusive odor more luxuriously -- and then it was gone altogether .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 17]: `` A habit of delicacies , '' he said aloud , addressing the wide silence complainingly .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 20]: He drew a faded tobacco-bag and a brier pipe from his coat pocket and filled and lit the pipe .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 23]: `` One taste -- and they quit , '' he finished , gazing solemnly upon the shining little town down the road .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 20]: He twirled the pouch mechanically about his finger , and then , suddenly regarding it , patted it caressingly .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 58]: It had been a giddy little bag , long ago , satin , and gay with embroidery in the colors of the editor 's university ; and although now it was frayed to the verge of tatters , it still bore an air of pristine jauntiness , an air of which its owner in no wise partook .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 69]: He looked from it over the fields toward the town in the clear distance and sighed softly as he put the pouch back in his pocket , and , resting his arm on his knee and his chin in his hand , sat blowing clouds of smoke out of the shade into the sunshine , absently watching the ghostly shadows dance on the white dust of the road .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 63]: A little garter snake crept under the fence beneath him and disappeared in the underbrush ; a rabbit progressing timidly on his travels by a series of brilliant dashes and terror-smitten halts , came within a few yards of him , sat up with quivering nose and eyes alight with fearful imaginings -- vanished , a flash of fluffy brown and white .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 15]: Shadows grew longer ; the brier pipe sputtered feebly in depletion and was refilled .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 48]: A cricket chirped and heard answer ; there was a woodland stir of breezes ; and the pair of robins left the branches overhead in eager flight , vacating before the arrival of a great flock of blackbirds hastening thither ere the eventide should be upon them .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 27]: The blackbirds came , chattered , gossiped , quarrelled , and beat each other with their wings above the smoker sitting on the top fence rail .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 9]: But he had remembered -- it was Commencement .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 43]: To-day , a thousand miles to the east , a company of grave young gentlemen sat in semi-circular rows before a central altar , while above them rose many tiers of mothers and sisters and sweethearts , listening to the final word .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 59]: He could see it all very clearly : the lines of freshly shaven , boyish faces , the dainty gowns , the flowers and bright eyes above , and the light that filtered in through stained glass to fall softly over them all , with , here and there , a vivid splash of color , Gothic shaped .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 99]: He could see the throngs of white-clad loungers under the elms without , under-classmen , bored by the Latin addresses and escaped to the sward and breeze of the campus ; there were the troops of roistering graduates trotting about arm in arm , and singing ; he heard the mandolins on the little balconies play an old refrain and the university cheering afterward ; saw the old professor he had cared for most of all , with the thin white hair straggling over his silken hood , following the band in the sparse ranks of his class .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 113]: And he saw his own Commencement Day -- and the station at the junction where he stood the morning after , looking across the valley at the old towers for the last time ; saw the broken groups of his class , standing upon the platform on the other side of the tracks , waiting for the south-bound train as he and others waited for the north-bound -- and they all sang `` Should auld acquaintance be forgot ; '' and , while they looked across at each other , singing , the shining rails between them wavered and blurred as the engine rushed in and separated them and their lives thenceforth .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 20]: He filled his pipe again and spoke to the phantoms gliding over the dust -- `` Seven years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 64]: He was occupied with the realization that there had been a man in his class whose ambition needed no restraint , his promise was so complete -- in the strong belief of the university , a belief he could not help knowing -- and that seven years to a day from his Commencement this man was sitting on a fence rail in Indiana .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 62]: Down the road a buggy came creaking toward him , gray with dust , the top canted permanently to one side , old and frayed , like the fat , shaggy , gray mare that drew it ; her unchecked , despondent head lowering before her , while her incongruous tail waved incessantly , like the banner of a storming party .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 33]: The editor did not hear the flop of the mare 's feet nor the sound of the wheels , so deep was his reverie , till the vehicle was nearly opposite him .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 24]: The red-faced and perspiring driver drew rein , and the journalist looked up and waved a long white hand to him in greeting .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 9]: `` Howdy ' do , Mr. Harkless ? ''
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 7]: called the man in the buggy .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 8]: `` Soakin ' in the weather ? ''
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 12]: He spoke in shouts , though neither was hard of hearing .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 18]: `` Yes ; just soaking , '' answered Harkless ; `` it 's such a gypsy day .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 6]: How is Mr. Bowlder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 15]: `` I 'm givin ' good satisfaction , thankye , and all at home .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 13]: She 's in town ; goin ' in after her now . ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 16]: `` Give Mrs. Bowlder my regards , '' said the journalist , comprehending the symbolism .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 6]: `` How is Hartley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 11]: The farmer 's honest face shaded over , a second .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 20]: `` He 's be 'n steady ever sence the night you brought him out home ; six weeks straight .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 33]: I 'm kind of bothered about to-morrow -- It 's show-day and he wants to come in town with us , and seems if I had n't any call to say no .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 16]: I reckon he 'll have to take his chances -- and us , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 25]: He raised the reins and clucked to the gray mare ; `` Well , she 'll be mad I ai n't there long ago .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 6]: Ride in with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 7]: `` No , I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 12]: I 'll walk in for the sake of my appetite . ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 22]: `` Would n't encourage it _ too _ much -- livin ' at the Palace Hotel , ' '' observed Bowlder .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 8]: `` Sorry ye wo n't ride . ''
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 42]: He gathered the loose ends of the reins in his hands , leaned far over the dashboard and struck the mare a hearty thwack ; the tattered banner of tail jerked indignantly , but she consented to move down the road .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 26]: Bowlder thrust his big head through the sun-curtain behind him and continued the conversation : `` See the White-Caps ai n't got ye yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 7]: `` No , not yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 3]: Harkless laughed .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 49]: `` Reckon the boys ` druther ye stayed in town after dark , '' the other called back ; then , as the mare stumbled into a trot , `` Well , come out and see us -- if ye kin spare time from the jedge 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 28]: The latter clause seemed to be an afterthought intended with humor , for Bowlder accompanied it with the loud laughter of sylvan timidity , risking a joke .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 23]: Harkless nodded without the least apprehension of his meaning , and waved farewell as Bowlder finally turned his attention to the mare .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 29]: When the flop , flop of her hoofs had died out , the journalist realized that the day was silent no longer ; it was verging into evening .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 14]: He dropped from the fence and turned his face toward town and supper .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 76]: He felt the light and life about him ; heard the clatter of the blackbirds above him ; heard the homing bees hum by , and saw the vista of white road and level landscape , framed on two sides by the branches of the grove , a vista of infinitely stretching fields of green , lined here and there with woodlands and flat to the horizon line , the village lying in their lap .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 25]: No roll of meadow , no rise of pasture land , relieved their serenity nor shouldered up from them to be called a hill .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 14]: A second great flock of blackbirds was settling down over the Plattville maples .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 63]: As they hung in the fair dome of the sky below the few white clouds , it occurred to Harkless that some supping god had inadvertently peppered his custard , and now inverted and emptied his gigantic blue dish upon the earth , the innumerable little black dots seeming to poise for a moment , then floating slowly down from the heights .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 32]: A farm-bell rang in the distance , a tinkling coming small and mellow from far away , and at the lonesomeness of that sound he heaved a long , mournful sigh .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 23]: The next instant he broke into laughter , for another bell rang over the fields , the court-house bell in the Square .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 70]: The first four strokes were given with mechanical regularity , the pride of the custodian who operated the bell being to produce the effect of a clock-work bell such as he had once heard in the court-house at Rouen ; but the fifth and sixth strokes were halting achievements , as , after four o'clock , he often lost count on the strain of the effort for precise imitation .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 32]: There was a pause after the sixth , then a dubious and reluctant stroke -- seven -- a longer pause , followed by a final ring with desperate decision -- eight !
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 13]: Harkless looked at his watch ; it was twenty minutes of six .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 39]: As he crossed the court-house yard to the Palace Hotel , he stopped to exchange a word with the bell-ringer , who , seated on the steps , was mopping his brow with an air of hard-earned satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 10]: `` Good-evening , Schofields ' , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 13]: `` You came in strong on the last stroke , to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 17]: `` What we need here , '' responded the bell-ringer , `` is more public-spirited men .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 75]: I ai n't kickin ' on you , Mr. Harkless , no sir ; but we want more men like they got in Rouen ; we want men that 'll git Main Street paved with block or asphalt ; men that 'll put in factories , men that 'll act and not set round like that ole fool Martin and laugh and polly-woggle and make fun of public sperrit , day in and out .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 11]: I reckon I do my best for the city . ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 12]: `` Oh , nobody minds Tom Martin , '' answered Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 16]: `` It 's only half the time he means anything by what he says . ''
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 32]: `` That 's jest what I hate about him , '' returned the bell-ringer in a tone of high complaint ; `` you ca n't never tell which half it is .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 6]: Look at him now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 37]: Over in front of the hotel Martin was standing , talking to the row of coatless loungers who sat with their chairs tilted back against the props of the wooden awning that projected over the sidewalk .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 21]: Their faces were turned toward the court-house , and even those lost in meditative whittling had looked up to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 56]: Martin , his hands in the pockets of his alpaca coat , his rusty silk hat tilted forward till the wide brim rested almost on the bridge of his nose , was addressing them in his one-keyed voice , the melancholy whine of which , though not the words , penetrated to the court-house steps .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 29]: The bell-ringer , whose name was Henry Schofield , but who was known as Schofield 's Henry -LRB- popularly abbreviated to Schofields ' -RRB- was moved to indignation .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 9]: `` Look at him , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 5]: `` Look at him !
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 8]: Everlastingly goin ' on about my bell !
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 10]: Let him talk , jest let him talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 14]: The supper gong boomed inside the hotel and Harkless bade the bell-ringer good-night .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 17]: As he moved away the latter called after him : `` He do n't disturb nobody .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 4]: Let him talk .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 14]: Who pays any ` tention to him I 'd like to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 10]: There was a burst of laughter from the whittlers .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 28]: Schofields ' sat in patient silence for a full minute , as one who knew that no official is too lofty to escape the anathemas of envy .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 23]: Then he sprang to his feet and shook his fist at Martin , who was disappearing within the door of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 6]: `` Go to Halifax ! ''
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 46]: The dining-room of the Palace Hotel was a large , airy apartment , rustling with artistically perforated and slashed pink paper that hung everywhere , at this season of the year , to lend festal effect as well as to palliate the scourge of flies .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 39]: There were six or seven large tables , all vacant except that at which Columbus Landis , the landlord , sat with his guests , while his wife and children ate in the kitchen by their own preference .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 48]: Transient trade was light in Plattville ; nobody ever came there , except occasional commercial travellers who got out of town the instant it was possible , and who said awful things if , by the exigencies of the railway time-table , they were left over night .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 77]: Behind the host 's chair stood a red-haired girl in a blue cotton gown ; and in her hand she languidly waved a long instrument made of clustered strips of green and white and yellow tissue paper fastened to a wooden wand ; with this she amiably amused the flies except at such times as the conversation proved too interesting , when she was apt to rest it on the shoulder of one of the guests .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 16]: This happened each time the editor of the `` Herald '' joined in the talk .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 21]: As the men seated themselves they all nodded to her and said , `` G 'd evening , Cynthy . ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 11]: Harkless always called her Charmion ; no one knew why .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 32]: When he came in she moved around the table to a chair directly opposite him , and held that station throughout the meal , with her eyes fixed on his face .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 36]: Mr. Martin noted this manoeuvre -- it occurred regularly twice a day -- with a stealthy smile at the girl , and her light skin flushed while her lip curled shrewishly at the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 25]: `` Oh , all right , Cynthy , '' he whispered to her , and chuckled aloud at her angry toss of the head .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 25]: `` Schofields ' seemed to be kind of put out with me this evening , '' he remarked , addressing himself to the company .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 13]: `` He 's the most ungratefullest cuss I ever come up with .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 16]: I was only oratin ' on how proud the city ought to be of him .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 21]: He fairly keeps Plattville 's sportin ' spirit on the gog ; ` die out , was n't for him .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 71]: There 's be 'n more money laid on him whether he 'll strike over and above the hour , or under and below , or whether he 'll strike fifteen minutes before time , or twenty after , than -- well , sir , we 'd all forgit the language if it was n't for Schofields ' bell to keep us talkin ' ; that 's _ my _ claim .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 13]: Dull days , think of the talk he furnishes all over town .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 9]: Think what he 's done to promote conversation .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 72]: Now , for instance , Anna Belle Bardlock 's got a beau , they say '' -- here old Tom tilted back in his chair and turned an innocent eye upon a youth across the table , young William Todd , who was blushing over his griddle-cakes -- `` and I hear he 's a good deal scared of Anna Belle and not just what you might call brash with her .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 73]: They say every Sunday night he 'll go up to Bardlocks ' and call on Anna Belle from half-past six till nine , and when he 's got into his chair he sets and looks at the floor and the crayon portraits till about seven ; then he opens his tremblin ' lips and says , ` Reckon Schofields ' must be on his way to the court-house by this time . '
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 30]: And about an hour later , when Schofields ' hits four or five , he 'll speak up again , ` Say , I reckon he means eight . '
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 80]: ` Long towards nine o'clock , they say he skews around in his chair and says , ` Wonder if he 'll strike before time or after , ' and Anna Belle answers out loud , ' I hope after , ' for politeness ; but in her soul she says , ' I pray before ' ; and then Schofields ' hits her up for eighteen or twenty , and Anna Belle 's company reaches for his hat .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 20]: Three Sundays ago he turned around before he went out and said , ` Do you like apple-butter ? '
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 7]: but never waited to find out .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 45]: It 's the same programme every Sunday evening , and Jim Bardlock says Anna Belle 's so worn out you would n't hardly know her for the blithe creature she was last year -- the excitement 's be 'n too much for her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 19]: Poor William Todd bent his fiery face over the table and suffered the general snicker in helpless silence .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 28]: Then there was quiet for a space , broken only by the click of knives against the heavy china and the indolent rustle of Cynthia 's fly-brush .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 48]: `` Town so still , '' observed the landlord , finally , with a complacent glance at the dessert course of prunes to which his guests were helping themselves from a central reservoir , `` Town so still , hardly seems like show-day 's come round again .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 37]: Yet there 's be 'n some shore signs lately : when my shavers come honeyin ' up with , ` Say , pa , ai n't they no urrands I can go for ye , pa ?
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 36]: I like to run 'em for you , pa , ' -- ` relse , ` Oh , pa , ai n't they no water I can haul , or nothin ' , pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 43]: -- ` relse , as little Rosina T. says , this morning , ` Pa , I always pray fer _ you _ pa , ' and pa this and pa that-you can rely either Christmas or show-day 's mighty close . ''
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 34]: William Todd , taking occasion to prove himself recovered from confusion , remarked casually that there was another token of the near approach of the circus , as ole Wilkerson was drunk again .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 7]: `` There 's a man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 6]: exclaimed Mr. Martin with enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 11]: `` There 's the feller for _ my _ money !
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 21]: He does his duty as a citizen more discriminatin ` ly on public occasions than any man I ever see .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 23]: There 's Wilkerson 's celebration when there 's a funeral ; look at the difference between it and on Fourth of July .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 46]: Why , sir , it 's as melancholy as a hearse-plume , and sympathy ai n't the word for it when he looks at the remains , no sir ; preacher nor undertaker , either , ai n't _ half _ as blue and respectful .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 6]: Then take his circus spree .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 74]: He come into the store this afternoon , head up , marchin ' like a grenadier and shootin ' his hand out before his face and drawin ' it back again , and hollering out , ` Ta , ta , ta-ra-ta , ta , ta-ta-ra ' -- why , the dumbest man ever lived could see in a minute show 's ` comin ' to-morrow and Wilkerson 's playin ' the trombone .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 10]: Then he 'd snort and goggle like an elephant .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 16]: Got the biggest sense of appropriateness of any man in the county , Wilkerson has .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 8]: Folks do n't half appreciate him . ''
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 68]: As each boarder finished his meal he raided the glass of wooden toothpicks and went away with no standing on the order of his going ; but Martin waited for Harkless , who , not having attended to business so concisely as the others , was the last to leave the table , and they stood for a moment under the awning outside , lighting their cigars .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 9]: `` Call on the judge , to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 17]: `` Did n't you see the lady with Minnie and the judge at the lecture ? ''
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 8]: `` I caught a glimpse of her .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 9]: That 's what Bowlder meant , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 21]: `` I do n't know what Bowlder meant , but I guess you better go out there , young man .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 8]: She might not stay here long . ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 32]: THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER The Briscoe buckboard rattled along the elastic country-road , the roans setting a sharp pace as they turned eastward on the pike toward home and supper .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 20]: `` They 'll make the eight miles in three-quarters of an hour , '' said the judge , proudly .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 7]: He pointed ahead with his whip .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 11]: `` Just beyond that bend we pass through Six-Cross-Roads . ''
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 6]: Miss Sherwood leaned forward eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 14]: `` Can we see ` Mr. Wimby 's ' house from here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 18]: `` No , it 's on the other side , nearer town ; we pass it later .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 11]: It 's the only respectable-looking house in this township . ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 20]: They reached the turn of the road , and the judge touched up his colts to a sharper gait .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 11]: `` No need of dallying , '' he observed quietly .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 14]: `` It always makes me a little sick just to see the place .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 10]: I 'd hate to have a break-down here . ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 20]: They came in sight of a squalid settlement , built raggedly about a blacksmith 's shop and a saloon .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 120]: Half-a-dozen shanties clustered near the forge , a few roofs scattered through the shiftlessly cultivated fields , four or five barns propped by fence-rails , some sheds with gaping apertures through which the light glanced from side to side , a squad of thin , `` razor-back '' hogs -- now and then worried by gaunt hounds -- and some abused-looking hens , groping about disconsolately in the mire , a broken-topped buggy with a twisted wheel settling into the mud of the middle of the road -LRB- there was always abundant mud , here , in the dryest summer -RRB- , a lowering face sneering from a broken window -- Six-Cross-Roads was forbidding and forlorn enough by day .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 48]: The thought of what might issue from it by night was unpleasant , and the legends of the Cross-Roads , together with an unshapen threat , easily fancied in the atmosphere of the place , made Miss Sherwood shiver as though a cold draught had crossed her .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 7]: `` It is so sinister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 6]: `` And so unspeakably mean !
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 15]: This is where they live , the people who hate him , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 6]: The ` White-Caps ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 13]: `` They are just a lot of rowdies , '' replied Briscoe .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 38]: `` You have your rough corners in big cities , and I expect there are mighty few parts of any country that do n't have their tough neighborhoods , only Six-Cross-Roads happens to be worse than most .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 23]: They choose to call themselves ` White-Caps , ' but I guess it 's just a name they like to give themselves .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 28]: Usually White-Caps are a vigilance committee going after rascalities the law does n't reach , or wo n't reach , but these fellows are not that kind .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 75]: They got together to wipe out their grudges -- and sometimes they did n't need any grudge and let loose their deviltries just for pure orneriness ; setting haystacks afire and such like ; or , where a farmer had offended them , they would put on their silly toggery and take him out at midnight and whip him and plunder his house and chase the horses and cattle into his corn , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 12]: They say the women went with them on their raids . ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 13]: `` And he was the first to try to stop them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 17]: `` Well , you see our folks are pretty long-suffering , '' Briscoe replied , apologetically .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 14]: `` We 'd sort of got used to the meanness of the Cross-Roads .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 13]: It took a stranger to stir things up -- and he did .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 15]: He sent eight of 'em to the penitentiary , some for twenty years . ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 16]: As they passed the saloon a man stepped into the doorway and looked at them .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 63]: He was coatless and clad in garments worn to the color of dust ; his bare head was curiously malformed , higher on one side than on the other , and though the buckboard passed rapidly , and at a distance , this singular lopsidedness was plainly visible to the occupants , lending an ugly significance to his meagre , yellow face .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 11]: He was tall , lean , hard , powerfully built .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 24]: He eyed the strangers with affected languor , and then , when they had gone by , broke into sudden , loud laughter .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 17]: `` That was Bob Skillett , the worst of the lot , '' said the judge .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 26]: `` Harkless sent his son and one brother to prison , and it nearly broke his heart that he could n't swear to Bob . ''
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 13]: When they were beyond the village and in the open road again .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 7]: Miss Sherwood took a deep breath .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 12]: `` I think I breathe more freely , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 11]: `` That was a hideous laugh he sent after us .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 22]: I had heard of places like this before -- and I do n't think I care to see many of them .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 32]: As I understand it , Six-Cross-Roads is entirely vicious , is n't it ; and bears the same relation to the country that the slums do to a city ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 6]: `` That 's about it .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 6]: They make their own whiskey .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 30]: I presume ; and they have their own fights amongst themselves , but they settle 'em themselves , too , and keep their own counsel and hush it up .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 16]: Lige Willetts , Minnie 's friend -- I guess she 's told you about Lige ?
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 68]: -- well , Lige Willetts will go anywhere when he 's following a covey , though mostly the boys leave this part of the country alone when they 're hunting ; but Lige got into a thicket back of the forge one morning , and he came on a crowd of buzzards quarrelling over a heap on the ground , and he got out in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 21]: He said he was sure it was a dog ; but he ran almost all the way to Plattville . ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 4]: `` Father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 10]: exclaimed his daughter , leaning from the back seat .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 25]: `` Do n't tell such stories to Helen ; she 'll think we 're horrible , and you 'll frighten her , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 17]: `` Well , it is n't exactly a lady 's story , '' said the judge .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 10]: He glanced at his guest 's face and chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 15]: `` I guess we wo n't frighten her much , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 19]: `` Young lady , I do n't believe you 'd be afraid of many things , would you ?
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 7]: You do n't look like it .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 44]: Besides , the Cross-Roads is n't Plattville , and the White-Caps have been too scared to do anything much , except try to get even with the ` Herald , ' for the last two years ; ever since it went for them .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 25]: They 're laying for Harkless partly for revenge and partly because they dare n't do anything until he 's out of the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 13]: The girl gave a low cry with a sharp intake of breath .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 9]: One grows tired of this everlasting American patience !
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 34]: Why do n't the Plattville people do something before they -- '' `` It 's just as I say , '' Briscoe answered ; `` our folks are sort of used to them .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 37]: I expect we do about all we can ; the boys look after him nights , and the main trouble is that we ca n't make him understand he ought to be more afraid of them .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 12]: If he 'd lived here all his life he would be .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 28]: You know there 's an old-time feud between the Cross-Roads and our folks ; goes way back into pioneer history and mighty few know anything of it .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 51]: Old William Platt and the forefathers of the Bardlocks and Tibbses and Briscoes and Schofields moved up here from North Carolina a good deal just to get away from some bad neighbors , mostly Skilletts and Johnsons -- one of the Skilletts had killed old William Platt 's two sons .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 37]: But the Skilletts and Johnsons followed all the way to Indiana to join in making the new settlement , and they shot Platt at his cabin door one night , right where the court-house stands to-day .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 22]: Then the other settlers drove them out for good , and they went seven miles west and set up a still .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 38]: A band of Indians , on the way to join the Shawnee Prophet at Tippecanoe , came down on the Cross-Roads , and the Cross-Roaders bought them off with bad whiskey and sent them over to Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 28]: Nearly all the Plattville men were away , fighting under Harrison , and when they came back there were only a few half-crazy women and children left .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 7]: They 'd hid in the woods .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 37]: `` The men stopped just long enough to hear how it was , and started for the Cross-Roads ; but the Cross-Roads people caught them in an ambush and not many of our folks got back .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 35]: `` We really never did get even with them , though all the early settlers lived and died still expecting to see the day when Plattville would go over and pay off the score .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 42]: It 's the same now as it was then , good stock with us , bad stock over here ; and all the country riff-raff in creation come and live with 'em when other places get too hot to hold them .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 60]: Only one or two of us old folks know what the original trouble was about ; but you ask a Plattville man , to-day , what he thinks of the Cross-Roads and he 'll be mighty apt to say , ' I guess we 'll all have to go over there some time and wipe those hoodlums out . '
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 10]: It 's been coming to that a long time .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 21]: The work the ` Herald ' did has come nearer bringing us even with Six-Cross-Roads than anything else ever has .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 25]: Queer , too -- a man that 's only lived in Plattville a few years to be settling such an old score for us .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 22]: They 'll do their best to get him , and if they do there 'll be trouble of an illegal nature .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 73]: I think our people would go over there again , but I expect there would n't be any ambush this time ; and the pioneers , might rest easier in -- '' He broke off suddenly and nodded to a little old man in a buckboard , who was turning off from the road into a farm lane which led up to a trim cottage with a honeysuckle vine by the door .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 16]: `` That 's Mrs. Wimby 's husband , '' said the judge in an undertone .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 20]: Miss Sherwood observed that `` Mrs. Wimby 's husband '' was remarkable for the exceeding plaintiveness of his expression .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 112]: He was a weazened , blank , pale-eyed little man , with a thin , white mist of neck whisker ; his coat was so large for him that the sleeves were rolled up from his wrists with several turns , and , as he climbed painfully to the ground to open the gate of the lane , it needed no perspicuous eye to perceive that his trousers had been made for a much larger man , for , as his uncertain foot left the step of his vehicle , one baggy leg of the garment fell down over his foot , completely concealing his boot and hanging some inches beneath .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 51]: A faintly vexed expression crossed his face as he endeavored to arrange the disorder , but he looked up and returned Briscoe 's bow , sadly , with an air of explaining that he was accustomed to trouble , and that the trousers had behaved no worse than he expected .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 34]: No more inoffensive or harmless figure than this feeble little old man could be imagined ; yet his was the distinction of having received a terrible visit from his neighbors of the Cross-Roads .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 27]: Mrs. Wimby was a widow , who owned a comfortable farm , and she had refused every offer of the neighboring ill-eligible bachelors to share it .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 66]: However , a vagabonding tinker won her heart , and after their marriage she continued to be known as `` Mrs. Wimby '' ; for so complete was the bridegroom 's insignificance that it extended to his name , which proved quite unrememberable , and he was usually called `` Widder-Woman Wimby 's Husband , '' or , more simply , `` Mr. Wimby . ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 84]: The bride supplied the needs of his wardrobe with the garments of her former husband , and , alleging this proceeding as the cause of their anger , the Cross-Roads raiders , clad as `` White-Caps , '' broke into the farmhouse one night , looted it , tore the old man from his bed , and compelling his wife , who was tenderly devoted to him , to watch , they lashed him with sapling shoots till he was near to death .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 51]: A little yellow cur , that had followed his master on his wanderings , was found licking the old man 's wounds , and they deluged the dog with kerosene and then threw the poor animal upon a bonfire they had made , and danced around it in heartiest enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 41]: The man recovered , but that was no palliation of the offense to the mind of a hot-eyed young man from the East , who was besieging the county authorities for redress and writing brimstone and saltpetre for his paper .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 44]: The powers of the county proving either lackadaisical or timorous , he appealed to those of the State , and he went every night to sleep at a farmhouse , the owner of which had received a warning from the `` White-Caps . ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 17]: And one night it befell that he was rewarded , for the raiders attempted an entrance .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 23]: He and the farmer and the former 's sons beat off the marauders and did a satisfactory amount of damage in return .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 16]: Two of the `` White-Caps '' they captured and bound , and others they recognized .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 32]: Then the State authorities hearkened to the voice of the `` Herald '' and its owner ; there were arrests , and in the course of time there was a trial .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 38]: Every prisoner proved an alibi , could have proved a dozen ; but the editor of the `` Herald , '' after virtually conducting the prosecution , went upon the stand and swore to man after man .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 17]: Eight men went to the penitentiary on his evidence , five of them for twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 14]: The Plattville Brass Band serenaded the editor of the `` Herald '' again .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 61]: There were no more raids , and the Six-Cross-Roads men who were left kept to their hovels , appalled and shaken , but , as time went by and left them unmolested , they recovered a measure of their hardiness and began to think on what they should do to the man who had brought misfortune and terror upon them .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 27]: For a long time he had been publishing their threatening letters and warnings in a column which he headed : `` Humor of the Day . ''
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 49]: `` Harkless do n't understand the Cross-Roads , '' Briscoe said to Miss Sherwood as they left the Wimby farm behind ; `` and then he 's like most of us ; hardly any of us realizes that harm 's ever going to come to _ us _ .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 21]: Harkless was anxious enough about other people , but -- '' The young lady interrupted him , touching his arm .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 4]: `` Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 23]: she said , `` Did n't you see a child , a little girl , ahead of us on the road ? ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 19]: `` I noticed one a minute ago , but she 's not there now , '' answered Briscoe .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 47]: `` There was a child walking along the road just ahead , but she turned and saw us coming , and she disappeared in the most curious way ; she seemed to melt into the weeds at the roadside , across from the elder-bush yonder . ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 10]: The judge pulled in the horses by the elder-bush .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 28]: `` No child here , now , '' he said , `` but you 're right ; there certainly was one , just before you spoke . ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 17]: The young corn was low in the fields , and there was no hiding-place in sight .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 19]: `` I 'm very superstitious ; I am sure it was an imp , '' Miss Sherwood said .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 19]: `` An imp or a very large chameleon ; she was exactly the color of the road . ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 26]: `` A Cross-Roads imp , '' said the judge , lifting the reins , `` and in that case we might as well give up .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 26]: I never set up to be a match for those people , and the children are as mean as their fathers , and smarter . ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 76]: When the buckboard had rattled on a hundred yards or so , a little figure clad in a tattered cotton gown rose up from the weeds , not ten feet from where the judge had drawn rein , and continued its march down the road toward Plattville , capering in the dust and pursuing the buckboard with malignant gestures till the clatter of the horses was out of hearing , the vehicle out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 51]: Something over two hours later , as Mr. Martin was putting things to rights in his domain , the Dry-Goods Emporium , previous to his departure for the evening 's gossip and checkers at the drug-store , he stumbled over something soft , lying on the floor behind a counter .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 36]: The thing rose , and would have evaded him , but he put out his hands and pinioned it and dragged it to the show-window where the light of the fading day defined his capture .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 9]: The capture shrieked and squirmed and fought earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 37]: Grasped by the shoulder he held a lean , fierce-eyed , undersized girl of fourteen , clad in one ragged cotton garment , unless the coat of dust she wore over all may be esteemed another .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 24]: Her cheeks were sallow , and her brow was already shrewdly lined , and her eyes were as hypocritical as they were savage .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 25]: She was very thin and little , but old Tom 's brown face grew a shade nearer white when the light fell upon her .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 12]: `` You 're no Plattville girl , '' he said sharply .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 5]: `` You lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 4]: cried the child .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 4]: `` You lie !
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 3]: I am !
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 8]: You leave me go , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 13]: I 'm lookin ' fer pap and you 're a liar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 18]: `` You crawled in here to sleep , after your seven-mile walk , did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 4]: Martin went on .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 11]: `` You 're a liar , '' she screamed again .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 72]: `` Look here , '' said Martin , slowly , `` you go back to Six-Cross-Roads and tell your folks that if anything happens to a hair of Mr. Harkless 's head every shanty in your town will burn , and your grandfather and your father and your uncles and your brothers and your cousins and your second-cousins and your third-cousins will never have the good luck to see the penitentiary .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 7]: Reckon you can remember that message ?
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 28]: But before I let you go to carry it , I guess you might as well hand out the paper they sent you over here with . ''
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 14]: His prisoner fell into a paroxysm of rage , and struck at him .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 13]: `` I 'll git pap to kill ye , '' she shrieked .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 33]: `` I don ' know nothin ' ` bout yer Six-Cross-Roads , ner no papers , ner yer dam Mister Harkels neither , ner _ you _ , ye razor-backed ole devil !
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 15]: Pap 'll kill ye ; leave me go -- leave me _ go _ !
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 17]: -- Pap 'll kill ye ; I 'll git him to _ kill _ ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 55]: Suddenly her struggles ceased ; her eyes closed ; her tense little muscles relaxed and she drooped toward the floor ; the old man shifted his grip to support her , and in an instant she twisted out of his hands and sprang out of reach , her eyes shining with triumph and venom .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 7]: `` Ya-hay , Mister Razor-back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 3]: she shrilled .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 7]: `` How 's that fer hi ?
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 7]: Pap 'll kill ye , Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 28]: You 'll be screechin ' in hell in a week , an ' we ` ull set up an ' drink our apple-jack an ' laff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 59]: Martin pursued her lumberingly , but she was agile as a monkey , and ran dodging up and down the counters and mocked him , singing `` Gran ' mammy Tipsy-Toe , '' till at last she tired of the game and darted out of the door , flinging back a hoarse laugh at him as she went .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 20]: He followed ; but when he reached the street she was a mere shadow flitting under the courthouse trees .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 15]: He looked after her forebodingly , then turned his eyes toward the Palace Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 33]: The editor of the `` Herald '' was seated under the awning , with his chair tilted back against a post , gazing dreamily at the murky red afterglow in the west .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 15]: `` What 's the use of tryin ' to bother him with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 5]: old Tom asked himself .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 7]: `` He 'd only laugh . ''
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 14]: He noted that young William Todd sat near the editor , whittling absently .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 3]: Martin chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 10]: `` William 's turn to-night , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 13]: `` Well , the boys take mighty good care of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 19]: He locked the doors of the Emporium , tried them , and dropped the keys in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 28]: As he crossed the Square to the drug-store , where his cronies awaited him , he turned again to look at the figure of the musing journalist .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 23]: `` I hope he 'll go out to the judge 's , '' he said , and shook his head , sadly .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 15]: `` I do n't reckon Plattville 's any too spry for that young man .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 8]: Five years he 's be 'n here .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 23]: Well , it 's a good thing for us folks , but I guess it ai n't exactly high-life for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 10]: He kicked a stick out of his way impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 11]: `` Now , where 'd that imp run to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 3]: he grumbled .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 9]: The imp was lying under the court-house steps .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 30]: When the sound of Martin 's footsteps had passed away , she crept cautiously from her hiding-place and stole through the ungroomed grass to the fence opposite the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 36]: Here she stretched herself flat in the weeds and took from underneath the tangled masses of her hair , where it was tied with a string , a rolled-up , crumpled slip of greasy paper .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 27]: With this in her fingers , she lay peering under the fence , her fierce eyes fixed unwinkingly on Harkless and the youth sitting near him .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 57]: The street ran flat and gray in the slowly gathering dusk , straight to the western horizon where the sunset embers were strewn in long , dark-red streaks ; the maple trees were clean-cut silhouettes against the pale rose and pearl tints of the sky above , and a tenderness seemed to tremble in the air .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 57]: Harkless often vowed to himself he would watch no more sunsets in Plattville ; he realized that their loveliness lent a too unhappy tone to the imaginings and introspections upon which he was thrown by the loneliness of the environment , and he considered that he had too much time in which to think about himself .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 18]: For five years his introspections had monotonously hurled one word at him : `` Failure ; Failure !
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 3]: Failure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 9]: He thought the sunsets were making him morbid .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 12]: Could he have shared them , that would have been different .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 22]: His long , melancholy face grew longer and more melancholy in the twilight , while William Todd patiently whittled near by .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 38]: Plattville had often discussed the editor 's habit of silence , and Mr. Martin had suggested that possibly the reason Mr. Harkless was such a quiet man was that there was nobody for him to talk to .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 27]: His hearers did not agree , for the population of Carlow County was a thing of pride , being greater than that of several bordering counties .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 32]: They did agree , however , that Harkless 's quiet was not unkind , whatever its cause , and that when it was broken it was usually broken to conspicuous effect .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 14]: Perhaps it was because he wrote so much that he hated to talk .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 22]: A bent figure came slowly down the street , and William hailed it cheerfully : `` Evening , Mr. Fisbee . ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 16]: `` A good evening , Mr. Todd , '' answered the old man , pausing .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 13]: `` Ah , Mr. Harkless , I was looking for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 31]: He had not seemed to be looking for anything beyond the boundaries of his own dreams , but he approached Harkless , tugging nervously at some papers in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 11]: `` I have completed my notes for our Saturday edition .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 11]: It was quite easy ; there is much doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 17]: `` Thank you , Mr. Fisbee , '' said Harkless , as he took the manuscript .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 12]: `` Have you finished your paper on the earlier Christian symbolism ?
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 15]: I hope the ` Herald ' may have the honor of printing it . ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 7]: This was the form they used .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 15]: `` I shall be the recipient of honor , sir , '' returned Fisbee .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 51]: `` Your kind offer will speed my work ; but I fear , Mr. Harkless , I very much fear , that your kindness alone prompts it , for , deeply as I desire it , I can not truthfully say that my essays appear to increase our circulation . ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 72]: He made an odd , troubled gesture as he went on : `` They do not seem to read them here , Mr. Harkless , although Mr. Martin assures me that he carefully peruses my article on Chaldean decoration whenever he rearranges his exhibition windows , and I bear in mind the clipping from a Rouen paper you showed me , commenting generously upon the scholarship of the ` Herald . '
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 31]: But for fifteen years I have tried to improve the art feeling in Plattville , and I may say that I have worked in the face of no small discouragement .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 39]: In fact , '' -LRB- there was a slight quaver in Fisbee 's voice -RRB- , `` I can not remember that I ever received the slightest word or token of encouragement till you came , Mr. Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 43]: Since then I have labored with refreshed energy ; still , I can not claim that our architecture shows a change for the better , and I fear the engravings upon the walls of our people exhibit no great progress in selection .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 47]: And -- I -- I wish also to say , Mr. Harkless , if you find it necessary to make some alterations in the form of my reportorial items for Saturday 's issue , I shall perfectly understand , remembering your explanation that journalism demands it .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 5]: Good-evening , Mr. Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 6]: Good-evening , Mr. Todd . ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 12]: He plodded on a few paces , then turned , irresolutely .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 8]: `` What is it , Fisbee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 3]: asked Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 26]: Fisbee stood for a moment , as though about to speak , then he smiled faintly , shook his head , and went his way .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 7]: Harkless stared after him , surprised .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 30]: It suddenly struck him , with a feeling of irritation , that if Fisbee had spoken it would have been to advise him to call at Judge Briscoe 's .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 44]: He laughed impatiently at the notion , and , drawing his pencil and a pad from his pocket , proceeded to injure his eyes in the waning twilight by the editorial perusal of the items his staff had just left in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 45]: When published , the manuscript came under a flaring heading , bequeathed by Harkless 's predecessor in the chair of the `` Herald , '' and the alteration of which he felt Plattville would refuse to sanction : `` Happenings of Our City . ''
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 40]: Below , was printed in smaller type : `` Improvements in the World of Business , '' and , beneath that , came the rubric : `` Also , the Cradle , the Altar , and the Tomb . ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 29]: The first of Fisbee 's items was thus recorded : `` It may be noted that the new sign-board of Mr. H. Miller has been put in place .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 24]: We can not but regret that Mr. Miller did not instruct the painter to confine himself to a simpler method of lettering . ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 32]: `` Ah , Fisbee , '' murmured the editor , reproachfully , `` that new sign-board is almost the only improvement in the World of Business Plattville has seen this year .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 42]: I wonder how many times we have used it from the first , ` It is rumored in business circles that Herve Miller contemplates ' -- to the exciting , ` Under Way , ' and , ` Finishing Touches . '
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 14]: My poor White Knight , are five years of training wasted on you ?
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 7]: Sometimes you make me fear it .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 24]: Here is Plattville panting for our story of the hanging of the sign , and you throw away the climax like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 16]: He began to write rapidly , bending low over the pad in the half darkness .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 26]: His narrative was an amplification of the interesting information -LRB- already possessed by every inhabitant -RRB- that Herve Miller had put up a new sign .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 18]: After a paragraph of handsome description , `` Herve is always enterprising , '' wrote the editor .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 10]: `` This is a move in the right direction .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 7]: Herve , keep it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 14]: He glanced over the other items meditatively , making alterations here and there .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 50]: The last two Fisbee had written as follows : `` There is noticeable in the new -LRB- and somewhat incongruous -RRB- portico erected by Solomon Tibbs at the residence of Mr. Henry Tibbs Willetts , an attempt at rococo decoration which can not fail to sadden the passer-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 30]: `` Miss Sherwood of Rouen , whom Miss Briscoe knew at the Misses Jennings ' finishing-school in New York , is a guest of Judge Briscoe 's household . ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 18]: Fisbee 's items were written in ink ; and there was a blank space beneath the last .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 13]: At the bottom of the page something had been scribbled in pencil .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 35]: Harkless tried vainly to decipher it , but the twilight had fallen too deep , and the writing was too faint , so he struck a match and held it close to the paper .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 32]: The action betokened only a languid interest , but when he caught sight of the first of the four subscribed lines he sat up straight in his chair with an ejaculation .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 79]: At the bottom of Fisbee 's page was written in a dainty , feminine hand , of a type he had not seen for years : '' ` The time has come , ' the Walrus said , ` To talk of many things : Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing-wax -- And cabbages -- and kings -- ' '' He put the paper in his pocket , and set off rapidly down the village street .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 21]: At his departure William Todd looked up quickly ; then he got upon his feet and quietly followed the editor .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 22]: In the dusk a tattered little figure rose up from the weeds across the way , and stole noiselessly after William .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 12]: He was in his shirt-sleeves , his waistcoat unbuttoned and loose .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 33]: On the nearest corner Mr. Todd encountered a fellow-townsman , who had been pacing up and down in front of a cottage , crooning to a protestive baby held in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 11]: He had paused in his vigil to stare after Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 9]: `` Whereas he bound for , William ? ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 7]: inquired the man with the baby .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 12]: `` Briscoes ' , '' answered William , pursuing his way .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 39]: `` I reckoned he would be , '' commented the other , turning to his wife , who sat on the doorstep , `` I reckoned so when I see that lady at the lecture last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 7]: The woman rose to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 7]: `` Hi , Bill Todd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 12]: `` What you got onto the back of your vest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 21]: William paused , put his hand behind him and encountered a paper pinned to the dangling strap of his waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 10]: The woman ran to him and unpinned the paper .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 5]: It bore a writing .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 49]: They took it to where the yellow lamp-light shone through the open door , and read : `` der Sir `` FoLer harkls aL yo ples an gaRd him yoR best venagesn is closteR , harkls not Got 3 das to liv `` We come in Wite . ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 8]: `` What ye think , William ? ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 9]: asked the man with the baby , anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 13]: But the woman gave the youth a sharp push with her hand .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 9]: `` They never dast to do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 6]: `` Never in the world !
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 6]: You hurry , Bill Todd .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 13]: Do n't you leave him out of your sight one second . ''
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 3]: CHAPTER V .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 56]: AT THE PASTURE BARS : ELDER-BUSHES MAY HAVE STINGS The street upon which the Palace Hotel fronted formed the south side of the Square and ran west to the edge of the town , where it turned to the south for a quarter of a mile or more , then bent to the west again .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 29]: Some distance from this second turn , there stood , fronting close on the road , a large brick house , the most pretentious mansion in Carlow County .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 46]: And yet it was a homelike place , with its red-brick walls embowered in masses of cool Virginia creeper , and a comfortable veranda crossing the broad front , while half a hundred stalwart sentinels of elm and beech and poplar stood guard around it .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 19]: The front walk was bordered by geraniums and hollyhocks ; and honeysuckle climbed the pillars of the porch .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 55]: Behind the house there was a shady little orchard ; and , back of the orchard , an old-fashioned , very fragrant rose-garden , divided by a long grape arbor , extended to the shallow waters of a wandering creek ; and on the bank a rustic seat was placed , beneath the sycamores .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 52]: From the first bend of the road , where it left the town and became -LRB- after some indecision -RRB- a country highway -- called the pike -- rather than a proud city boulevard , a pathway led through the fields to end at some pasture bars opposite the brick house .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 9]: John Harkless was leaning on the pasture bars .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 14]: The stars were wan , and the full moon shone over the fields .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 16]: Meadows and woodlands lay quiet under the old , sweet marvel of a June night .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 24]: In the wide monotony of the flat lands , there sometimes comes a feeling that the whole earth is stretched out before one .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 31]: To-night it seemed to lie so , in the pathos of silent beauty , all passive and still ; yet breathing an antique message , sad , mysterious , reassuring .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 12]: But there had come a divine melody adrift on the air .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 7]: Through the open windows it floated .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 26]: Indoors some one struck a peal of silver chords , like a harp touched by a lover , and a woman 's voice was lifted .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 16]: John Harkless leaned on the pasture bars and listened with upraised head and parted lips .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 14]: `` To thy chamber window roving , love hath led my feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 13]: The Lord sent manna to the children of Israel in the wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 50]: Harkless had been five years in Plattville , and a woman 's voice singing Schubert 's serenade came to him at last as he stood by the pasture bars of Jones 's field and listened and rested his dazzled eyes on the big , white face of the moon .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 37]: How long had it been since he had heard a song , or any discourse of music other than that furnished by the Plattville Band -- not that he had not taste for a brass band !
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 25]: But music that he loved always gave him an ache of delight and the twinge of reminiscences of old , gay days gone forever .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 63]: To-night his memory leaped to the last day of a June gone seven years ; to a morning when the little estuary waves twinkled in the bright sun about the boat in which he sat , the trim launch that brought a cheery party ashore from their schooner to the Casino landing at Winter Harbor , far up on the Maine coast .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 23]: It was the happiest of those last irresponsible days before he struck into his work in the world and became a failure .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 41]: To-night he saw the picture as plainly as if it were yesterday ; no reminiscence had risen so keenly before his eyes for years : pretty Mrs. Van Skuyt sitting beside him -- pretty Mrs. Van Skuyt and her roses !
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 6]: What had become of her ?
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 68]: He saw the crowd of friends waiting on the pier for their arrival , and the dozen or so emblazoned classmates -LRB- it was in the time of brilliant flannels -RRB- who suddenly sent up a volley of college cheers in his honor -- how plainly the dear , old , young faces rose up before him to-night , the men from whose lives he had slipped !
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 48]: Dearest and jolliest of the faces was that of Tom Meredith , clubmate , classmate , his closest friend , the thin , red-headed third baseman ; he could see Tom 's mouth opened at least a yard , it seemed , such was his frantic vociferousness .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 11]: Again and again the cheers rang out , `` Harkless !
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 3]: Harkless ! ''
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 6]: on the end of them .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 51]: In those days everybody -LRB- particularly his classmates -RRB- thought he would be minister to England in a few years , and the orchestra on the Casino porch was playing `` The Conquering Hero , '' in his honor , and at the behest of Tom Meredith , he knew .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 50]: There were other pretty ladies besides Mrs. Van Skuyt in the launch-load from the yacht , but , as they touched the pier , pretty girls , or pretty women , or jovial gentlemen , all were overlooked in the wild scramble the college men made for their hero .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 24]: They haled him forth , set him on high , bore him on their shoulders , shouting `` Skal to the Viking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 11]: and carried him up the wooded bluff to the Casino .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 30]: He heard Mrs. Van Skuyt say , `` Oh , we 're used to it ; we 've put in at several other places where he had friends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 15]: He struggled manfully to be set down , but his triumphal procession swept on .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 49]: He heard bystanders telling each other , `` It 's that young Harkless , ` the Great Harkless , ' they 're all so mad about '' ; and while it pleased him a little to hear such things , they always made him laugh a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 53]: He had never understood his popularity : he had been chief editor of the university daily , and he had done a little in athletics , and the rest of his distinction lay in college offices his mates had heaped upon him without his being able to comprehend why they did it .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 32]: And yet , somehow , and in spite of himself , they had convinced him that the world was his oyster ; that it would open for him at a touch .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 59]: He could not help seeing how the Freshmen looked at him , how the Sophomores jumped off the narrow campus walks to let him pass ; he could not help knowing that he was the great man of his time , so that `` The Great Harkless '' came to be one of the traditions of the university .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 32]: He remembered the wild progress they made for him up the slope that morning at Winter Harbor , how the people baked on , and laughed , and clapped their hands .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 30]: But at the veranda edge he had noticed a little form disappearing around a corner of the building ; a young girl running away as fast as she could .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 5]: `` See there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 18]: he said , as the tribe set him down , `` You have frightened the populace . ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 21]: And Tom Meredith stopped shouting long enough to answer , `` It 's my little cousin , overcome with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 36]: She 's been counting the hours till you came -- been hearing of you from me and others for a good while ; and has n't been able to talk or think of anything else .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 27]: She 's only fifteen , and the crucial moment is too much for her -- the Great Harkless has arrived , and she has fled . ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 37]: He remembered other incidents of his greatness , of the glory that now struck him as rarely comical ; he hoped he had n't taken it too seriously then , in the flush of his youth .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 36]: Maybe , after all , he had been a , big-headed boy , but he must have bottled up his conceit tightly enough , or the other boys would have detected it and abhorred him .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 22]: He was inclined to believe that he had not been very much set up by the pomp they made for him .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 34]: At all events , that day at Winter Harbor had been beautiful , full of the laughter of friends and music ; for there was a musicale at the Casino in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 50]: But the present hour grew on him as he leaned on the pasture bars , and suddenly his memories sped ; and the voice that was singing Schubert 's serenade across the way touched him with the urgent , personal appeal that a present beauty always had for him .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 43]: It was a soprano ; and without tremolo , yet came to his ear with a certain tremulous sweetness ; it was soft and slender , but the listener knew it could be lifted with fullness and power if the singer would .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 15]: It spoke only of the song , yet the listener thought of the singer .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 59]: Under the moon thoughts run into dreams , and he dreamed that the owner of the voice , she who quoted `` The Walrus and the Carpenter '' on Fisbee 's notes , was one to laugh with you and weep with you ; yet her laughter would be tempered with sorrow , and her tears with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 21]: When the song was ended , he struck the rail he leaned upon a sharp blow with his open hand .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 54]: There swept over him a feeling that he had stood precisely where he stood now , on such a night , a thousand years ago , had heard that voice and that song , had listened and been moved by the song , and the night , just as he was moved now .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 19]: He had long known himself for a sentimentalist ; he had almost given up trying to cure himself .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 19]: And he knew himself for a born lover ; he had always been in love with some one .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 44]: In his earlier youth his affections had been so constantly inconstant that he finally came to settle with his self-respect by recognizing in himself a fine constancy that worshipped one woman always -- it was only the shifting image of her that changed !
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 34]: Somewhere -LRB- he dreamed , whimsically indulgent of the fancy ; yet mocking himself for it -RRB- there was a girl whom he had never seen , who waited till he should come .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 4]: She was Everything .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 48]: Until he found her , he could not help adoring others who possessed little pieces and suggestions of her -- her brilliancy , her courage , her short upper lip , `` like a curled roseleaf , '' or her dear voice , or her pure profile .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 13]: He had no recollection of any lady who had quite her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 24]: He had never passed a lovely stranger on the street , in the old days , without a thrill of delight and warmth .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 64]: If he never saw her again , and the vision only lasted the time it takes a lady to cross the sidewalk from a shop door to a carriage , he was always a little in love with her , because she bore about her , somewhere , as did every pretty girl he ever saw , a suggestion of the far-away divinity .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 12]: One does not pass lovely strangers in the streets of Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 16]: Miss Briscoe was pretty , but not at all in the way that Harkless dreamed .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 20]: For five years the lover in him that had loved so often had been starved of all but dreams .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 71]: Only at twilight and dusk in the summer , when , strolling , he caught sight of a woman 's skirt , far up the village street -- half-outlined in the darkness under the cathedral arch of meeting branches -- this romancer of petticoats could sigh a true lover 's sigh , and , if he kept enough distance between , fly a yearning fancy that his lady wandered there .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 17]: Ever since his university days the image of her had been growing more and more distinct .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 14]: He had completely settled his mind as to her appearance and her voice .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 34]: She was tall , almost too tall , he was sure of that ; and out of his consciousness there had grown a sweet and vivacious young face that he knew was hers .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 49]: Her hair was light-brown with gold lustres -LRB- he reveled in the gold lustres , on the proper theory that when your fancy is painting a picture you may as well go in for the whole thing and make it sumptuous -RRB- , and her eyes were gray .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 24]: They were very earnest , and yet they sparkled and laughed to him companionably ; and sometimes he had smiled back upon her .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 35]: The Undine danced before him through the lonely years , on fair nights in his walks , and came to sit by his fire on winter evenings when he stared alone at the embers .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 30]: And to-night , here in Plattville , he heard a voice he had waited for long , one that his fickle memory told him he had never heard before .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 36]: But , listening , he knew better -- he had heard it long ago , though when and how , he did not know , as rich and true , and ineffably tender as now .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 9]: He threw a sop to his common sense .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 46]: `` Miss Sherwood is a little thing '' -LRB- the image was so surely tall -RRB- `` with a bumpy forehead and spectacles , '' he said to himself , `` or else a provincial young lady with big eyes to pose at you . ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 26]: Then he felt the ridiculousness of looking after his common sense on a moonlight night in June ; also , he knew that he lied .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 22]: The song had ceased , but the musician lingered , and the keys were touched to plaintive harmonies new to him .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 31]: He had come to Plattville before `` Cavalleria Rusticana '' was sung at Rome , and now , entranced , he heard the `` Intermezzo '' for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 18]: Listening to this , he feared to move lest he should wake from a summer-night 's dream .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 41]: A ragged little shadow flitted down the path behind him , and from a solitary apple-tree , standing like a lonely ghost in the middle of the field , came the _ woo _ of a screech owl -- twice .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 24]: It was answered -- twice -- from a clump of elder-bushes that grew in a fence-corner fifty yards west of the pasture bars .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 22]: Then the barrel of a squirrel rifle issued , lifted out of the white elder-blossoms , and lay along the fence .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 27]: The music in the house across the way ceased , and Harkless saw two white dresses come out through the long parlor windows to the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 20]: `` It will be cooler out here , '' came the voice of the singer clearly through the quiet .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 6]: `` What a night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 11]: John vaulted the bars and started to cross the road .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 16]: They saw him from the veranda , and Miss Briscoe called to him in welcome .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 35]: As his tall figure stood out plainly in the bright light against the white dust , a streak of fire leaped from the elder-blossoms and there rang out the sharp report of a rifle .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 8]: There were two screams from the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 8]: One white figure ran into the house .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 24]: The other , a little one with a gauzy wrap streaming behind , came flying out into the moonlight -- straight to Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 14]: There was a second report ; the rifle-shot was answered by a revolver .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 26]: William Todd had risen up , apparently from nowhere , and , kneeling by the pasture bars , fired at the flash of the rifle .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 33]: `` Jump fer the shadder , Mr. Harkless , '' he shouted ; `` he 's in them elders , '' and then : `` Fer God 's sake , comeback ! ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 65]: Empty-handed as he was , the editor dashed for the treacherous elder-bush as fast as his long legs could carry him ; but , before he had taken six strides , a hand clutched his sleeve , and a girl 's voice quavered from close behind him : `` Do n't run like that , Mr. Harkless ; I ca n't keep up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 31]: He wheeled about , and confronted a vision , a dainty little figure about five feet high , a flushed and lovely face , hair and draperies disarranged and flying .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 7]: He stamped his foot with rage .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 8]: `` Get back in the house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 10]: `` You must n't go , '' she panted .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 11]: `` It 's the only way to stop you . ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 8]: `` Go back to the house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 5]: he shouted , savagely .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 6]: `` Will you come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 15]: `` Fer God 's sake , '' cried William Todd , `` come back !
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 7]: Keep out of the road . ''
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 20]: He was emptying his revolver at the clump of elder , the uproar of his firing blasting the night .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 10]: Some one screamed from the house : `` Helen !
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 3]: Helen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 16]: John seized the girl 's wrists roughly ; her gray eyes flashed into his defiantly .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 6]: `` Will you go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 3]: he roared .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 36]: He dropped her wrists , caught her up in his arms as if she had been a kitten , and leaped into the shadow of the trees that leaned over the road from the yard .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 14]: The rifle rang out again , and the little ball whistled venomously overhead .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 12]: Harkless ran along the fence and turned in at the gate .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 23]: A loose strand of the girl 's hair blew across his cheek , and in the moon her head shone with gold .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 17]: She had light-brown hair and gray eyes and a short upper lip like a curled rose-leaf .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 9]: He set her down on the veranda steps .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 6]: Both of them laughed wildly .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 8]: `` But you came with me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 4]: she gasped triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 31]: `` I always thought you were tall , '' he answered ; and there was afterward a time when he had to agree that this was a somewhat vague reply .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 17]: JUNE Judge Briscoe smiled grimly and leaned on his shot-gun in the moonlight by the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 24]: He and William Todd had been trampling down the elder-bushes , and returning to the house , found Minnie alone on the porch .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 4]: `` Safe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 14]: he said to his daughter , who turned an anxious face upon him .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 14]: `` They 'll be safe enough now , and in our garden . ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 17]: `` Maybe I ought n't to have let them go , '' she returned , nervously .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 22]: They 're all right ; that scalawag 's half-way to Six-Cross-Roads by this time , is n't he , William ? ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 29]: `` He tuck up the fence like a scared rabbit , '' Mr. Todd responded , looking into his hat to avoid meeting the eyes of the lady .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 20]: `` I did n't have no call to toller , and he knowed how to run , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 33]: Time Mr. Harkless come out the yard again , he was near out o ' sight , and we see him take across the road to the wedge-woods , near half-a-mile up .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 11]: Somebody else with him then -- looked like a kid .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 12]: Must ` a ' cut acrost the field to join him .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 10]: They 're fur enough towards home by this . ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 14]: `` Did Miss Helen shake hands with you four or five times ? ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 5]: asked Briscoe , chuckling .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 5]: `` Because Harkless did .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 29]: My hand aches , and I guess William 's does , too ; he nearly shook our arms off when we told him he 'd been a fool .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 6]: Seemed to do him good .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 35]: I told him he ought to hire somebody to take a shot at him every morning before breakfast -- not that it 's any joking matter , '' the old gentleman finished , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 28]: `` I should say not , '' said William , with a deep frown and a jerk of his head toward the rear of the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 8]: _ He _ jokes about it enough .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 11]: Would n't even promise to carry a gun after this .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 10]: Said he would n't know how to use it .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 16]: Never shot one off since he was a boy , on the Fourth of July .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 34]: This is the third time he 's be 'n shot at this year , but he says the others was at a -- a -- what 'd he call it ? '' '' '
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 10]: A merely complimentary range , ' '' Briscoe supplied .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 13]: He handed William a cigar and bit the end off another himself .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 30]: `` Minnie , you better go in the house and read , I expect -- unless you want to go down the creek and join those folks . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 5]: _ Me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 3]: she responded .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 11]: `` I know when to stay away , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 10]: Do go and put that terrible gun up . ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 13]: `` No , '' said Briscoe , lighting his cigar , deliberately .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 39]: `` It 's all safe ; there 's no question of that ; but maybe William and I better go out and take a smoke in the orchard as long as they stay down at the creek . ''
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 70]: In the garden , shafts of white light pierced the bordering trees and fell where June roses lifted their heads to breathe the mild night breeze , and here , through summer spells , the editor of the `` Herald '' and the lady who had run to him at the pasture bars strolled down a path trembling with shadows to where the shallow creek tinkled over the pebbles .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 30]: They walked slowly , with an air of being well-accustomed friends and comrades , and for some reason it did not strike either of them as unnatural or extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 26]: They came to a bench on the bank , and he made a great fuss dusting the seat for her with his black slouch hat .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 18]: Then he regretted the hat -- it was a shabby old hat of a Carlow County fashion .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 36]: It was a long bench , and he seated himself rather remotely toward the end opposite her , suddenly realizing that he had walked very close to her , coming down the narrow garden path .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 30]: Neither knew that neither had spoken since they left the veranda ; and it had taken them a long time to come through the little orchard and the garden .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 17]: She rested her chin on her hand , leaning forward and looking steadily at the creek .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 17]: Her laughter had quite gone ; her attitude seemed a little wistful and a little sad .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 29]: He noted that her hair curled over her brow in a way he had not pictured in the lady of his dreams ; this was so much lovelier .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 20]: He did not care for tall girls ; he had not cared for them for almost half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 14]: It was so much more beautiful to be dainty and small and piquant .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 45]: He had no notion that he was sighing in a way that would have put a furnace to shame , but he turned his eyes from her because he feared that if he looked longer he might blurt out some speech about her beauty .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 73]: His glance rested on the bank ; but its diameter included the edge of her white skirt and the tip of a little , white , high-heeled slipper that peeped out beneath it ; and he had to look away from that , too , to keep from telling her that he meant to advocate a law compelling all women to wear crisp , white gowns and white slippers on moonlight nights .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 26]: She picked a long spear of grass from the turf before her , twisted it absently in her fingers , then turned to him slowly .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 8]: Her lips parted as if to speak .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 6]: Then she turned away again .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 45]: The action was so odd , and somehow , as she did it , so adorable , and the preserved silence was such a bond between them , that for his life he could not have helped moving half-way up the bench toward her .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 21]: he asked ; and he spoke in a whisper he might have used at the bedside of a dying friend .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 13]: He would not have laughed if he had known he did so .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 23]: She twisted the spear of grass into a little ball and threw it at a stone in the water before she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 20]: `` Do you know , Mr. Harkless , you and I have n't ` met , ' have we ?
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 12]: Did n't we forget to be presented to each other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 6]: `` I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 3]: Miss Sherwood .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 9]: In the perturbation of comedy I forgot . ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 10]: `` It was melodrama , was n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 9]: He laughed , but she shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 21]: `` Comedy , '' he answered , `` except your part of it , which you should n't have done .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 12]: It was not arranged in honor of ` visiting ladies . '
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 9]: But you must n't think me a comedian .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 8]: Truly , I did n't plan it .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 18]: My friend from Six-Cross-Roads must be given the credit of devising the scene-though you divined it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 11]: `` It was a little too picturesque , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 5]: I know about Six-Cross-Roads .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 10]: Please tell me what you mean to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 5]: What should I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 30]: `` You mean that you will keep on letting them shoot at you , until they -- until you -- '' She struck the bench angrily with her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 16]: `` There 's no summer theatre in Six-Cross-Roads ; there 's not even a church .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 6]: Why should n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 4]: he asked gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 25]: `` During the long and tedious evenings it cheers the poor Cross-Reader 's soul to drop over here and take a shot at me .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 22]: It whiles away dull care for him , and he has the additional exercise of running all the way home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 15]: she cried indignantly , `` they told me you always answered like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 16]: `` Well , you see the Cross-Roads efforts have proved so purely hygienic for me .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 37]: As a patriot I have sometimes felt extreme mortification that such bad marksmanship should exist in the county , but I console myself with the thought that their best shots are unhappily in the penitentiary . ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 6]: `` There are many left .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 24]: Ca n't you understand that they will organize again and come in a body , as they did before you broke them up ?
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 42]: And then , if they come on a night when they know you are wandering out of town -- '' `` You have not the advantage of an intimate study of the most exclusive people of the Cross-Roads , Miss Sherwood .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 17]: There are about twenty gentlemen who remain in that neighborhood while their relatives sojourn under discipline .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 33]: If you had the entree over there , you would understand that these twenty could not gather themselves into a company and march the seven miles without physical debate in the ranks .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 11]: They are not precisely amiable people , even amongst themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 16]: They would quarrel and shoot each other to pieces long before they got here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 10]: `` But they worked in a company once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 6]: `` Never for seven miles .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 6]: Four miles was their radius .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 8]: Five would see them all dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 6]: She struck the bench again .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 8]: `` Oh , you laugh at me !
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 16]: You make a joke of your own life and death , and laugh at everything !
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 12]: Have five years of Plattville taught you to do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 12]: `` I laugh only at taking the poor Cross-Roaders too seriously .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 15]: I do n't laugh at your running into fire to help a fellow-mortal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 9]: `` I knew there was n't any risk .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 14]: I knew he had to stop to load before he shot again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 6]: `` He did shoot again .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 19]: If I had known you before to-night -- I -- '' His tone changed and he spoke gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 12]: `` I am at your feet in worship of your philanthropy .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 18]: It 's so much finer to risk your life for a stranger than for a friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 16]: `` That is rather a man 's point of view , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 14]: `` You risked yours for a man you had never seen before . ''
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 5]: `` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 17]: I saw you at the lecture ; I heard you introduce the Honorable Mr. Halloway . ''
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 13]: `` Then I do n't understand your wishing to save me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 41]: She smiled unwillingly , and turned her gray eyes upon him with troubled sunniness , and , under the kindness of her regard , he set a watch upon his lips , though he knew it might not avail him .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 29]: He had driveled along respectably so far , he thought , but he had the sentimental longings of years , starved of expression , culminating in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 13]: She continued to look at him , wistfully , searchingly , gently .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 48]: Then her eyes traveled over his big frame from his shoes -LRB- a patch of moonlight fell on them ; they were dusty ; he drew them under the bench with a shudder -RRB- to his broad shoulders -LRB- he shook the stoop out of them -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 22]: She stretched her small hands toward him in contrast , and broke into the most delicious low laughter in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 13]: At this sound he knew the watch on his lips was worthless .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 21]: It was a question of minutes till he should present himself to her eyes as a sentimental and susceptible imbecile .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 4]: He knew it .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 6]: He was in wild spirits .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 15]: `` Could you realize that one of your dangers might be a shaking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 9]: `` Is your seriousness a lost art ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 5]: Her laughter ceased suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 5]: `` Ah , no .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 3]: I understand .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 13]: Thiers said the French laugh always , in order not to weep .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 8]: I have n't lived here five years .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 11]: I should laugh too , if I were you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 10]: `` Look at the moon , '' he responded .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 24]: `` We Plattvillains own that with the best of metropolitans , and , for my part , I see more of it here .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 6]: You do not appreciate us .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 20]: We have large landscapes in the heart of the city , and what other capital possesses advantages like that ?
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 15]: Next winter the railway station is to have a new stove for the waiting-room .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 22]: Heaven itself is one of our suburbs -- it is so close that all one has to do is to die .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 19]: You insist upon my being French , you see , and I know you are fond of nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 25]: How did you happen to put ` The Walrus and the Carpenter ' at the bottom of a page of Fisbee 's notes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 4]: `` Was it ?
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 9]: How were you sure it was I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 6]: `` In Carlow County ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 9]: `` He might have written it himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 15]: `` Fisbee has never in his life read anything lighter than cuneiform inscriptions . ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 20]: `` Miss Briscoe -- '' `` She does n't read Lewis Carroll ; and it was not her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 11]: What made you write it on Fisbee 's manuscript ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 18]: `` He was with us this afternoon , and I teased him a little about your heading .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 18]: ` Business and the Cradle , the Altar , and the Tomb , ' is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 16]: And he said it had always troubled him , but that you thought it good .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 4]: So do I .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 54]: He asked me if I could think of anything that you might like better , to put in place of it , and I wrote , ` The time has come , ' because it was the only thing I could think of that was as appropriate and as fetching as your headlines .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 7]: He was perfectly dear about it .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 15]: He was so serious ; he said he feared it would n't be acceptable .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 26]: I did n't notice that the paper he handed me to write on was part of his notes , nor did he , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 10]: Afterward , he put it back in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 7]: It was n't a message . ''
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 11]: `` I 'm not so sure he did not notice .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 5]: He is very wise .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 21]: Do you know , somehow , I have the impression that the old fellow wanted me to meet you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 9]: `` How dear and good of him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 14]: She spoke earnestly , and her face was suffused with a warm light .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 11]: There was no doubt about her meaning what she said .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 10]: `` It was , '' John answered , unsteadily .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 26]: `` He knew how great was my need of a few moments ' companionableness with -- with -- '' `` No , '' she interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 31]: `` I meant dear and good to me , because I think he was thinking of me , and it was for my sake he wanted us to meet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 31]: It would have been hard to convince a woman , if she had overheard this speech , that Miss Sherwood 's humility was not the calculated affectation of a coquette .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 19]: Sometimes a man 's unsuspicion is wiser , and Harkless knew that she was not flirting with him .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 29]: In addition , he was not a fatuous man ; he did not extend the implication of her words nearly so far as she would have had him .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 16]: `` But I had met you , '' said he , `` long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 8]: she cried , and her eyes danced .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 6]: `` You actually remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 7]: `` Yes ; do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 3]: he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 16]: `` I stood in Jones 's field and heard you singing , and I remembered .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 29]: It was a long time since I had heard you sing : '' ' I was a ruffler of Flanders , And fought for a florin 's hire .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 16]: You were the dame of my captain And sang to my heart 's desire . '
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 9]: `` But that is the balladist 's notion .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 21]: The truth is that you were a lady at the Court of Clovis , and I was a heathen captive .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 14]: I heard you sing a Christian hymn -- and asked for baptism . ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 16]: By a great effort he managed to look as if he did not mean it .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 30]: But she did not seem over-pleased with his fancy , for , the surprise fading from her face , `` Oh , that was the way you remembered ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 9]: `` Perhaps it was not that way alone .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 11]: You wo n't despise me for being mawkish to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 12]: `` I have n't had the chance for so long . ''
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 30]: The night air wrapped them warmly , and the balm of the little breezes that stirred the foliage around them was the smell of damask roses from the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 26]: The creek tinkled over the pebbles at their feet , and a drowsy bird , half-wakened by the moon , crooned languorously in the sycamores .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 12]: The girl looked out at the flashing water through downcast lashes .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 14]: `` Is it because it is so transient that beauty is pathetic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 18]: she said ; `` because we can never come back to it in quite the same way ?
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 6]: I am a sentimental girl .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 18]: If you are born so , it is never entirely teased out of you , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 8]: Besides , to-night is all a dream .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 8]: It is n't real , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 7]: You could n't be mawkish . ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 17]: Her tone was gentle as a caress , and it made him tingle to his finger-tips .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 7]: `` How do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 7]: he asked in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 5]: `` I just know .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 13]: Do you think I 'm very ` bold and forward ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 5]: she said , dreamily .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 12]: `` It was your song I wanted to be sentimental about .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 65]: I am like one ` who through long days of toil ' -- only that does n't quite apply -- ` and nights devoid of ease ' -- but I ca n't claim that one does n't sleep well here ; it is Plattville 's specialty -- like one who '' ` Still heard in his soul the music Of wonderful melodies . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 7]: `` Those blessed old lines ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 25]: `` Once a thing is music or poetry , all the hand-organs and elocutionists in the world can not ruin it , can they ?
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 45]: Yes ; to live here , out of the world , giving up the world , doing good and working for others , working for a community as you do -- '' `` I am not quite shameless , '' he interrupted , smilingly .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 30]: `` I was given a life sentence for incompetency , and I 've served five years of it , which have been made much happier than my deserts . ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 36]: `` No , '' she persisted , `` that is your way of talking of yourself ; I know you would always ` run yourself down , ' if one paid any attention to it .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 64]: But to give up the world , to drop out of it without regret , to come here and do what you have done , and to live the life that must be so desperately dry and dull for a man of your sort , and yet to have the kind of heart that makes wonderful melodies sing in itself -- oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 11]: she cried , `` I say that is fine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 24]: `` You do not understand , '' he returned , sadly , wishing , before her , to be unmercifully just to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 14]: `` I came here because I could n't make a living anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 34]: And the ` wonderful melodies ' -- I have known you only one evening -- and the melodies -- '' He rose to his feet and took a few steps toward the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 7]: `` Come , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 7]: `` Let me take you back .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 14]: Let us go before I -- '' he finished with a helpless laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 20]: She stood by the bench , one hand resting on it ; she stood all in the tremulant shadow .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 24]: She moved one step toward him , and a single , long sliver of light pierced the sycamores and fell upon her head .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 3]: He gasped .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 9]: `` What was it about the melodies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 3]: `` Nothing !
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 17]: I do n't know how to thank you for this evening that you have given me .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 9]: I -- I suppose you are leaving to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 6]: No one ever stays here .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 11]: -- I -- '' `` What about the melodies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 5]: He gave it up .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 8]: `` The moon makes people insane ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 28]: `` If that is true , '' she returned , `` then you need not be more afraid than I , because ` people ' is plural .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 19]: What were you saying about -- '' `` I _ had _ heard them -- in my heart .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 27]: When I heard your voice to-night , I knew that it was you who sang them there -- had been singing them for me always . ''
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 4]: `` So ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 5]: she cried , gaily .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 10]: `` All that debate about a pretty speech ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 21]: Then , sinking before him in a deep courtesy , `` I am beholden to you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 18]: `` Do you think that no man ever made a little flattery for me before to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 24]: At the edge of the orchard , where they could keep an unseen watch on the garden and the bank of the creek .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 19]: Judge Briscoe and Mr. Todd were ensconced under an apple-tree , the former still armed with his shot-gun .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 24]: When the two young people got up from their bench , the two men rose hastily , and then sauntered slowly toward them .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 20]: When they met , Harkless shook each of them cordially by the hand , without seeming to know it .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 14]: `` We were coming to look for you , '' explained the judge .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 27]: `` William was afraid to go home alone ; thought some one might take him for Mr. Harkless and shoot him before he got into town .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 29]: Can you come out with young Willetts in the morning , Harkless , '' he went on , `` and go with the ladies to see the parade ?
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 20]: And Minnie wants you to stay to dinner and go to the show with them in the afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 20]: Harkless seized his hand and shook it fervently , and then laughed heartily , as he accepted the invitation .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 28]: At the gate , Miss Sherwood extended her hand to him and said politely , and with some flavor of mockery : `` Good-night , Mr. Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 6]: I do not leave to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 10]: I am very glad to have met you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 26]: `` We are going to keep her all summer if we can , '' said Minnie , weaving her arm about her friend 's waist .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 9]: `` You 'll come in the morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 12]: `` Good-night , Miss Sherwood , '' he returned , hilariously .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 11]: `` It has been such a pleasure to meet you .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 9]: Thank you so much for saving my life .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 8]: It was very good of you indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 6]: Yes , in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 5]: Good-night -- good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 18]: He shook hands with them all again , including Mr. Todd , who was going with him .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 18]: He laughed most of the way home , and Mr. Todd walked at his side in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 28]: The Herald Building was a decrepit frame structure on Main Street ; it had once been a small warehouse and was now sadly in need of paint .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 60]: Closely adjoining it , in a large , blank-looking yard , stood a low brick cottage , over which the second story of the warehouse leaned in an effect of tipsy affection that had reminded Harkless , when he first saw it , of an old Sunday-school book wood-cut of an inebriated parent under convoy of a devoted child .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 30]: The title to these two buildings and the blank yard had been included in the purchase of the `` Herald '' ; and the cottage was Harkless 's home .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 13]: There was a light burning upstairs in the `` Herald '' office .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 37]: From the street a broad , tumble-down stairway ran up on the outside of the building to the second floor , and at the stairway railing John turned and shook his companion warmly by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 9]: `` Good-night , William , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 14]: `` It was plucky of you to join in that muss , to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 7]: I sha n't forget it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 35]: `` I jest happened to come along , '' replied the other , drowsily ; then , with a portentous yawn , he asked : `` Ai n't ye goin ' to bed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 10]: `` No ; Parker would n't allow it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 30]: `` Well , '' observed William , with another yawn , which bade fair to expose the veritable soul of him , `` I d'know how ye stand it .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 7]: It 's closte on eleven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 3]: Good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 56]: John went up the steps , singing aloud : `` For to-night we 'll merry , merry be , For to-night we 'll merry , merry be , '' and stopped on the sagging platform at the top of the stairs and gave the moon good-night with a wave of the hand and friendly laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 101]: At that it suddenly struck him that he was twenty-nine years of age ; that he had laughed a great deal that evening ; that he had laughed and laughed over things not in the least humorous , like an excited schoolboy making his first formal call ; that he had shaken hands with Miss Briscoe when he left her , as if he should never see her again ; that he had taken Miss Sherwood 's hand twice in one very temporary parting ; that he had shaken the judge 's hand five times , and William 's four !
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 4]: `` Idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 8]: `` What has happened to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 17]: Then he shook his fist at the moon and went in to work -- he thought .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 35]: MORNING : `` SOME IN RAGS AND SOME IN TAGS AND SOME IN VELVET GOWNS '' The bright sun of circus-day shone into Harkless 's window , and he awoke to find himself smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 22]: For a little while he lay content , drowsily wondering why he smiled , only knowing that there was something new .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 57]: It was thus , as a boy , he had wakened on his birthday mornings , or on Christmas , or on the Fourth of July , drifting happily out of pleasant dreams into the consciousness of long-awaited delights that had come true , yet lying only half-awake in a cheerful borderland , leaving happiness undefined .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 19]: The morning breeze was fluttering at his window blind ; a honeysuckle vine tapped lightly on the pane .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 8]: Birds were trilling , warbling , whistling .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 20]: From the street came the rumbling of wagons , merry cries of greeting , and the barking of dogs .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 13]: What was it made him feel so young and strong and light-hearted ?
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 29]: The breeze brought him the smell of June roses , fresh and sweet with dew , and then he knew why he had come smiling from his dreams .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 6]: He would go a holiday-making .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 15]: With that he leaped out of bed , and shouted loudly : `` Zen !
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 5]: Hello , Xenophon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 37]: In answer , an ancient , very black darky put his head in at the door , his warped and wrinkled visage showing under his grizzled hair like charred paper in a fall of pine ashes .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 9]: He said : `` Good-mawn ' , suh .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 2]: Yessuh .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 7]: Hit 's done pump ' full .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 6]: Good-mawn ' , suh . ''
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 80]: A few moments later , the colored man , seated on the front steps of the cottage , heard a mighty splashing within , while the rafters rang with stentorian song : `` He promised to buy me a bunch o ' blue ribbon , He promised to buy me a bunch o ' blue ribbon , He promised to buy me a bunch o ' blue ribbon , To tie up my bonny brown hair `` Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 6]: What can the matter be ?
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 6]: What can the matter be ?
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 6]: What can the matter be ?
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 9]: Johnnie 's so long at the Fair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 28]: At the sound of this complaint , delivered in a manly voice , the listener 's jaw dropped , and his mouth opened and stayed open . ''
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 3]: _ Him !
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 8]: _ '' he muttered , faintly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 6]: _ Singin ' _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 24]: `` Well , the old Triangle knew the music of our tread ; How the peaceful Seminole would tremble in his bed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 4]: sang the editor .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 27]: `` I dunno huccome it , '' exclaimed the old man , `` an ' dat ain ' hyer ner dar ; but , bless Gawd !
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 7]: de young man ' happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 12]: A thought struck him suddenly , and he scratched his head .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 13]: `` Maybe he goin ' away , '' he said , querulously .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 9]: `` What become o ' ole Zen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 17]: The splashing ceased , but not the voice , which struck into a noble marching chorus .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 21]: `` Oh , my Lawd , '' said the colored man , `` I pray you listen at dat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 16]: `` Soldiers marching up the street , They keep the time ; They look sublime !
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 8]: Hear them play Die Wacht am Rhein !
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 7]: They call them Schneider 's Band .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 8]: Tra la la la , la ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 19]: The length of Main Street and all the Square resounded with the rattle of vehicles of every kind .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 19]: Since earliest dawn they had been pouring into the village , a long procession on every country road .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 73]: There were great red and blue farm wagons , drawn by splendid Clydesdales ; the elders of the family on the front seat and on boards laid from side to side in front , or on chairs placed close behind , while , in the deep beds back of these , children tumbled in the straw , or peeped over the sides , rosy-cheeked and laughing , eyes alight with blissful anticipations .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 59]: There were more pretentious two-seated cut-unders and stout buckboards , loaded down with merrymakers , four on a seat meant for two ; there were rattle-trap phaetons and comfortable carry-alls drawn by steady spans ; and , now and then , mule teams bringing happy negroes , ready to squander all on the first Georgia watermelons and cider .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 63]: Every vehicle contained heaping baskets of good things to eat -LRB- the previous night had been a woeful Bartholomew for Carlow chickens -RRB- and underneath , where the dogs paced faithfully , swung buckets and fodder for the horses , while colts innumerable trotted dose to the maternal flanks , viewing the world with their big , new eyes in frisky surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 128]: Here and there the trim side-bar buggy of some prosperous farmer 's son , escorting his sweetheart , flashed along the road , the young mare stepping out in pride of blood to pass the line of wagons , the youth who held the reins , resplendent in Sunday best and even better , his scorched brown face glowing with a fine belief in the superiority of both his steed and his lady ; the latter beaming out upon life and rejoicing in the light-blue ribbons on her hat , the light-blue ribbon around her waist , the light-blue , silk half-mittens on her hands , and the beautiful red coral necklace about her neck and the red coral buttons that fastened her gown in the back .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 60]: The air was full of exhilaration ; everybody was laughing and shouting and calling greetings ; for Carlow County was turning out , and from far and near the country people came ; nay , from over the county line , clouds of dust rising from every thoroughfare and highway , and sweeping into town to herald their coming .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 71]: Dibb Zane , the `` sprinkling contractor , '' had been at work with the town water-cart since the morning stars were bright , but he might as well have watered the streets with his tears , which , indeed , when the farmers began to come in , bringing their cyclones of dust , he drew nigh unto , after a spell of profanity as futile as his cart .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 18]: `` Tief wie das Meer soll deine Liebe sein , '' hummed the editor in the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 25]: His song had taken on a reflective tone as that of one who cons a problem , or musically ponders which card to play .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 11]: He was kneeling before an old trunk in his bedchamber .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 31]: From one compartment he took a neatly folded pair of duck trousers and a light-gray tweed coat ; from another , a straw hat with a ribbon of bright colors .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 17]: They had lain in the trunk a long time undisturbed ; and he examined them musingly .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 70]: He shook the coat and brushed it ; then he laid the garments upon his bed , and proceeded to shave himself carefully , after which he donned the white trousers , the gray coat , and , rummaging in the trunk again , found a gay pink cravat , which he fastened about his tall collar -LRB- also a resurrection from the trunk -RRB- with a pearl pin .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 18]: After that he had a long , solemn time arranging his hair with a pair of brushes .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 18]: When at last he was suited , and his dressing completed , he sallied forth to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 14]: Xenophon stared after him as he went out of the gate whistling heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 10]: The old darky lifted his hands , palms outward .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 9]: `` Lan ' name , who dat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 4]: he exclaimed aloud .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 7]: `` Who dat in dem pan-jingeries ?
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 7]: He jine ' de circus ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 21]: His hands fell upon his knees , and he got to his feet pneumatically , shaking his head with foreboding .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 18]: `` Honey , honey , hit ' baid luck , baid luck sing ` fo ' breakfus .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 9]: Trouble ` fo ' de day be done .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 9]: Trouble , honey , gre ' t trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 7]: Baid luck , baid luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 33]: Along the Square the passing of the editor in his cool equipment evoked some gasps of astonishment ; and Mr. Tibbs and his sister rushed from the postoffice to stare after him .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 13]: `` He looks just beautiful , Solomon , '' said Miss Tibbs .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 13]: `` But what 's the name for them kind of clothes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 5]: inquired her brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 14]: ` Seems to me there 's a special way of callin ' 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 13]: ` Seems as if I see a picture of 'em , somewheres .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 31]: Was n't it on the cover of that there long-tennis box we bought and put in the window , and the country people thought it was a seining outfit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 15]: `` It was a game , the catalogue said , '' observed Miss Selina .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 6]: `` Was n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 13]: `` It was a mighty pore investment , '' the postmaster answered .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 33]: As Harkless approached the hotel , a decrepit old man , in a vast straw hat and a linen duster much too large for him , came haltingly forward to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 7]: He was Widow-Woman Wimby 's husband .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 22]: And , as did every one else , he spoke of his wife by the name of her former martial companion .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 30]: `` Be 'n a-lookin ' fer you , Mr. Harkless , '' he said in a shaking spindle of a voice , as plaintive as his pale little eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 11]: `` Mother Wimby , she sent some roses to ye .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 9]: Cynthy 's fixin ' 'em on yer table .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 21]: I 'm well as ever I am ; but her , she 's too complaining to come in fer show-day .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 27]: This morning , early , we see some the Cross-Roads folks pass the place towards town , an ' she sent me in to tell ye .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 8]: Oh , I knowed ye 'd laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 78]: Says she , ` He 's too much of a man to be skeered , ' says she , ` these here tall , big men always ` low nothin ' on earth kin hurt 'em , ' says she , ` but you tell him to be keerful , ' says she ; an ' I see Bill Skillett an ' his brother on the Square lessun a half-an-hour ago , ` th my own eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 9]: I wo n't keep ye from yer breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 10]: -- Eph Watts is in there , eatin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 19]: He 's come back ; but I guess I do n't need to warn ye agin ' him .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 5]: He seems peaceable enough .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 13]: It 's the other folks you got to look out fer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 4]: He limped away .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 30]: The editor waved his hand to him from the door , but the old fellow shook his head , and made a warning , friendly gesture with his arm .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 16]: Harkless usually ate his breakfast alone , as he was the latest riser in Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 19]: -LRB- There were days in the winter when he did not reach the hotel until eight o'clock . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 55]: This morning he found a bunch of white roses , still wet with dew and so fragrant that the whole room was fresh and sweet with their odor , prettily arranged in a bowl on the table , and , at his plate , the largest of all with a pin through the stem .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 13]: He looked up , smilingly , and nodded at the red-haired girl .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 10]: `` Thank you , Charmion , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 7]: `` That 's very pretty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 25]: She turned even redder than she always was , and answered nothing , vigorously darting her brush at an imaginary fly on the cloth .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 13]: After several minutes she said abruptly , `` You 're welcome . ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 14]: There was a silence , finally broken by a long , gasping sigh .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 8]: Astonished , he looked at the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 26]: Her eyes were set unfathomably upon his pink tie ; the wand had dropped from her nerveless hand , and she stood rapt and immovable .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 7]: She started violently from her trance .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 12]: `` Ai n't you goin ' to finish your coffee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 29]: she asked , plying her instrument again , and , bending over him slightly , whispered : `` Say , Eph Watts is over there behind you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 30]: At a table in a far corner of the room a large gentleman in a brown frock coat was quietly eating his breakfast and reading the `` Herald . ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 11]: He was of an ornate presence , though entirely neat .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 33]: A sumptuous expanse of linen exhibited itself between the lapels of his low-cut waistcoat , and an inch of bediamonded breastpin glittered there , like an ice-ledge on a snowy mountain side .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 14]: He had a steady , blue eye and a dissipated , iron-gray mustache .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 49]: This personage was Mr. Ephraim Watts , who , following a calling more fashionable in the eighteenth century than in the latter decades of the nineteenth , had shaken the dust of Carlow from his feet some three years previously , at the strong request of the authorities .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 29]: The `` Herald '' had been particularly insistent upon his deportation , and , in the local phrase , Harkless had `` run him out of town . ''
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 56]: Perhaps it was because the `` Herald 's '' opposition -LRB- as the editor explained at the time -RRB- had been merely moral and impersonal , and the editor had always confessed to a liking for the unprofessional qualities of Mr. Watts , that there was but slight embarrassment when the two gentlemen met to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 15]: His breakfast finished , Harkless went over to the other and extended his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 12]: Cynthia held her breath and clutched the back of a chair .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 13]: However , Mr. Watts made no motion toward his well-known hip pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 15]: Instead , he rose , flushed slightly , and accepted the hand offered him .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 18]: `` I 'm glad to see you , Mr. Watts , '' said the journalist , cordially .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 33]: `` Also , if you are running with the circus and calculate on doing business here to-day , I 'll have to see that you are fired out of town before noon .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 4]: How are you ?
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 7]: You 're looking extremely well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 33]: `` Mr. Harkless , '' answered Watts , `` I cherish no hard feelings , and I never said but what you done exactly right when I left , three years ago .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 24]: No , sir ; I 'm not here in a professional way at all , and I do n't want to be molested .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 20]: I 've connected myself with an oil company , and I 'm down here to look over the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 32]: It beats poker and fan-tan hollow , though there ai n't as many chances in favor of the dealer , and in oil it 's the farmer that gets the rake-off .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 27]: I 've come back , but in an enterprising spirit this time , to open up a new field and shed light and money in Carlow .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 23]: They told me never to show my face here again , but if you say I stay , I guess I stay .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 22]: I always was sure there was oil in the county , and I want to prove it for everybody 's benefit .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 6]: Is it all right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 24]: `` My dear fellow , '' laughed the young man , shaking the gambler 's hand again , `` it is all right .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 12]: I have always been sorry I had to act against you .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 5]: Everything is all right !
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 9]: Stay and bore to Corea if you like .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 9]: Did ever you see such glorious weather ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 20]: `` I 'll let you in on some shares , '' Watts called after him as he turned away .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 20]: He nodded in reply and was leaving the room when Cynthia detained him by a flourish of the fly-brush .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 24]: `` Say , '' she said , -- she always called him `` Say '' -- `` You 've forgot your flower . ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 8]: He came back , and thanked her .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 12]: `` Will you pin it on for me , Charmion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 28]: `` I do n't know what call you got to speak to me out of my name , '' she responded , looking at the floor moodily .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 5]: he asked , surprised .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 15]: `` I do n't see why you want to make fun of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 13]: `` I beg your pardon , Cynthia , '' he said gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 9]: `` I did n't mean to do that .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 6]: I have n't been considerate .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 9]: I did n't think you 'd be displeased .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 5]: I 'm very sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 10]: Wo n't you pin it on my coat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 19]: Her face was lifted in grateful pleasure , and she began to pin the rose to his lapel .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 9]: Her hands were large and red and trembled .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 36]: She dropped the flower , and , saying huskily , `` I do n't know as I could do it right , '' seized violently upon a pile of dishes and hurried from the room .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 41]: Harkless rescued the rose , pinned it on his coat himself , and , observing internally , for the hundredth time , that the red-haired waitress was the queerest creature in the village , set forth gaily upon his holiday .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 29]: When he reached the brick house on the pike he discovered a gentleman sunk in an easy and contemplative attitude in a big chair behind the veranda railing .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 41]: At the click of the gate the lounger rose and disclosed the stalwart figure and brown , smiling , handsome face of Mr. Lige Willetts , an habitual devotee of Minnie Briscoe , and the most eligible bachelor of Carlow .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 34]: `` The ladies will be down right off , '' he said , greeting the editor 's finery with a perceptible agitation and the editor himself with a friendly shake of the hand .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 9]: `` Mildy says to wait out here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 44]: But immediately there was a faint rustling within the house : the swish of draperies on the stairs , a delicious whispering when light feet descend , tapping , to hearts that beat an answer , the telegraphic message , `` We come !
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 3]: We come !
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 4]: We are near !
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 5]: We are near ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 6]: Lige Willetts stared at Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 60]: He had never thought the latter good-looking until he saw him step to the door to take Miss Sherwood 's hand and say in a strange , low , tense voice , `` Good-morning , '' as if he were announcing , at the least : `` Every one in the world except us two , died last night .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 13]: It is a solemn thing , but I am very happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 16]: They walked , Minnie and Mr. Willetts a little distance in front of the others .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 24]: Harkless could not have told , afterward , whether they rode , or walked , or floated on an air-ship to the court-house .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 55]: All he knew distinctly was that a divinity in a pink shirt waist , and a hat that was woven of gauzy cloud by mocking fairies to make him stoop hideously to see under it , dwelt for the time on earth and was at his side , dazzling him in the morning sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 86]: Last night the moon had lent her a silvery glamour ; she had something of the ethereal whiteness of night-dews in that watery light , a nymph to laugh from a sparkling fountain , at the moon or , as he thought , remembering her courtesy for his pretty speech , perhaps a little lady of King Louis 's court , wandering down the years from Fontainebleau and appearing to clumsy mortals sometimes , of a June night when the moon was in their heads .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 23]: But to-day she was of the clearest color , a pretty girl , whose gray eyes twinkled to his in gay companionship .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 62]: He marked how the sunshine was spun into the fair shadows of her hair and seemed itself to catch a lustre , rather than to impart it , and the light of the June day drifted through the gauzy hat , touching her face with a delicate and tender flush that came and went like the vibrating pink of early dawn .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 31]: She had the divinest straight nose , tip-tilted the faintest , most alluring trifle , and a dimple cleft her chin , `` the deadliest maelstrom in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 6]: He thrilled through and through .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 13]: He had been only vaguely conscious of the dimple in the night .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 17]: It was not until he saw her by daylight that he really knew it was there .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 8]: The village hummed with life before them .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 15]: They walked through shimmering airs , sweeter to breathe than nectar is to drink .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 28]: She caught a butterfly , basking on a jimson weed , and , before she let it go , held it out to him in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 6]: It was a white butterfly .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 7]: He asked which was the butterfly .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 4]: `` Bravo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 33]: she said , tossing the captive craft above their heads and watching the small sails catch the breeze ; `` And so you can make little flatteries in the morning , too .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 21]: It is another courtesy you should be having from me , if it were n't for the dustiness of it .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 10]: Wait till we come to the board walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 11]: She had some big , pink roses at her waist .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 36]: `` In the meantime , '' he answered , indicating these , `` I know very well a lad that would be blithe to accept a pretty token of any lady 's high esteem . ''
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 14]: `` But you have one , already , a very beautiful one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 23]: She gave him a genial up-and-down glance from head to foot , half quizzical , but so quick he almost missed it .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 23]: And then he was glad he had found the straw hat with the youthful ribbon , and all his other festal vestures .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 39]: `` And a very becoming flower a white rose is , '' she continued , `` though I am a bold girl to be blarneying with a young gentleman I met no longer ago than last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 20]: `` But why should n't you blarney with a gentleman , when you began by saving his life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 24]: `` Or , rather , when the gentleman had the politeness to gallop about the county with me tucked under his arm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 21]: She stood still and laughed softly , but consummately , and her eyes closed tight with the mirth of it .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 31]: She had taken one of the roses from her waist , and , as she stood , holding it by the long stem , its petals lightly pressed her lips .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 13]: `` You may have it -- in exchange , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 24]: He bent down to her , and she began to fasten the pink rose in place of the white one on his coat .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 36]: She did not ask him , directly or indirectly , who had put the white one there for him , because she knew by the way it was pinned that he had done it himself .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 16]: `` Who is it that ev'ry morning brings me these lovely flow ` rs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 10]: she burlesqued , as he bent over her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 9]: ` Mr. Wimby , ' '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 9]: `` I will point him out to you .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 20]: You must see him , and , also , Mr. Bodeffer , the oldest inhabitant -- and crossest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 9]: `` Will you present them to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 21]: `` No ; they might talk to you and take some of my time with you away from me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 19]: Her eyes sparkled into his for the merest fraction of a second , and she laughed half mockingly .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 9]: Then she dropped his lapel and they proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 15]: She did not put the white rose in her belt , but carried it .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 42]: The Square was heaving with a jostling , goodnatured , happy , and constantly increasing crowd that overflowed on Main Street in both directions ; and the good nature of this crowd was augmented in the ratio that its size increased .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 23]: The streets were a confusion of many colors , and eager faces filled every window opening on Main Street or the Square .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 44]: Since nine o'clock all those of the courthouse had been occupied , and here most of the damsels congregated to enjoy the spectacle of the parade , and their swains attended , gallantly posting themselves at coignes of less vantage behind the ladies .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 46]: Some of the faces that peeped from the dark , old court-house windows were pretty , and some of them were not pretty ; but nearly all of them were rosy-cheeked , and all were pleasant to see because of the good cheer they showed .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 23]: Some of the gallants affected the airy and easy , entertaining the company with badinage and repartee ; some were openly bashful .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 41]: Now and then one of the latter , after long deliberation , constructed a laborious compliment for his inamorata , and , after advancing and propounding half of it , again retired into himself , smit with a blissful palsy .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 25]: Nearly all of them conversed in tones that might have indicated that they were separated from each other by an acre lot or two .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 74]: Here and there , along the sidewalk below , a father worked his way through the throng , a licorice-bedaubed cherub on one arm , his coat -LRB- borne with long enough -RRB- on the other ; followed by a mother with the other children hanging to her skirts and tagging exasperatingly behind , holding red and blue toy balloons and delectable batons of spiral-striped peppermint in tightly closed , sadly sticky fingers .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 83]: A thousand cries rent the air ; the strolling mountebanks and gypsying booth-merchants ; the peanut vendors ; the boys with palm-leaf fans for sale ; the candy sellers ; the popcorn peddlers ; the Italian with the toy balloons that float like a cluster of colored bubbles above the heads of the crowd , and the balloons that wail like a baby ; the red-lemonade man , shouting in the shrill voice that reaches everywhere and endures forever : `` Lemo !
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 2]: Lemo !
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 3]: Ice-cole lemo !
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 12]: Five cents , a nickel , a half-a-dime , the twentiethpotofadollah !
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 2]: Lemo !
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 4]: Ice-cole lemo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 12]: -- all the vociferating harbingers of the circus crying their wares .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 66]: Timid youth , in shoes covered with dust through which the morning polish but dimly shone , and unalterably hooked by the arm to blushing maidens , bought recklessly of peanuts , of candy , of popcorn , of all known sweetmeats , perchance ; and forced their way to the lemonade stands ; and there , all shyly , silently sipped the crimson-stained ambrosia .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 17]: Everywhere the hawkers dinned , and everywhere was heard the plaintive squawk of the toy balloon .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 36]: But over all rose the nasal cadence of the Cheap John , reeking oratory from his big wagon on the corner : `` Walk up , walk up , walk up , ladies and gents !
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 4]: Here we are !
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 4]: Here we are !
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 8]: Make hay while we gather the moss .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 7]: Walk up , one and all .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 66]: Here I put this solid gold ring , sumptuous and golden , eighteen carats , eighteen golden carats of the priceless mother of metals , toiled fer on the wild Pacific slope , eighteen garnteed , I put this golden ring , rich and golden , in the package with the hangkacheef , the elegant and blue-ruled note-paper , self-writing pens , pencil and penholder .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 5]: Who takes the lot ?
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 9]: Who takes it , ladies and gents ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 13]: His tongue curled about his words ; he seemed to love them .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 5]: `` Fer a quat-of-a-dollah !
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 17]: Do n't turn away , young man -- you feller in the green necktie , there .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 19]: We all see the young lady on your arm is a-langrishing fer the golden ring and the package .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 8]: Faint heart never won fair wummin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 13]: There you are , sir , and you 'll never regret it .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 6]: Go -- and be happy !
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 17]: Now , who 's the next man to git solid with his girl fer a quat-of-a-dollah ?
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 17]: Life is a mysterus and unviolable shadder , my friends ; who kin read its orgeries ?
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 13]: To-day we are here -- but to-morrow we may be in jail .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 4]: Only a quat-of-a-dollah !
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 25]: We are Seventh-Day Adventists , ladies and gents , a-givin ' away our belongings in the awful face of Michael , fer a quat-of-a-dollah .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 30]: The same price fer each-an-devery individual , lady and gent , man , wummin , wife and child , and happiness to one and all fer a quat-of-a-dollah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 88]: Down the middle of the street , kept open between the waiting crowd , ran barefoot boys , many of whom had not slept at home , but had kept vigil in the night mists for the coming of the show , and , having seen the muffled pageant arrive , swathed , and with no pomp and panoply , had returned to town , rioting through jewelled cobwebs in the morning fields , happy in the pride of knowledge of what went on behind the scenes .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 36]: To-night , or to-morrow , the runaways would face a woodshed reckoning with outraged ancestry ; but now they caracoled in the dust with no thought of the grim deeds to be done upon them .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 68]: In the court-house yard , and so sinning in the very eye of the law , two swarthy , shifty-looking gentlemen were operating -LRB- with some greasy walnut shells and a pea -RRB- what the fanciful or unsophisticated might have been pleased to call a game of chance ; and the most intent spectator of the group around them was Mr. James Bardlock , the Town Marshal .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 9]: He was simply and unofficially and earnestly interested .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 44]: Thus the eye of Justice may not be said to have winked upon the nefariousness now under its vision ; it gazed with strong curiosity , an itch to dabble , and -LRB- it must be admitted -RRB- a growing hope of profit .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 11]: The game was so direct and the player so sure .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 57]: Several countrymen had won small sums , and one , a charmingly rustic stranger , with a peculiar accent -LRB- he said that him and his goil should now have a smoot ' old time off his winninks -- though the lady was not manifested -RRB- , had won twenty-five dollars with no trouble at all .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 21]: The two operators seemed depressed , declaring the luck against them and the Plattville people too brilliant at the game .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 19]: It was wonderful how the young couples worked their way arm-in-arm through the thickest crowds , never separating .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 23]: Even at the lemonade stands they drank holding the glasses in their outer hands -- such are the sacrifices demanded by etiquette .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 70]: But , observing the gracious outpouring of fortune upon the rustic with the rare accent , a youth in a green tie disengaged his arm -- for the first time in two hours -- from that of a girl upon whose finger there shone a ring , sumptuous and golden , and , conducting her to a corner of the yard , bade her remain there until he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 11]: He had to speak to Hartly Bowlder , he explained .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 24]: Then he plunged , red-faced and excited , into the circle about the shell manipulators , and offered , to lay a wager .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 25]: `` Hol ' on there , Hen Fentriss , '' thickly objected a flushed young man beside him , `` iss my turn . ''
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 5]: `` I 'm first .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 7]: Hartley , '' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 13]: `` You can hold yer bosses a minute , I reckon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 16]: `` Plenty fer each and all , chents , '' interrupted one of the shell-men .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 9]: `` Place yer spondulicks on de little ball .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 11]: Wich is de next lucky one to win our money ?
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 15]: Chent bets four sixty-five he seen de little ball go under de middle shell .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 4]: Up she comes !
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 16]: Dis time _ we _ wins ; Plattville ca n't win _ every _ time .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 7]: Who 's de next chent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 16]: Fentriss edged slowly out of the circle , abashed , and with rapidly whitening cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 45]: He paused for a moment , outside , slowly realizing that all his money had gone in one wild , blind whirl -- the money he had earned so hard and saved so hard , to make a holiday for his sweetheart and himself .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 16]: He stole one glance around the building to where a patient figure waited for him .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 38]: Then he fled down a side alley and soon was out upon the country road , tramping soddenly homeward through the dust , his chin sunk in his breast and his hands clenched tight at his sides .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 26]: Now and then he stopped and bitterly hurled a stone at a piping bird on a fence , or gay Bob White in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 25]: At noon the patient figure was still waiting in the corner of the court-house yard , meekly twisting the golden ring upon her finger .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 47]: But the flushed young man who had spoken thickly to her deserter drew an envied roll of bankbills from his pocket and began to bet with tipsy caution , while the circle about the gamblers watched with fervid interest , especially Mr. Bardlock , Town Marshal .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 14]: From far up Main Street came the cry `` She 's a-comin ' !
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 6]: She 's a-comin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 35]: and , this announcement of the parade proving only one of a dozen false alarms , a thousand discussions took place over old-fashioned silver timepieces as to when `` she '' was really due .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 66]: Schofields ' Henry was much appealed to as an arbiter in these discussions , from a sense of his having a good deal to do with time in a general sort of way ; and thus Schofields ' came to be reminded that it was getting on toward ten o'clock , whereas , in the excitement of festival , he had not yet struck nine .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 24]: This , rushing forthwith to do , he did ; and , in the elation of the moment , seven or eight besides .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 73]: Miss Helen Sherwood was looking down on the mass of shifting color from a second-story window -- whither many an eye was upturned in wonder -- and she had the pleasure of seeing Schofields ' emerge on the steps beneath her , when the bells had done , and heard the cheers -LRB- led by Mr. Martin -RRB- with which the laughing crowd greeted his appearance after the performance of his feat .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 6]: She turned beamingly to Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 8]: `` What a family it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 8]: `` Just one big , jolly family .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 16]: I did n't know people could be like this until I came to Plattville . ''
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 21]: `` That is the word for it , '' he answered , resting his hand on the casement beside her .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 16]: `` I used to think it was desolate , but that was long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 9]: He leaned from the window to look down .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 65]: In his dark cheek was a glow Carlow folk had never seen there ; and somehow he seemed less thin and tired ; indeed , he did not seem tired at all , by far the contrary ; and he carried himself upright -LRB- when he was not stooping to see under the hat -RRB- , though not as if he thought about it .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 16]: `` I believe they are the best people I know , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 53]: `` Perhaps it is because they have been so kind to me ; but they are kind to each other , too ; kind , good people -- '' `` I know , '' she said , nodding -- a flower on the gauzy hat set to vibrating in a tantalizing way .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 4]: `` I know .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 27]: There are fat women who rock and rock on piazzas by the sea , and they speak of country people as the ` lower classes . '
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 16]: How happy this big family is in not knowing it is the lower classes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 13]: `` We have n't read Nordau down here , '' said John .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 15]: `` Old Tom Martin 's favorite work is ` The Descent of Man . '
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 27]: Miss Tibbs admires Tupper , and ` Beulah , ' and some of us possess the works of E. P. Roe -- and why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 17]: `` Yes ; what of it , '' she returned , `` since you escape Nordau ?
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 66]: I think the conversation we hear from the other windows is as amusing and quite as loud as most of that I hear in Rouen during the winter ; and Rouen , you know , is just like any other big place nowadays , though I suppose there are Philadelphians , for instance , who would be slow to believe a statement like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 19]: `` Oh , but they are not all of Philadelphia -- '' He left the sentence , smilingly .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 27]: `` And yet somebody said , ` The further West I travel the more convinced I am the Wise Men came from the East . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' he answered . ''
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 11]: ` From ' is the important word in that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 39]: `` It was a girl from Southeast Cottonbridge , Massachusetts , '' said Helen , `` who heard I was from Indiana and asked me if I did n't hate to live so far away from things . ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 19]: There was a pause , while she leaned out of the window with her face aside from him .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 14]: Then she remarked carelessly , `` I met her at Winter Harbor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 9]: `` Do you go to Winter Harbor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 14]: `` We have gone there every summer until this one , for years .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 8]: Have you friends who go there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 6]: `` I had -- once .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 16]: There was a classmate of mine from Rouen -- '' `` What was his name ?
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 6]: Perhaps I know him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 7]: She stole a glance at him .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 26]: His face had fallen into sad lines , and he looked like the man who had come up the aisle with the Hon. Kedge Halloway .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 11]: A few moments before he had seemed another person entirely .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 10]: `` He 's forgotten me , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 19]: I have n't seen him for seven years ; and that 's a long time , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 16]: Besides , he 's ` out in the world , ' where remembering is harder .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 9]: Here in Plattville we do n't forget . ''
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 9]: `` Were you ever at Winter Harbor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 6]: `` I was -- once .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 19]: I spent a very happy day there long ago , when you must have been a little girl .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 10]: Were you there in -- '' `` Listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 6]: `` The procession is coming .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 6]: Look at the crowd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 8]: The parade had seized a psychological moment .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 10]: There was a fanfare of trumpets in the east .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 41]: Lines of people rushed for the street , and , as one looked down on the straw hats and sunbonnets and many kinds of finer head apparel , tossing forward , they seemed like surf sweeping up the long beaches .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 6]: She was coming at last .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 33]: The boys whooped in the middle of the street ; some tossed their arms to heaven , others expressed their emotion by somersaults ; those most deeply moved walked on their hands .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 34]: In the distance one saw , over the heads of the multitude , tossing banners and the moving crests of triumphal cars , where `` cohorts were shining in purple and gold . ''
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 6]: She _ was _ coming .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 12]: After all the false alarms and disappointments , she was coming !
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 7]: There was another flourish of music .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 29]: Immediately all the band gave sound , and then , with blare of brass and the crash of drums , the glory of the parade burst upon Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 5]: Glory in the utmost !
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 198]: The resistless impetus of the march-time music ; the flare of royal banners , of pennons on the breeze ; the smiling of beautiful Court Ladies and great , silken Nobles ; the swaying of howdahs on camel and elephant , and the awesome shaking of the earth beneath the elephant 's feet , and the gleam of his small but devastating eye -LRB- every one declared he looked the alarmed Mr. Snoddy full in the face as he passed , and Mr. Snoddy felt not at all reassured when Tom Martin severely hinted that it was with the threatening glance of a rival -RRB- ; then the badinage of the clown , creaking along in his donkey cart ; the terrific recklessness of the spangled hero who was drawn by in a cage with two striped tigers ; the spirit of the prancing steeds that drew the rumbling chariots , and the grace of the helmeted charioteers ; the splendor of the cars and the magnificence of the paintings with which they were adorned ; the ecstasy of all this glittering , shining , gorgeous pageantry needed even more than walking on your hands to express .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 33]: Last of all came the tooting calliope , followed by swarms of boys as it executed , `` Wait till the clouds roll by , Jennie '' with infinite dash and gusto .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 59]: When it was gone , Miss Sherwood 's intent gaze relaxed -- she had been looking on as eagerly as any child , -- and she turned to speak to Harkless and discovered that he was no longer in the room ; instead , she found Minnie and Mr. Willetts , whom he had summoned from another window .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 10]: `` He was called away , '' explained Lige .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 31]: `` He thought he 'd be back before the parade was over , and said you were enjoying it so much he did n't want to speak to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 5]: `` Called away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 5]: she said , inquiringly .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 3]: Minnie laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 10]: `` Oh , everybody sends for Mr. Harkless . ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 15]: `` It was a farmer , name of Bowlder , '' added Mr. Willetts .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 22]: `` His son Hartley 's drinking again , and there ai n't any one but Harkless can do anything with him .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 36]: You let him tackle a sick man to nurse , or a tipsy one to handle , and I tell you , '' Mr. Willetts went on with enthusiasm , `` he is at home .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 19]: It beats me , -- and lots of people do n't think college does a man any good !
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 14]: Why , the way he cured old Fis -- '' `` See ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 11]: cried Minnie , loudly , pointing out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 5]: `` Look down there .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 5]: Something 's happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 9]: There was a swirl in the crowd below .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 19]: Men were running around a corner of the court-house , and the women and children were harking after .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 34]: They went so fast , and there were so many of them , that immediately that whole portion of the yard became a pushing , tugging , pulling , squirming jam of people .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 12]: `` It 's on the other side , '' said Lige .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 9]: `` We can see from the hall window .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 12]: Come quick , before these other folks fill it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 17]: They followed him across the building , and looked down on an agitated swarm of faces .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 30]: Five men were standing on the entrance steps to the door below , and the crowd was thickly massed beyond , leaving a little semicircle clear about the steps .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 22]: Those behind struggled to get closer , and leaped in the air to catch a glimpse of what was going on .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 23]: Harkless stood alone on the top step , his hand resting on the shoulder of the pale and contrite and sobered Hartley .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 28]: In the clear space , Jim Bardlock was standing with sheepishly hanging head , and between him and Harkless were the two gamblers of the walnut shells .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 12]: The journalist held in his hand the implements of their profession .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 15]: `` Give it all up , '' he was saying in his steady voice .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 10]: `` You 've taken eighty-six dollars from this boy .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 5]: Hand it over . ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 39]: The men began to edge closer to the crowd , giving little , swift , desperate , searching looks from left to right , and right to left , moving nervously about , like weasels in a trap .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 12]: `` Close up there tight , '' said Harkless , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 8]: `` Do n't let them out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 14]: `` W ' y ca n't we git no square treatment here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 22]: one of the gamblers whined ; but his eyes , blazing with rage , belied the plaintive passivity of his tone .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 7]: `` We been running no skin .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 11]: Wy d'ye say we gotter give up our own money ?
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 8]: You gotter prove it was a skin .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 7]: We risked our money fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 4]: `` Prove it !
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 7]: Come up here , Eph Watts .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 37]: Friends , '' the editor turned to the crowd , smiling , `` friends , here 's a man we ran out of town once , because he knew too much about things of this sort .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 14]: He 's come back to us again and he 's here to stay .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 12]: He 'll give us an object-lesson on the shell game . ''
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 11]: `` It 's pretty simple , '' remarked Mr. Watts .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 36]: `` The best way is to pick up the ball with your second finger and the back part of your thumb as you pretend to lay the shell down over it : this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 39]: He illustrated , and showed several methods of manipulation , with professional sang-froid ; and as he made plain the easy swindle by which many had been duped that morning , there arose an angry and threatening murmur .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 28]: `` You all see , '' said Harkless , raising his voice a little , `` what a simple cheat it is -- and old as Pharaoh .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 39]: Yet a lot of you stood around and lost your own money , and stared like idiots , and let Hartley Bowlder lose eighty-odd dollars on a shell racket , and not one of you lifted a hand .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 15]: How hard did you work for what these two cheap crooks took from you ?
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 3]: Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 17]: he cried , `` it is because you were greedy that they robbed you so easily .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 6]: You know it 's true .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 30]: It 's when you want to get something for nothing that the ` confidence men ' steal the money you sweat for and make the farmer a laughing stock .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 11]: And _ you _ , Jim Bardlock , Town Marshal !
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 40]: -- you , who confess that you ` went in the game sixty cents ' worth , yourself -- '' His eyes were lit with wrath as he raised his accusing hand and levelled it at the unhappy municipal .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 122]: The Town Marshal smiled uneasily and deprecatingly about him , and , meeting only angry glances , hearing only words of condemnation , he passed his hand unsteadily over his fat mustache , shifted from one leg to the other and back again , looked up , looked down , and then , an amiable and pleasure-loving man , beholding nothing but accusation and anger in heaven and earth , and wishing nothing more than to sink into the waters under the earth , but having no way of reaching them , finding his troubles quite unbearable , and unable to meet the manifold eye of man , he sought relief after the unsagacious fashion of a larger bird than he .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 36]: His burly form underwent a series of convulsions not unlike sobs , and he shut his eyes tightly and held them so , presenting a picture of misery unequalled in the memory of any spectator .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 8]: Harkless 's outstretched hand began to shake .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 4]: `` You ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 57]: he tried to continue -- `` you , a man elected to -- '' There came from the crowd the sound of a sad , high-keyed voice , drawling : `` That 's a nice vest Jim 's got on , but it ai n't hardly the feathers fitten for an ostrich , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 20]: The editor 's gravity gave way ; he broke into a ringing laugh and turned again to the shell-men .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 8]: `` Give up the boy 's money .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 3]: Hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 16]: `` Step down here and git it , '' said the one who had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 19]: There was a turbulent motion in the crowd , and a cry arose , `` Run 'em out !
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 6]: Ride 'em on a rail !
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 4]: Tar and feathers !
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 8]: Run 'em out o ' town ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 24]: `` I would n't dilly-dally long if I were you , '' said Harkless , and his advice seemed good to the shell-men .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 23]: A roll of bills , which he counted and turned over to the elder Bowlder , was sullenly placed in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 17]: The fellow who had not yet spoken clutched the journalist 's sleeve with his dirty hand .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 15]: `` We hai n't done wit ' youse , '' he said , hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 14]: `` Do n't belief it , not fer a minute , see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 36]: The Town Marshal opened his eyes briskly , and placing a hand on each of the gamblers , said : `` I hereby do arrest your said persons , and declare you my prisoners . ''
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 12]: The cry rose again , louder : `` Run 'em out !
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 4]: String 'em up !
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 3]: Hang them !
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 4]: Hang them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 7]: and a forward rush was made .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 6]: `` This way , Jim .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 22]: Be quick , '' said Harkless , quietly , bending down and jerking one of the gamblers half-way up the steps .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 17]: `` Get through the hall to the other side and then run them to the lock-up .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 8]: No one will stop you that way .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 9]: Watts and I will hold this door . ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 32]: Bardlock hustled his prisoners through the doorway , and the crowd pushed up the steps , while Harkless struggled to keep the vestibule clear until Watts got the double doors closed .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 7]: `` Stand back , here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 9]: he cried ; `` it 's all over .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 5]: Do n't be foolish .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 8]: The law is good enough for us .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 7]: Stand back , will you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 40]: He was laughing a little , shoving them back with open hand and elbow , when a small , compact group of men suddenly dashed up the steps together , and a heavy stick swung out over their heads .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 12]: A straw hat with a gay ribbon sailed through the air .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 25]: The journalist 's long arms went out swiftly from his body in several directions , the hands not open , but clenched and hard .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 34]: The next instant he and Mr. Watts stood alone on the steps , and a man with a bleeding , blaspheming mouth dropped his stick and tried to lose himself in the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 13]: Mr. Watts was returning something he had not used to his hip-pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 6]: `` Prophets of Israel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 15]: exclaimed William Todd , ruefully , `` it was n't Eph Watts 's pistol .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 6]: Did you see Mr. Harkless ?
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 10]: I was up on them steps when he begun .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 17]: I do n't believe he needs as much takin ' care of as we think . ''
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 16]: `` Was n't it one of them Cross-Roads devils that knocked his hat off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 4]: asked Judd Bennett .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 14]: `` I thought I see Bob Skillett run up with a club . ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 13]: Harkless threw open the doors behind him ; the hall was empty .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 11]: `` You may come in now , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 8]: `` This is n't my court-house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 21]: GLAD AFTERNOON : THE GIRL BY THE BLUE TENT-POLE They walked slowly back along the pike toward the brick house .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 31]: The white-ruffed fennel reached up its dusty yellow heads to touch her skirts as she passed , and then drooped , satisfied , against the purple iron-weed at the roadside .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 50]: In the noonday silence no cricket chirped nor locust raised its lorn monotone ; the tree shadows mottled the road with blue , and the level fields seemed to pant out a dazzling breath , the transparent `` heat-waves '' that danced above the low corn and green wheat .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 25]: He was stooping very much as they walked ; he wanted to be told that he could look at her for a thousand years .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 67]: Her face was rarely and exquisitely modelled , but , perhaps , just now the salient characteristic of her beauty -LRB- for the salient characteristic seemed to be a different thing at different times -RRB- was the coloring , a delicate glow under the white skin , that bewitched him in its seeming a reflection of the rich benediction of the noonday sun that blazed overhead .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 44]: Once he had thought the way to the Briscoe homestead rather a long walk ; but now the distance sped malignantly ; and strolled they never so slow , it was less than a `` young bird 's flutter from a wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 30]: With her acquiescence he rolled a cigarette , and she began to hum lightly the air of a song , a song of an ineffably gentle , slow movement .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 38]: That , and a reference of the morning , and , perhaps , the smell of his tobacco mingling with the fragrance of her roses , awoke again the keen reminiscence of the previous night within him .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 53]: Clearly outlined before him rose the high , green slopes and cool cliff-walls of the coast of Maine , while his old self lazily watched the sharp little waves through half-closed lids , the pale smoke of his cigarette blowing out under the rail of a waxen deck where he lay cushioned .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 21]: And again a woman pelted his face with handfuls of rose-petals and cried : `` Up lad and at 'em !
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 6]: Yonder is Winter Harbor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 67]: Again he sat in the oak-raftered Casino , breathless with pleasure , and heard a young girl sing the `` Angel 's Serenade , '' a young girl who looked so bravely unconscious of the big , hushed crowd that listened , looked so pure and bright and gentle and good , that he had spoken of her as `` Sir Galahad 's little sister . ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 32]: He recollected he had been much taken with this child ; but he had not thought of her from that time to this , he supposed ; had almost forgotten her .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 37]: Her face suddenly stood out to his view as though he saw her with his physical eye -- a sweet and vivacious child 's face with light-brown hair and gray eyes and a short upper lip .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 14]: ... And the voice ... He stopped short and struck his palms together .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 10]: `` You are Tom Meredith 's little cousin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 6]: `` The Great Harkless ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 11]: she answered , and stretched out her hand to him .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 6]: `` I remember you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 7]: `` Is n't it time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 13]: `` Ah , but I never forgot you , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 6]: `` I thought I had .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 11]: I did n't know who it was I was remembering .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 11]: I thought it was fancy , and it was memory .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 23]: I never forgot your voice , singing -- and I remembered your face too ; though I thought I did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 7]: He drew a deep breath . ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 23]: _ That _ was why -- '' `` Tom Meredith has not forgotten you , '' she said , as he paused .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 10]: `` Would you mind shaking hands once more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 7]: She gave him her hand again .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 6]: `` With all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 9]: `` I 'm making a record at it .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 4]: Thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 23]: `` They called me ` Sir Galahad 's little sister ' all one summer because the Great John Harkless called me that .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 9]: You danced with me in the evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 5]: `` Did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 31]: `` Ah , '' she said , shaking her head , `` you were too busy being in love with Mrs. Van Skuyt to remember a waltz with only me !
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 34]: I was allowed to meet you as a reward for singing my very best , and you -- you bowed with the indulgence of a grandfather , and asked me to dance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 5]: `` Like a grandfather ?
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 6]: How young I was then !
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 6]: How time changes us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 19]: `` I 'm afraid my conversation did not make a great impression upon you , '' she continued .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 5]: `` But it did .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 6]: I am remembering very fast .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 19]: If you will wait a moment , I will tell you some of the things you said . ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 5]: The girl laughed merrily .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 20]: Whenever she laughed he realized that it was becoming terribly difficult not to tell her how adorable she was .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 28]: `` I would n't risk it , if I were you , '' she warned him , `` because I did n't speak to you at all .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 20]: I shut my lips tight and trembled all over every bit of the time I was dancing with you .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 23]: I did not sleep that night , because I was so unhappy , wondering what the Great Harkless would think of me .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 15]: I knew he thought me unutterably stupid because I could n't talk to him .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 14]: I wanted to send him word that I knew I had bored him .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 15]: I could n't bear for him not to know that I knew I had .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 11]: But he was not thinking of me in any way .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 22]: He had gone to sea again in a big boat , the ungrateful pirate , cruising with Mrs. Van Skuyt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 10]: `` How time _ does _ change us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 3]: said John .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 49]: `` You are wrong , though ; I did think of you ; I have al -- '' `` Yes , '' she interrupted , tossing her head in airy travesty of the stage coquette , `` you think so -- I mean you say so -- now .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 8]: Away with you and your blarneying ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 45]: And so they went through the warm noontide , and little he cared for the heat that wilted the fat mullein leaves and made the barefoot boy , who passed by , skip gingerly through the burning dust with anguished mouth and watery eye .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 75]: Little he knew of the locust that suddenly whirred his mills of shrillness in the maple-tree , and sounded so hot , hot , hot ; or those others that railed at the country quiet from the dim shade around the brick house ; or even the rain-crow that sat on the fence and swore to them in the face of a sunny sky that they should see rain ere the day were done .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 65]: Little the young man recked of what he ate at Judge Briscoe 's good noon dinner : chicken wing and young roas 'n' - ear ; hot rolls as light as the fluff of a summer cloudlet ; and honey and milk ; and apple-butter flavored like spices of Arabia ; and fragrant , flaky cherry-pie ; and cool , rich , yellow cream .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 51]: Lige Willetts was a lover , yet he said he asked no better than to Just go on eating that cherry-pie till a sweet death overtook him ; but railroad sandwiches and restaurant chops might have been set before Harkless for all the difference it would have made to him .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 51]: At no other time is a man 's feeling of companionship with a woman so strong as when he sits at table with her-not at a `` decorated '' and becatered and bewaitered table , but at a homely , appetizing , wholesome home table like old Judge Briscoe 's .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 18]: The very essence of the thing is domesticity , and the implication is utter confidence and liking .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 9]: There are few greater dangers for a bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 35]: An insinuating imp perches on his shoulder , and , softly tickling the bachelor 's ear with the feathers of an arrow-shaft , whispers : `` Pretty nice , is n't it , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 14]: Rather pleasant to have that girl sitting there , do n't you think ?
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 9]: Enjoy having her notice your butter-plate was empty ?
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 9]: Think it exhilarating to hand her those rolls ?
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 7]: Looks nice , does n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 8]: Says ` Thank you ' rather prettily ?
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 12]: Makes your lonely breakfast seem mighty dull , does n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 17]: How would you like to have her pour your coffee for you to-morrow , my boy ?
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 16]: How would it seem to have such pleasant company all the rest of your life ?
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 6]: Pretty cheerful , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 26]: When Miss Sherwood passed the editor the apple-butter , the casual , matter-of-course way she did it entranced him in a strange , exquisite wonderment .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 59]: He did not set the dish down when she put it in his hand , but held it straight out before him , just looking at it , until Mr. Willetts had a dangerous choking fit , for which Minnie was very proud of Lige ; no one could have suspected that it was the veil of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 51]: When Helen told John he really must squeeze a lemon into his iced tea , he felt that his one need in life was to catch her up in his arms and run away with her , not anywhere in particular , but just run and run and run away .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 13]: After dinner they went out to the veranda and the gentlemen smoked .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 32]: The judge set his chair down on the ground , tilted back in it with his feet on the steps , and blew a wavery domed city up in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 6]: He called it solid comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 23]: He liked to sit out from under the porch roof , he said ; he wanted to see more of the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 14]: The others moved their chairs down to join him in the celestial vision .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 30]: There had blown across the heaven a feathery , thin cloud or two , but save for these , there was nothing but glorious and tender , brilliant blue .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 39]: It seemed so clear and close one marvelled the little church spire in the distance did not pierce it ; yet , at the same time , the eye ascended miles and miles into warm , shimmering ether .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 16]: Far away two buzzards swung slowly at anchor , half-way to the sun . '' '
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 28]: O bright , translucent , cerulean hue , Let my wide wings drift on in you , ' '' said Harkless , pointing them out to Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 35]: `` You seem to get a good deal of fun out of this kind of weather , '' observed Lige , as he wiped his brow and shifted his chair out of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 29]: `` I expect you do n't get such skies as this up in Rouen , '' said the judge , looking at the girl from between half-closed eyelids .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 15]: `` It 's the same Indiana sky , I think , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 23]: `` I guess maybe in the city you do n't see as much of it , or think as much about it .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 15]: Yes , they 're the Indiana skies , '' the old man went on .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 15]: Skies as blue As the eyes of children when they smile at you . '
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 16]: `` There are n't any others anywhere that ever seemed much like them to me .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 10]: They 've been company for me all my life .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 22]: I do n't think there are any others half as beautiful , and I know there are n't any as sociable .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 6]: They were always so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 29]: He sighed gently , and Miss Sherwood fancied his wife must have found the Indiana skies as lovely as he had , in the days of long ago .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 19]: `` Seems to me they _ are _ the softest and bluest and kindest in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 43]: `` I think they are , '' said Helen , `` and they are more beautiful than the ` Italian skies , ' though I doubt if many of us Hoosiers realize it ; and -- certainly no one else does . ''
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 10]: The old man leaned over and patted her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 4]: Harkless gasped . ''
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 6]: ` Us Hoosiers ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 4]: chuckled the judge .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 10]: `` You 're a great Hoosier , young lady !
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 12]: How much of your life have you spent in the State ?
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 6]: ` Us Hoosiers ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 38]: `` But I 'm going to be a good one , '' she answered , gaily , `` and if I 'm good enough , when I grow up maybe I 'll be a great one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 18]: The buckboard had been brought around , and the four young people climbed in , Harkless driving .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 27]: Before they started , the judge , standing on the horse-block in front of the gate , leaned over and patted Miss Sherwood 's hand again .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 6]: Harkless gathered up the reins .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 22]: `` You 'll make a great Hoosier , all right , '' said the old man , beaming upon the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 15]: `` You need n't worry about that , I guess , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 14]: When he said `` my dear , '' Harkless spoke to the horses .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 15]: `` Wait , '' said the judge , still holding the girl 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 15]: `` You 'll make a great Hoosier , some day ; do n't fret .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 9]: You 're already a very beautiful one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 12]: Then he bent his white head and kissed her , gallantly .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 28]: John said : `` Good afternoon , judge '' ; the whip cracked like a pistol-shot , and the buckboard dashed off in a cloud of dust .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 28]: `` Every once in a while , Harkless , '' the old fellow called after them , `` you must remember to look at the team . ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 50]: The enormous white tent was filled with a hazy yellow light , the warm , dusty , mellow light that thrills the rejoicing heart because it is found nowhere in the world except in the tents of a circus -- the canvas-filtered sunshine and sawdust atmosphere of show day .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 48]: Through the entrance the crowd poured steadily , coming from the absorptions of the wild-animal tent to feast upon greater wonders ; passing around the sawdust ellipse that contained two soul-cloying rings , to find seats whence they might behold the splendors so soon to be unfolded .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 82]: Every one who was not buying the eternal lemonade was eating something ; and the faces of children shone with gourmand rapture ; indeed , very often the eyes of them were all you saw , half-closed in palate-gloating over a huge apple , or a bulky oblong of popcorn , partly unwrapped from its blue tissue-paper cover ; or else it might be a luscious pink crescent of watermelon , that left its ravisher stained and dripping to the brow .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 65]: Here , as in the morning , the hawkers raised their cries in unintermittent shrillness , offering to the musically inclined the Happy Evenings Song-book , alleged to contain those treasures , all the latest songs of the day , or presented for the consideration of the humorous the Lawrence Lapearl Joke-book , setting forth in full the art of comical entertainment and repartee .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 41]: -LRB- Schofields ' Henry bought two of these -- no doubt on the principle that two were twice as instructive as one -- intending to bury himself in study and do battle with Tom Martin on his own ground . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 163]: Here swayed the myriad palm-leaf fans ; here paraded blushing youth and rosy maiden , more relentlessly arm-in-arm than ever ; here crept the octogenarian , Mr. Bodeffer , shaking on cane and the shoulder of posterity ; here waddled Mr. Snoddy , who had hurried through the animal tent for fear of meeting the elephant ; here marched sturdy yeomen and stout wives ; here came William Todd and his Anna Belle , the good William hushed with the embarrassments of love , but looking out warily with the white of his eye for Mr. Martin , and determined not to sit within a hundred yards of him ; here rolled in the orbit of habit the bacchanal , Mr. Wilkerson , who politely answered in kind all the uncouth roarings and guttural ejaculations of jungle and fen that came from the animal tent ; in brief , here came with lightest hearts the population of Carlow and part of Amo .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 13]: Helen had found a true word : it was a big family .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 51]: Jim Bardlock , broadly smiling and rejuvenated , shorn of depression , paused in front of the `` reserve '' seats , with Mrs. Bardlock on his arm , and called loudly to a gentleman on a tier about the level of Jim 's head : `` How are ye ?
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 19]: I reckon we were a _ little _ too smart fer 'em , this morning , huh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 33]: Five or six hundred people -- every one within hearing -- fumed to look at Jim ; but the gentleman addressed was engaged in conversation with a lady and did not notice .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 3]: `` Hi !
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 4]: Hi , there !
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 4]: _ Say _ !
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 4]: Mr. Harkless ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 5]: bellowed Jim , informally .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 8]: The people turned to look at Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 11]: His attention was arrested and his cheek grew red . ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 7]: _ What is it _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 12]: he asked , a little confused and a good deal annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 21]: `` I do n't hear what ye say , '' shouted Jim , putting his hand to his ear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 7]: _ What is it _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 5]: repeated the young man .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 15]: `` I 'll kill that fellow to-night , '' he added to Lige Willetts .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 12]: `` Some one ought to have done it long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 11]: `` I _ say _ , WHAT IS IT ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 20]: `` I only wanted to say me and you certainly did fool these here Hoosiers this morning , huh ?
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 24]: Hustled them two fellers through the court-house , and nobody never thought to slip round to the other door and head us off .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 15]: We were jest a _ leetle _ too many fer 'em , huh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 36]: From an upper tier of seats the rusty length of Mr. Martin erected itself joint by joint , like an extension ladder , and he peered down over the gaping faces at the Town Marshal .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 34]: `` Excuse me , '' he said sadly to those behind him , but his dry voice penetrated everywhere , `` I got up to hear Jim say ` We ' again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 24]: Mr. Bardlock joined in the laugh against himself , and proceeded with his wife to some seats , forty or fifty feet distant .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 29]: When he had settled himself comfortably , he shouted over cheerfully to the unhappy editor : `` Them shell-men got it in fer you , Mr. Harkless . ''
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 12]: `` Ai n't that fool shet up _ yit _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 8]: snarled the aged Mr. Bodeffer , indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 23]: He was sitting near the young couple , and the expression of his sympathy was distinctly audible to them and many others .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 17]: `` Got no more regards than a brazing calf-disturbin ' a feller with his sweetheart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 20]: `` The both of 'em says they 're goin ' to do fer you , '' bleated Mr. Bardlock .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 11]: `` Swear they 'll git their evens with ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 5]: Mr. Martin rose again .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 24]: `` Do n't git scared and leave town , Mr. Harkless , '' he called out ; `` Jim 'll protect you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 35]: Vastly to the young man 's relief the band began to play , and the equestrians and equestriennes capered out from the dressing-tent for the `` Grand Entrance , '' and the performance commenced .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 99]: Through the long summer afternoon it went on : wonders of horsemanship and horsewomanship ; hair-raising exploits on wires , tight and slack ; giddy tricks on the high trapeze ; feats of leaping and tumbling in the rings ; while the tireless musicians blatted inspiringly through it all , only pausing long enough to allow that uproarious jester , the clown , to ask the ring-master what he would do if a young lady came up and kissed him on the street , and to exploit his hilarities during the short intervals of rest for the athletes .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 27]: When it was over , John and Helen found themselves in the midst of a densely packed crowd , and separated from Miss Briscoe and Lige .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 14]: People were pushing and shoving , and he saw her face grow pale .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 40]: He realized with a pang of sympathy how helpless he would feel if he were as small as she , and at his utmost height could only see big , suffocating backs and huge shoulders pressing down from above .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 24]: He was keeping them from crowding heavily upon her with all his strength , and a royal feeling of protectiveness came over him .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 5]: She was so little .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 72]: And yet , without the remotest hint of hardness , she gave him such a distinct impression of poise and equilibrium , she seemed so able to meet anything that might come , to understand it -- even to laugh at it -- so Americanly capable and sure of the event , that in spite of her pale cheek he could not feel quite so protective as he wished to feel .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 20]: He managed to get her to one of the tent-poles , and placed her with her back to it .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 46]: Then he set one of his own hands against it over her head , braced himself and stood , keeping a little space about her , ruggedly letting the crowd surge against him as it would ; no one should touch her in rough carelessness .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 22]: It was rather trying in there , '' she said , and looked up into his eyes with a divine gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 15]: `` Please do n't do that , '' he answered in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 5]: `` Do what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 6]: `` Look like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 11]: She not only looked like that , but more so .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 25]: `` Young man , young man , '' she said , `` I fear you 're wishful of turning a girl 's head . ''
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 35]: The throng was thick around them , garrulous and noisy , but they two were more richly alone together , to his appreciation , than if they stood on some far satellite of Mars .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 69]: He was not to forget that moment , and he kept the picture of her , as she leaned against the big blue tent-pole , there , in his heart : the clear gray eyes lifted to his , the delicate face with the color stealing back to her cheeks , and the brave little figure that had run so straight to him out of the night shadows .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 59]: There was something about her , and in the moment , that suddenly touched him with a saddening sweetness too keen to be borne ; the forget-me-not finger of the flying hour that could not come again was laid on his soul , and he felt the tears start from his heart on their journey to his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 10]: He knew that he should always remember that moment .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 6]: She knew it , too .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 16]: She put her hand to her cheek and turned away from him a little tremulously .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 4]: Both were silent .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 8]: They had been together since early morning .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 6]: Plattville was proud of him .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 49]: Many a friendly glance from the folk who jostled about them favored his suit and wished both of them well , and many lips , opening to speak to Harkless in passing , closed when their owners -LRB- more tactful than Mr. Bardlock -RRB- looked a second time .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 29]: Old Tom Martin , still perched alone On his high seat , saw them standing by the tent-pole , and watched them from under his rusty hat brim .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 51]: `` I reckon it 's be 'n three or four thousand years since I was young , '' he sighed to himself ; then , pushing his hat still further down over his eyes : `` I do n't believe I 'd ort to rightly look on at that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 29]: He sighed again as he rose , and gently spoke the name of his dead wife : `` Marjie , -- it 's be 'n lonesome , sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 54]: I reckon you 're mighty tired waitin ' for me , ever since sixty-four -- yet maybe not ; Ulysses S. Grant 's over on your side now , and perhaps you 've got acquainted with him ; you always thought a good deal more of him than you did of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 12]: `` Do you see that tall old man up there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 9]: said Helen , nodding her head toward Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 10]: `` I think I should like to know him .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 8]: I 'm sure I like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 8]: `` That is old Tom Martin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 5]: `` I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 13]: `` I was sorry and ashamed about all that conspicuousness and shouting .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 19]: It must have been very unpleasant for you ; it must have been so , for a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 13]: Please try to forgive me for letting you in for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 6]: `` But I liked it .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 26]: It was ` all in the family , ' and it was so jolly and good-natured , and that dear old man was so bright .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 44]: Do you know , '' she said softly , `` I do n't think I 'm such a stranger -- I -- I think I love all these people a great deal -- in spite of having known them only two days . ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 8]: At that a wild exhilaration possessed him .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 51]: He wanted to shake hands with everybody in the tent , to tell them all that he loved them with his whole heart , but , what was vastly more important , _ she _ loved them a great deal -- in spite of having known them only two days !
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 41]: He made the horses prance on the homeward drive , and once , when she told him that she had read a good many of his political columns in the `` Herald , '' he ran them into a fence .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 75]: After this it occurred to him that they were nearing their destination and had come at a perversely sharp gait ; so he held the roans down to a snail 's pace -LRB- if it be true that a snail 's natural gait is not a trot -RRB- for the rest of the way , while they talked of Tom Meredith and books and music , and discovered that they differed widely about Ibsen .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 13]: They found Mr. Fisbee in the yard , talking to Judge Briscoe .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 32]: As they drove up , and before the horses had quite stopped , Helen leaped to the ground and ran to the old scholar with both her hands outstretched to him .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 33]: He looked timidly at her , and took the hands she gave him ; then he produced from his pocket a yellow telegraph envelope , watching her anxiously as she received it .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 30]: However , she seemed to attach no particular importance to it , and , instead of opening it , leaned toward him , still holding one of his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 7]: `` These awful old men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 13]: Harkless groaned inwardly as he handed the horses over to the judge .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 14]: `` I dare say _ he _ 'll kiss her , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 18]: But , when the editor and Mr. Willetts had gone , it was Helen who kissed Fisbee .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 15]: `` They 're coming out to spend the evening , are n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 16]: asked Briscoe , nodding to the young men as they set off down the road .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 32]: `` Lige has to come whether he wants to or not , '' Minnie laughed , rather consciously ; `` It 's his turn to-night to look after Mr. Harkless . ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 14]: `` I guess he wo n't mind coming , '' said the judge .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 50]: `` Well , '' returned his daughter , glancing at Helen , who stood apart , reading the telegram to Fisbee , `` I know if he follows Mr. Harkless he 'll get here pretty soon after supper -- as soon as the moon comes up , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 15]: The editor of the `` Herald '' was late to his supper that evening .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 33]: It was dusk when he reached the hotel , and , for the first time in history , a gentleman sat down to meat in that house of entertainment in evening dress .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 49]: There was no one in the diningroom when he went in ; the other boarders had finished , and it was Cynthia 's `` evening out , '' but the landlord came and attended to his guests ' wants himself , and chatted with him while he ate .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 39]: `` There 's a picture of Henry Clay , '' remarked Landis , in obvious relevancy to his companion 's attire , `` there 's a picture of Henry Clay somewheres about the house in a swallow-tail coat .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 33]: Governor Ray spoke here in one in early times , Bodeffer says , except it was higher built up 'n yourn about the collar , and had brass buttons , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 16]: Ole man Wimby was here to-night , '' the landlord continued , changing the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 10]: `` He waited around fer ye a good while .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 21]: He 's be 'n mighty wrought up sence the trouble this morning , an ' wanted to see ye bad .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 33]: I do n't know ' f you seen it , but that feller ' t knocked your hat off was mighty near tore to pieces in the crowd before he got away .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 36]: ` Seems some the boys re - _ cog _ - nized him as one the Cross-Roads Skillets , and sicked the dogs on him , and he had a pretty mean time of it .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 29]: Wimby says the Cross-Roads folks 'll be worse 'n ever , and , says he , ` Tell him to stick close to town , ' says he .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 22]: ` They 'll do anything to git him now , ' says he , ` and _ resk _ anything . '
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 29]: I told him you would n't take no stock in it , but , see here , do n't you put nothin ' too mean fer them folks .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 16]: I tell you , Mr. Harkless , plenty of us are scared fer ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 48]: The good fellow was so earnest that when the editor 's meal was finished and he would have departed , Landis detained him almost by force until the arrival of Mr. Willetts , who , the landlord knew , was his allotted escort ' for the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 79]: When Lige came -LRB- wearing a new tie , a pink one he had hastened to buy as soon as his engagements had allowed him the opportunity -RRB- , Mr. Landis hissed a savage word of reproach for his tardiness in his ear , and whisperingly bade him not let the other out of reach that night , to which Willetts replied with a nod implying his trustworthiness ; and the young men set off in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 39]: Harkless wondered if his costume were not an injustice to his companion , but he did not regret it ; he would wear his best court suit , his laces and velvets , for deference to that lady .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 64]: It was a painful thing to remember his dusty rustiness of the night before , the awful Carlow cut of his coat , and his formless black cravat ; the same felt hat he wore again to-night , perforce , but it was brushed -- brushed almost to holes in spots , and somehow he had added a touch of shape to it .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 31]: His dress-coat was an antique ; fashions had changed , no doubt ; he did not know ; possibly she would recognize its vintage -- but it was a dress-coat .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 17]: Lige walked along talking ; Harkless answering `` Yes '' and `` No '' at random .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 46]: The woodland-spiced air was like champagne to him ; the road under foot so elastic and springy that he felt like a thoroughbred before a race ; he wanted to lift his foot knee-high at every step , he had so much energy to spare .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 53]: In the midst of a speech of Lige 's about the look of the wheat he suddenly gave out a sigh so deep , so heartfelt , so vibrant , so profound , that Willetts turned with astonishment ; but when his eye reached his companion 's face , Harkless was smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 6]: The editor extended his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 10]: `` Shake hands , Lige , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 26]: The moon peeped over the shoulder of an eastern wood , and the young men suddenly descried their long shadows stretching in front of them .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 24]: Harkless turned to look at the silhouetted town , the tree-tops and roofs and the Methodist church spire , silvered at the edges .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 10]: `` Do you see that town , Willetts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 12]: he asked , laying his fingers on his companion 's sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 12]: `` That 's the best town in the United States ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 20]: `` I always kind of thought you did n't much like it , '' said the other , puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 16]: `` Seemed to me you always sort of wished you had n't settled here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 9]: A little further on they passed Mr. Fisbee .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 18]: He was walking into the village with his head thrown back , a strange thing for him .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 10]: They gave him a friendly greeting and passed on .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 8]: `` Well , it beats me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 12]: observed Lige , when the old man was out of hearing .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 10]: `` He 's be 'n there to supper again .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 54]: He was there all day yesterday , and with 'em at the lecture , and at the deepo day before and he looks like another man , and dressed up -- for him -- to beat thunder -- What do you expect makes him so thick out there all of a sudden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 8]: `` I had n't thought about it .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 16]: The judge and he have been friends a good while , have n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 13]: `` Yes , three or four years ; but not like this .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 6]: It beats _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 11]: He 's all upset over Miss Sherwood , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 25]: Old enough to be her grandfather , too , the old -- '' His companion stopped him , dropping a hand on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 4]: `` Listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 28]: They were at the corner of the Briscoe picket fence , and a sound lilted through the stillness -- a touch on the keys that Harkless knew .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 7]: `` Listen , '' he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 12]: It was the `` Moonlight Sonata '' that Helen was playing .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 14]: `` It 's a pretty piece , '' observed Lige after a time .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 18]: John could have choked him , but he answered : `` Yes , it is seraphic . ''
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 7]: `` Who made it up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 4]: pursued Mr. Willetts .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 4]: `` Beethoven . ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 6]: `` Foreigner , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 40]: Yet in some way or another makes me think of fishing down on the Wabash bend in Vigo , and camping out nights like this ; it 's a mighty pretty country around there -- especially at night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 18]: The sonata was finished , and then she sang -- sang the `` Angel 's Serenade . ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 67]: As the soft soprano lifted and fell in the modulations of that song there was in its timbre , apart from the pure , amber music of it , a questing , seeking pathos , and Willetts felt the hand on his shoulder tighten and then relax ; and , as the song ended , he saw that his companion 's eyes were shining and moist .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 62]: NIGHT : IT IS BAD LUCK TO SING BEFORE BREAKFAST There was a lace of faint mists along the creek and beyond , when John and Helen reached their bench -LRB- of course they went back there -RRB- , and broken roundelays were croaking from a bayou up the stream , where rakish frogs held carnival in resentment of the lonesomeness .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 7]: The air was still and close .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 33]: Hundreds of fire-flies coquetted with the darkness amongst the trees across the water , glinting from unexpected spots , shading their little lanterns for a second to glow again from other shadows .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 21]: The sky was a wonderful olive green ; a lazy cloud drifted in it and lapped itself athwart the moon .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 37]: `` The dead painters design the skies for us each day and night , I think , '' Helen said , as she dropped a little scarf from her shoulders and leaned back on the bench .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 18]: `` It must be the only way to keep them happy and busy ` up there . '
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 19]: They let them take turns , and those not on duty , probably float around and criticise . ''
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 44]: `` They 've given a good man his turn to-night , '' said John ; `` some quiet colorist , a poetic , friendly soul , no Turner -- though I think I 've seen a Turner sunset or two in Plattville . ''
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 10]: `` It was a sculptor 's sunset this evening .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 5]: Did you see it ?
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 13]: -- great massy clouds piled heap on heap , almost with violence .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 7]: I 'm sure it was Michelangelo .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 16]: The judge did n't think it meant Michelangelo ; he thought it meant rain . ''
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 24]: `` Michelangelo gets a chance rather often , does n't he , considering the number of art people there must be over there ?
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 69]: I believe I 've seen a good many sunsets of his , and a few dawns , too ; the dawns not for a long time -- I used to see them more frequently toward the close of senior year , when we sat up all night talking , knowing we 'd lose one another soon , and trying to hold on as long as we could . ''
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 9]: She turned to him with a little frown .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 37]: `` Why have you never let Tom Meredith know you were living so near him , less than a hundred miles , when he has always liked and admired you above all the rest of mankind ?
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 33]: I know that he has tried time and again to hear of you , but the other men wrote that they knew nothing -- that it was thought you had gone abroad .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 61]: I had heard of you , and so must he have seen your name in the Rouen papers -- about the ` White-Caps , ' and in politics -- but he would never dream of connecting the Plattville Mr. Harkless with _ his _ Mr. Harkless , though _ I _ did , just a little , and rather vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 13]: I knew , of course , when you came into the lecture .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 11]: But why have n't you written to my cousin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 14]: `` Rouen seems a long way from here , '' he answered quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 14]: `` I 've only been there once -- half a day on business .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 29]: Except that , I 've never been further away than Amo or Gainesville , for a convention or to make a speech , since I came here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 4]: `` Wicked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 11]: she exclaimed , `` To shut yourself up like this !
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 24]: I said it was fine to drop out of the world ; but why have you cut off your old friends from you ?
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 37]: Why have n't you had a relapse , now and then , and come over to hear Ysaye play and Melba sing , or to see Mansfield or Henry Irving , when we have had them ?
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 12]: And do you think you 've been quite fair to Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 13]: What right had you to assume that he had forgotten you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 31]: `` Oh , I did n't exactly mean forgotten , '' he said , pulling a blade of grass to and fro between his fingers , staring at it absently .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 16]: `` It 's only that I have dropped out of the world , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 41]: I kept track of every one , saw most of my friends , or corresponded , now and then , for a year or so after I left college ; but people do n't miss you much after a while .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 25]: They rather expected me to do a lot of things , in a way , you know , and I was n't doing them .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 7]: I was glad to get away .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 18]: I always had an itch for newspaper work , and I went on a New York paper .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 17]: Maybe it was the wrong paper ; at least , I was n't fit for it .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 42]: There was something in the side of life I saw , too , not only on the paper , that made me heart-sick ; and then the rush and fight and scramble to be first , to beat the other man .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 6]: Probably I am too squeamish .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 70]: I saw classmates and college friends diving into it , bound to come out ahead , dear old , honest , frank fellows , who had been so happy-go-lucky and kind and gay , growing too busy to meet and be good to any man who could n't be good to them , asking -LRB- more delicately -RRB- the eternal question , ` What does it get me ? '
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 24]: You might think I bad-met with unkindness ; but it was not so ; it was the other way more than I deserved .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 63]: But the cruel competition , the thousands fighting for places , the multitude scrambling for each ginger-bread baton , the cold faces on the streets -- perhaps it 's all right and good ; of course it has to _ be _ -- but I wanted to get out of it , though I did n't want to come _ here _ .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 4]: That was chance .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 16]: A new man bought the paper I was working for , and its policy changed .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 32]: Many of the same men still wrote for it , facing cheerfully about and advocating a tricky theory , vehement champions of a set of personal schemers and waxy images . ''
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 36]: He spoke with feeling ; but now , as though a trifle ashamed of too much seriousness , and justifiably afraid of talking like one of his own editorials , he took a lighter tone .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 47]: `` I had been taken on the paper through a friend and not through merit , and by the same undeserved , kindly influence , after a month or so I was set to writing short political editorials , and was at it nearly two years .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 24]: When the paper changed hands the new proprietor indicated that he would be willing to have me stay and write the other way .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 19]: I refused ; and it became somewhat plain to me that I was beginning to be a failure .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 23]: `` A cousin of mine , the only relative I had , died in Chicago , and I went to his funeral .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 23]: I happened to hear of the Carlow ` Herald ' through an agent there , the most eloquent gentleman I ever met .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 28]: I was younger , and even more thoughtless than now , and I had a little money and I handed it over for the ` Herald . '
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 15]: I wanted to run a paper myself , and to build up a power !
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 56]: And then , though I only lived here the first few years of my life and all the rest of it had been spent in the East , I was born in Indiana , and , in a way , the thought of coming back to a life-work in my native State appealed to me .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 48]: I always had a dim sort of feeling that the people out in these parts knew more -- had more sense and were less artificial , I mean -- and were kinder , and tried less to be somebody else , than almost any other people anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 7]: And I believe it 's so .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 19]: It 's dull , here in Carlow , of course -- that is , it used to be .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 22]: The agent explained that I could make the paper a daily at once , with an enormous circulation in the country .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 7]: I was very , very young .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 11]: Then I came here and saw what I had got .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 14]: Possibly it is because I am sensitive that I never let Tom know .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 30]: They expected me to amount to something ; but I do n't believe his welcome would be less hearty to a failure -- he is a good heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 4]: `` Failure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 10]: she cried , and clapped her hands and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 24]: `` I 'm really not very tragic about it , though I must seem consumed with self-pity , '' he returned , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 20]: `` It is only that I have dropped out of the world while Tom is still in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 9]: `` Dropped out of the world ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 5]: she echoed , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 11]: `` Ca n't you see you 've dropped into it ?
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 22]: That you -- '' `` Last night I was honored by your praise of my graceful mode of quitting it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 11]: `` And so you wish me to be consistent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 4]: she retorted scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 15]: `` What becomes of your gallantry when _ we _ abide by reason ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 12]: `` True enough ; equality is a denial of privilege . ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 9]: `` And privilege is a denial of equality .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 9]: I do n't like that at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 14]: She turned a serious , suddenly illuminated face upon him and spoke earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 29]: `` It 's my hobby , I should tell you , and I 'm very tired of that nonsense about ` women always sounding the personal note . '
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 12]: It _ should _ be sounded as we would sound it .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 22]: And I think we could bear the loss of ` privilege ' -- '' He laughed and raised a protesting hand .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 9]: `` But _ we _ could n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 17]: `` No , you could n't ; it 's the ribbon of superiority in your buttonhole .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 83]: I know several women who manage to live without men to open doors for them , and I think I could bear to let a man pass before me now and then , or wear his hat in an office where I happened to be ; and I could get my own ice at a dance , I think , possibly with even less fuss and scramble than I 've sometimes observed in the young men who have done it for me .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 31]: But you know you would never let us do things for ourselves , no matter what legal equality might be declared , even when we get representation for our taxation .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 15]: You will never be able to deny yourselves giving us our ` privilege . '
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 6]: I hate being waited on .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 9]: I 'd rather do things for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 118]: She was so earnest in her satire , so full of scorn and so serious in her meaning , and there was such a contrast between what she said and her person ; she looked so preeminently the pretty marquise , all silks and softness , the little exquisite , so essentially to be waited on and helped , to have cloaks thrown over the dampness for her to tread upon , to be run about for -- he could see half a dozen youths rushing about for her ices , for her carriage , for her chaperone , for her wrap , at dances -- that to save his life he could not repress a chuckle .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 18]: He managed to make it inaudible , however ; and it was as well that he did .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 22]: `` I understand your love of newspaper work , '' she went on , less vehemently , but not less earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 14]: `` I have always wanted to do it myself , wanted to immensely .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 15]: I ca n't think of any more fascinating way of earning one 's living .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 8]: And I know I could do it .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 13]: Why do n't you make the ` Herald ' a daily ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 17]: To hear her speak of `` earning one 's living '' was too much for him .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 31]: She gave the impression of riches , not only for the fine texture and fashioning of her garments , but one felt that luxuries had wrapped her from her birth .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 47]: He had not had much time to wonder what she did in Plattville ; it had occurred to him that it was a little odd that she could plan to spend any extent of time there , even if she had liked Minnie Briscoe at school .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 27]: He felt that she must have been sheltered and petted and waited on all her life ; one could not help yearning to wait on her .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 24]: He answered inarticulately , `` Oh , some day , '' in reply to her question , and then burst into outright laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 24]: `` I might have known you would n't take me seriously , '' she said with no indignation , only a sad wistfulness .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 8]: `` I am well used to it .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 18]: I think it is because I am not tall ; people take big girls with more gravity .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 9]: Big people are nearly always listened to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 5]: `` Listened to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 16]: he said , and felt that he must throw himself on his knees before her .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 9]: `` You ought n't to mind being Titania .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 18]: She was listened to , you -- '' She sprang to her feet and her eyes flashed .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 13]: `` Do you think personal comment is ever in good taste ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 15]: she cried fiercely , and in his surprise he almost fell off the bench .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 28]: `` If there is one thing I can not bear , it is to be told that I am ' _ small _ ' I am not !
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 15]: Every one who is n't a giantess is n't ' _ small _ ' .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 6]: I _ hate _ personalities !
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 16]: I am a great deal over five feet , a great deal more than that .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 61]: I -- '' `` Please , _ please _ , '' he said , `` I did n't -- '' `` Do n't say you are sorry , '' she interrupted , and in spite of his contrition he found her angry voice delicious , it was still so sweet , hot with indignation , but ringing , not harsh .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 14]: `` Do n't say you did n't mean it ; because you did !
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 12]: You ca n't unsay it , you can not alter it !
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 3]: Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 24]: She drew in her breath with a sharp sigh , and covering her face with her hands , sank back upon the bench .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 19]: `` I will not cry , '' she said , not so firmly as she thought she did .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 6]: `` My blessed child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 15]: he cried , in great distress and perturbation , `` What have I done ?
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 16]: I -- I -- '' `` Call me ` small ' all you like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 6]: `` I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 5]: It is n't that .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 10]: You must n't think me such an imbecile . ''
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 19]: She dropped her hands from her face and shook the tears from her eyes with a mournful laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 13]: He saw that her hands were clenched tightly and her lip trembled .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 7]: `` I will not cry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 7]: she said in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 24]: `` Somebody ought to murder me ; I ought to have thought -- personalities _ are _ hideous -- '' `` Do n't !
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 6]: It was n't that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 39]: `` I ought to be shot -- '' `` Ah , please do n't say that , '' she said , shuddering ; `` please do n't , not even as a joke -- after last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 19]: `` But I ought to be for hurting you , indeed -- '' She laughed sadly , again .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 6]: `` It was n't that .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 9]: I do n't care what you call me .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 4]: I am small .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 12]: You 'll try to forgive me for being such a baby ?
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 8]: I did n't mean anything I said .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 13]: I have n't acted so badly since I was a child . ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 10]: `` It 's my fault , all of it .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 6]: I 've tired you out .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 21]: And I let you get into that crush at the circus -- '' he was going on , remorsefully . ''
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 5]: _ That _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 3]: she interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 13]: `` I do n't think I would have missed the circus . ''
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 28]: He had a thrilling hope that she meant the tent-pole ; she looked as if she meant that , but he dared not let himself believe it .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 27]: `` No , '' he continued ; `` I have been so madly happy in being with you that I 've fairly worn out your patience .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 28]: I 've haunted you all day , and I have -- '' `` All that has nothing to do with it , '' she said , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 18]: `` Just after you left , this afternoon , I found that I could not stay here .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 19]: My people are going abroad , to Dresden , at once , and I must go with them .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 8]: That 's what almost made me cry .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 6]: I leave to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 8]: He felt something strike at his heart .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 39]: In the sudden sense of dearth he had no astonishment that she should betray such agitation over her departure from a place she had known so little , and friends who certainly were not part of her life .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 23]: He rose to his feet , and , resting his arm against a sycamore , stood staring away from her at nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 5]: She did not move .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 6]: There was a long silence .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 50]: He had wakened suddenly ; the skies had been sapphire , the sward emerald , Plattville a Camelot of romance ; to be there , enchantment -- and now , like a meteor burned out in a breath , the necromancy fell away and he gazed into desolate years .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 30]: The thought of the Square , his dusty office , the bleak length of Main Street , as they should appear to-morrow , gave him a faint physical sickness .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 34]: To-day it had all been touched to beauty ; he had felt fit to live and work there a thousand years -- a fool 's dream , and the waking was to emptiness .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 56]: He should die now of hunger and thirst in that Sahara ; he hoped the Fates would let it be soon -- but he knew they would not ; knew that this was hysteria , that in his endurance he should plod on , plod , plod dustily on , through dingy , lonely years .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 13]: There was a rumble of thunder far out on the western prairie .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 24]: A cold breath stole through the hot stillness , and an arm of vapor reached out between the moon and the quiet earth .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 3]: Darkness fell .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 10]: The man and the girl kept silence between them .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 19]: They might have been two sad guardians of the black little stream that splashed unseen at their feet .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 17]: Now and then an echo of far away lightning faintly illumined them with a green light .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 16]: Thunder rolled nearer , ominously ; the gods were driving their chariots over the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 14]: The chill breath passed , leaving the air again to its hot inertia .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 25]: `` I did not want to go , '' she said , at last , with tears just below the surface of her voice .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 19]: `` I wanted to stay here , but he -- they would n't -- I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 7]: `` Wanted to stay here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 8]: he said , huskily , not turning .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 4]: `` Here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 8]: `` In Rouen , you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 5]: `` In Plattville . ''
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 5]: `` In Plattville ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 6]: He turned now , astounded .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 16]: `` Yes ; would n't you have taken me on the ` Herald ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 7]: She rose and came toward him .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 29]: `` I could have supported myself here if you would -- and I 've studied how newspapers are made ; I know I could have earned a wage .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 9]: We could have made it a daily . ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 28]: He searched in vain for a trace of raillery in her voice ; there was none ; she seemed to intend her words to be taken literally .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 10]: `` I do n't understand , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 10]: `` I do n't know what you mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 36]: `` I mean that I want to stay here ; that I ought to stay here ; that my conscience tells me I should -- but I ca n't and it makes me very unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 9]: That was why I acted so badly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 5]: `` Your conscience ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 17]: `` Oh , I know what a jumble and puzzle it must seem to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 25]: `` I only know one thing ; that you are going away to-morrow morning , and that I shall never see you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 6]: The darkness had grown heavy .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 64]: They could not see each other ; but a wan glimmer gave him a fleeting , misty view of her ; she stood half-turned away from him , her hand to her cheek in the uncertain fashion of his great moment of the afternoon ; her eyes-he saw in the flying picture that he caught -- were adorably troubled and her hand trembled .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 93]: She had been irresistible in her gaiety ; but now that a mysterious distress assailed her , the reason for which he had no guess , she was so divinely pathetic ; and seemed such a rich and lovely and sad and happy thing to have come into his life only to go out of it ; and he was so full of the prophetic sense of loss of her -- it seemed so much like losing everything -- that he found too much to say to be able to say anything .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 10]: He tried to speak , and choked a little .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 11]: A big drop of rain fell on his bare head .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 11]: Neither of them noticed the weather or cared for it .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 14]: They stood with the renewed blackness hanging like a thick drapery between them .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 18]: `` Can -- can you -- tell me why you think you ought not to go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 10]: he whispered , finally , with a great effort .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 6]: `` No ; not now .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 20]: But I know you would think I am right in wanting to stay , '' she cried , impulsively .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 21]: `` I know you would , if you knew about it -- but I ca n't , I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 8]: I must go in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 20]: `` I should always think you right , '' he answered in an unsteady tone , `` Always ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 18]: He went over to the bench , fumbled about for his hat , and picked it up .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 16]: `` Come , '' he said , gently , `` I am going now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 23]: She stood quite motionless for a full minute or longer ; then , without a word , she moved toward the house .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 18]: He went to her with hands extended to find her , and his fingers touched her sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 15]: Then together and silently they found the garden-path ; and followed its dim length .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 13]: In the orchard he touched her sleeve again and led the way .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 11]: As they came out behind the house she detained him .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 11]: Stopping short , she shook his hand from her arm .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 24]: She spoke in a single breath , as if it were all one word : `` Will you tell me why you go ?
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 5]: It is not late .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 17]: Why do you wish to leave me , when I shall not see you again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 9]: `` The Lord be good to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 21]: he broke out , all his long-pent passion of dreams rushing to his lips , now that the barrier fell .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 17]: `` Do n't you see it is because I ca n't bear to let you go ?
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 9]: I hoped to get away without saying it .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 6]: I want to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 11]: I want to be with myself and try to realize .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 16]: I did n't want to make a babbling idiot of myself -- but I am !
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 22]: It is because I do n't want another second of your sweetness to leave an added pain when you 've gone .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 32]: It is because I do n't want to hear your voice again , to have it haunt me in the loneliness you will leave -- but it 's useless , useless !
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 43]: I shall hear it always , just as I shall always see your face , just as I have heard your voice and seen your face these seven years -- ever since I first saw you , a child at Winter Harbor .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 30]: I forgot for a while ; I thought it was a girl I had made up out of my own heart , but it was you -- you always !
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 33]: The impression I thought nothing of at the time , just the merest touch on my heart , light as it was , grew and grew deeper until it was there forever .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 22]: You 've known me twenty-four hours , and I understand what you think of me for speaking to you like this .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 28]: If I had known you for years and had waited and had the right to speak and keep your respect , what have I to offer you ?
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 18]: I , could n't even take care of you if you went mad as I and listened .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 8]: I 've no excuse for this raving .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 6]: Yes , I have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 15]: He saw her in another second of lightning , a sudden , bright one .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 17]: Her back was turned to him ; she had taken a few startled steps from him .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 20]: `` Ah , '' he cried , `` you are glad enough , now , to see me go !
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 4]: I knew it .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 7]: I wanted to spare myself that .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 13]: I tried not to be a hysterical fool in your eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 11]: He turned aside and his head fell on his breast .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 20]: `` God help me , '' he said , `` what will this place be to me now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 24]: The breeze had risen ; it gathered force ; it was a chill wind , and there rose a wailing on the prairie .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 7]: Drops of rain began to fall .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 25]: `` You will not think a question implied in this , '' he said more composedly , and with an unhappy laugh at himself .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 34]: `` I believe you will not think me capable of asking you if you care -- '' `` No , '' she answered ; `` I -- I do not love you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 8]: Was it a question , after all ?
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 23]: I -- you read me better than I do , perhaps -- but if I asked , I knew the answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 13]: She made as if to speak again , but words refused her .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 14]: After a moment , `` Good-by , '' he said , very steadily .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 34]: `` I thank you for the charity that has given me this little time with you -- it will always be -- precious to me -- I shall always be your servant . ''
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 13]: His steadiness did not carry him to the end of his sentence .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 4]: `` Good-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 12]: She started toward him and stopped , without his seeing her .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 18]: She answered nothing ; but stretched out her hand to him and then let it fall quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 8]: `` Good-by , '' he said again .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 9]: `` I shall go out the orchard gate .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 7]: Please tell them good-night for me .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 7]: Wo n't you speak to me ?
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 3]: Good-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 13]: He stood waiting while the rising wind blew their garments about them .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 9]: She leaned against the wall of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 20]: `` Wo n't you say good-by and tell me you can forget my -- '' She did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 5]: he cried , wildly .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 8]: `` Since you do n't forget it !
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 18]: I have spoiled what might have been a pleasant memory for you , and I know it .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 25]: You were already troubled , and I have added , and you wo n't forget it , nor shall I -- nor shall I !
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 14]: Do n't say good-by -- I can say it for both of us .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 12]: God bless you -- and good-by , good-by , good-by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 15]: He crushed his hat down over his eyes and ran toward the orchard gate .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 20]: For a moment lightning flashed repeatedly ; she saw him go out the gate and disappear into sudden darkness .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 12]: He ran through the field and came out on the road .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 12]: Heaven and earth were revealed again for a dazzling white second .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 35]: From horizon to horizon rolled clouds contorted like an illimitable field of inverted haystacks , and beneath them enormous volumes of pale vapor were tumbling in the west , advancing eastward with sinister swiftness .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 22]: She ran to a little knoll at the corner of the house and saw him set his face to the storm .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 36]: She cried aloud to him with all her strength and would have followed , but the wind took the words out of her mouth and drove her back cowering to the shelter of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 60]: Out on the road the dust came lashing and stinging him like a thousand nettles ; it smothered him , and beat upon him so that he covered his face with his sleeve and fought into the storm shoulder foremost , dimly glad of its rage , scarcely conscious of it , keeping westward on his way to nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 15]: West or east , south or north -- it was all one to him .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 24]: The few heavy drops that fell boiling into the dust ceased to come ; the rain withheld while the wind-kings rode on earth .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 8]: On he went in spite of them .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 13]: On and on , running blindly when he could run at all .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 8]: At least , the wind-kings were company .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 7]: He had been so long alone .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 45]: He could remember no home that had ever been his since he was a little child , neither father nor mother , no one who belonged to him or to whom he belonged , except one cousin , an old man who was dead .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 26]: For a day his dreams had found in a girl 's eyes the precious thing that is called home -- oh , the wild fancy !
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 4]: He laughed aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 33]: There was a startling answer ; a lance of living fire hurled from the sky , riving the fields before his eyes , while crash on crash of artillery numbed his ears .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 11]: With that his common-sense awoke and he looked about him .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 20]: He was almost two miles from town ; the nearest house was the Briscoes ' far down the road .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 8]: He knew the rain would come now .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 11]: There was a big oak near him at the roadside .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 22]: He stepped under its sheltering branches and leaned against the great trunk , wiping the perspiration and dust from his face .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 12]: A moment of stunned quiet had succeeded the peal of thunder .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 20]: It was followed by several moments of incessant lightning that played along the road and danced in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 33]: From that intolerable brightness he turned his head and saw , standing against the fence , five feet away , a man , leaning over the top rail and looking at him .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 21]: The same flash staggered brilliantly before Helen 's eyes as she crouched against the back steps of the brick house .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 39]: It scarred a picture like a marine of big waves : the tossing tops of the orchard trees ; for in the same second the full fury of the storm was loosed , wind and rain and hail .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 30]: It drove her against the kitchen door with cruel force ; the latch lifted , the door blew open violently , and she struggled to close it in vain .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 6]: The house seemed to rock .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 14]: A lamp flickered toward her from the inner doorway and was blown out .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 3]: `` Helen !
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 3]: Helen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 7]: came Minnie 's voice , anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 5]: `` Is that you ?
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 8]: We were coming to look for you .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 6]: Did you get wet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 14]: Mr. Willetts threw his weight against the door and managed to close it .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 28]: Then Minnie found her friend 's hand and led her through the dark hall to the parlor where the judge sat , placidly reading by a student-lamp .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 8]: Lige chuckled as they left the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 41]: `` I guess you did n't try too hard to shut that door , Harkless , '' he said , and then , when they came into the lighted room , `` Why , where _ is _ Harkless ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 12]: `` Did n't he come with us from the kitchen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 15]: `` No , '' answered Helen , faintly ; `` he 's gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 22]: She sank upon the sofa and drew her hand across her eyes as if to shade them from too sudden light .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 4]: `` Gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 14]: The judge dropped his book and stared across the table at the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 3]: `` Gone !
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 3]: When ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 15]: `` Ten minutes -- five -- half an hour -- I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 6]: Before the storm commenced . ''
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 8]: The old gentleman appeared to be reassured .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 17]: `` Probably he had work to do and wanted to get in before the rain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 7]: But Lige Willetts was turning pale .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 7]: He swallowed several times with difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 7]: `` Which way did he go ?
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 18]: He did n't come around the house ; we were out there till the storm broke . ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 8]: `` He went by the orchard gate .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 12]: When he got to the road he turned that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 6]: She pointed to the west .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 8]: `` He must have been crazy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 4]: exclaimed the judge .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 7]: `` What possessed the fellow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 7]: `` I could n't stop him .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 7]: I did n't know how . ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 19]: She looked at her three companions , slowly and with growing terror , from one face to another .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 34]: Minnie 's eyes were wide and she had unconsciously grasped Lige 's arm ; the young man was looking straight before him ; the judge got up and walked nervously back and forth .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 20]: Helen rose to her feet swiftly and went toward the old man , her hands pressed to her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 14]: she cried out , sharply , `` I had forgotten _ that _ !
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 41]: You do n't think they -- you do n't think -- '' `` I know what I think , '' Lige broke in ; `` I think I 'd ought to be hanged for letting him out of my sight .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 20]: Maybe it 's all right ; maybe he turned and started right back for town -- and got there .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 22]: But I had no business to leave him , and if I can I 'll catch up with him yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 41]: He went to the front door , and , opening it , let in a tornado of wind and flood of water that beat him back ; sheets of rain blew in horizontally , in spite of the porch beyond .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 4]: Briscoe followed him .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 13]: `` Do n't be a fool , Lige , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 11]: `` You hardly expect to go out in that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 15]: Lige shook his head ; it needed them both to get the door closed .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 15]: The young man leaned against it and passed his sleeve across his wet brow .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 11]: `` I had n't ought to have left him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 39]: `` Do n't scare the girls , '' whispered the other ; then in a louder tone : `` All I 'm afraid of is that he 'll get blown to pieces or catch his death of cold .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 9]: That 's all there is to worry about .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 13]: Those scalawags would n't try it again so soon after last night .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 11]: I 'm not bothering about that ; not at all .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 7]: That need n't worry anybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 9]: `` But this morning -- '' `` Pshaw !
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 21]: He 's likely home and dry by this time -- all foolishness ; do n't be an old woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 18]: The two men reentered the room and found Helen clinging to Minnie 's hand on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 7]: She looked up at them quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 24]: `` Do you think -- do you -- what do you -- '' Her voice shook so that she could not go on .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 9]: The judge pinched her cheek and patted it .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 23]: `` I think he 's home and dry , but I think he got wet first ; that 's what I think .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 15]: Never you fear , he 's a good hand at taking care of himself .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 5]: Sit down , Lige .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 9]: You ca n't go for a while . ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 4]: Nor could he .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 31]: It was long before he could venture out ; the storm raged and roared without abatement ; it was Carlow 's worst since ` Fifty-one , the old gentleman said .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 29]: They heard the great limbs crack and break outside , while the thunder boomed and the wind ripped at the eaves till it seemed the roof must go .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 29]: Meanwhile the judge , after some apology , lit his pipe and told long stories of the storms of early days and of odd freaks of the wind .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 35]: He talked on calmly , the picture of repose , and blew rings above his head , but Helen saw that one of his big slippers beat an unceasing little tattoo on the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 31]: She sat with fixed eyes , in silence , holding Minnie 's hand tightly ; and her face was colorless , and grew whiter as the slow hours dragged by .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 44]: Every moment Mr. Willetts became more restless , though assuring the ladies he had no anxiety regarding Mr. Harkless ; it was only his own dereliction of duty that he regretted ; the boys would have the laugh on him , he said .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 35]: But he visibly chafed more and more under the judge 's stories ; and constantly rose to peer out of the window into the wrack and turmoil , or uneasily shifted in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 12]: Once or twice he struck his hands together with muttered ejaculations .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 89]: At last there was a lull in the fury without , and , as soon as it was perceptible , he declared his intention of making his way into town ; he had ought to have went before , he declared , apprehensively ; and then , with immediate amendment , of course he would find the editor at work in the `` Herald '' office ; there was n't the slightest doubt of that ; he agreed with the judge , but he better see about it .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 32]: He would return early in the morning to bid Miss Sherwood good-by ; hoped she 'd come back , some day ; hoped it was n't her last visit to Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 64]: They gave him an umbrella and he plunged out into the night , and as they stood watching him for a moment from the door , the old man calling after him cheery good-nights and laughing messages to Harkless , they could hear his feet slosh into the puddles and see him fight with his umbrella when he got out into the road .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 24]: Helen 's room was over the porch , the windows facing north , looking out upon the pike and across the fields beyond .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 20]: `` Please do n't light the lamp , Minnie , '' she said , when they had gone upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 9]: `` I do n't need a light . ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 12]: Miss Briscoe was flitting about the room , hunting for matches .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 27]: In the darkness she came to her friend , and laid a kind , large hand on Helen 's eyes , and the hand became wet .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 17]: She drew Helen 's head down on her shoulder and sat beside her on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 16]: `` Sweetheart , you must n't fret , '' she soothed , in motherly fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 8]: `` Do n't you worry , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 5]: He 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 8]: It is n't your fault , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 11]: They would n't come on a night like this . ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 24]: But Helen drew away and went to the window , flattening her arm against the pane , her forehead pressed against her arm .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 13]: She had let him go ; she had let him go alone .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 10]: She had forgotten the danger that always beset him .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 15]: She had been so crazy , she had seen nothing , thought of nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 15]: She had let him go into that , and into the storm , alone .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 10]: Who knew better than she how cruel they were ?
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 31]: She had seen the fire leap from the white blossom and heard the ball whistle , the ball they had meant for his heart , that good , great heart .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 23]: She had run to him the night before -- why had she let him go into the unknown and the storm to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 8]: But how could she have stopped him ?
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 13]: How could she have kept him , after what he had said ?
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 9]: She peered into the night through distorting tears .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 69]: The wind had gone down a little , but only a little , and the electrical flashes danced all around the horizon in magnificent display , sometimes far away , sometimes dazingly near , the darkness trebly deep between the intervals when the long sweep of flat lands lay in dazzling clearness , clean-cut in the washed air to the finest detail of stricken field and heaving woodland .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 60]: A staggering flame clove earth and sky ; sheets of light came following it , and a frightful uproar shook the house and rattled the casements , but over the crash of thunder Minnie heard her friend 's loud scream and saw her spring back from the window with both hands , palm outward , pressed to her face .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 11]: She leaped to her and threw her arms about her .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 4]: `` Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 7]: Helen dragged her to the window .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 18]: `` At the next flash -- the fence beyond the meadow -- '' `` What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 6]: What was it like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 5]: The lightning flashed incessantly .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 15]: Helen tried to point ; her hand only jerked from side to side . ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 5]: _ Look _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 14]: `` I see nothing but the lightning , '' Minnie answered , breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 8]: `` Oh , the _ fence _ !
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 10]: The fence -- and in the field ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 4]: _ Helen _ !
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 8]: What was it _ like _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 4]: `` Ah-ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 21]: she panted , `` a long line of white -- horrible white -- '' `` What _ like _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 16]: Minnie turned from the window and caught the other 's wrist in a fluttering clasp .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 5]: `` Minnie , Minnie !
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 11]: Like long white gowns and cowls crossing the fence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 22]: Helen released her wrist , and put both hands on Minnie 's cheeks , forcing her around to face the pane .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 13]: `` You must look -- you must look , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 18]: `` They would n't do it , they would n't -- it _ is n't _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 3]: Minnie cried .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 9]: `` They could n't come in the storm .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 11]: They would n't do it in the pouring rain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 8]: Such things would mind the rain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 19]: She burst into hysterical laughter , and Minnie , almost as unnerved , caught her about the waist .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 7]: `` They would mind the rain .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 6]: They would fear a storm !
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 4]: Yes -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 12]: And I let him go -- I let him go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 23]: Pressing close together , shuddering , clasping each other 's waists , the two girls peered out at the flickering landscape . ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 5]: _ Look _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 43]: Up from the distant fence that bordered the northern side of Jones 's field , a pale , pelted , flapping thing reared itself , poised , and seemed , just as the blackness came again , to drop to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 8]: `` Did you _ see _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 15]: But Minnie had thrown herself into a chair with a laugh of wild relief .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 6]: `` My darling girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 17]: `` Not a line of white things -- just one -- Mr. Jones 's old scarecrow !
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 8]: And we saw it blown down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 7]: `` No , no , no !
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 12]: I saw the others ; they were in the field beyond .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 4]: I saw them !
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 14]: When I looked the first time they were nearly all on the fence .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 9]: This time we saw the last man crossing .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 7]: I let him go alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 7]: Minnie sprang up and enfolded her .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 24]: `` No ; you dear , imagining child , you 're upset and nervous -- that 's all the matter in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 14]: Do n't worry ; do n't , child , it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 11]: Mr. Harkless is home and safe in bed long ago .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 21]: I know that old scarecrow on the fence like a book ; you 're so unstrung you fancied the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 13]: He 's all right ; do n't you bother , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 43]: The big , motherly girl took her companion in her arms and rocked her back and forth soothingly , and petted and reassured her , and then cried a little with her , as a good-hearted girl always will with a friend .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 16]: Then she left her for the night with many a cheering word and tender caress .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 21]: `` Get to sleep , dear , '' she called through the door when she had closed it behind her .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 19]: `` You must , if you have to go in the morning -- it just breaks my heart .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 12]: I do n't know how we 'll bear it without you .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 11]: Father will miss you almost as much as I will .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 2]: Good-night .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 9]: Do n't bother about that old white scarecrow .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 6]: That 's all it was .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 7]: Good-night , dear , good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 12]: `` Good-night , dear , '' answered a plaintive little voice .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 14]: Helen 's hot cheek pressed the pillow and tossed from side to side .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 14]: By and by she turned the pillow over ; it had grown wet .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 16]: The wind blew about the eaves and blew itself out ; she hardly heard it .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 5]: Sleep would not come .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 9]: She got up and laved her burning eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 7]: Then she sat by the window .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 38]: The storm 's strength was spent at last ; the rain grew lighter and lighter , until there was but the sound of running water and the drip , drip on the tin roof of the porch .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 33]: Only the thunder rumbling in the distance marked the storm 's course ; the chariots of the gods rolling further and further away , till they finally ceased to be heard altogether .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 23]: The clouds parted majestically , and then , between great curtains of mist , the day-star was seen shining in the east .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 20]: The night was hushed , and the peace that falls before dawn was upon the wet , flat lands .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 10]: Somewhere in the sodden grass a swamped cricket chirped .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 28]: From an outlying flange of the village a dog 's howl rose mournfully ; was answered by another , far away , and by another and another .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 16]: The sonorous chorus rose above the village , died away , and quiet fell again .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 12]: Helen sat by the window , no comfort touching her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 38]: Tears coursed her cheeks no longer , but her eyes were wide and staring , and her lips parted , for the hush was broken by the far clamor of the court-house bell ringing in the night .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 12]: It rang , and rang , and rang , and rang .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 5]: She could not breathe .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 6]: She threw open the window .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 4]: The bell stopped .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 6]: All was quiet once more .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 6]: The east was growing gray .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 18]: Suddenly out of the stillness there came the sound of a horse galloping over a wet road .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 6]: He was coming like mad .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 6]: Some one for a doctor ?
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 27]: No ; the horse-hoofs grew louder , coming out from the town , coming this way , coming faster and faster , coming _ here _ .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 18]: There was a splashing and trampling in front of the house and a sharp `` Whoa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 17]: In the dim gray of first dawn she made out a man on a foam-flecked horse .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 7]: He drew up at the gate .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 11]: A window to the right of hers went screeching up .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 11]: She heard the judge clear his throat before he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 5]: `` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 10]: That 's you , is n't it , Wiley ?
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 13]: He took a good deal of time and coughed between the sentences .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 13]: His voice was more than ordinarily quiet , and it sounded husky .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 8]: `` What is it , Wiley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 20]: `` Judge , what time did Mr. Harkless leave here last night and which way did he go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 5]: There was a silence .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 8]: The judge turned away from the window .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 8]: Minnie was standing just outside his door .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 16]: `` It must have been about half-past nine , was n't it , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 7]: she called in a shaking voice .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 13]: `` And , you know , Helen thought he went west . ''
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 4]: `` Wiley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 9]: The old man leaned from the sill again .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 6]: answered the man on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 14]: `` Wiley , he left about half-past nine -- just before the storm .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 7]: They think he went west . ''
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 4]: `` Much obliged .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 12]: Willetts is so upset he is n't sure of anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 4]: `` Wiley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 13]: The old man 's voice shook ; Minnie began to cry aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 13]: The horseman wheeled about and turned his animal 's head toward town .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 4]: `` Wiley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 17]: `` Wiley , they have n't -- you do n't think they 've got him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 21]: `` By God , judge , '' said the man on horseback , `` I 'm afraid they have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 3]: CHAPTER X .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 11]: THE COURT-HOUSE BELL The court-house bell ringing in the night !
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 17]: No hesitating stroke of Schofields ' Henry , no uncertain touch , was on the rope .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 19]: A loud , wild , hurried clamor pealing out to wake the country-side , a rapid _ clang !
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 2]: clang !
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 2]: clang !
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 9]: _ that struck clear in to the spine .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 91]: The court-house bell had tolled for the death of Morton , of Garfield , of Hendricks ; had rung joy-peals of peace after the war and after political campaigns ; but it had rung as it was ringing now only three times ; once when Hibbard 's mill burned , once when Webb Landis killed Sep Bardlock and intrenched himself in the lumber-yard and would not be taken till he was shot through and through , and once when the Rouen accommodation was wrecked within twenty yards of the station .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 7]: Why was the bell ringing now ?
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 22]: Men and women , startled into wide wakefulness , groped to windows -- no red mist hung over town or country .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 4]: What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 5]: The bell rang on .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 21]: Its loud alarm beat increasingly into men 's hearts and quickened their throbbing to the rapid measure of its own .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 7]: Vague forms loomed in the gloaming .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 11]: A horse , wildly ridden , splashed through the town .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 8]: There were shouts ; voices called hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 8]: Lamps began to gleam in the windows .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 21]: Half-clad people emerged from their houses , men slapping their braces on their shoulders as they ran out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 7]: Questions were shouted into the dimness .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 8]: Then the news went over the town .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 24]: It was cried from yard to yard , from group to group , from gate to gate , and reached the furthermost confines .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 54]: Runners shouted it as they sped by ; boys panted it , breathless ; women with loosened hair stumbled into darkling chambers and faltered it out to new-wakened sleepers ; pale girls clutching wraps at their throats whispered it across fences ; the sick , tossing on their hard beds , heard it .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 23]: The bell clamored it far and near ; it spread over the country-side ; it flew over the wires to distant cities .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 7]: The White-Caps had got Mr. Harkless !
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 25]: Lige Willetts had lost track of him out near Briscoes ' , it was said , and had come in at midnight seeking him .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 43]: He had found Parker , the `` Herald '' foreman , and Ross Schofield , the typesetter , and Bud Tipworthy , the devil , at work in the printing-room , but no sign of Harkless , there or in the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 31]: Together these had sought for him and had roused others , who had inquired at every house where he might have gone for shelter , and they had heard nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 27]: They had watched for his coming during the slackening of the storm and he had not come , and there was nowhere he could have gone .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 11]: He was missing ; only one thing could have happened .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 33]: They had roused up Warren Smith , the prosecutor , the missing editor 's most intimate friend in Carlow , and Homer , the sheriff , and Jared Wiley , the deputy .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 7]: William Todd had rung the alarm .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 10]: The first thing to do was to find him .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 11]: After that there would be trouble -- if not before .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 10]: It looked as if there would be trouble before .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 46]: The men tramping up to the muddy Square in their shirt-sleeves were bulgy about the right hips ; and when Homer Tibbs joined Lum Landis at the hotel corner , and Landis saw that Homer was carrying a shot-gun , Landis went back for his .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 9]: A hastily sworn posse galloped out Main Street .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 13]: Women and children ran into neighbors ' yards and began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 25]: Day was coming ; and , as the light grew , men swore and savagely kicked at the palings of fences that they passed .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 31]: In the foreglow of dawn they gathered in the Square and listened to Warren Smith , who made a speech from the court-house fence and warned them to go slow .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 64]: They answered him with angry shouts and hootings , but he made his big voice heard , and bade them do nothing rash ; no facts were known , he said ; it was far from certain that harm had been done , and no one knew that the Six-Cross-Roads people had done it -- even if something had happened to Mr. Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 10]: He declared that he spoke in Harkless 's name .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 25]: Nothing could distress _ him _ so much as for them to defy the law , to take it out of the proper hands .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 5]: Justice would be done .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 6]: `` Yes it will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 17]: shouted a man below him , brandishing the butt of a raw-hide whip above his head .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 49]: `` And while you jaw on about it here , he may be tied up like a dog in the woods , shot full of holes by the men you never lifted a finger to hender , because you want their votes when you run for circuit judge .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 9]: What are we doin ' _ here _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 10]: What 's the good of listening to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 55]: There was a yell at this , and those who heard the speaker would probably have started for the Cross-Roads without further parley , had not a rumor sprung up , which passed so rapidly from man to man that within five minutes it was being turbulently discussed in every portion of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 30]: The news came that the two shell-gamblers had wrenched a bar out of a window under cover of the storm , had broken jail , and were at large .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 14]: Their threats of the day before were remembered now , with convincing vividness .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 38]: They had sworn repeatedly to Bardlock and to the sheriff , and in the hearing of others , that they would `` do '' for the man who took their money from them and had them arrested .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 63]: The prosecuting attorney , quickly perceiving the value of this complication in holding back the mob that was already forming , called Homer from the crowd and made him get up on the fence and confess that his prisoners had escaped -- at what time he did not know , probably toward the beginning of the storm , when it was noisiest .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 23]: `` You see , '' cried the attorney , `` there is nothing as yet of which we can accuse the Cross-Roads .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 18]: If our friend has been hurt , it is much more likely that these crooks did it .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 18]: They escaped in time to do it , and we all know they were laying for him .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 9]: You want to be mighty careful , fellow-citizens .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 21]: Homer is already in telegraphic communication with every town around here , and we 'll have those men before night .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 18]: All you 've got to do is to control yourselves a little and go home quietly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 25]: He could see that his words -LRB- except those in reference to returning home -- no one was going home -RRB- made an impression .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 39]: There rose a babble of shouting and argument and swearing that grew continually louder , and the faces the lawyer looked down on were creased with perplexity , and shadowed with an anger that settled darker and darker .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 38]: Mr. Ephraim Watts , in spite of all confusion , clad as carefully as upon the preceding day , deliberately climbed the fence and stood by the lawyer and made a single steady gesture with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 35]: He was listened to at once , as his respect for the law was less notorious than his irreverence for it , and he had been known in Carlow as a customarily reckless man .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 14]: They wanted illegal and desperate advice , and quieted down to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 8]: He spoke in his professionally calm voice .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 29]: `` Gentlemen , it seems to me that Mr. Smith and Mr. Ribshaw '' -LRB- nodding to the man with the rawhide whip -RRB- `` are both right .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 7]: What good are we doing here ?
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 13]: What we want to know is what 's happened to Mr. Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 12]: It looks just now like the shell-men might have done it .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 8]: Let 's find out what they done .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 6]: Scatter and hunt for him .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 18]: ` Soon as anything is known for certain , Hibbard 's mill whistle will blow three times .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 7]: Keep on looking till it does .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 33]: _ Then _ '' he finished , with a barely perceptible scornful smile at the attorney , '' _ then _ we can decide on what had ought to be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 11]: Six-Cross-Roads lay dark and steaming in the sun that morning .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 19]: The forge was silent , the saloon locked up , the roadway deserted , even by the pigs .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 33]: The broken old buggy stood rotting in the mud without a single lean , little old man or woman -- such were the children of the Cross-Roads -- to play about it .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 35]: The fields were empty , and the rag-stuffed windows blank , under the baleful glance of the horsemen who galloped by at intervals , muttering curses , not always confining themselves to muttering them .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 70]: Once , when the deputy sheriff rode through alone , a tattered black hound , more wolf than dog , half-emerged , growling , from beneath one of the tumble-down barns , and was jerked back into the darkness by his tail , with a snarl fiercer than his own , while a gun-barrel shone for a second as it swung for a stroke on the brute 's head .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 12]: The hound did not yelp or whine when the blow fell .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 14]: He shut his eyes twice , and slunk sullenly back to his place .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 43]: The shanties might have received a volley or two from some of the mounted bands , exasperated by futile searching , had not the escape of Homer 's prisoners made the guilt of the Cross-Roads appear doubtful in the minds of many .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 22]: As the morning waned , the advocates of the theory that the gamblers had made away with Harkless grew in number .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 71]: There came a telegram from the Rouen chief of police that he had a clew to their whereabouts ; he thought they had succeeded in reaching Rouen , and it began to be generally believed that they had escaped by the one-o'clock freight , which had stopped to take on some empty cars at a side-track a mile northwest of the town , across the fields from the Briscoe house .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 12]: Toward noon a party went out to examine the railroad embankment .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 36]: Men began to come back into the village for breakfast by twos and threes , though many kept on searching the woods , not feeling the need of food , or caring if they did .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 35]: Every grove and clump of underbrush , every thicket , was ransacked ; the waters of the creek , shallow for the most part , but swollen overnight , were dragged at every pool .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 10]: Nothing was found ; there was not a sign .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 40]: The bar of the hotel was thronged all morning as the returning citizens rapidly made their way thither , and those who had breakfasted and were going out again paused for internal , as well as external , reinforcement .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 19]: The landlord , himself returned from a long hunt , set up his whiskey with a lavish hand .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 23]: `` He was the best man we had , boys , '' said Landis , as he poured the little glasses full .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 16]: `` We 'd ort of sent him to the legislative halls of Washington long ago .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 36]: He 'd of done us honor there ; but we never thought of doin ' anything fer him ; jest set ` round and let him build up the town and give him empty thankyes .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 26]: Drink hearty , gentlemen , '' he finished , gloomily , `` I do n't grudge no liquor to-day -- except to Lige Willetts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 23]: `` He was a good man , '' said young William Todd , whose nose was red , not from the whiskey .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 8]: `` I 've about give up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 10]: Schofields ' Henry drew his sleeve across his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 36]: `` He was the only man in this whole city that did n't jab and nag at me when I done my best , '' he exclaimed , with an increasing break in his utterance .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 33]: `` Many a good word I 've had from him when nobody in town done nothin ' but laugh an ' rile an ' badger me about my -- my bell . ''
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 9]: And Schofields ' Henry began to cry openly .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 15]: `` He was a great hand with the chuldern , '' said one man .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 17]: `` Always have something to say to 'em to make 'em laugh when he went by .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 12]: ` Talk more to them 'n he would to grown folks .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 5]: Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 13]: `` They knowed _ him _ all right , '' added another .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 13]: `` I reckon all of us did , little and big . ''
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 17]: `` It 's goin ' to seem mighty empty around here , '' said Ross Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 20]: `` What 's goin ' to become o ' the ` Herald ' and the party in this district ?
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 11]: Where 's the man to run either of 'em now .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 21]: Like as not , '' he concluded desperately , `` the election 'll go against us in the fall . ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 8]: Dibb Zane choked over his four fingers .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 17]: `` We might 's well bust up this dab-dusted ole town ef he 's gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 18]: `` I do n't know what 's come over that Cynthy Tipworthy , '' said the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 23]: `` She 's waited table on him last two year , and her brother Bud works at the ` Herald ' office .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 32]: She did n't say a word -- only looked and looked and looked -- like a crazy woman ; then her and Bud went off together to hunt in the woods .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 25]: They just tuck hold of each other 's hands like -- '' `` That ai n't nothin ' , '' Homer Tibbs broke in .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 24]: `` You 'd ort to 've saw old Miz Hathaway , that widder woman next door to us , when she heard it .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 28]: He had helped her to git her pension ; and she tuck on worse 'n' anything I ever hear -- lot worse 'n' when Hathaway died . ''
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 37]: `` I reckon there ai n't many crazier than them two Bowlders , father and son , '' said the postmaster , wiping the drops from his beard as he set his glass on the bar .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 41]: `` They rid into town like a couple of wild Indians , the old man beatin ' that gray mare o ' theirn till she was one big welt , and he ai n't natcherly no cruel man , either .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 13]: I reckon Lige Willetts better keep out of Hartley 's way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 17]: `` I keep out of no man 's way , '' cried a voice behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 18]: Turning , they saw Lige standing on the threshold of the door that led to the street .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 36]: In his hand he held the bridle of the horse he had ridden across the sidewalk , and that now stood panting , with lowered head , half through the doorway , beside his master .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 40]: Lige was hatless , splashed with mud from head to foot ; his jaw was set , his teeth ground together ; his eyes burned under red lids , and his hair lay tossed and damp on his brow .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 16]: `` I keep out of no man 's way , '' he repeated , hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 44]: `` I heard you , Mr. Tibbs , but I 've got too much to do , while you loaf and gas and drink over Lum Landis 's bar -- I 've got other business than keeping out of Hartley Bowlder 's way .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 7]: I 'm looking for John Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 37]: He was the best man we had in this ornery hole , and he was too good for us , and so we 've maybe let him get killed , and maybe I 'm to blame .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 19]: But I 'm going to find him , and if he 's hurt -- damn _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 30]: I 'm going to have a hand on the rope that lifts the men that did it , if I have to go to Rouen to put it there !
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 13]: After that I 'll answer for my fault , not before ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 10]: He threw himself on his horse and was gone .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 40]: Soon the room was emptied , as the patrons of the bar returned to the search , and only Mr. Wilkerson and the landlord remained , the bar being the professional office , so to speak , of both .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 36]: Wilkerson had a chair in a corner , where he sat chanting a funeral march in a sepulchral murmur , allowing a parenthetical _ hic _ to punctuate the dirge in place of the drum .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 72]: Whenever a batch of newcomers entered , he rose to drink with them ; and , at such times , after pouring off his liquor with a rich melancholy , shedding tears after every swallow , he would make an exploring tour of the room on his way back to his corner , stopping to look under each chair inquiringly and ejaculate : `` Why , where kin he be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 25]: Then , shaking his head , he would observe sadly : `` Fine young man , he was , too ; fine young man .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 3]: Pore fellow !
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 12]: I reckon we hai n't a-goin ' to git him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 4]: At eleven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 35]: Judge Briscoe dropped wearily from his horse at his own gate , and said to a wan girl who came running down the walk to meet him : `` There is nothing , yet .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 13]: I sent the telegram to your mother -- to Mrs. Sherwood . ''
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 6]: Helen turned away without answering .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 12]: Her face was very white and looked pinched about the mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 29]: She went back to where old Fisbee sat on the porch , his white head held between his two hands ; he was rocking himself to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 12]: She touched him gently , but he did not look up .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 5]: She spoke to him .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 8]: `` There is n't anything -- yet .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 7]: He sent the telegram to mamma .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 15]: I shall stay with you , now , no matter what you say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 58]: She sat beside him and put her head down on his shoulder , and though for a moment he appeared not to notice it , when Minnie came out on the porch , hearing her father at the door , the old scholar had put his arm about the girl and was stroking her fair hair softly .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 41]: Briscoe glanced at them , and raised a warning finger to his daughter , and they went tiptoeing into the house , where the judge dropped heavily upon a sofa with an asthmatic sigh ; he was worn and tired .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 17]: Minnie stood before him with a look of pale inquiry , and he shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 31]: `` No use to tell _ them _ ; but I ca n't see any hope , '' he answered her , biting nervously at the end of a cigar .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 22]: `` I expect you better bring me some coffee in here ; I could n't take another step to save me .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 19]: I 'm too old to tear around the country horseback before breakfast , like I have to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 8]: `` Did you send her telegram ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 12]: Minnie asked , as he drank the coffee she brought him .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 41]: She had interpreted `` coffee '' liberally , and , with the assistance of Mildy Upton -LRB- whose subdued nose was frankly red and who shed tears on the raspberries -RRB- , had prepared an appetizing table at his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' responded the judge , `` and I 'm glad she sent it .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 34]: I talked the other way yesterday , what little I said -- it is n't any of our business -- but I do n't think any too much of those people , somehow .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 14]: She thinks she belongs with Fisbee , and I guess she 's right .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 35]: That young fellow must have got along with her pretty well , and I 'm afraid when she gives up she 'll be pretty bad over it ; but I guess we all will .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 29]: It 's terribly sudden , somehow , though it 's only what everybody half expected would come ; only we thought it would come from over yonder . ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 6]: He nodded toward the west .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 11]: `` But she 's got to stay here with us .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 24]: Boarding at Sol Tibbs 's with that old man wo n't do ; and she 's no girl to live in two rooms .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 13]: You fix it up with her -- you make her stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 29]: `` She must , '' answered his daughter as she knelt beside him and patted his coat and handed him several things to eat at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 26]: `` Mr. Fisbee will help me persuade her , now that she 's bound to stay in spite of him and the Sherwoods , too .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 10]: I think she is perfectly grand to do it .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 40]: I 've always thought she was grand -- ever since she took me under her wing at school when I was terribly ` country ' and frightened ; but she was so sweet and kind she made me forget .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 92]: She was the pet of the school , too , always doing things for the other girls , for everybody ; looking out for people simply heads and heads bigger than herself , and so recklessly generous and so funny about it ; and always thoughtful and -- and -- pleasant -- '' Minnie was speaking sadly , mechanically ; but suddenly she broke off with a quick sob , sprang up and went to the window ; then , turning , cried out : `` I do n't believe it !
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 11]: He knew how to take care of himself too well .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 9]: He 'd have got away from them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 6]: Her father shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 9]: `` Then why has n't he turned up ?
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 17]: He 'd have gone home after the storm if something bad was n't the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 13]: `` But nothing -- nothing _ that _ bad could have happened .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 10]: They have n't found -- any -- anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 12]: `` But why has n't he come back , child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 14]: `` Well , he 's lying hurt somewhere , that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 10]: `` Then why have n't they found him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 7]: `` I do n't care ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 23]: she cried , and choked with the words and tossed her dishevelled hair from her temples ; `` it is n't true .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 10]: Helen wo n't believe it -- why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 20]: It 's only a few hours since he was right here in our yard , talking to us all .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 20]: I wo n't believe it till they 've searched every stick and stone of Six-Cross-Roads and found him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 25]: `` It was n't the Cross-Roads , '' said the old gentleman , pushing the table away and relaxing his limbs on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 12]: `` They probably did n't have anything to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 26]: We thought they had at first , but everybody 's about come to believe it was those two devils that he had arrested yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 6]: `` Not the Cross-Roads ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 10]: echoed Minnie , and she began to tremble violently .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 10]: `` Have n't they been out there yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 4]: `` What use ?
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 15]: They are out of it , and they can thank God they are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 6]: `` They are not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 4]: she cried excitedly .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 5]: `` They did it .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 5]: It was the White-Caps .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 18]: We saw them , Helen and I. '' The judge got upon his feet with an oath .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 10]: He had not sworn for years until that morning .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 6]: `` What 's this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 4]: he said sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 31]: `` I ought to have told you before , but we were so frightened , and -- and you went off in such a rush after Mr. Wiley was here .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 23]: I never dreamed everybody would n't know it was the Cross-Roads ; that they would _ think _ of any one else .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 51]: And I looked for the scarecrow as soon as it was light and it was ` way off from where we saw them , and was n't blown down at all , and Helen saw them in the field besides -- saw all of them -- '' He interrupted her .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 6]: `` What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 11]: Try to tell me about it quietly , child . ''
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 8]: He laid his hand on her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 36]: She told him breathlessly -LRB- while he grew more and more visibly perturbed and uneasy , biting his cigar to pieces and groaning at intervals -RRB- what she and Helen had seen in the storm .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 70]: When she finished he took a few quick turns about the room with his hands thrust deep in his coat pockets , and then , charging her to repeat the story to no one , left the house , and , forgetting his fatigue , rapidly crossed the fields to the point where the bizarre figures of the night had shown themselves to the two girls at the window .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 10]: The soft ground had been trampled by many feet .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 7]: The boot-prints pointed to the northeast .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 25]: He traced them backward to the southwest through the field , and saw where they had come from near the road , going northeast .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 17]: Then , returning , he climbed the fence and followed them northward through the next field .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 23]: From there , the next , beyond the road that was a continuation of Main Street , stretched to the railroad embankment .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 40]: The track , raggedly defined in trampled loam and muddy furrow , bent in a direction which indicated that its terminus might be the switch where the empty cars had stood last night , waiting for the one-o'clock freight .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 48]: Though the fields had been trampled down in many places by the searching parties , he felt sure of the direction taken by the Cross-Roads men , and he perceived that the searchers had mistaken the tracks he followed for those of earlier parties in the hunt .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 32]: On the embankment he saw a number of men , walking west and examining the ground on each side , and a long line of people following them out from town .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 3]: He stopped .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 14]: He held the fate of Six-Cross-Roads in his hand and he knew it .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 33]: He knew that if he spoke , his evidence would damn the Cross-Roads , and that it meant that more than the White-Caps would be hurt , for the Cross-Roads would fight .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 39]: If he had believed that the dissemination of his knowledge could have helped Harkless , he would have called to the men near him at once ; but he had no hope that the young man was alive .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 56]: They would not have dragged him out to their shanties wounded , or as a prisoner ; such a proceeding would have courted detection , and , also , they were not that kind ; they had been `` looking for him '' a long time , and their one idea was to kill him .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 29]: And Harkless , for all his gentleness , was the sort of man , Briscoe believed , who would have to be killed before he could be touched .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 22]: Of one thing the old gentleman was sure ; the editor had not been tied up and whipped while yet alive .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 43]: In spite of his easy manners and geniality , there was a dignity in him that would have made him kill and be killed before the dirty fingers of a Cross-Roads `` White-Cap '' could have been laid upon him in chastisement .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 32]: A great many good Americans of Carlow who knew him well always Mistered him as they would have Mistered only an untitled Morton or Hendricks who might have lived amongst them .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 29]: He was the only man the old darky , Uncle Xenophon , had ever addressed as `` Marse '' since he came to Plattville , thirty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 22]: Briscoe considered it probable that a few people were wearing bandages , in the closed shanties over to the west to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 62]: A thought of the number they had brought against one man ; a picture of the unequal struggle , of the young fellow he had liked so well , unarmed and fighting hopelessly in a trap , and a sense of the cruelty of it , made the hot anger surge up in his breast , and he started on again .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 6]: Then he stopped once more .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 39]: Though long retired from faithful service on the bench , he had been all his life a serious exponent of the law , and what he went to tell meant lawlessness that no one could hope to check .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 29]: He knew the temper of the people ; their long suffering was at an end , and they would go over at last and wipe out the Cross-Roads .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 5]: It depended on him .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 34]: If the mob could be held off over to-day , if men 's minds could cool over night , the law could strike and the innocent and the hotheaded be spared from suffering .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 31]: He would wait ; he would lay his information before the sheriff ; and Horner would go quietly with a strong posse , for he would need a strong one .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 7]: He began to retrace his steps .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 20]: The men on the embankment were walking slowly , bending far over , their eyes fixed on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 17]: Suddenly one of them stood erect and tossed his arms in the air and shouted loudly .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 50]: Other men ran to him , and another far down the track repeated the shout and the gesture to another far in his rear ; this man took it up , and shouted and waved to a fourth man , and so they passed the signal back to town .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 48]: There came , almost immediately three long , loud whistles from a mill near the station , and the embankment grew black with people pouring out from town , while the searchers came running from the fields and woods and underbrush on both sides of the railway .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 17]: Briscoe paused for the last time ; then he began to walk slowly toward the embankment .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 40]: The track lay level and straight , not dimming in the middle distances , the rails converging to points , both northwest and southeast , in the clean-washed air , like examples of perspective in a child 's drawing-book .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 41]: About seventy miles to the west and north lay Rouen ; and , in the same direction , nearly six miles from where the signal was given , the track was crossed by a road leading directly south to Six-Cross-Roads .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 9]: The embankment had been newly ballasted with sand .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 17]: What had been discovered was a broad brown stain on the south slope near the top .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 25]: There were smaller stains above and below ; none beyond it to left or right ; and there were deep boot-prints in the sand .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 11]: Men were examining the place excitedly , talking and gesticulating .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 9]: It was Lige Willetts who had found it .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 20]: His horse was tethered to a fence near by , at the end of a lane through a cornfield .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 17]: Jared Wiley , the deputy , was talking to a group near the stain , explaining .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 28]: `` You see them two must have knowed about the one-o'clock freight , and that it was to stop here to take on the empty lumber cars .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 13]: I do n't know how they knowed it , but they did .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 23]: It was this way : when they dropped from the window , they beat through the storm , straight for this side-track .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 13]: At the same time Mr. Harkless leaves Briscoes ' goin ' west .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 5]: It begins to rain .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 62]: He cuts across to the railroad to have a sure footing , and strikin ' for the deepo for shelter -- near place as any except Briscoes ' where he 'd said good-night already and prob ` ly do n't wish to go back , ` fear of givin ' trouble or keepin ' 'em up -- anybody can understand that .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 31]: He comes along , and gets to where we are precisely at the time _ they _ do , them comin ' from town , him strikin ' for it .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 7]: They run right into each other .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 5]: That 's what happened .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 20]: They re - _ cog _ - nized him and raised up on him and let him have it .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 46]: What they done it with , I do n't know ; we took everything in that line off of 'em ; prob ` ly used railroad iron ; and what they done with him afterwards we do n't know ; but we will by night .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 16]: They 'll sweat it out of 'em up at Rouen when they get 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 17]: `` I reckon maybe some of us might help , '' remarked Mr. Watts , reflectively .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 7]: Jim Bardlock swore a violent oath .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 7]: `` That 's the talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 75]: `` Ef I ai n't the first man of this crowd to set my foot in Roowun , an ' first to beat in that jail door , an ' take 'em out an ' hang 'em by the neck till they 're dead , dead , dead , I 'm not Town Marshal of Plattville , County of Carlow , State of Indiana , and the Lord have mercy on our souls ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 21]: Tom Martin looked at the brown stain and quickly turned away ; then he went back slowly to the village .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 8]: On the way he passed Warren Smith .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 6]: `` Is it so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 4]: asked the lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 7]: Martin answered with a dry throat .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 15]: He looked out dimly over the sunlit fields , and swallowed once or twice .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 7]: `` Yes , it 's so .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 9]: There 's a good deal of it there .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 9]: Little more than a boy he was . ''
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 13]: The old fellow passed his seamy hand over his eyes without concealment .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 62]: `` Peter ai n't very bright , sometimes , it seems to me , '' he added , brokenly ; `` overlook Bodeffer and Fisbee and me and all of us old husks , and -- and -- '' he gulped suddenly , then finished -- `` and act the fool and take a boy that 's the best we had .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 19]: I wish the Almighty would take Peter off the gate ; he ai n't fit fer it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 18]: When the attorney reached the spot where the crowd was thickest , way was made for him .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 38]: The old colored man , Xenophon , approached at the same time , leaning on a hickory stick and bent very far over , one hand resting on his hip as if to ease a rusty joint .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 42]: The negro 's age was an incentive to fable ; from his appearance he might have known the prophets , and he wore that hoary look of unearthly wisdom many decades of superstitious experience sometimes give to members of his race .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 31]: His face , so tortured with wrinkles that it might have been made of innumerable black threads woven together , was a living mask of the mystery of his blood .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 17]: Harkless had once said that Uncle Xenophon had visited heaven before Swedenborg and hell before Dante .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 47]: To-day , as he slowly limped over the ties , his eyes were bright and dry under the solemn lids , and , though his heavy nostrils were unusually distended in the effort for regular breathing , the deeply puckered lips beneath them were set firmly .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 10]: He stopped and looked at the faces before him .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 25]: When he spoke his voice was gentle , and though the tremulousness of age harped on the vocal strings , it was rigidly controlled .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 36]: `` Kin some kine gelmun , '' he asked , `` please t ` be so good ez t ' show de ole main whuh de W'ite - Caips is done shoot Marse Hawkliss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 18]: `` Here was where it happened , Uncle Zen , '' answered Wiley , leaning him forward .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 7]: `` Here is the stain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 17]: Xenophon bent over the spot on the sand , making little odd noises in his throat .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 8]: Then he painfully resumed his former position .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 17]: `` Dass his blood , '' he said , in the same gentle , quavering tone .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 20]: `` Dass my bes ' frien ' whut lay on de groun ' whuh yo staind , gelmun . ''
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 10]: There was a pause , and no one spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 20]: `` Dass whuh day laid ` im an ' dass whuh he lie , '' the old negro continued .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 9]: `` Dey shot ` im in de fiels .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 19]: Dey ain ' shot ` im hear-yondeh dey drugged ` im , but dis whuh he lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 40]: He bent over again , then knelt , groaningly , and placed his hand on the stain , one would have said , as a man might place his hand over a heart to see if it still beat .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 10]: He was motionless , with the air of hearkening .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 10]: `` Marse , honey , is you gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 15]: He raised his voice as if calling , `` Is you gone , suh ?
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 4]: -- Marse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 51]: He looked up at the circle about him , and , still kneeling , not taking his hand from the sand , seeming to wait for a sign , to listen for a voice , he said : `` Whafo ' you gelmun think de good Lawd summon Marse Hawkliss ?
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 8]: Kaze he de mos ' fittes ' ?
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 25]: You know dat man he ketch me in de cole night , wintuh ` to ' lais ' , stealin ' ` is wood .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 11]: You know whut he done t ` de ole thief ?
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 29]: Tek an ' bull ' up big fiah een ole Zen ' shainty ; say , ` He ' p yo ` se ' f an ' welcome .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 13]: Reckon you hongry , too , ain ' you , Xenophon ? '
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 6]: Tek an ' feed me .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 12]: Tek an ' tek keer o ' me ev ' since .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 28]: Ah pump de baith full in de mawin ' ; mek ` is bed ; pull de weeds out 'n of de front walk -- dass all .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 5]: He tek me in .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 45]: When Ah aisk ` im ain ' he fraid keep ole thief he say , jesso : ` Dass all my fault , Xenophon ; ought look you up long ` go ; ought know long ` go you be cole dese baid nights .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 29]: Reckon Ahm de thievenest one us two , Xenophon , keepin ' all dis wood stock ' up when you got none , ' he say , jesso .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 12]: Tek me in ; say he _ lahk _ a thief .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 8]: Pay me sala ` y. Feed me .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 13]: Dass de main whut de Caips gone shot lais ' night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 26]: He raised his head sharply , and the mystery in his gloomy eyes intensified as they opened wide and stared at the sky , unseeingly .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 8]: `` Ise bawn wid a cawl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 5]: he exclaimed , loudly .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 10]: His twisted frame was braced to an extreme tension .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 7]: `` Ise bawn wid a cawl !
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 5]: De blood anssuh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 25]: `` It was n't the Cross-Roads , Uncle Xenophon , '' said Warren Smith , laying his hand on the old man 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 6]: Xenophon rose to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 50]: He stretched a long , bony arm straight to the west , where the Cross-Roads lay ; stood rigid and silent , like a seer ; then spoke : `` De men whut shot Marse Hawkliss lies yondeh , hidin ' f ` um de light o ' day .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 24]: An ' _ him _ '' -- he swerved his whole rigid body till the arm pointed northwest -- `` he lies yondeh .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 7]: You wo n't find him heah .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 16]: Dey fought ` im een de fiel 's an ' dey druggen ` im heah .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 8]: Dis whim dey lay ` im down .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 7]: Ise bawn wid a cawl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 15]: There were exclamations from the listeners , for Xenophon spoke as one having authority .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 13]: Suddenly he turned and pointed his outstretched hand full at Judge Briscoe .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 24]: `` An ' dass de main , '' he cried , `` dass de main kin tell you Ah speak de trufe . ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 38]: Before he was answered , Eph Watts looked at Briscoe keenly and then turned to Lige Willetts and whispered : `` Get on your horse , ride in , and ring the court-house bell like the devil .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 6]: Do as I say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 8]: Tears stood in the judge 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 11]: `` It is so , '' he said , solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 6]: `` He speaks the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 16]: I did n't mean to tell it to-day , but somehow -- '' He paused .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 5]: `` The hounds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 5]: `` They deserve it !
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 30]: My daughter saw them crossing the fields in the night -- saw them climb the fence , hoods , gowns , and all , a big crowd of them .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 15]: She and the lady who is visiting us saw them , saw them plainly .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 24]: The lady saw them several times , clear as day , by the flashes of lightning -- the scoundrels were coming this way .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 10]: They must have been dragging him with them then .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 13]: He could n't have had a show for his life amongst them .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 14]: Do what you like -- maybe they 've got him at the Cross-Roads .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 17]: If there 's a chance of it -- dead or alive -- bring him back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 15]: A voice rang out above the clamor that followed the judge 's speech . ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 6]: ` Bring him back ! '
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 10]: God could , maybe , but He wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 6]: Who 's travelling my way ?
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 5]: I go west ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 18]: Hartley Bowlder had ridden his sorrel up the embankment , and the horse stood between the rails .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 40]: There was an angry roar from the crowd ; the prosecutor pleaded and threatened unheeded ; and as for the deputy sheriff , he declared his intention of taking with him all who wished to go as his posse .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 11]: Eph Watts succeeded in making himself heard above the tumult .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 5]: `` The Square ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 6]: `` Start from the Square .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 10]: We want everybody , and we 'll need them .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 14]: We want every one in Carlow to be implicated in this posse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 6]: `` They will be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 4]: shouted a farmer .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 9]: `` Do n't you worry about that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 15]: `` We want to get into some sort of shape , '' cried Eph .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 6]: `` Shape , hell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 4]: said Hartley Bowlder .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 17]: There was a hiss and clang and rattle behind him , and a steam whistle shrieked .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 24]: The crowd divided , and Hartley 's sorrel jumped just in time as the westbound accommodation rushed through on its way to Rouen .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 54]: From the rear platform leaned the sheriff , Horner , waving his hands frantically as he flew by , but no one understood -- or cared -- what he said , or , in the general excitement , even wondered why he was leaving the scene of his duty at such a time .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 42]: When the train had dwindled to a dot and disappeared , and the noise of its rush grew faint , the court-house bell was heard ringing , and the mob was piling pell-mell into the village to form on the Square .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 8]: The judge stood alone on the embankment .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 17]: `` That settles it , '' he said aloud , gloomily , watching the last figures .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 17]: He took off his hat and pushed back the thick , white hair from his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 7]: `` Nothing to do but wait .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 8]: Might as well go home for that .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 4]: Blast it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 5]: he exclaimed , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 9]: `` I do n't want to go there .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 9]: It 's too hard on the little girl .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 17]: If she had n't come till next week she 'd never have known John Harkless . ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 20]: JOHN BROWN 'S BODY All morning horsemen had been galloping through Six-Cross-Roads , sometimes singly , oftener in company .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 36]: At one-o'clock the last posse passed through on its return to the county-seat , and after that there was a long , complete silence , while the miry corners were undisturbed by a single hoof-beat .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 27]: No unkempt colt nickered from his musty stall ; the sparse young corn that was used to rasp and chuckle greenly stood rigid in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 44]: Up the Plattville pike despairingly cackled one old hen , with her wabbling sailor run , smit with a superstitious horror of nothing , in the stillness ; she hid herself in the shadow underneath a rickety barn , and her shrieking ceased .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 11]: Only on the Wimby farm were there signs of life .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 38]: The old lady who had sent Harkless roses sat by the window all morning and wiped her eyes , watching the horsemen ride by ; sometimes they would hail her and tell her there was nothing yet .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 78]: About two-o'clock , her husband rattled up in a buckboard , and got out the late , and more authentic , Mr. Wimby 's shot-gun , which he carefully cleaned and oiled , in spite of its hammerless and quite useless condition , sitting , meanwhile , by the window opposite his wife , and often looking up from his work to shake his weak fist at his neighbors ' domiciles and creak decrepit curses and denunciations .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 6]: But the Cross-Roads was ready .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 7]: It knew what was coming now .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 10]: Frightened , desperate , sullen , it was ready .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 23]: The afternoon wore on , and lengthening shadows fell upon a peaceful -- one would have said , a sleeping -- country .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 82]: The sun-dried pike , already dusty , stretched its serene length between green borders flecked with purple and yellow and white weedflowers ; and the tree shadows were not shade , but warm blue and lavender glows in the general pervasion of still , bright light , the sky curving its deep , unburnished , penetrable blue over all , with no single drift of fleece upon it to be reflected in the creek that wound along past willow and sycamore .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 14]: A woodpecker 's telegraphy broke the quiet like a volley of pistol shots .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 15]: But far eastward on the pike there slowly developed a soft , white haze .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 6]: It grew denser and larger .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 5]: Gradually it rolled nearer .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 19]: Dimly behind it could be discerned a darker , moving nucleus that extended far back upon the road .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 21]: A heavy tremor began to stir the air -- faint manifold sounds , a waxing , increasing , multitudinous rumor .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 15]: The pike ascended a long , slight slope leading west up to the Cross-Roads .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 25]: From a thicket of iron-weed at the foot of this slope was thrust the hard , lean visage of an undersized girl of fourteen .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 11]: Her fierce eyes examined the approaching cloud of dust intently .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 14]: A redness rose under the burnt yellow skin and colored the wizened cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 4]: They were coming .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 44]: She stepped quickly out of the tangle , and darted up the road , running with the speed of a fleet little terrier , not opening her lips , not calling out , but holding her two thin hands high above her head .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 4]: That was all .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 15]: But Birnam wood was come to Dunsinane at last , and the messenger sped .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 38]: Out of the weeds in the corners of the snake fence , in the upper part of the rise , silently lifted the heads of men whose sallowness became a sickish white as the child flew by .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 6]: The mob was carefully organized .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 18]: They had taken their time and had prepared everything deliberately , knowing that nothing could stop them .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 26]: No one had any thought of concealment ; it was all as open as the light of day , all done in the broad sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 26]: Nothing had been determined as to what was to be done at the Cross-Roads more definite than that the place was to be wiped out .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 13]: That was comprehensive enough ; the details were quite certain to occur .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 12]: They were all on foot , marching in fairly regular ranks .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 39]: In front walked Mr. Watts , the man Harkless had abhorred in a public spirit and befriended in private -- to-day he was a hero and a leader , marching to avenge his professional oppressor and personal brother .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 41]: Cool , unruffled , and , to outward vision , unarmed , marching the miles in his brown frock coat and generous linen , his carefully creased trousers neatly turned up out of the dust , he led the way .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 32]: On one side of him were the two Bowlders , on the other was Lige Willetts , Mr. Watts preserving peace between the two young men with perfect tact and sang-froid .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 57]: They kept good order and a similitude of quiet for so many , except far to the rear , where old Wilkerson was bringing up the tail of the procession , dragging a wretched yellow dog by a slip-noose fastened around the poor cur 's protesting neck , the knot carefully arranged under his right ear .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 24]: In spite of every command and protest , Wilkerson had marched the whole way uproariously singing , `` John Brown 's Body . ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 30]: The sun was in the west when they came in sight of the Cross-Roads , and the cabins on the low slope stood out angularly against the radiance beyond .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 25]: As they beheld the hated settlement , the heretofore orderly ranks showed a disposition to depart from the steady advance and rush the shanties .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 30]: Willetts , the Bowlders , Parker , Ross , Schofield , and fifty others did , in fact , break away and set a sharp pace up the slope .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 7]: Watts tried to call them back .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 11]: `` What 's the use your gettin ' killed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 36]: answered Lige , who , like the others , was increasing his speed when old `` Wimby '' rose up suddenly from the roadside ahead of them , and motioned them frantically to go back .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 19]: `` They 're laid out along the fence , waitin ' fer ye , '' he warned them .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 6]: `` Git out the road .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 5]: Come by the fields .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 9]: Per the Lord 's sake , spread ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 17]: Then , as suddenly as he had appeared , he dropped down into the weeds again .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 20]: Lige and those with him paused , and the whole body came to a halt while the leaders consulted .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 14]: There was a sound of metallic clicking and a thin rattle of steel .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 117]: From far to the rear came the voice of old Wilkerson : `` John Brown 's body lies a-mouldering in the ground , John Brown 's body lies a-mouldering in the ground -- '' A few near him , as they stood waiting , began to take up the burden of the song , singing in slow time like a dirge ; then those further away took it up ; it spread , reached the leaders ; they , too , began to sing , taking off their hats as they joined in ; and soon the whole concourse , solemn , earnest , and uncovered , was singing -- a thunderous requiem for John Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 60]: The sun was swinging lower and the edges of the world were embroidered with gold while that deep volume of sound shook the air , the song of a stern , savage , just cause -- sung , perhaps , as some of the ancestors of these men sang with Hampden before the bristling walls of a hostile city .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 8]: It had iron and steel in it .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 27]: The men lying on their guns in the ambuscade along the fence heard the dirge rise and grow to its mighty fulness , and they shivered .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 25]: One of them , posted nearest the advance , had his rifle carefully levelled at Lige Willetts , a fair target in the road .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 34]: When he heard the singing , he turned to the man next behind him and laughed harshly : `` I reckon we 'll see a big jamboree in hell to-night , huh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 27]: The huge murmur of the chorus expanded , and gathered in rhythmic strength , and swelled to power , and rolled and thundered across the plain .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 37]: `` John Brown 's body lies a-mouldering in the ground , John Brown 's body lies a-mouldering in the ground , John Brown 's body lies a-mouldering in the ground , His soul goes marching on !
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 2]: Glory !
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 2]: Glory !
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 2]: Hallelujah !
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 2]: Glory !
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 2]: Glory !
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 2]: Hallelujah !
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 2]: Glory !
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 2]: Glory !
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 2]: Hallelujah !
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 7]: His soul goes marching on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 38]: A gun spat from the higher ground , and Willetts dropped where he stood , but was up again in a second , with a red line across his forehead where the ball had grazed his temple .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 31]: Then the mob spread out like a fan , hundreds of men climbing the fence and beginning the advance through the fields , dosing on the ambuscade from both sides .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 58]: Mr. Watts , wading through the high grass in the field north of the road , perceived the barrel of a gun shining from a bush some distance in front of him , and , although in the same second no weapon was seen in his hand , discharged a revolver at the bush behind the gun .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 45]: Instantly ten or twelve men leaped from their hiding-places along the fences of both fields , and , firing hurriedly and harmlessly into the scattered ranks of the oncoming mob , broke for the shelter of the houses , where their fellows were posted .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 29]: Taken on the flanks and from the rear , there was but one thing for them to do to keep from being hemmed in and shot or captured .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 8]: -LRB- They excessively preferred being shot . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 28]: With a wild , high , joyous yell , sounding like the bay of young hounds breaking into view of their quarry , the Plattville men followed .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 39]: The most eastward of the debilitated edifices of Six-Cross-Roads was the saloon , which bore the painted legends : on the west wall , `` Last Chance '' ; on the east wall , `` First Chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 48]: Next to this , and separated by two or three acres of weedy vacancy from the corners where the population centred thickest , stood-if one may so predicate of a building which leaned in seven directions-the house of Mr. Robert Skillett , the proprietor of the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 14]: Both buildings were shut up as tight as their state of repair permitted .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 51]: As they were furthest to the east , they formed the nearest shelter , and to them the Cross-Roaders bent their flight , though they stopped not here , but disappeared behind Skillett 's shanty , putting it between them and their pursuers , whose guns were beginning to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 32]: The fugitives had a good start , and , being the picked runners of the Cross-Roads , they crossed the open , weedy acres in safety and made for their homes .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 22]: Every house had become a fort , and the defenders would have to be fought and torn out one by one .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 22]: As the guns sounded , a woman in a shanty near the forge began to scream , and kept on screaming .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 10]: On came the farmers and the men of Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 40]: They took the saloon at a run ; battered down the crazy doors with a fence-rail , and swarmed inside like busy insects , making the place hum like a hive , but with the hotter industries of destruction .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 45]: It was empty of life as a tomb , but they beat and tore and battered and broke and hammered and shattered like madmen ; they reduced the tawdry interior to a mere chaos , and came pouring forth laden with trophies of ruin .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 24]: And then there was a charry smell in the air , and a slender feather of smoke floated up from a second-story window .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 48]: At the same time Watts led an assault on the adjoining house -- an assault which came to a sudden pause , for , from cracks in the front wall , a squirrel-rifle and a shot-gun snapped and banged , and the crowd fell back in disorder .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 29]: Homer Tibbs had a hat blown away , full of buck-shot holes , while Mr. Watts solicitously examined a small aperture in the skirts of his brown coat .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 24]: The house commanded the road , and the rush of the mob into the village was checked , but only for the instant .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 28]: A rickety woodshed , which formed a portion of the Skillett mansion , closely joined the `` Last Chance '' side of the family place of business .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 56]: Scarcely had the guns of the defenders sounded , when , with a loud shout , Lige Willetts leaped from an upper window on that side of the burning saloon and landed on the woodshed , and , immediately climbing the roof of the house itself , applied a fiery brand to the time-worn clapboards .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 38]: Ross Schofield dropped on the shed , close behind him , his arm lovingly enfolding a gallon jug of whiskey , which he emptied -LRB- not without evident regret -RRB- upon the clapboards as Lige fired them .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 34]: Flames burst forth almost instantly , and the smoke , uniting with that now rolling out of every window of the saloon , went up to heaven in a cumbrous , gray column .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 42]: As the flames began to spread , there was a rapid fusillade from the rear of the house , and a hundred men and more , who had kept on through the fields to the north , assailed it from behind .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 25]: Their shots passed clear through the flimsy partitions , and there was a horrid screeching , like a beast 's howls , from within .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 30]: The front door was thrown open , and a lean , fierce-eyed girl , with a case-knife in her hand , ran out in the face of the mob .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 31]: At sound of the shots in the rear they had begun to advance on the house a second time , and Hartley Bowlder was the nearest man to the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 21]: With awful words , and shrieking inconceivably , she made straight at Hartley , and attacked him with the knife .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 42]: She struck at him again and again , and , in her anguish of hate and fear , was so extraordinary a spectacle that she gained for her companions the four or five seconds they needed to escape from the house .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 40]: As she hurled herself alone at the oncoming torrent , they sped from the door unnoticed , sprang over the fence , and reached the open lots to the west before they were seen by Willetts from the roof .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 9]: `` Do n't let 'em fool you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 7]: `` Look to I your left !
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 4]: There they go !
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 8]: Do n't let 'em get away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 8]: The Cross-Readers were running across the field .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 30]: They were Bob Skillett and his younger brother , and Mr. Skillett was badly damaged : he seemed to be holding his jaw on his face with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 9]: The girl turned , and sped after them .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 24]: She was over the fence almost as soon as they were , and the three ran in single file , the girl last .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 47]: She was either magnificently sacrificial and fearless , or she cunningly calculated that the regulators would take no chances of killing a woman-child , for she kept between their guns and her two companions , trying to cover and shield the latter with her frail body .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 9]: `` Shoot , Lige , '' called Watts .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 12]: `` If we fire from here we 'll hit the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 3]: Shoot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 28]: Willetts and Ross Schofield were still standing on the roof , at the edge , out of the smoke , and both fired at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 40]: The fugitives did not turn ; they kept on running , and they had nearly reached the other side of the field , when suddenly , without any premonitory gesture , the elder Skillett dropped flat on his face .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 41]: The Cross-Roaders stood by each other that day , for four or five men ran out of the nearest shanty into the open , lifted the prostrate figure from the ground , and began to carry it back with them .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 15]: But Mr. Skillett was alive ; his curses were heard above all other sounds .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 13]: Lige and Schofield fired again , and one of the rescuers staggered .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 46]: Nevertheless , as the two men slid down from the roof , the burdened Cross-Readers were seen to break into a run ; and at that , with another yell , fiercer , wilder , more joyous than the first , the Plattville men followed .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 31]: The yell rang loudly in the ears of old Wilkerson , who had remained back in the road , and at the same instant he heard another shout behind him .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 86]: Mr. Wilkerson had not shared in the attack , but , greatly preoccupied with his own histrionic affairs , was proceeding up the pike alone -- except for the unhappy yellow mongrel , still dragged along by the slip-noose -- and alternating , as was his natural wont , from one fence to the other ; crouching behind every bush to fire an imaginary rifle at his dog , and then springing out , with triumphant bellowings , to fall prone upon the terrified animal .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 60]: It was after one of these victories that a shout of warning was raised behind him , and Mr. Wilkerson , by grace of the god Bacchus , rolling out of the way in time to save his life , saw a horse dash by him -- a big , black horse whose polished flanks were dripping with lather .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 6]: Warren Smith was the rider .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 13]: He was waving a slip of yellow paper high in the air .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 23]: He rode up the slope , and drew rein beyond the burning buildings , just ahead of those foremost in the pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 25]: He threw his horse across the road to oppose their progress , rose in his stirrups , and waved the paper over his head .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 4]: `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 9]: he roared , `` Give me one minute .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 3]: Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 28]: He had a grand voice ; and he was known in many parts of the State for the great bass roar with which he startled his juries .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 37]: To be heard at a distance most men lift the pitch of their voices ; Smith lowered his an octave or two , and the result was like an earthquake playing an organ in a catacomb .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 4]: `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 3]: he thundered .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 4]: `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 18]: In answer , one of the flying Cross-Roaders turned and sent a bullet whistling close to him .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 25]: The lawyer paused long enough to bow deeply in satirical response ; then , flourishing the paper , he roared again : `` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 3]: A mistake !
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 4]: I have news !
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 5]: Stop , I say !
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 6]: Homer has got them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 75]: To make himself heard over that tempestuous advance was a feat ; for him , moreover , whose counsels had so lately been derided , to interest the pursuers at such a moment enough to make them listen -- to find the word -- was a greater ; and by the word , and by gestures at once vehemently imperious and imploring , to stop them was still greater ; but he did it .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 17]: He had come at just the moment before the moment that would have been too late .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 5]: They all heard him .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 32]: They all knew , too , he was not trying to save the Cross-Roads as a matter of duty , because he had given that up before the mob left Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 29]: Indeed , it was a question if , at the last , he had not tacitly approved ; and no one feared indictments for the day 's work .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 14]: It would do no harm to listen to what he had to say .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 14]: The work could wait ; it would `` keep '' for five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 18]: They began to gather around him , excited , flushed , perspiring , and smelling of smoke .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 26]: Hartley Bowlder , won by Lige 's desperation and intrepidity , was helping the latter tie up his head ; no one else was hurt .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 4]: they clamored impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 5]: `` Speak quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 34]: There was another harmless shot from a fugitive , and then the Cross-Roaders , divining that the diversion was in their favor , secured themselves in their decrepit fastnesses and held their fire .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 10]: Meanwhile , the flames crackled cheerfully in Plattville ears .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 36]: No matter what the prosecutor had to say , at least the Skillett saloon and homestead were gone , and Bob Skillett and one other would be sick enough to be good for a while .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 29]: `` Listen , '' cried Warren Smith , and , rising in his stirrups again , read the missive in his hand , a Western Union telegraph form .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 11]: `` Warren Smith , Plattville , '' was the direction .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 5]: `` Found both shell-men .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 10]: Police familiar with both , and both wanted here .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 31]: One arrested at noon in a second-hand clothes store , wearing Harkless 's hat , also trying dispose torn full-dress coat known to have been worn by Harkless last night .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 6]: Stains on lining believed blood .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 23]: Second man found later at freight-yards in empty lumber car left Plattville 1 P.M. , badly hurt , shot , and bruised .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 6]: Supposed Harkless made hard fight .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 7]: Hurt man taken to hospital unconscious .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 3]: Will die .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 10]: Hope able question him first and discover whereabouts body .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 7]: Other man refuses talk so far .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 5]: Check any movement Cross-Roads .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 6]: This clears Skillett , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 6]: Come over on 9.15 . ''
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 17]: The telegram was signed by Homer and by Barrett , the superintendent of police at Rouen .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 26]: `` It 's all a mistake , boys , '' the lawyer said , as he handed the paper to Watts and Parker for inspection .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 19]: `` The ladies at the judge 's were mistaken , that 's all , and this proves it .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 42]: It 's easy enough to understand : they were frightened by the storm , and , watching a fence a quarter-mile away by flashes of lightning , any one would have been confused , and imagined all the horrors on earth .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 54]: I do n't deny but what I believed it for a while , and I do n't deny but the Cross-Roads is pretty tough , but you 've done a good deal here already , to-day , and we 're saved in time from a mistake that would have turned out mighty bad .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 4]: This settles it .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 33]: Homer got a wire from Rouen to come over there , soon as they got track of the first man ; that was when we saw him on the Rouen accommodation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 56]: A slightly cracked voice , yet a huskily tuneful one , was lifted quaveringly on the air from the roadside , where an old man and a yellow dog sat in the dust together , the latter reprieved at the last moment , his surprised head rakishly garnished with a hasty wreath of dog-fennel daisies .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 18]: `` John Brown 's body lies a-mouldering in the ground , While we go marching on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 113]: Three-quarters of an hour later , the inhabitants of the Cross-Roads , saved , they knew not how ; guilty ; knowing nothing of the fantastic pendulum of opinion , which , swung by the events of the day , had marked the fatal moment of guilt , now on others , now on them , who deserved it -- these natives and refugees , conscious of atrocity , dumfounded by a miracle , thinking the world gone mad , hovered together in a dark , ragged mass at the crossing corners , while the skeleton of the rotting buggy in the slough rose behind them against the face of the west .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 10]: They peered with stupified eyes through the smoky twilight .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 42]: From afar , faintly through the gloaming , came mournfully to their ears the many-voiced refrain -- fainter , fainter : `` John Brown 's body lies a-mouldering in the ground , John Brown 's body lies a-mouldering in the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 16]: John Brown 's body lies -- mould -- ... we go march ... on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 19]: JERRY THE TELLER At midnight a small brougham stopped at the gates of the city hospital in Rouen .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 31]: A short distance ahead , the lamps of a cab , drawn up at the curbing , made two dull orange sparks under the electric light swinging over the street .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 37]: A cigarette described a brief parabola as it was tossed from the brougham , and a short young man jumped out and entered the gates , then paused and spoke to the driver of the cab .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 9]: `` Did you bring Mr. Barrett here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 18]: `` Yes , sir , '' answered the driver ; `` him and two other gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 26]: Lighting another cigarette , from which he drew but two inspirations before he threw it away , the young man proceeded quickly up the walk .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 48]: As he ascended the short flight of steps which led to the main doors , he panted a little , in a way which suggested that -LRB- although his white waistcoat outlined an ellipse still respectable -RRB- a crescendo of portliness was playing diminuendo with his youth .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 13]: And , though his walk was brisk , it was not lively .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 39]: The expression of his very red face indicated that his briskness was spurred by anxiety , and a fattish groan he emitted on the top step added the impression that his comfortable body protested against the mental spur .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 87]: In the hall he removed his narrow-brimmed straw hat and presented a rotund and amiable head , from the top of which his auburn hair seemed to retire with a sense of defeat ; it fell back , however , not in confusion , but in perfect order , and the sparse pink mist left upon his crown gave , by a supreme effort , an effect of arrangement , so that an imaginative observer would have declared that there was a part down the middle .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 86]: The gentleman 's plump face bore a grave and troubled expression , and gravity and trouble were patent in all the lines of his figure and in every gesture ; in the way he turned his head ; in the uneasy shifting of his hat from one hand to the other and in his fanning himself with it in a nervous fashion ; and in his small , blue eyes , which did not twinkle behind his rimless glasses and looked unused to not twinkling .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 36]: His gravity clothed him like an ill-fitting coat ; or , possibly , he might have reminded the imaginative observer , just now conjured up , of a music-box set to turning its cylinder backwards .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 19]: He spoke to an attendant , and was directed to an office , which he entered without delay .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 38]: There were five men in the room , three of them engaged in conversation near the door ; another , a young surgeon , was writing at a desk ; the fifth drowsily nodding on a sofa .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 7]: The newcomer bowed as he entered .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 5]: `` Mr. Barrett ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 4]: he said inquiringly .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 10]: One of the men near the door turned about .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 26]: `` Yes , sir , '' he answered , with a stem disfavor of the applicant ; a disfavor possibly a perquisite of his office .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 6]: `` What 's wanted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 13]: `` I think I have met you , '' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 7]: `` My name is Meredith . ''
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 48]: Mr. Barrett probably did not locate the meeting , but the name proved an open sesame to his geniality , for he melted at once , and saying : `` Of course , of course , Mr. Meredith ; did you want a talk with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 55]: clasped the young man 's hand confidentially in his , and , with an appearance of assuring him that whatever the atrocity which had occurred in the Meredith household it should be discreetly handled and hushed up , indicated a disposition to conduct him toward a more appropriate apartment for the rehearsal of scandal .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 17]: The young man accepted the hand-clasp with some resignation , but rejected the suggestion of privacy .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 16]: `` A telegram from Plattville reached me half an hour ago , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 19]: `` I should have had it sooner , but I have been in the country all day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 19]: The two men who had been talking with the superintendent turned quickly , and stared at the speaker .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 60]: He went on : `` Mr. Harkless was an old -- and -- '' He broke off , with a sudden , sharp choking , and for a moment was unable to control an emotion that seemed , for some reason , as surprising and unbefitting , in a person of his rubicund presence , as was his gravity .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 11]: An astonished tear glittered in the corner of his eye .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 18]: The grief of the gayer sorts of stout people appears , sometimes , to dumfound even themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 13]: The young man took off his glasses and wiped them slowly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 11]: -- An old and very dear friend of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 9]: He replaced the glasses insecurely upon his nose .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 16]: `` I telephoned to your headquarters , and they said you had come here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 18]: `` Yes , sir ; yes , sir , '' the superintendent of police responded , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 14]: `` These two gentlemen are from Plattville ; Mr. Smith just got in .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 22]: They mighty near had big trouble down there to-day , but I guess we 'll settle things for 'em up here .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 19]: Let me make you acquainted with my friend , Mr. Smith , and my friend , Mr. Homer .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 15]: Gentlemen , my friend , Mr. Meredith , one of our well-known citizens . ''
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 20]: `` You hear it from the police , gentlemen , '' added Mr. Meredith , perking up a little .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 7]: `` I know Dr. Gay . ''
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 6]: He nodded to the surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 22]: `` I suppose you have heard some of the circumstances -- those that we 've given out , '' said Barrett .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 10]: `` I read the account in the evening paper .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 48]: I had heard of Harkless , of Carlow , before ; but it never occurred to me that it was my friend -- I had heard he was abroad -- until I got this telegram from a relative of mine who happened to be down there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 21]: `` Well , '' said the superintendent , `` your friend made a mighty good fight before he gave up .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 46]: The Teller , that 's the man we 've got out here , he 's so hacked up and shot and battered his mother would n't know him , if she wanted to ; at least , that 's what Gay , here , says .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 43]: We have n't seen him , because the doctors have been at him ever since he was found , and they expect to do some more tonight , when we 've had our interview with him , if he lives long enough .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 73]: One of my sergeants found him in , the freight-yards about four-o'clock and sent him here in the ambulance ; knew it was Teller , because he was stowed away in one of the empty cars that came from Plattville last night , and Slattery -- that 's his running mate , the one we caught with the coat and hat -- gave in that they beat their way on that freight .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 29]: I guess Slattery let this one do most of the fighting ; he ai n't scratched ; but Mr. Harkless certainly made it hot for the Teller . ''
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 15]: `` My relative believes that Mr. Harkless is still alive , '' said Meredith .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 8]: Mr. Barrett permitted himself an indulgent smile .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 54]: He had the air of having long ago discovered everything which anybody might wish to know , and of knowing a great deal which he held in reserve because it was necessary to suppress many facts for a purpose far beyond his auditor 's comprehension , though a very simple matter to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 14]: `` Well , hardly , I expect , '' he replied , easily .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 9]: `` No ; he 's hardly alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 12]: `` Oh , do n't say that , '' said Meredith .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 17]: `` I 'm afraid Mr. Barrett has to say it , '' broke in Warren Smith .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 32]: `` We 're up here to see this fellow before he dies , to try and get him to tell what disposal they made of the -- '' `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 3]: Meredith shivered .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 18]: `` I believe I 'd rather he said the other than to hear you say that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 19]: Mr. Horner felt the need of defending a fellow-townsman , and came to the rescue , flushing painfully .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 57]: `` It 's mighty bad , I know , '' said the sheriff of Carlow , the shadows of his honest , rough face falling in a solemn pattern ; `` I reckon we hate to say it as much as you hate to hear it ; and Warren really did n't get the word out .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 30]: It 's stuck in our throats all day ; and I do n't recollect as I heard a single man say it before I left our city this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 22]: Our folks thought a great deal of him , Mr. Meredith ; I do n't believe there 's any thinks more .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 17]: But it 's come to that now ; you ca n't hardly see no chance left .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 18]: We be 'n sweating this other man , Slattery , but we ca n't break him down .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 37]: Jest tells us to go to '' -- the sheriff paused , evidently deterred by the thought that swear-words were unbefitting a hospital -- `` to the other place , and shets his jaw up tight .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 21]: The one up here is called the Teller , as Mr. Barrett says ; his name 's Jerry the Teller .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 70]: Well , we told Slattery that Jerry had died and left a confession ; tried to make him think there was n't no hope fer him , and he might as well up and tell his share ; might git off easier ; warned him to look out for a mob if he did n't , maybe , and so on , but it never bothered him at all .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 7]: He 's nervy , all right .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 33]: Told us to go -- that is , he said it again -- and swore the Teller was on his way to Chicago , swore he seen him git on the train .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 11]: Would n't say another word tell he got a lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 25]: So , ` soon as it was any use , we come up here -- they reckon he 'll come to before he dies .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 17]: We 'll be glad to have you go in with us , '' Horner said kindly .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 13]: `` I reckon it 's all the same to Mr. Barrett . ''
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 11]: `` He will die , will he , Gay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 8]: Meredith asked , turning to the surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 37]: `` Oh , not necessarily , '' the young man replied , yawning slightly behind his hand , and too long accustomed to straightforward questions to be shocked at an evident wish for a direct reply .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 16]: `` His chances are better , because they 'll hang him if he gets well .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 28]: They took the ball and a good deal of shot out of his side , and there 's a lot more for afterwhile , if he lasts .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 16]: He 's been off the table an hour , and he 's still going . ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 12]: `` That 's in his favor , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 3]: said Meredith .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 7]: `` And extraordinary , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 18]: If young Dr. Gay perceived a slur in these interrogations he betrayed no exterior appreciation of it .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 4]: `` Shot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 3]: exclaimed Homer .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 3]: `` Shot !
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 35]: I knowed there 'd be 'n a pistol used , though where they got it beats me -- we stripped 'em -- and it was n't Mr. Harkless 's ; he never carried one .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 5]: But a shot-gun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 31]: An attendant entered and spoke to the surgeon , and Gay rose wearily , touched the drowsy young man on the shoulder , and led the way to the door .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 24]: `` You can come now , '' he said to the others ; `` though I doubt its being any good to you .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 5]: He 's delirious . ''
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 22]: They went down a long hall and up a narrow corridor , then stepped softly into a small , quiet ward .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 39]: There was a pungent smell of chemicals in the room ; the light was low , and the dimness was imbued with a thick , confused murmur , incoherent whisperings that came from a cot in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 33]: It was the only cot in use in the ward , and Meredith was conscious of a terror that made him dread , to look at it , to go near it .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 25]: Beside it a nurse sat silent , and upon it feebly tossed the racked body of him whom Barrett had called Jerry the Teller .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 31]: The head was a shapeless bundle , so swathed it was with bandages and cloths , and what part of the face was visible was discolored and pigmented with drugs .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 38]: Stretched under the white sheet the man looked immensely tall -- as Horner saw with vague misgiving -- and he lay in an odd , inhuman fashion , as though he had been all broken to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 46]: His attempts to move were constantly soothed by the nurse , and he as constantly renewed such attempts ; and one hand , though torn and bandaged , was not to be restrained from a wandering , restless movement which Meredith felt to be pathetic .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 41]: He had entered the room with a flare of hate for the thug whom he had come to see die , and who had struck down the old friend whose nearness he had never known until it was too late .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 45]: But at first sight of the broken figure he felt all animosity fall away from him ; only awe remained , and a growing , traitorous pity as he watched the long , white fingers of the Teller `` pick at the coverlet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 12]: The man was muttering rapid fragments of words , and syllables .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 15]: `` Somehow I feel a sense of wrong , '' Meredith whispered to Gay .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 23]: `` I feel as if I had done the fellow to death myself , as if it were all out of gear .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 13]: I know , now , how Henry felt over the great Guisard .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 8]: My God , how tall he looks !
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 13]: That does n't seem to me like a thug 's hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 4]: The surgeon nodded .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 25]: `` Of course , if there 's a mistake to be made , you can count on Barrett and his sergeants to make it .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 8]: I doubt if this is their man .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 25]: When they found him what clothes he wore were torn and stained ; but they had been good once , especially the linen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 7]: Barrett bent over the recumbent figure .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 4]: `` See here .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 16]: Jerry , '' he said , `` I want to talk to you a little .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 6]: Rouse up , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 11]: I want to talk to you as a friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 5]: The incoherent muttering continued .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 7]: `` See here , Jerry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 6]: repeated Barrett , more sharply .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 3]: `` Jerry !
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 6]: rouse up , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 13]: We do n't want any fooling ; understand that , Jerry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 14]: He dropped his hand on the man 's shoulder and shook him slightly .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 9]: The Teller uttered a short , gasping cry .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 12]: `` Let me , '' said Gay , and swiftly interposed .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 28]: Bending over the cot , he said in a pleasant , soft voice : `` It 's all right , old man ; it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 21]: Slattery wants to know what you did with that man down at Plattville , when you got through with him .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 15]: He ca n't remember , and he thinks there was money left on him .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 11]: Slattery 's head was hurt -- he ca n't remember .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 12]: He 'll go shares with you , when he gets it .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 16]: Slattery 's going to stand by you , if he can get the money . ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 16]: The Teller only tried to move his free hand to the shoulder Barrett had shaken .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 20]: `` Slattery wants to know , '' repeated the surgeon , gently moving the hand back upon the sheet .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 11]: `` He 'll divvy up , when he gets it .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 10]: He 'll stand by you , old man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 32]: `` Would you please not mind , '' whispered the Teller faintly , `` would you please not mind if you took care not to brush against my shoulder again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 25]: The surgeon drew back with an exclamation ; but the Teller 's whisper gathered strength , and they heard him murmuring oddly to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 4]: Meredith moved forward .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 8]: he asked , with a startled gesture .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 20]: `` Seems to be trying to sing , or something , '' said Barrett , bending over to listen .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 40]: The Teller swung his arm heavily over the side of the cot , the fingers never ceasing their painful twitching , and Gay leaned down and gently moved the cloths so that the white , scarred lips were free .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 74]: They moved steadily ; they seemed to be framing the semblance of an old ballad that Meredith knew ; the whisper grew more distinct , and it became a rich but broken voice , and they heard it singing , like the sound of some far , halting minstrelsy : `` Wave willows -- murmur waters -- golden sunbeams smile , Earthly music -- can not waken -- lovely -- Annie Lisle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 5]: `` My God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 4]: cried Tom Meredith .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 11]: The bandaged hand waved jauntily over the Teller 's head .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 35]: `` Ah , men , '' he said , almost clearly , and tried to lift himself on his arm , `` I tell you it 's a grand eleven we have this year !
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 12]: There will be little left of anything that stands against them .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 13]: Did you see Jim Romley ride over his man this afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 38]: As the voice grew clearer the sheriff stepped forward , but Tom Meredith , with a loud exclamation of grief , threw himself on his knees beside the cot and seized the wandering fingers in his own .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 4]: `` John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 3]: `` John !
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 7]: Is it _ you _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 31]: The voice went on rapidly , not heeding him : `` Ah , you need n't howl ; I 'd have been as much use at right as that Sophomore .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 8]: Well , laugh away , you Indians !
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 41]: If it had n't been for this ankle -- but it seems to be my chest that 's hurt -- and side -- not that it matters , you know ; the Sophomore 's just as good , or better .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 6]: It 's only my egotism .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 20]: Yes , it must be the side -- and chest -- and head -- all over , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 63]: Not that it matters -- I 'll try again next year -- next year I 'll make it a daily , Helen said , not that I should call you Helen -- I mean Miss -- Miss -- Fisbee -- no , Sherwood -- but I 've always thought Helen was the prettiest name in the world -- you 'll forgive me ?
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 72]: -- And please tell Parker there 's no more copy , and wo n't be -- I would n't grind out another stick to save his immortal -- yes , yes , a daily -- she said-ah , I never made a good trade -- no -- they ca n't come seven miles -- but I 'll finish _ you _ , Skillett , first ; I know _ you _ !
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 7]: I know nearly all of you !
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 10]: Now let 's sing ` Annie Lisle . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 14]: He lifted his hand as if to beat the time for a chorus .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 8]: `` Oh , John , John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 8]: cried Tom Meredith , and sobbed outright .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 39]: `` My boy -- my boy -- old friend -- '' The cry of the classmate was like that of a mother , for it was his old idol and hero who lay helpless and broken before him .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 19]: The brougham lamps and the apathetic sparks of the cab gleamed in front of the hospital till daylight .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 47]: Two other pairs of lamps joined them in the earliest of the small hours , these subjoined to two deep-hooded phaetons , from each of which quickly descended a gentleman with a beard , an air of eminence , and a small , ominous black box .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 23]: The air of eminence was justified by the haste with which Meredith had sent for them , and by their wide repute .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 27]: They arrived almost simultaneously , and hastily shook hands as they made their way to the ward down the long hall and up the narrow corridor .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 29]: They had a short conversation with Gay and a word with the nurse , then turned the others out of the room by a practiced innuendo of manner .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 13]: They stayed a long time in the room without opening the door .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 28]: Meredith paced the hall alone , sometimes stopping to speak to Warren Smith ; but the two officials of peace sat together in dumb consternation and astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 25]: The sleepy young man relaxed himself resignedly upon a bench in the hall had returned to the dormance from which he had been roused .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 7]: The big hospital was very still .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 48]: Now and then a nurse went through the hall , carrying something , and sometimes a neat young physician passed cheerfully along , looking as if he had many patients who were well enough to testify to his skill , but sick enough to pay for it .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 12]: Outside , through the open front doors , the crickets chirped .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 14]: Meredith went out on the steps , and breathed the cool night air .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 35]: A slender taint of drugs hung everywhere about the building , and the almost imperceptible permeation sickened him ; it was deadly , he thought , and imbued with a hideous portent of suffering .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 52]: That John Harkless , of all men , should lie stifled with ether , and bandaged and splintered , and smeared with horrible unguents , while they stabbed and slashed and tortured him , and made an outrage and a sin of that grand , big , dexterous body of his !
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 3]: Meredith shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 51]: The lights in the little ward were turned up , and they seemed to shine from a chamber of horrors , while he waited , as a brother might have waited outside the Inquisition -- if , indeed , a brother would have been allowed to wait outside the Inquisition .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 8]: Alas , he had found John Harkless !
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 47]: He had `` lost track '' of him as men sometimes do lose track of their best beloved , but it had always been a comfort to know that Harkless _ was _ -- somewhere , a comfort without which he could hardly have got along .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 55]: Like others he had been waiting for John to turn up -- on top , of course ; for people would always believe in him so , that he would be shoved ahead , no matter how much he hung back himself -- but Meredith had not expected him to turn up in Indiana .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 40]: He had heard vaguely that Harkless was abroad , and he had a general expectation that people would hear of him over there some day , with papers like the `` Times '' beseeching him to go on missions .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 28]: And he found him here , in his own home , a stranger , alone and dying , receiving what ministrations were reserved for Jerry the Teller .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 10]: But it was Helen Sherwood who had found him .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 17]: He wondered how much those two had seen of each other , down there in Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 24]: If they had liked each other , and Harkless could have lived , he thought it might have simplified some things for Helen .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 5]: `` Poor Helen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 4]: he exclaimed aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 13]: Her telegram had a ring , even in the barren four sentences .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 10]: He wondered how much they had liked each other .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 9]: Perhaps she would wish to come at once .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 17]: When those fellows came out of the room he would send her a word by telegraph .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 7]: When they came out -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 13]: he did not want them to come out ; he was afraid .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 11]: They were an eternity -- why did n't they come ?
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 12]: No ; he hoped they would not come , just now .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 56]: In a little time , in a few minutes , even , he would not dread a few words so much ; but _ now _ he could n't quite bear to be told he had found his friend only to lose him , the man he had always most needed , wanted , loved .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 11]: Everybody had always cared for Harkless , wherever he went .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 17]: That _ he _ had always cared for everybody was part of the reason , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 39]: Meredith remembered , now , hearing a man who had spent a day in Plattville on business speak of him : `` They 've got a young fellow down there who 'll be Governor in a few years .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 30]: He 's a sort of dictator ; and runs the party all over that part of the State to suit his own sweet will , just by sheer personality .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 25]: And there is n't a man in that district who would n't cheerfully lie down in the mud to let him pass over dry .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 32]: It 's that young Harkless , you know ; owns the ` Herald , ' the paper that downed McCune and smashed those imitation ` White-Caps ' in Carlow County . ''
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 57]: Meredith had been momentarily struck by the coincidence of the name , but his notion of Harkless was so inseparably connected with what was -LRB- to his mind -RRB- a handsome and more spacious -- certainly more illuminated -- field of action , that the idea that this might be his friend never entered his head .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 27]: Helen had said something once -- he could not remember what -- that made him think she had half suspected it , and he had laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 39]: He thought of the whimsical fate that had taken her to Plattville , of the reason for her going , and the old thought came to him that the world is , after all , so very small .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 14]: He looked up at the twinkling stars ; they were reassuring and kind .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 35]: Under their benignancy no loss could befall , no fate miscarry -- for in his last thought he felt his vision opened , for the moment , to perceive a fine tracery of fate .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 10]: `` Ah , that would be too beautiful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 13]: And then he shivered ; for his name was spoken from within .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 41]: It was soon plain to him that he need not have feared a few words , for he did not in the least understand those with which the eminent surgeons favored him ; and they at once took their departure .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 11]: He did understand , however , what Horner told him .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 26]: Mr. Barrett , Warren Smith , and the sleepy young man had reentered the ward ; and Horner was following , but waited for Meredith .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 26]: Somehow , the look of the sheriff 's Sunday coat , wrinkling forlornly from his broad , bent shoulders , was both touching and solemn .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 15]: He said simply : `` He 's conscious and not out of his head .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 18]: They 're gone in to take his ante-mortem statement , '' and they went into the room .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 6]: Harkless 's eyes were bandaged .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 16]: The lawyer was speaking to him , and as Horner went awkwardly toward the cot .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 43]: Warren said something indicative of the sheriff 's presence , and the hand on the sheet made a formless motion which Horner understood , for he took the pale fingers in his own , very gently , and then set them back .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 35]: Smith turned toward Meredith , but the latter made a gesture which forbade the attorney to speak of him , and went to a corner and sat down with his head in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 20]: The sleepy young man opened a notebook and shook a stylographic pen so that the ink might flow freely .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 25]: The lawyer , briefly and with unlegal agitation , administered an oath , to which Harkless responded feebly , and then there was silence .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 32]: `` Now , Mr. Harkless , if you please , '' said Barrett , insinuatingly ; `` if you feel like telling us as much as you can about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 19]: He answered in a low , rather indistinct voice , very deliberately , pausing before almost every word .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 9]: It was easy work for the sleepy stenographer .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 4]: `` I understand .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 14]: I do n't want to go off my head again before I finish .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 9]: Of course I know why you want this .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 31]: If it were only for myself I should tell you nothing , because , if I am to leave , I should like it better if no one were punished .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 35]: But that 's a bad community over there ; they are everlastingly worrying our people ; they have always been a bother to us , and it 's time it was stopped for good .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 45]: I do n't believe very much in punishment , but you ca n't do a great deal of reforming with the Cross-Roaders unless you catch them young -- very young , before they 're weaned -- they wean them on whiskey , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 16]: I realize you need n't have sworn me for me to tell you this . ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 32]: Homer and Smith had started at the mention of the Cross-Roads , but they subdued their ejaculations , while Mr. Barrett looked as if he had known it , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 19]: The room was still , save for the dim voice and the soft transcribings of the stylographic pen .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 18]: `` I left Judge Briscoe 's , and went west on the pike to a big tree .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 12]: It rained , and I stepped under the tree for shelter .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 12]: There was a man on the other side of the fence .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 5]: It was Bob Skillett .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 18]: He was carrying his gown and hood -- I suppose it was that -- on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 33]: Then I saw two others a little farther east , in the middle of the road ; and I think they had followed me from the Briscoes ' , or near there .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 22]: They had their foolish regalia on , as all the rest had , -- there was plenty of lightning to see .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 23]: The two in the road were simply standing there in the rain , looking at me through the eye-holes in their hoods .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 21]: I knew there were others -- plenty -- but I thought they were coming from behind me -- the west .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 24]: `` I wanted to get home -- the court-house yard was good enough for me -- so I started east , toward town .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 48]: I passed the two gentlemen ; and one fell down as I went by him , but the other fired a shot as a signal , and I got his hood off his face for it -- I stopped long enough -- and it was Force Johnson .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 5]: I know him well .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 8]: Then I ran , and they followed .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 17]: A little ahead of me I saw six or eight of them spread across the road .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 39]: I knew I 'd have a time getting through , so I jumped the fence to cut across the fields , and I lit in a swarm of them -- it had rained them just where I jumped .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 36]: I set my back to the fence , but one of the fellows in the road leaned over and smashed my head in , rather -- with the butt of a gun , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 15]: I came out from the fence and they made a little circle around me .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 5]: No one said anything .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 23]: I saw they had ropes and saplings , and I did n't want that , exactly , so I went into them .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 27]: I got a good many hoods off before it was over , and I can swear to quite a number besides those I told you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 9]: He named the men , slowly and carefully .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 16]: Then he went on : `` I think they gave up the notion of whipping .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 57]: We all got into a bunch , and they could n't clear to shoot without hitting some of their own : and there was a lot of gouging and kicking -- one fellow nearly got my left eye , and I tried to tear him apart and he screamed so that I think he was hurt .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 47]: Once or twice I thought I might get away , but somebody hammered me over the head and face again , and I got dizzy ; and then they all jumped away from me suddenly , and Bob Skillett stepped up -- and -- shot me .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 16]: He waited for a good flurry of lightning , and I was slow tumbling down .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 25]: Some one else fired a shot-gun , I think -- I ca n't be sure -- about the same time , from the side .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 21]: I tried to get up , but I could n't , and then they got together , for a consultation .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 18]: The man I had hurt -- I did n't recognize him -- came and looked at me .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 49]: He was nursing himself all over ; and groaned ; and I laughed , I -- at any rate , my arm was lying stretched out on the grass , and he stamped his heel into my hand , and after a little of that I quit feeling .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 11]: `` I 'm not quite clear about what happened afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 10]: They went away , not far , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 27]: There 's an old shed , a cattle-shelter , near there , and I think the storm drove them under it to wait for a slack .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 6]: It seemed a long time .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 10]: Sometimes I was conscious , sometimes I was n't .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 17]: I thought I might be drowned , but I suppose the rain was good for me .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 15]: Then I remember being in motion , being dragged and carried a long way .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 18]: They took me up a steep , short slope , and set me down near the top .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 79]: I knew that was the railroad embankment , and I thought they meant to lay me across the track , but it did n't occur to them , I suppose -- they are not familiar with melodrama -- and a long time after that I felt and heard a great banging and rattling under me and all about me , and it came to me that they had disposed of me by hoisting me into an empty freight-car .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 33]: The odd part of it was that the car was n't empty , for there were two men already in it , and I knew them by what they said to me .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 78]: `` They were the two shell-men who cheated Hartley Bowlder , and they were n't vindictive ; they even seemed to be trying to help me a little , though perhaps they were only stealing my clothes , and maybe they thought for them to do anything unpleasant would be superfluous ; I could see that they thought I was done for , and that they had been hiding in the car when I was put there .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 28]: I asked them to try to call the train men for me , but they would n't listen , or else I could n't make myself understood .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 4]: That 's all .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 6]: The rest is a blur .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 12]: I have n't known anything more until those surgeons were here .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 9]: Please tell me how long ago it happened .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 21]: I shall not die , I think ; there are a good many things I want to know about . ''
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 9]: He moved restlessly and the nurse soothed him .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 11]: Meredith rose and left the room with a noiseless step .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 25]: He went out to the stars again , and looked to them to check the storm of rage and sorrow that buffeted his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 39]: He understood lynching , now the thing was home to him , and his feeling was no inspiration of a fear lest the law miscarry ; it was the itch to get his own hand on the rope .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 30]: Horner came out presently , and whispered a long , broad , profound curse upon the men of the Cross-Roads , and Meredith 's gratitude to him was keen .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 16]: Barrett went away , soon after , leaving the cab for the gentlemen from Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 18]: Meredith had a strange , unreasonable desire to kick Barrett , possibly for his sergeant 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 19]: Warren Smith sat in the ward with the nurse and Gay , and the room was very quiet .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 6]: It was a long vigil .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 5]: They were only waiting .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 17]: At five o'clock he was still alive -- just that , Smith came out to say .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 27]: Meredith sent his driver with a telegram to Helen which would give Plattville the news that Harkless was found and was not yet gone from them .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 26]: Homer took the cab and left for the station ; there was a train , and there were things for him to do in Carlow .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 27]: At noon Meredith sent a second telegram to Helen , as barren of detail as the first : he was alive -- was a little improved .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 42]: This telegram did not reach her , for she was on the way to Rouen , and half of the population of Carlow -- at least , so it appeared to the unhappy conductor of the accommodation -- was with her .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 25]: They seemed to feel that they could camp in the hospital halls and corridors , and they were an incalculable worry to the authorities .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 37]: More came on every train , and nearly all brought flowers , and jelly , and chickens for preparing broth , and they insisted that the two latter delicacies be fed to the patient at once .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 23]: Meredith was possessed by an unaccountable responsibility for them all , and invited a great many to stay at his own house .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 49]: They were still in ignorance of the truth about the Cross-Roads , and some of them spent the day -LRB- it was Sunday -RRB- in planning an assault upon the Rouen jail for the purpose of lynching Slattery in case Harkless 's condition did not improve at once .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 42]: Those who had heard his statement kept close mouths until the story appeared in full in the Rouen papers on Monday morning ; but by that time every member of the Cross-Roads White-Caps was lodged in the Rouen jail with Slattery .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 33]: Homer and a heavily armed posse rode over to the muddy corners on Sunday night , and the sheriff discovered that he might have taken the Skilletts and Johnsons single-handed and unarmed .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 41]: Their nerve was gone ; they were shaken and afraid ; and , to employ a figure somewhat inappropriate to their sullen , glad surrender , they fell upon his neck in their relief at finding the law touching them .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 14]: They had no wish to hear `` John Brown 's Body '' again .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 25]: They wanted to get inside of a strong jail , and to throw themselves on the mercy of the court as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 23]: And those whom Harkless had not recognized delayed not to give themselves up ; they did not desire to remain in Six-Cross-Roads .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 30]: Bob Skillett , Force Johnson , and one or two others needed the care of a physician badly , and one man was suffering from a severely wrenched back .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 29]: Homer had a train stopped at a crossing , so that his prisoners need not be taken through Plattville , and he brought them all safely to Rouen .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 63]: Had there chanced any one to ride through the deserted Cross-Roads the next morning , passing the trampled fields and the charred ruins of the two shanties to the east , and listening to the lamentations of the women and children , he would have declared that at last the old score had been paid , and that Six-Cross-Roads was wiped out .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 86]: The Carlow folks were deeply impressed with the two eminent surgeons , of whom some of them had heard , and on Tuesday , the bulletins marking considerable encouragement , most of them decided to temporarily risk the editor of the `` Herald '' to such capable hands , and they returned quietly to their homes ; only a few were delayed in reaching Carlow by travelling to the first station in the opposite direction before they succeeded in planting themselves on the proper train .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 16]: Meanwhile , the object of their solicitude tossed and burned on his bed of pain .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 45]: He was delirious most of the time , and , in the intervals of half-consciousness , found that his desire to live , very strong at first , had disappeared ; he did not care much about anything except rest -- he wanted peace .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 22]: In his wanderings he was almost always back in his college days , beholding them in an unhappy , distorted fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 104]: He would lie asprawl on the sward with the others , listening to the Seniors singing on the steps , and , all at once , the old , kindly faces would expand enormously and press over him with hideous mouthings , and an ugly Senior in cap and gown would stamp him and grind a spiked heel into his hand ; then they would toss him high into air that was all flames , and he would fall and fall through the raging heat , seeing the cool earth far beneath him , but never able to get down to it again .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 120]: And then he was driven miles and miles by dusky figures , through a rain of boiling water ; and at other times the whole universe was a vast , hot brass bell , and it gave off a huge , continuous roar and hum , while he was a mere point of consciousness floating in the exact centre of the heat and sound waves , and he listened , listened for years , to the awful , brazen hum from which there could be no escape ; at the same time it seemed to him that he was only a Freshman on the slippery roof of the tower , trying to steal the clapper of the chapel bell .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 32]: Finally he came to what he would have considered a lucid interval , had it not appeared that Helen Sherwood was whispering to Tom Meredith at the foot of his bed .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 26]: This he knew to be a fictitious presentation of his fever , for was she not by this time away and away for foreign lands ?
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 45]: And , also , Tom Meredith was a slim young thing , and not the middle-aged youth with an undeniable stomach and a baldish head , who , by the grotesque necromancy of his hallucinations , assumed a preposterous likeness to his old friend .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 34]: He waved his hand to the figures and they vanished like figments of a dream ; but all the same the vision had been realistic enough for the lady to look exquisitely pretty .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 19]: No one could help wishing to stay in a world which contained as charming a picture as that .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 63]: And then , too quickly , the moment of clearness passed ; and he was troubled about the `` Herald , '' beseeching those near him to put copies of the paper in his hands , threatening angrily to believe they were deceiving him , that his paper had suspended , if the three issues of the week were not instantly produced .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 11]: What did they mean by keeping the truth from him ?
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 11]: He knew the `` Herald '' had not come out .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 11]: Who was there to get it out in his absence ?
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 21]: He raised himself on his elbow and struggled to be up ; and they had hard work to quiet him .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 14]: But the next night Meredith waited near his bedside , haggard and dishevelled .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 38]: Harkless had been lying in a long stupor ; suddenly he spoke , quite loudly , and the young surgeon , Gay , who leaned over him , remembered the words and the tone all his life .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 14]: `` Away and away -- across the waters , '' said John Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 11]: `` She was here -- once -- in June . ''
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 8]: `` What is it , John ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 5]: whispered Meredith , huskily .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 10]: `` You 're easier , are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 29]: And John smiled a little , as if , for an instant , his swathed eyes penetrated the bandages , and saw and knew his old friend again .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 20]: That same night a friend of Rodney McCune 's sent a telegram from Rouen : `` He is dying .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 5]: His paper is dead .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 9]: Your name goes before convention in September . ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 50]: JAMES FISBEE On Monday morning three men sat in council in the `` Herald '' office ; that is , if staring out of dingy windows in a demented silence may be called sitting in council ; that was what Mr. Fisbee and Parker and Ross Schofield were doing .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 102]: By almost desperate exertions , these three and Bud Tipworthy had managed to place before the public the issues of the paper for the previous week , unaided by their chief , or , rather , aided by long accounts of his condition and the manner of his mishap ; and , in truth , three copies were at that moment in the possession of Dr. Gay , accompanied by a note from Parker warning the surgeon to exhibit them to his patient only as a last resort , as the foreman feared the perusal of them might cause a relapse .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 72]: By indiscriminate turns , acting as editors , reporters , and typesetters -- and particularly space-writers -- the three men had worried out three issues , and part of the fourth -LRB- to appear the next morning -RRB- was set up ; but they had come to the end of their string , and there were various horrid gaps yet to fill in spite of a too generous spreading of advertisements .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 100]: Bud Tipworthy had been sent out to besiege Miss Tibbs , all of whose recent buds of rhyme had been hot-housed into inky blossom during the week , and after a long absence the youth returned with a somewhat abrupt quatrain , entitled `` The Parisians of Old , '' which she had produced while he waited -- only four lines , according to the measure they meted , which was not regardful of art -- less than a drop in the bucket , or , to preserve the figure , a single posy where they needed a bouquet .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 48]: Bud went down the rickety outside stairs , and sat on the lowest step , whistling `` Wait till the Clouds Roll by , Jenny '' ; Ross Schofield descended to set up the quatrain , and Fisbee and Parker were left to silence and troubled meditation .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 11]: They were seated on opposite sides of Harkless 's desk .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 16]: Sheets of blank scratch-paper lay before them , and they relaxed not their knit brows .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 61]: Now and then , one of them , after gazing vacantly about the room for ten or fifteen minutes , would attack the sheet before him with fiercest energy ; then the energy would taper off , and the paragraph halt , the writer peruse it dubiously , then angrily tear off the sheet and hurl it to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 10]: All around them lay these snowballs of defeated journalism .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 49]: Mr. Parker was a long , loose , gaunt gentleman , with a peremptory forehead and a capable jaw , but on the present occasion his capability was baffled and swamped in the attempt to steer the craft of his talent up an unaccustomed channel without a pilot .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 32]: `` I do n't see as it 's any use , Fisbee , '' he said , morosely , after a series of efforts that littered the floor in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 15]: `` I 'm a born compositor , and I ca n't shift my trade .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 23]: I stood the pace fairly for a week , but I 'll have to give up ; I 'm run plumb dry .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 28]: I only hope they wo n't show him our Saturday with your three columns of ' A Word of the Lotus Motive , ' reprinted from February .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 21]: I begin to sympathize with the boss , because I know what he felt when I ballyragged him for copy .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 20]: Yes , sir , I know how it is to be an editor in a dead town now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 33]: `` We must remember , too , '' said his companion , thoughtfully , `` there is the Thursday issue of this week to be prepared , almost at once . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 5]: _ Do n't _ !
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 9]: Please do n't mention that , Fisbee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 20]: Parker tilted far back in his chair with his feet anchored under the desk , preserving a precarious balance .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 17]: `` I ai n't as grateful for my promotion to joint Editor-in-Chief as I might be .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 30]: I 'm a middling poor man for the hour , I guess , '' he remarked , painfully following the peregrinations of a fly on his companion 's sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 48]: Mr. Fisbee twisted up another sheet , and employed his eyes in following the course of a crack in the plaster , a slender black aperture which staggered across the dusty ceiling and down the dustier wall to disappear behind a still dustier map of Carlow County .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 7]: `` That 's the trouble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 9]: exclaimed Parker , observing the other 's preoccupation .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 29]: `` Soon as you get to writing a line or two that seems kind of promising , you begin to take a morbid interest in that blamed crack .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 23]: It 's busted up enough copy for me , the last eight days , to have filled her up twenty times over .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 14]: I do n't know as I ever care to see that crack again .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 57]: I turned my back on it , but there was n't any use in that , because if a fly lights on you I watch him like a brother , and if there ai n't any fly I 've caught a mania for tapping my teeth with a pencil , that is just as good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 50]: To these two gentlemen , thus disengaged , reentered -LRB- after a much longer absence than Miss Selina 's quatrain justified -RRB- Mr. Ross Schofield , a healthy glow of exertion lending pleasant color to his earnest visage , and an almost visible laurel of success crowning his brows .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 25]: In addition to this imaginary ornament , he was horned with pencils over both ears , and held some scribbled sheets in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 22]: `` I done a good deal down there , '' he announced cheerfully , drawing up a chair to the desk .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 21]: `` I thought up a heap of things I 've heard lately , and they 'll fill up mighty well .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 31]: That there poem of Miss Seliny 's was a kind of an inspiration to me , and I tried one myself , and it did n't come hard at all .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 14]: When I got started once , it jest seemed to flow from me .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 37]: I did n't set none of it up , '' he added modestly , but with evident consciousness of having unearthed genius in himself and an elate foreknowledge of the treat in store for his companions .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 15]: `` I thought I 'd ort to see how you liked it first . ''
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 15]: He offered the papers to Mr. Parker , but the foreman shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 11]: `` You read it , Ross , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 11]: `` I do n't believe I feel hearty enough to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 12]: Read the items first -- we can bear the waiting . ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 5]: `` What waiting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 4]: inquired Mr. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 11]: `` For the poem , '' replied Parker , grimly .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 44]: With a vague but not fleeting smile , Ross settled the sheets in order , and exhibited tokens of that pleasant nevousness incident to appearing before a critical audience , armed with literature whose merits should delight them out of the critical attitude .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 65]: `` I run across a great scheme down there , '' he volunteered amiably , by way of preface ; `` I described everything in full , in as many words as I could think up ; it 's mighty filling , and it 'll please the public , too ; it gives 'em a lot more information than they us ` ally git .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 14]: I reckon there 's two sticks of jest them extry words alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 12]: `` Go on , '' said the foreman , rather ominously .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 39]: Ross began to read , a matter necessitating a puckered brow and at times an amount of hesitancy and ruminating , as his results had already cooled a little , and he found his hand difficult to decipher .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 60]: `` Here 's the first , '' he said : '' ` The large and handsome , fawn-colored , two years and one-half year old Jersey of Frederick Bibshaw Jones , Esquire -- ' '' The foreman interrupted him : `` Every reader of the ` Herald ' will be glad to know that Jersey 's age and color !
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 7]: But go on . '' '' '
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 52]: -- Frederick Bibshaw Jones , Esquire , ' '' pursued his assistant , with some discomfiture , '' ' -- Esquire , our popular and well-dressed fellow-citizen -- ' '' `` You 're right ; Bib Jones is a heavy swell , '' said Parker in a breaking voice . '' '
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 26]: -- Citizen , can be daily seen wandering from the far end of his pasture-lot to the other far end of it . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 5]: ` His ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 5]: exclaimed Parker . '' '
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 6]: _ His _ pasture-lot ? '
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 5]: The Jersey 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 16]: `` No , '' returned the other , meekly , `` Bib Jones 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 7]: `` Oh , '' said Parker .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 9]: `` Is that the end of that item ?
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 3]: It is !
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 38]: You want to get out of Plattville , my friend ; it 's too small for you ; you go to Rouen and you 'll be city editor of the ` Journal ' inside of a week .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 6]: Let 's have another . ''
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 75]: Mr. Schofield looked up blankly ; however , he felt that there was enough live , legitimate news in his other items to redeem the somewhat tame quality of the first , and so , after having crossed out several of the extra words which had met so poor a reception , he proceeded : '' ` Whit Upton 's pigs broke out last Wednesday and rooted up a fine patch of garden truck .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 7]: Hard luck , Whit . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 9]: ` Jerusalem Hawkins took a drive yesterday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 8]: He had the bay to his side-bar .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 8]: Jee 's buggy has been recently washed .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 6]: Congratulations , Jee . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 7]: `` There 's thrilling information ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 4]: shouted the foreman .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 11]: `` That 'll touch the gentle reader to the marrow .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 20]: The boss had to use some pretty rotten copy himself , but he never got as low as that .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 13]: But we 'll use it ; oh , we 'll use it !
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 25]: If we do n't get her out he 'll have a set-back , but if they show her to him it 'll kill him .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 15]: If it does n't , and he gets well , he 'll kill us .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 8]: But we 'll use it , Ross .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 24]: Do n't read any more to us , though ; I feel weaker than I did , and I was n't strong before .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 9]: Go down and set it all up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 47]: Mr. Schofield rejoined with an injured air , and yet hopefully : `` I 'd like to see what you think of the poetry -- it seemed all right to me , but I reckon you ai n't ever the best judge of your own work .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 6]: Shall I read it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 18]: The foreman only glanced at him in silence , and the young man took this for assent .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 14]: `` I have n't made up any name for it yet . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 58]: ` O , the orphan boy stood on the hill , The wind blew cold and very chill -- ' '' Glancing at his auditors , he was a trifle abashed to observe a glaze upon the eyes of Mr. Parker , while a purple tide rose above his neck-band and unnaturally distended his throat and temples .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 41]: With a placative little laugh , Mr. Schofield remarked : `` I git the swing to her all right , I reckon , but somehow it does n't sound so kind of good as when I was writing it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 56]: There was no response , and he went on hurriedly : '' ` But there he saw the little rill -- ' '' The poet paused to say , with another amiable laugh : `` It 's sort of hard to git out of them ill , hill , chill rhymes once you strike 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 20]: It runs on like this : '' ' -- Little rill That curved and spattered around the hill . '
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 22]: `` I guess that 's all right , to use ` hill ' twice ; do n't you reckon so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 89]: ` And the orphan he stood there until The wind and all gave him a chill ; And he sickened -- ' '' That day Ross read no more , for the tall printer , seemingly incapable of coherent speech , kicked the desk impotently , threw his arms above his head , and , his companions confidently looking to see him foam at the mouth , lost his balance and toppled over backward , his extensive legs waving wildly in the air as he struck the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 4]: Mr. Schofield fled .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 17]: Parker made no effort to rise , but lay glaring at the ceiling , breathing hard .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 29]: He remained in that position for a long time , until finally the glaze wore away from his eyes and a more rational expression settled over his features .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 21]: Mr. Fisbee addressed him timidly : `` You do n't think we could reduce the size of the sheet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 12]: `` It would kill him , '' answered his prostrate companion .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 22]: `` We 've got to fill her solid some way , though I give up ; I do n't know how .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 6]: How that man has worked !
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 4]: It was genius .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 19]: He just floated around the county and soaked in items , and he wrote editorials that people read .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 11]: One thing 's certain : we ca n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 22]: We 're ruining his paper for him , and when he gets able to read , it 'll hurt him bad .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 11]: Mighty few knew how much pride he had in it .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 26]: Has it struck you that now would be a precious good time for it to occur to Rod McCune to come out of his hole ?
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 13]: Suppose we go by the board , what 's to stop him ?
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 8]: What 's to stop him , anyway ?
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 27]: Who knows where the boss put those copies and affidavits , and if we did know , would we know the best way to use 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 19]: If we did , what 's to keep the ` Herald ' alive until McCune lifts his head ?
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 17]: And if we do n't stop him , the ` Carlow County Herald ' is finished .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 9]: Something 's got to be done ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 24]: No one realized this more poignantly than Mr. Fisbee , but no one was less capable of doing something of his own initiation .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 58]: And although the Tuesday issue was forthcoming , embarrassingly pale in spots -- most spots -- Mr. Martin remarked rather publicly that the items were not what you might call stirring , and that the unpatented pages put him in mind of Jones 's field in winter with a dozen chunks of coal dropped in the snow .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 48]: And his observations on the later issues of the week -LRB- issues which were put forth with a suggestion of spasm , and possibly to the permanent injury of Mr. Parker 's health , he looked so thin -RRB- were too cruelly unkind to be repeated here .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 115]: Indeed , Mr. Fisbee , Parker , the luckless Mr. Schofield , and the young Tipworthy may be not untruthfully likened to a band of devoted mariners lost in the cold and glaring regions of a journalistic Greenland : limitless plains of empty white paper extending about them as far as the eye could reach , while life depended upon their making these terrible voids productive ; and they shrank appalled from the task , knowing no means to fertilize the barrens ; having no talent to bring the still snows into harvests , and already feeling-in the chill of Mr. Martin 's remarks -- a touch of the frost that might wither them .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 64]: It was Fisbee who caught the first glimpse of a relief expedition clipping the rough seas on its lively way to rescue them , and , although his first glimpse of the jaunty pennant of the relieving vessels was over the shoulder of an iceberg , nothing was surer than that the craft was flying to them with all good and joyous speed .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 57]: The iceberg just mentioned assumed -- by no melting process , one may be sure -- the form of a long letter , first postmarked at Rouen , and its latter substance was as follows : `` Henry and I have always believed you as selfish , James Fisbee , as you are self-ingrossed and incapable .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 75]: She has told us of your ` renunciation ' ; of your ` forbidding ' her to remain with you ; how you ` commanded , ' after you had ` begged ' her , to return to us , and how her conscience told her she should stay and share your life in spite of our long care of her , but that she yielded to your ` wishes ' and our entreaty .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 15]: What have you ever done for her and what have you to offer her ?
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 54]: She is our daughter , and needless to say we shall still take care of her , for no one believes you capable of it , even in that miserable place , and , of course , in time she will return to her better wisdom , her home , and her duty .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 19]: I need scarcely say we have given up the happy months we had planned to spend in Dresden .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 54]: Henry and I can only stay at home to pray that her preposterous mania will wear itself out in short order , as she will find herself unfitted for the ridiculous task which she insists upon attempting against the earnest wishes of us who have been more than father and mother to her .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 33]: Of course , she has talked volumes of her affection for us , and of her gratitude , which we do not want -- we only want her to stay with us .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 19]: Please , please try to make her come back to us -- we can not bear it long .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 13]: If you are a man you will send her to us soon .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 127]: Her excuse for not returning on the day we wired our intention to go abroad at once -LRB- and I may as well tell you now that our intention to go was formed in order to bring affairs to a crisis and to draw her away from your influence -- we always dreaded her visit to you and held it off for years -RRB- -- her excuse was that your best friend , and , as I understand it , your patron , had been injured in some brawl in that Christian country of yours -- a charming place to take a girl like her -- and she would not leave you in your ` distress ' until more was known of the man 's injuries .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 82]: And now she insists -- and you will know it from her by the next mail -- on returning to Plattville , forsooth , because she has been reading your newspaper , and she says she knows you are in difficulties over it , and it is her moral obligation -- as by some wild reasoning of her own she considers herself responsible for your ruffling patron 's having been alone when he was shot -- to go down and help .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 46]: I suppose he made love to her , as all the young men she meets always do , sooner or later , but I have no fear of any rustic entanglements tor her ; she has never been really interested , save in one affair .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 24]: We are quite powerless -- we have done everything ; but we can not alter her determination to edit your paper for you .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 40]: Naturally , she knows nothing whatever about such work , but she says , with the air of triumphantly quelching all such argument , that she has talked a great deal to Mr. Macauley of the ` Journal . '
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 32]: Mr. Macauley is the affair I have alluded to ; he is what she has meant when she has said , at different times , that she was interested in journalism .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 7]: But she is very business-like now .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 37]: She has bought a typewriter and purchased a great number of soft pencils and erasers at an art shop ; I am only surprised that she does not intend to edit your miserable paper in water-colors .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 6]: She is coming at once .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 18]: For mercy 's sake do n't telegraph her not to ; your forbiddings work the wrong way .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 27]: Our only hope is that she will find the conditions so utterly discouraging at the very start that she will give it up and come home .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 13]: If you are a man you will help to make them so .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 22]: She has promised to stay with that country girl with whom she contracted such an incomprehensible friendship at Miss Jennings 's .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 23]: `` Oh , James , pray for grace to be a man once in your life and send her back to us !
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 10]: Be a man -- try to be a man !
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 6]: Remember the angel you killed !
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 24]: Remember all we have done for you and what a return you have made , and be a man for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 6]: Try and be a man !
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 10]: `` Your unhappy sister-in-law , `` MARTHA SHERWOOD . ''
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 96]: Mr. Fisbee read the letter with a great , rising delight which no sense of duty could down ; indeed , he perceived that his sense of duty had ceased to conflict with the one strong hope of his life , just as he perceived that to be a man , according to Martha Sherwood , was , in part , to assist Martha Sherwood to have her way in things ; and , for the rest , to be the sort of man she persuaded herself she would be were she not a woman .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 9]: This he had never been able to be .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 61]: By some whimsy of fate , or by a failure of Karma -LRB- or , perhaps , by some triumph of Kismetic retribution -RRB- , James Fisbee was born in one of the most business-like and artless cities of a practical and modern country , of money-getting , money-saving parents , and he was born a dreamer of the past .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 32]: He grew up a student of basilican lore , of choir-screens , of Persian frescoes , and an ardent lounger in the somewhat musty precincts of Chaldea and Byzantium and Babylon .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 57]: Early Christian Symbolism , a dispute over the site of a Greek temple , the derivation of the lotus column , the restoration of a Gothic buttress -- these were the absorbing questions of his youth , with now and then a lighter moment spent in analytical consideration of the extra-mural decorations of St. Mark 's .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 31]: The world buzzed along after its own fashion , not disturbing him , and his absorptions permitted only a faint consciousness of the despair of his relatives regarding his mind .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 55]: Arrived at middle-age , and a little more , he found himself alone in the world -LRB- though , for that matter , he had always been alone and never of the world -RRB- , and there was plenty of money for him with various bankers who appeared to know about looking after it .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 68]: Returning to the town of his nativity after sundry expeditions in Syria -- upon which he had been accompanied by dusky gentlemen with pickaxes and curly , long-barrelled muskets -- he met , and was married by , a lady who was ambitious , and who saw in him -LRB- probably as a fulfilment of another Kismetic punishment -RRB- a power of learning and a destined success .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 45]: Not long after the birth of their only child , a daughter , he was `` called to fill the chair '' of archaeology in a newly founded university ; one of the kind which a State and a millionaire combine to purchase ready-made .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 66]: This one was handed down off the shelf in a more or less chaotic condition , and for a period of years betrayed considerable doubt as to its own intentions , undecided whether they were classical or technical ; and in the settlement of that doubt lay the secret of the past of the one man in Plattville so unhappy as to possess a past .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 66]: From that settlement and his own preceding action resulted his downfall , his disgrace with his wife 's relatives , the loss of his wife , the rage , surprise , and anguish of her sister , Martha , and Martha 's husband , Henry Sherwood , and the separation from his little daughter , which was by far to him the hardest to bear .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 65]: For Fisbee , in his own way , and without consulting anybody -- it never occurred to him , and he was supposed often to forget that he had a wife and child -- had informally turned over to the university all the money which the banks had kindly taken care of , and had given it to equip an expedition which never expedited .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 60]: A new president of the institution was installed ; he talked to the trustees ; they met , and elected to become modern and practical and technical ; they abolished the course in fine arts , which abolished Fisbee 's connection with them , and they then employed his money to erect a building for the mechanical engineering department .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 6]: Fisbee was left with nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 29]: His wife and her kinsfolk exhibited no brilliancy in holding a totally irresponsible man down to responsibilities , and they made a tragedy of a not surprising fiasco .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 25]: Mrs. Fisbee had lived in her ambitions , and she died of heartbreak over the discovery of what manner of man she had married .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 13]: But , before she died , she wisely provided for her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 11]: Fisbee told Parker the story after his own queer fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 61]: `` You see , Mr. Parker , '' he said , as they sat together in the dust and litter of the `` Herald '' office , on Sunday afternoon , `` you see , I admit that my sister-in-law has always withheld her approbation from me , and possibly her disapproval is well founded -- I shall say probably .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 35]: My wife had also a considerable sum , and this she turned over to me at the time of our marriage , though I had no wish regarding it one way or the other .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 69]: When I gave my money to the university with which I had the honor to be connected , I added to it the fund I had received from her , as I was the recipient of a comfortable salary as a lecturer in the institution and had no fear of not living well , and I was greatly interested in providing that the expedition should be perfectly equipped .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 83]: Expeditions of the magnitude of that which I had planned are expensive , I should , perhaps , inform you , and this one was to carry on investigations regarding several important points , very elaborately ; and I am still convinced it would have settled conclusively many vital questions concerning the derivation of the Babylonian column , as : whether the lotus column may be without prejudice said to -- but at the present moment I will not enter into that .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 37]: I fear I had no great experience in money matters , for the transaction had been almost entirely verbal , and there was nothing to bind the trustees to carry out my plans for the expedition .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 11]: They were very sympathetic , but what could they do ?
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 6]: they begged leave to inquire .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 35]: Such an institution can not give back money once donated , and it was clearly out of character for a school of technology and engineering to send savants to investigate the lotus column . ''
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 11]: `` I see , '' Mr. Parker observed , genially .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 34]: He listened with the most ingratiating attention , knowing that he had a rich sensation to set before Plattville as a dish before a king , for Fisbee 's was no confidential communication .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 56]: The old man might have told a part of his history long ago , but it had never occurred to him to talk about his affairs -- things had a habit of not occurring to Fisbee -- and the efforts of the gossips to draw him out always passed over his serene and absent head .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 36]: `` It was a blow to my wife , '' the old man continued , sadly , `` and I can not deny that her reproaches were as vehement as her disappointment was sincere . ''
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 30]: He hurried over this portion of his narrative with a vaguely troubled look , but the intelligent Parker read poor Mrs. Fisbee 's state of mind between the sentences .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 19]: `` She never seemed to regard me in the same light again , '' the archaeologist went on .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 39]: `` She did not conceal from me that she was surprised and that she could not look upon me as a practical man ; indeed , I may say , she appeared to regard me with marked antipathy .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 49]: She sent for her sister , and begged her to take our daughter and keep her from me , as she did not consider me practical enough-I will substitute for her more embittered expressions -- to provide for a child and instruct it in the world 's ways .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 63]: My sister-in-law , who was childless , consented to adopt the little one , on the conditions that I renounced all claim , and that the child legally assumed her name and should be in all respects as her own daughter , and that I consented to see her but once a year , in Rouen , at my brother-in-law 's home .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 66]: `` I should have refused , but I -- my wife -- that is -- she was -- very pressing -- in her last hours , and they all seemed to feel that I ought to make amends -- all except the little girl herself , I should say , for she possessed , even as an infant , an exceptional affection for her father .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 51]: I had nothing ; my salary was gone , and I was discomfited by the combined actions of the trustees and my relatives , so -- I -- I gave her up to them , and my wife passed away in a more cheerful frame of mind , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 5]: That is about all .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 33]: One of the instructors obtained the position here for me , which I -- I finally -- lost , and I went to See the little girl every New Year 's day .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 47]: This year she declared her intention of visiting _ me _ , but she was persuaded by friends who were conversant with the circumstances to stay with them , where I could be with her almost as much as at my apartment at Mr. Tibbs 's .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 32]: She had long since declared her intention of some day returning to live with me , and when she came she was strenuous in insisting that the day had come . ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 26]: The old man 's voice broke suddenly as he observed : `` She has -- a very -- beautiful -- character , Mr. Parker . ''
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 7]: The foreman nodded with warm confirmation .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 7]: `` I believe you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 15]: Yes , sir ; I saw her , and I guess she looks it .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 56]: You take that kind of a lady usually , and catch her in a crowd like the one show-day , and she ca n't help doing the Grand Duchess , giving the tenants a treat -- but not her ; she did n't seem to _ separate _ herself from 'em , some way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 13]: `` She is a fine lady , '' said the other simply .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 20]: `` I did not accept her renunciation , though I acknowledge I forbade it with a very poignant envy .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 57]: I could not be the cause of her giving up for my sake her state of ease and luxury -- for my relatives are more than well-to-do , and they made it plain she must choose between them and me , with the design , I think , of making it more difficult to choose me .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 39]: And , also , it seemed to me , as it did to her , that she owed them nearly everything , but she declared I had lived alone so long that she owed me everything , also .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 12]: She is a -- beautiful -- character , Mr. Parker . ''
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 50]: `` Well , '' said Parker , after a pause , `` the town will be upside down over this ; and folks will be mighty glad to have it explained about your being out there so much , and at the deepo , and all this and that .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 50]: Everybody in the place has been wondering what in -- that is -- '' he finished in some confusion -- `` that is -- what I started to say was that it wo n't be so bad as it might be , having a lady in the office here .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 21]: I do n't cuss to speak of , and Ross can lay off on his till the boss comes back .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 8]: Besides , it 's our only chance .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 18]: If she ca n't make the ` Herald ' hum , we go to the wall . ''
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 10]: The old man did not seem to hear him .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 38]: `` I forbade the renunciation she wished to make for my sake , '' he said , gently , `` but I accept it now for the sake of our stricken friend -- for Mr. Harkless . ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 14]: `` And for the Carlow ` Herald , ' '' completed the foreman .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 30]: The morning following that upon which this conversation took place , the two gentlemen stood together on the station platform , awaiting the arrival of the express from Rouen .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 81]: It was a wet gray day ; the wide country lay dripping under formless wraps of thin mist , and a warm , drizzling rain blackened the weather-beaten shingles of the station ; made clear-reflecting puddles of the unevenly worn planks of the platform , and dampened the packing-cases that never went anywhere too thoroughly for occupation by the station-lounger , and ran in a little crystal stream off Fisbee 's brown cotton umbrella and down Mr. Parker 's back .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 69]: The ` bus driver , Mr. Bennett , the proprietor of two attendant `` cut-unders , '' and three or four other worthies whom business , or the lack of it , called to that locality , availed themselves of the shelter of the waiting-room , but the gentlemen of the `` Herald '' were too agitated to be confined , save by the limits of the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 32]: They had reached the station half an hour before train time , and consumed the interval in pacing the platform under the cotton umbrella , addressing each other only in monosyllables .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 25]: Those in the waiting-room gossiped eagerly , and for the thousandth time , about the late events , and the tremendous news concerning Fisbee .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 39]: Judd Bennett looked out through the rainy doorway at the latter with reverence and a fine pride of townsmanship , declaring it to be his belief that Fisbee and Parker were waiting for her at the present moment .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 35]: It was a lady , and a bird of a lady , too , else why should Cale Parker be wearing a coat , and be otherwise dooded and fixed up beyond any wedding ?
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 10]: Judd and his friends were somewhat excited over Parker .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 121]: Fisbee was clad in his best shabby black , which lent an air of state to the occasion , but Mr. Parker -- Caleb Parker , whose heart , during his five years of residence in Plattville , had been steel-proof against all the feminine blandishments of the town , whose long , lank face had shown beneath as long , and lanker , locks of proverbially uncombed hair , he who had for weeks conspicuously affected a single , string-patched suspender , who never , even upon the Sabbath day , wore a collar or blacked his shoes -- what aesthetic leaven had entered his soul that he donned not a coat alone but also a waistcoat with checks ?
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 14]: -- and , more than _ that _ , a gleaming celluloid collar ?
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 12]: -- and , more than that , a brilliant blue tie ?
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 19]: What had this iron youth to do with a rising excitement at train time and brilliant blue ties ?
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 72]: Also , it might have been inquired if this parade of fashion had no connection with the simultaneous action of Mr. Ross Schofield ; for Ross was at this hour engaged in decorating the battered chairs in the `` Herald '' editorial room with blue satin ribbon , the purchase of which at the Dry Goods Emporium had been directed by a sudden inspiration of his superior of the composing force .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 60]: It was Ross 's intention to garnish each chair with an elaborately tied bow , but , as he was no sailor and understood only the intricacies of a hard-knot , he confined himself to that species of ornamentation , leaving , however , very long ends of ribbon hanging down after the manner of the pendants of rosettes .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 22]: It scarcely needs the statement that his labors were in honor of the new editor-in-chief of the Carlow `` Herald . ''
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 28]: The advent and the purposes of this personage were , as yet , known certainly to only those of the `` Herald '' and to the Briscoes .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 69]: It had been arranged , however , that Minnie and her father were not to come to the station , for the journalistic crisis was immoderately pressing ; the `` Herald '' was to appear on the morrow , and the new editor wished to plunge directly , and without the briefest distraction , into the paper 's difficulties , now accumulated into a veritable sea of troubles .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 29]: The editor was to be delivered to the Briscoes at eventide and returned by them again at dewy morn ; and this was to be the daily programme .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 56]: It had been further -- and most earnestly -- stipulated that when the wounded proprietor of the ailing journal should be informed of the addition to his forces , he was not to know , or to have the slenderest hint of , the sex or identity of the person in charge during his absence .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 32]: It was inevitable that Plattville -LRB- already gaping to the uttermost -RRB- would buzz voluminously over it before night , but Judge Briscoe volunteered to prevent the buzz from reaching Rouen .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 32]: He undertook to interview whatever citizens should visit Harkless , or write to him -- when his illness permitted visits and letters -- and forewarn them of the incumbent 's desires .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 44]: To-day , the judge stayed at home with his daughter , who trilled about the house for happiness , and , in their place , the `` Herald '' deputation of two had repaired to the station to act as a reception committee .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 61]: Far away the whistle of the express was heard , muffled to sweetness in the damp , and the drivers , whip in hand , came out upon the platform , and the loafers issued , also , to stand under the eaves and lean their backs against the drier boards , preparing to eye the travellers with languid raillery .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 52]: Mr. Parker , very nervous himself , felt the old man 's elbow trembling against his own as the great engine , reeking in the mist , and sending great clouds of white vapor up to the sky , rushed by them , and came to a standstill beyond the platform .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 31]: Fisbee and the foreman made haste to the nearest vestibule , and were gazing blankly at its barred approaches when they heard a tremulous laugh behind them and an exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 11]: `` Upstairs and downstairs and in my lady 's chamber !
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 7]: Just behind you , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 64]: Turning quickly , Parker beheld a blushing and smiling little vision , a vision with light-brown hair , a vision enveloped in a light-brown rain-cloak and with brown gloves , from which the handles of a big brown travelling bag were let fall , as the vision disappeared under the cotton umbrella , while the smitten Judd Bennett reeled gasping against the station .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 31]: `` Dearest , '' the girl cried to the old man , `` you were looking for me between the devil and deep sea -- the parlor-car and the smoker .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 23]: I 've given up cigars , and I 've begun to study economy , so I did n't come on either . ''
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 85]: There was but this one passenger for Plattville ; two enormous trunks thundered out of the baggage car onto the truck , and it was the work of no more than a minute for Judd to hale them to the top of the omnibus -LRB- he well wished to wear them next his heart , but their dimensions forbade the thought -RRB- , and immediately he cracked his whip and drove off furiously through the mud to deposit his freight at the Briscoes ' .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 56]: Parker , Mr. Fisbee , and the new editor-in-chief set forth , directly after , in one of the waiting cut-unders , the foreman in front with the driver , and holding the big brown bag on his knees in much the same manner he would have held an alien , yet respected , infant .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 48]: A RESCUE The drizzle and mist blew in under the top of the cut-under as they drove rapidly into town , and bright little drops sparkled on the fair hair above the new editor 's forehead and on the long lashes above the new editor 's cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 25]: She shook these transient gems off lightly , as she paused in the doorway of the office at the top of the rickety stairway .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 54]: Mr. Schofield had just added the last touch to his decorations and managed to slide into his coat as the party came up the stairs , and now , perspiring , proud , embarrassed , he assumed an attitude at once deprecatory of his endeavors and pointedly expectant of commendation for the results .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 64]: -LRB- He was a modest youth and a conscious ; after his first sight of her , as she stood in the doorway , it was several days before he could lift his distressed eyes under her glance , or , indeed , dare to avail himself of more than a hasty and fluttering stare at her when her back was turned . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 17]: As she entered the room , he sidled along the wall and laughed sheepishly at nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 28]: Every chair in the room was ornamented with one of his blue rosettes , tied carefully -LRB- and firmly -RRB- to the middle slat of each chair-back .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 80]: There had been several yards of ribbon left over , and there was a hard knot of glossy satin on each of the ink-stands and on the door-knobs ; a blue band , passing around the stovepipe , imparted an antique rakishness suggestive of the charioteer ; and a number of streamers , suspended from a hook in the ceiling , encouraged a supposition that the employees of the `` Herald '' contemplated the intricate festivities of May Day .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 36]: It needed no genius to infer that these garnitures had not embellished the editorial chamber during Mr. Harkless 's activity , but , on the contrary , had been put in place that very morning .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 50]: Mr. Fisbee had not known of the decorations , and , as his glance fell upon them , a faint look of pain passed over his brow ; but the girl examined the room with a dancing eye , and there were both tears and laughter in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 5]: `` How beautiful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 5]: `` How beautiful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 11]: She crossed the room and gave her hand to Ross .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 10]: `` It is Mr. Schofield , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 5]: The ribbons are delightful .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 13]: I did n't know Mr. Harkless 's room was so pretty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 47]: Ross looked out of the window and laughed as he took her hand -LRB- which he shook with a long up and down motion -RRB- , but he was set at better ease by her apparent unrecognition of the fact that the decorations were for her .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 26]: `` Oh , it ai n't much , I reckon , '' he replied , and continued to look out of the window and laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 19]: She went to the desk and removed her gloves and laid her rain-coat over a chair near by .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 9]: `` Is this Mr. Harkless 's chair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 66]: she asked , and , Fisbee answering that it was , she looked gravely at it for a moment , passed her hand gently over the back of it , and then , throwing the rain-cloak over another chair , said cheerily : `` Do you know , I think the first thing for us to do will be to dust everything very carefully . ''
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 15]: `` You remember I was confident she would know precisely where to begin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 14]: was Fisbee 's earnest whisper in the willing ear of the long foreman .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 11]: `` Not an instant 's indecision , was there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 6]: `` No , siree ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 49]: replied the other ; and , as he went down to the press-room to hunt for a feather-duster which he thought might be found there , he collared Bud Tipworthy , who , not admitted to the conclave of his superiors , was whistling on the rainy stairway .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 13]: `` You hustle and find that dust brush we used to have .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 6]: Bud , '' said Parker .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 22]: And presently , as they rummaged in the nooks and crannies about the machinery , he melted to his small assistant .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 16]: `` The paper is saved , Buddie -- saved by an angel in light brown .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 11]: You can tell it by the look of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 4]: `` Gee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 3]: said Bud .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 11]: Mr. Schofield had come , blushing , to join them .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 15]: `` Say , Cale , did you notice the color of her eyes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 8]: `` Yes ; they 're gray . ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 29]: `` I thought so , too , show day , and at Kedge Halloway 's lecture ; but , say , Cale , they 're kind of changeable .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 16]: When she come in upstairs with you and Fisbee , they were jest as blue !
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 10]: -- near matched the color of our ribbons . ''
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 4]: `` Gee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 4]: repeated Mr. Tipworthy .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 57]: When the editorial chamber had been made so Beat that it almost glowed -- though it could never be expected to shine as did Fisbee and Caleb Parker and Ross Schofield that morning -- the editor took her seat at the desk and looked over the few items the gentlemen had already compiled for her perusal .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 37]: Mr. Parker explained many technicalities peculiar to the Carlow `` Herald , '' translated some phrases of the printing-room , and enabled her to grasp the amount of matter needed to fill the morrow 's issue .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 21]: When Parker finished , the three incompetents sat watching the little figure with the expression of hopeful and trusting terriers .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 18]: She knit her brow for a second -- but she did not betray an instant 's indecision .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 16]: `` I think we should have regular market reports , '' she announced , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 9]: `` I am sure Mr. Harkless would approve .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 8]: Do n't you think he would ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 5]: She turned to Parker .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 5]: `` Market reports ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 4]: Mr. Fisbee exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 24]: `` I should never have thought of market reports , nor , do I imagine , would either of my -- my associates .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 11]: A woman to conceive the idea of market reports ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 4]: The editor blushed .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 41]: `` Why , who would , dear , if not a woman , or a speculator , and I 'm not a speculator ; and neither are you , and that 's the reason you did n't think of them .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 88]: So , Mr. Parker , as there is so much pressure , and if you do n't mind continuing to act as reporter as well as compositor until after to-morrow , and if it is n't too wet -- you must take an umbrella -- would it be too much bother if you went around to all the shops -- _ stores _ , I mean -- to all the grocers ' , and the butchers ' , and that leather place we passed , the tannery ?
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 26]: -- and if there 's one of those places where they bring cows , would it be too much to ask you to stop there ?
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 13]: -- and at the flour-mill , if it is n't too far ?
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 7]: -- and at the dry-goods store ?
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 27]: And you must take a blank-book and sharpened pencil , And will you price everything , please , and jot down how much things are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 30]: Orders received , the impetuous Parker was departing on the instant , when she stopped him with a little cry : `` But you have n't any umbrella ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 27]: And she forced her own , a slender wand , upon him ; it bore a cunningly wrought handle and its fabric was of glistening silk .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 75]: The foreman , unable to decline it , thanked her awkwardly , and , as she turned to speak to Fisbee , bolted out of the door and ran down the steps without unfolding the umbrella ; and as he made for Mr. Martin 's emporium , he buttoned it securely under his long `` Prince Albert , '' determined that not a drop of water should touch and ruin so delicate a thing .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 18]: Thus he carried it , triumphantly dry , through the course of his reportings of that day .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 14]: When he had gone the editor laid her hand on Fisbee 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 41]: `` Dear , '' she said , `` do you think you would take cold if you went over to the hotel and made a note of all the arrivals for the last week -- and the departures , too ?
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 17]: I noticed that Mr. Harkless always filled two or three -- sticks , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 17]: -- with them and things about them , and somehow it ` read ' very nicely .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 37]: You must ask the landlord all about them ; and , if there are n't any , we can take up the same amount of space lamenting the dull times , just as he used to .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 24]: You see I 've read the ` Herald ' faithfully ; is n't it a good thing I always subscribed for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 17]: She patted Fisbee 's cheek , and laughed gaily into his mild , vague old eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 15]: `` It wo n't be this scramble to ` fill up ' much longer .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 19]: I have plans , gentlemen , '' she cried , `` and before long we will print news .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 34]: And we must buy ` plate matter ' instead of ` patent insides ' ; and I had a talk with the Associated Press people in Rouen -- but that 's for afterwhile .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 12]: And I went to the hospital this morning before I left .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 84]: They would n't let me see him again , but they told me all about him , and he 's better ; and I got Tom to go to the jail -- he was so mystified , he does n't know what I wanted it for -- and he saw some of those beasts , and I can do a column of description besides an editorial about them , and I will be fierce enough to suit Carlow , you may believe that .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 34]: And I 've been talking to Senator Burns -- that is , listening to Senator Burns , which is much stupider -- and I think I can do an article on national politics .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 20]: I 'm not very well up on local issues yet , but I -- '' She broke off suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 13]: I think we can get out to-morrow 's number without any trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 28]: By the time you get back from the hotel , father , I 'll have half my stuff written -- ` written up , ' I mean .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 23]: Take your big umbrella and go , dear , and please ask at the express office if my typewriter has come . ''
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 31]: She laughed again with sheer delight , like a child , and ran to the corner and got the cotton umbrella and placed it in the old man 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 15]: As he reached the door , she called after him : `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 32]: and went to him and knelt before him , and , with the humblest , proudest grace in the world , turned up his trousers to keep them from the mud .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 21]: Ross Schofield had never considered Mr. Fisbee a particularly sacred sort of person , but he did from that moment .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 52]: The old man made some timid protest , at his daughter 's action , But she answered ; `` The great ladies used to buckle the Chevalier Bayard 's spurs for him , and you 're a great deal nicer than the Chev -- _ You have n't any rubbers _ !
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 14]: I do n't believe _ any _ of you have any rubbers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 37]: And not until both Fisbee and Mr. Schofield had promised to purchase overshoes at once , and in the meantime not to step in any puddles , would she let her father depart upon his errand .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 15]: He crossed the Square with the strangest , jauntiest step ever seen in Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 14]: Solomon Tibbs had a warm argument with Miss Selina as to his identity .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 31]: Miss Selina maintaining that the figure under the big umbrella -- only the legs and coat-tails were visible to them -- was that of a stranger , probably an Englishman .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 19]: In the `` Herald '' office the editor turned , smiling , to the paper 's remaining vassal .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 26]: `` Mr. Schofield , I heard some talk in Rouen of an oil company that had been formed to prospect for kerosene in Carlow County .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 8]: Do you know anything about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 41]: Ross , surfeited with honor , terror , and possessed by a sweet distress at finding himself tete-a-tete with the lady , looked at the wall and replied : `` Oh , it 's that Eph Watts 's foolishness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 15]: `` Do you know if they have begun to dig for it yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 3]: said Ross .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 9]: `` Have they begun the diggings yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 9]: `` No , ma'am ; I think not .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 12]: They 've got a contrapshun fixed up about three mile south .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 20]: I do n't reckon they 've begun yet , hardly ; they 're gittin ' the machinery in place .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 51]: I heard Eph say they 'd begin to bore -- _ dig _ , I mean , ma'am , I meant to say dig -- '' He stopped , utterly confused and unhappy ; and she understood his manly purpose , and knew him for a gentleman whom she liked .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 49]: `` You must n't be too much surprised , '' she said ; `` but in spite of my ignorance about such things , I mean to devote a good deal of space to the oil company ; it may come to be of great importance to Carlow .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 61]: We wo n't go into it in to-morrow 's paper , beyond an item or so ; but do you think you could possibly find Mr. Watts and ask him for some information as to their progress , and if it would be too much trouble for him to call here some time to-morrow afternoon , or the day after ?
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 12]: I want him to give me an interview if he will .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 13]: Tell him , please , he will very greatly oblige us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 16]: `` Oh , he 'll come all right , '' answered her companion , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 14]: `` I 'll take Tibbs 's buggy and go down there right off .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 13]: Eph wo n't lose no time gittin ' _ here _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 24]: And with this encouraging assurance he was flying forth , when he , like the others , was detained by her solicitous care .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 6]: She was a born mother .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 38]: He protested that in the buggy he would be perfectly sheltered ; besides , there was n't another umbrella about the place ; he _ liked _ to get wet , anyway ; had always loved rain .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 42]: The end of it was that he went away in a sort of tremor , wearing her rain-cloak over his shoulders , which garment , as it covered its owner completely when she wore it , hung almost to his knees .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 112]: He darted around a corner ; and there , breathing deeply , tenderly removed it ; then , borrowing paper and cord at a neighboring store , wrapped it neatly , and stole back to the printing-office on the ground floor of the `` Herald '' building , and left the package in charge of Bud Tipworthy , mysteriously charging him to care for it as for his own life , and not to open it , but if the lady so much as set one foot out of doors before his return , to hand it to her with the message : `` He borrowed another off J. Hankins . ''
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 21]: Left alone , the lady went to the desk and stood for a time looking gravely at Harkless 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 42]: She touched it gently , as she had touched it once before that morning , and then she spoke to it as if he were sitting there , and as she would not have spoken , had he been sitting there .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 11]: `` You did n't want gratitude , did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 7]: she whispered , with sad lips .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 32]: Soon she smiled at the blue ribbons , patted the chair gaily on the back , and , seizing upon pencil and pad , dashed into her work with rare energy .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 37]: She bent low over the desk , her pencil moving rapidly , and , except for a momentary interruption from Mr. Tipworthy , she seemed not to pause for breath ; certainly her pencil did not .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 72]: She had covered many sheets when her father returned ; and , as he came in softly , not to disturb her , she was so deeply engrossed she did not hear him ; nor did she look up when Parker entered , but pursued the formulation of her fast-flying ideas with the same single purpose and abandon ; so the two men sat and waited while their chieftainess wrote absorbedly .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 23]: At last she glanced up and made a little startled exclamation at seeing them there , and then gave them cheery greeting .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 63]: Each placed several scribbled sheets before her , and she , having first assured herself that Fisbee had bought his overshoes , and having expressed a fear that Mr. Parker had found her umbrella too small , as he looked damp -LRB- and indeed he _ was _ damp -RRB- , cried praises on their notes and offered the reporters great applause .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 8]: `` It is all so splendid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 9]: `` How could you do it so quickly ?
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 7]: And in the rain , too !
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 7]: This is exactly what we need .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 23]: I 've done most of the things I mentioned , I think , and made a draught of some plans for hereafter .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 23]: And about that man 's coming out for Congress , I must tell you it is my greatest hope that he will .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 58]: We can let it go until he does , and then -- But does n't it seem to you that it would be a good notion for the ` Herald ' to have a woman 's page -- ` For Feminine Readers , ' or , ` Of Interest to Women ' -- once a week ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 7]: `` A woman 's page ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 3]: exclaimed Fisbee .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 16]: `` I could never have thought of that , could you , Mr. Parker ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 36]: `` And now , '' she continued , `` I think that when I 've gone over what I 've written and beat it into better shape I shall be ready for something to eat .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 9]: Is n't it almost time for luncheon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 18]: This simple , and surely natural , inquiry had a singular , devastating effect upon her hearers .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 12]: They looked upon each other with fallen jaws and complete stupefaction .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 18]: The old man began to grow pale , and Parker glared about him with a wild eye .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 75]: Fortunately , the editor was too busy at her work to notice their agitation ; she applied herself to making alterations here and there , sometimes frowningly crossing out whole lines and even paragraphs , sometimes smiling and beaming at the writing ; and , as she bent earnestly over the paper , against the darkness of the rainy day , the glamour about her fair hair was like a light in the room .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 34]: To the minds of her two companions , this lustre was a gentle but unbearable accusation ; and each dreaded the moment when her Work should be finished , with a great dread .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 25]: There was a small `` store-room '' adjoining the office , and presently Mr. Parker , sweating at the brow , walked in there .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 36]: The old man gave him a look of despairing reproach , but in a moment the foreman 's voice was heard : `` Oh , Mr. Fisbee , can you step here a second ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 6]: `` Yes , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 21]: was Fisbee 's reply ; and he fled guiltily into the `` store-room , '' and Parker closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 14]: They stood knee-deep in the clutter and lumber , facing each other abjectly .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 18]: `` Well , we 're both done , anyway , Mr. Fisbee , '' remarked the foreman .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 19]: `` Indubitably , Mr. Parker , '' the old man answered ; `` it is too true . ''
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 13]: `` Never to think a blame thing about dinner for her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 5]: Parker continued , remorsefully .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 19]: `` And her a lady that can turn off copy like a rotary snowplough in a Dakota blizzard !
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 14]: Did you see the sheets she 's piled up on that desk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 23]: `` There is no cafe -- nothing -- in Plattville , that could prepare food worthy of her , '' groaned Fisbee .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 4]: `` Nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 8]: `` And we never thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 6]: Never made a single arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 19]: Never struck us she did n't live on keeping us dry and being good , I guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 12]: `` How can I go there and tell her that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 4]: `` Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 17]: `` She can not go to the hotel -- '' `` Well , I guess not !
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 7]: It ai n't fit for her .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 11]: Lum 's table is hard enough on a strong man .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 13]: Landis does n't know a good cake from a Fiji missionary pudding .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 21]: I do n't expect pie is much her style , and , besides , the Palace Hotel pies -- well !
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 40]: -- the boss was a mighty uncomplaining man , but I used to notice his articles on field drainage got kind of sour and low-spirited when they 'd been having more than the regular allowance of pie for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 26]: She ca n't go there anyway ; it 's no use ; it 's after two o'clock , and the dining-room shuts off at one .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 11]: I wonder what kind of cake she likes best . ''
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 12]: `` I do n't know , '' said the perplexed Fisbee .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 31]: `` If we ask her -- '' `` If we could sort of get it out of her diplomatically , we could telegraph to Rouen for a good one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 7]: said the other , brightening up .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 8]: `` You try it , Mr. Parker .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 40]: I fear I have not much skill in diplomacy , but if you -- '' The compositor 's mouth drooped at the corners , and he interrupted gloomily : `` But it would n't get here till to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 8]: `` True ; it would not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 14]: They fell into a despondent reverie , with their chins in their bosoms .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 35]: There came a cheerful voice from the next room , but to them it brought no cheer ; in their ears it sounded weak from the need of food and faint with piteous reproach .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 14]: `` Father , are n't you coming to have luncheon with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 11]: `` Mr. Parker , what are we to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 7]: whispered the old man , hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 13]: `` Is it too far to take her to Briscoes ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 6]: `` In the rain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 10]: `` Take her with you to Tibbs 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 21]: `` Their noon meal is long since over ; and their larder is not -- is not -- extensive . ''
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 4]: `` Father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 4]: called the girl .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 13]: She was stirring ; they could hear her moving about the room .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 26]: `` You 've got to go in and tell her , '' said the foreman , desperately , and together they stumbled into the room .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 39]: A small table at one end of it was laid with a snowy cloth and there was a fragrance of tea , and , amidst various dainties , one caught a glimpse of cold chicken and lettuce leaves .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 40]: Fisbee stopped , dumfounded , but the foreman , after stammeringly declining an invitation to partake , alleging that his own meal awaited , sped down to the printing-room , and seized upon Bud Tipworthy with a heavy hand .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 12]: `` Where did all that come from , up there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 5]: `` Leave go me !
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 9]: _ What _ ` all that ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 24]: `` All that tea and chicken and salad and wafers -- all kinds of things ; sardines , for all I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 12]: `` They come in Briscoes ' buckboard while you was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 20]: Briscoes sent 'em in a basket ; I took 'em up and she set the basket under the table .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 12]: You 'd seen it if you 'd ` a ' looked .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 6]: _ Quit _ that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 25]: And it was unjust to cuff the perfectly innocent and mystified Bud , and worse not to tell him what the punishment was for .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 78]: Before the day was over , system had been introduced , and the `` Herald '' was running on it : and all that warm , rainy afternoon , the editor and Fisbee worked in the editorial rooms , Parker and Bud and Mr. Schofield -LRB- after his return with the items and a courteous message from Ephraim Watts -RRB- bent over the forms downstairs , and Uncle Xenophon was cleaning the store-room and scrubbing the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 70]: An extraordinary number of errands took the various members of the printing force up to see the editor-in-chief , literally to see the editor-in-chief ; it was hard to believe that the presence had not flown -- hard to keep believing , without the repeated testimony of sight , that the dingy room upstairs was actually the setting for their jewel ; and a jewel they swore she was .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 30]: The printers came down chuckling and gurgling after each interview ; it was partly the thought that she belonged to the `` Herald , '' _ their _ paper .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 24]: Once Ross , as he cut down one of the temporarily distended advertisements , looked up and caught the foreman giggling to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 15]: `` What in the name of common-sense you laughin ' at , Cale ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 10]: `` What are _ you _ laughing at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 4]: rejoined the other .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 5]: `` I dunno ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 35]: The day wore on , wet and dreary outside , but all within the `` Herald 's '' bosom was snug and busy and murmurous with the healthy thrum of life and prosperity renewed .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 63]: Toward six o'clock , system accomplished , the new guiding-spirit was deliberating on a policy as Harkless would conceive a policy , were he there , when Minnie Briscoe ran joyously up the stairs , plunged into the room , waterproofed and radiant , and caught her friend in her eager arms , and put an end to policy for that day .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 37]: But policy and labor did not end at twilight every day ; there were evenings , as in the time of Harkless , when lamps shone from the upper windows of the `` Herald '' building .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 18]: For the little editor worked hard , and sometimes she worked late ; she always worked early .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 23]: She made some mistakes at first , and one or two blunders which she took more seriously than any one else did .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 18]: But she found a remedy for all such results of her inexperience , and she developed experience .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 42]: She set at her task with the energy of her youthfulness and no limit to her ambition , and she felt that Harkless had prepared the way for a wide expansion of the paper 's interests ; wider than he knew .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 57]: She had a belief that there were possibilities for a country newspaper , and she brought a fresh point of view to operate in a situation where Harkless had fallen , perhaps , too much in the rut ; and she watched every chance with a keen eye and looked ahead of her with clear foresight .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 38]: What she waited and yearned for and dreaded , was the time when a copy of the new `` Herald '' should be placed in the trembling hands of the man who lay in the Rouen hospital .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 40]: Then , she felt , if he , unaware of her identity , should place everything in her hands unreservedly , that would be a tribute to her work -- and how hard she would labor to deserve it !
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 31]: After a time , she began to realize that , as his representative and the editor of the `` Herald , '' she had become a factor in district politics .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 21]: It took her breath -- but with a gasp of delight , for there was something she wanted to do .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 12]: Above all , she brought a light heart to her work .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 34]: One evening in the latter part of that first week of the new regime , Parker perceived Bud Tipworthy standing in the doorway of the printing-room , beckoning him silently to come without .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter , Buddie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 3]: `` Listen .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 9]: She 's singin ' over her work . ''
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 4]: Parker stepped outside .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 90]: On the pavement , people had stopped to listen ; they stood in the shadow , looking up with parted lips at the open , lighted Windows , whence came a clear , soft , reaching voice , lifted in song ; now it swelled louder , unconsciously ; now its volume was more slender and it melted liquidly into the night ; again , it trembled and rose and dwelt in the ear , strong and pure ; and , hearing it , you sighed with unknown longings .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 9]: It was the `` Angels ' Serenade . ''
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 60]: Bud Tipworthy 's sister , Cynthia , was with him , and Parker saw that she turned from the window and that she was crying , quietly ; she put her hand on the boy 's shoulder and patted it with a forlorn gesture which , to the foreman 's eye , was as graceful as it was sad .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 56]: He moved closer to Bud and his big hand fell on Cynthia 's brother 's other shoulder , as he realized that red hair could look pretty sometimes ; and he wondered why the editor 's singing made Cynthy cry ; and at the same time he decided to be mighty good to Bud henceforth .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 51]: The spell of night and song was on him ; that and something more ; for it is a strange , inexplicable fact that the most practical chief ever known to the `` Herald '' had a singularly sentimental influence over her subordinates , from the moment of her arrival .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 150]: Under Harkless 's domination there had been no more steadfast bachelors in Carlow than Ross Schofield and Caleb Parker , and , like timorous youths in a graveyard , daring and mocking the ghosts in order to assuage their own fears , they had so jibed and jeered at the married state that there was talk of urging the minister to preach at them ; but now let it be recorded that at the moment Caleb laid his hand on Bud 's other shoulder , his associate , Mr. Schofield , was enjoying a walk in the far end of town with a widow , and it is not to be doubted that Mr. Tipworthy 's heart , also , was no longer in his possession , though , as it was after eight o'clock , the damsel of his desire had probably long since retired to her couch .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 27]: For some faint light on the cause of these spells , we must turn to a comment made by the invaluable Mr. Martin some time afterward .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 77]: Referring to the lady to whose voice he was now listening in silence -LRB- which shows how great the enthralling of her voice was -RRB- , he said : `` When you saw her , or heard her , or managed to be around , any , where she was , why , if you could n't git up no hope of marryin ' _ her _ , you wanted to marry _ somebody _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 23]: Mr. Lige Willetts , riding idly by , drew rein in front of the lighted windows , and listened with the others .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 21]: Presently he leaned from his horse and whispered to a man near him : `` I know that song . ''
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 5]: `` Do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 4]: whispered the other .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 18]: `` Yes ; he and I heard her sing it , the night he was shot . ''
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 4]: `` So ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 6]: It 's by Beethoven . ''
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 5]: `` Is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 11]: `` It 's a seraphic song , '' continued Lige .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 22]: exclaimed his friend ; then , shaking his head , he sighed : `` Well , it 's mighty sweet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 52]: The song was suddenly woven into laughter in the unseen chamber , and the lights in the windows went out , and a small lady and a tall lady and a thin old man , all three laughing and talking happily , came down and drove off in the Briscoe buckboard .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 88]: The little crowd dispersed quietly ; Lige Willetts plucked to his horse and cantered away to overtake the buckboard ; William Todd took his courage between his teeth , and , the song ringing in his ears , made a desperate resolve to call upon Miss Bardlock that evening , in spite of its being a week day , and Caleb Parker gently and stammeringly asked Cynthia if she would wait till he shut up the shop , and let him walk home with her and Bud .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 21]: Soon the Square was quiet as before , and there was naught but peace under the big stars of July .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 34]: That day the news had come that Harkless , after weeks of alternate improvement and relapse , hazardously lingering in the borderland of shadows , had passed the crucial point and was convalescent .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 5]: His recovery was assured .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 30]: But from their first word of him , from the message that he was found and was alive , none of the people of Carlow had really doubted it .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 14]: They are simple country people , and they know that God is good .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 173]: NETTLES Two men who have been comrades and classmates at the Alma Mater of John Harkless and Tom Meredith ; two who have belonged to the same dub and roomed in the same entry ; who have pooled their clothes and money in a common stock for either to draw on ; who have shared the fortunes of athletic war , triumphing together , sometimes with an intense triumphancy ; two men who were once boys getting hazed together , hazing in no unkindly fashion in their turn , always helping each other to stuff brains the night before an examination and to blow away the suffocating statistics like foam the night after ; singing , wrestling , dancing , laughing , succeeding together , through the four kindest years of life ; two such brave companions , meeting in the after years , are touchingly tender and caressive of each other , but the tenderness takes the shy , United States form of insulting epithets , and the caresses are blows .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 41]: If John Harkless had been in health , uninjured and prosperous , Tom Meredith could no more have thrown himself on his knees beside him and called him `` old friend '' than he could have danced on the slack-wire .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 26]: One day they thought the patient sleeping ; the nurse fanned him softly , and Meredith had stolen in and was sitting by the cot .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 83]: One of Harkless 's eyes had been freed of the bandage , and , when Tom came in , it was closed ; but , by and by , Meredith became aware that the unbandaged eye had opened and that it was suffused with a pathetic moisture ; yet it twinkled with a comprehending light , and John knew that it was his old Tom Meredith who was sitting beside him , with the air of having sat there very often before .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 54]: But this bald , middle-aged young man , not without elegance , yet a prosperous burgher for all that -- was _ this _ the slim , rollicking broth of a boy whose thick auburn hair used to make one streak of flame as he spun around the bases on a home run ?
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 16]: Without doubt it was the stupendous fact , wrought by the alchemy of seven years .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 95]: For , though seven years be a mere breath in the memories of the old , it is a long transfiguration to him whose first youth is passing , and who finds unsolicited additions accruing to some parts of his being and strange deprivations in others , and upon whom the unhappy realization begins to be borne in , that his is no particular case , and that he of all the world is not to be spared , but , like his forbears , must inevitably wriggle in the disguising crucible of time .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 42]: And , though men accept it with apparently patient humor , the first realization that people do grow old , and that they do it before they have had time to be young , is apt to come like a shock .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 32]: Perhaps not even in the interminable months of Carlow had Harkless realized the length of seven years so keenly as he did when he beheld his old friend at his bedside .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 20]: How men may be warped apart in seven years , especially in the seven years between twenty-three and thirty !
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 36]: At the latter age you may return to the inseparable of seven years before and speak not the same language ; you find no heartiness to carry on with each other after half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 14]: Not so these classmates , who had known each other to the bone .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 31]: Ah , yes , it was Tom Meredith , the same lad , in spite of his masquerade of flesh ; and Helen was right : Tom had not forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 8]: `` It 's the old horse-thief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 5]: John murmured , tremulously .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 13]: `` You go plumb to thunder , '' answered Meredith between gulps .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 45]: When he was well enough , they had long talks ; and at other times Harkless lay by the window , and breathed deep of the fresh air , while Meredith attended to his correspondence for him , and read the papers to him .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 42]: But there was one phenomenon of literature the convalescent insisted upon observing for himself , and which he went over again and again , to the detriment of his single unswathed eye , and this was the Carlow `` Herald . ''
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 105]: The first letter he had read to him was one from Fisbee stating that the crippled forces left in charge had found themselves almost distraught in their efforts to carry on the paper -LRB- as their chief might conclude for himself on perusal of the issues of the first fortnight of his absence -RRB- , and they had made bold to avail themselves of the services of a young relative of the writer 's from a distant city -- a capable journalist , who had no other employment for the present , and who had accepted the responsibilities of the `` Herald '' temporarily .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 29]: There followed a note from Parker , announcing that Mr. Fisbee 's relative was a bird , and was the kind to make the `` Herald '' hum .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 23]: They hoped Mr. Harkless would approve of their bespeaking the new hand on the sheet ; the paper must have suspended otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 49]: Harkless , almost overcome by his surprise that Fisbee possessed a relative , dictated a hearty and grateful indorsement of their action , and , soon after , received a typewritten rejoinder , somewhat complicated in the reading , because of the numerous type errors and their corrections .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 29]: The missive was signed `` H. Fisbee , '' in a strapping masculine hand that suggested six feet of enterprise and muscle spattering ink on its shirt sleeves .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 87]: John groaned and fretted over the writhings of the `` Herald 's '' headless fortnight , but , perusing the issues produced under the domination of H. Fisbee , he started now and then , and chuckled at some shrewd felicities of management , or stared , puzzled , over an oddity , but came to a feeling of vast relief ; and , when the question of H. Fisbee 's salary was settled and the tenancy assured , he sank into a repose of mind .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 64]: H. Fisbee might be an eccentric fellow , but he knew his business , and , apparently , he knew something of other business as well , for he wrote at length concerning the Carlow oil fields , urging Harkless to take shares in Mr. Watts 's company while the stock was very low , two wells having been sunk without satisfactory results .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 18]: H. Fisbee explained with exceeding technicality his reasons for believing that the third well would strike oil .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 19]: But with his ease of mind regarding the `` Herald , '' Harkless found himself possessed by apathy .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 10]: He fretted no longer to get back to Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 45]: With the prospect of return it seemed an emptiness glared at him from hollow sockets , and the thought of the dreary routine he must follow when he went back gave him the same faint nausea he had felt the evening after the circus .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 35]: And , though it was partly the long sweat of anguish which had benumbed him , his apathy was pierced , at times , by a bodily horror of the scene of his struggle .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 43]: At night he faced the grotesque masks of the Cross-Roads men and the brutal odds again ; over and over he felt the blows , and clapped his hand to where the close fire of Bob Skillett 's pistol burned his body .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 18]: And , except for the release from pain , he rejoiced less and less in his recovery .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 54]: He remembered a tedious sickness of his childhood and how beautiful he had thought the world , when he began to get well , how electric the open air blowing in at the window , how green the smile of earth , and how glorious to live and see the open day again .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 8]: He had none of that feeling now .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 18]: No pretty vision came again near his bed , and he beheld his convalescence as a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 19]: He had come to a jumping-off place in his life -- why had they not let him jump ?
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 16]: What was there left but the weary plod , plod , and dust of years ?
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 38]: He could have gone back to Carlow in better spirit if it had not been for the few dazzling hours of companionship which had transformed it to a paradise , but , gone , left a desert .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 32]: She , by the sight of her , had made him wish to live , and now , that he saw her no more , she made him wish to die .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 26]: How little she had cared for him , since she told him she did not care , when he had not meant to ask her .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 39]: He was weary , and at last he longed to find the line of least resistance and follow it ; he had done hard things for a long time , but now he wanted to do something easy .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 87]: Under the new genius -- who was already urging that the paper should be made a daily -- the `` Herald '' could get along without him ; and the `` White-Caps '' would bother Carlow no longer ; and he thought that Kedge Halloway , an honest man , if a dull one , was sure to be renominated for Congress at the district convention which was to meet at Plattville in September -- these were his responsibilities , and they did not fret him .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 5]: Everything was all right .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 44]: There was only one thought which thrilled him : his impression that she had come to the hospital to see him was not a delusion ; she had really been there -- as a humane , Christian person , he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 20]: One day he told Meredith of his vision , and Tom explained that it was no conjuration of fever .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 15]: `` But I thought she 'd gone abroad , '' said Harkless , staring .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 11]: `` They had planned to , '' answered his friend .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 9]: `` They gave it up for some reason .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 17]: Uncle Henry decided that he was n't strong enough for the trip , or something . ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 11]: `` Then -- is she -- is she here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 10]: `` No ; Helen is never here in summer .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 24]: When she came back from Plattville , she went north , somewhere , to join people she had promised , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 17]: Meredith had as yet no inkling or suspicion that his adopted cousin had returned to Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 20]: What he told Harkless was what his aunt had told him , and he accepted it as the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 50]: Mrs. Sherwood -LRB- for she was both Mr. and Mrs. Sherwood -RRB- had always considered Fisbee an enigmatic rascal , and she regarded Helen 's defection to him in the light of a family scandal to be hushed up , as well as a scalding pain to be borne .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 26]: Some day the unkind girl-errant would `` return to her wisdom and her duty '' ; meanwhile , the less known about it the better .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 47]: Meredith talked very little to Harkless of his cousin , beyond lightly commenting on the pleasure and oddity of their meeting , and telling him of her friendly anxiety about his recovery ; he said she had perfect confidence from the first that he would recover .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 97]: Harkless had said a word or two in his delirium and a word or two out of it , and these , with once a sudden brow of suffering , and a difference Meredith felt in Helen 's manner when they stood together by the sick man 's bedside , had given the young man a strong impression , partly intuitive , that in spite of the short time the two had known each other , something had happened between them at Plattville , and he ventured a guess which was not far from the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 35]: Altogether , the thing was fairly plain -- a sad lover is not so hard to read -- and Meredith was sorry , for they were the two people he liked best on earth .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 75]: The young man carried his gay presence daily to the hospital , where Harkless now lay in a pleasant room of his own , and he tried to keep his friend cheery , which was an easy matter on the surface , for the journalist turned ever a mask of jokes upon him ; but it was not hard for one who liked him as Meredith did to see through to the melancholy underneath .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 38]: After his one reference to Helen , John was entirely silent of her , and Meredith came to feel that both would be embarrassed if occasion should rise and even her name again be mentioned between them .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 52]: He did not speak of his family connection with Mr. Fisbee to the invalid , for , although the connection was distant , the old man was , in a way , the family skeleton , and Meredith had a strong sense of the decency of reserve in such a matter .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 57]: There was one thing Fisbee 's shame had made the old man unable not to suppress when he told Parker his story ; the wraith of a torrid palate had pursued him from his youth , and the days of drink and despair from which Harkless had saved him were not the first in his life .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 30]: Meredith wondered as much as did Harkless where Fisbee had picked up the journalistic `` young relative '' who signed his extremely business-like missives in such a thundering hand .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 57]: It was evident that the old man was grateful to his patron , but it did not occur to Meredith that Fisbee 's daughter might have an even stronger sense of gratitude , one so strong that she could give all her young strength to work for the man who had been good to her father .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 26]: There came a day in August when Meredith took the convalescent from the hospital in a victoria , and installed him in his own home .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 32]: Harkless 's clothes hung on his big frame limply ; however , there was a drift of light in his eyes as they drove slowly through the pretty streets of Rouen .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 22]: The bandages and splints and drugs and swathings were all gone now , and his sole task was to gather strength .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 41]: The thin face was sallow no longer ; it was the color of evening shadows ; indeed he lay among the cushions seemingly no more than a gaunt shadow of the late afternoon , looking old and gray and weary .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 16]: They rolled along abusing each other , John sometimes gratefully threatening his friend with violence .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 49]: The victoria passed a stone house with wide lawns and an inhospitable air of wealth and importunate rank ; over the sward two peacocks swung , ambulating like caravals in a green sea ; and one expected a fine lady to come smiling and glittering from the door .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 21]: Oddly enough , though he had never seen the place before , it struck Harkless with a sense of familiarity .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 6]: `` Who lives there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 4]: he asked abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 5]: `` Who lives there ?
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 4]: On the left ?
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 36]: Why that -- that is the Sherwood place , '' Meredith answered , in a tone which sounded as if he were not quite sure of it , but inclined to think his information correct .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 5]: Harkless relapsed into silence .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 24]: Meredith 's home was a few blocks further up the same street ; a capacious house in the Western fashion of the Seventies .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 36]: In front , on the lawn , there was a fountain with a leaping play of water ; maples and shrubbery were everywhere ; and here and there stood a stiff sentinel of Lombardy poplar .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 58]: It was all cool and incongruous and comfortable ; and , on the porch , sheltered from publicity by a multitude of palms and flowering plants , a white-jacketed negro appeared with a noble smile and a more important tray , whereon tinkled bedewed glasses and a crystal pitcher , against whose sides the ice clinked sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 7]: There was a complement of straws .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 17]: When they had helped him to an easy chair on the porch , Harkless whistled luxuriously .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 7]: `` Ah , my bachelor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 10]: he exclaimed , as he selected a straw . ''
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 8]: ` Who would fardels bear ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 4]: rejoined Mr. Meredith .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 41]: Then came to the other a recollection of an auburn-haired ball player on whom the third strike had once been called while his eyes wandered tenderly to the grandstand , where the prettiest girl of that commencement week was sitting .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 11]: `` Have you forgot the ` Indian Princess ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 12]: `` You 're a dull old person , '' Tom laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 13]: `` Have n't you discovered that 't is they who forget us ?
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 6]: And why should n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 7]: Do _ we _ remember well ?
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 14]: -- anybody except just us two , I mean , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 11]: `` I 've a notion we do , sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 14]: The other set his glass on the tray , and lit his cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 8]: `` Yes ; when we 're unsuccessful .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 7]: Then I think we do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 7]: `` That may be true . ''
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 6]: `` Of course it is .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 25]: If a lady wishes to make an impression on me that is worth making , let her let me make none on her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 10]: `` You think it is always our vanity ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 16]: `` Analyze it as your revered Thomas does and you shall reach the same conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 46]: Let a girl reject you and -- '' Meredith broke off , cursing himself inwardly , and , rising , cried gaily : `` What profiteth it a man if he gain the whole wisdom in regard to women and loseth not his own heart ?
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 34]: And neither of us is lacking a heart -- though it may be ; one ca n't tell , one 's self ; one has to find out about that from some girl .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 26]: At least , I 'm rather sure of mine ; it 's difficult to give a tobacco-heart away ; it 's drugged on the market .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 24]: I 'm going to bring out the dogs ; I 'm spending the summer at home just to give them daily exercise . ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 33]: This explanation of his continued presence in Rouen struck John as quite as plausible as Meredith 's more seriously alleged reasons for not joining his mother and sister , at Winter Harbor .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 25]: -LRB- He possessed a mother , and , as he explained , he had also sisters to satiety , in point of numbers . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 34]: Harkless knew that Tom had stayed to look after him ; and he thought there never was so poor a peg as himself whereon to hang the warm mantle of such a friendship .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 50]: He knew that other mantles of affection and kindliness hung on that self-same peg , for he had been moved by the letters and visits from Carlow people , and he had heard the story of their descent upon the hospital , and of the march on the Cross-Roads .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 79]: Many a good fellow , too , had come to see him during his better days -- from Judge Briscoe , openly tender and solicitous , to the embarrassed William Todd , who fiddled at his hat and explained that , being as he was in town on business -LRB- a palpable fiction -RRB- he thought he 'd look in to see if `` they was any word would wish to be sent down to our city . ''
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 31]: The good will the sick man had from every one touched him , and made him feel unworthy , and he could see nothing he had done to deserve it .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 38]: Mr. Meredith could -LRB- and would not -- openly , at least -RRB- have explained to him that it made not a great deal of difference what he did ; it was what people thought he was .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 18]: His host helped him upstairs after dinner , and showed him the room prepared for his occupancy .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 28]: Harkless sank , sighing with weakness , into a deep chair , and Meredith went to a window-seat and stretched himself out for a smoke and chat .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 27]: `` Does n't it beat your time , '' he said , cheerily , `` to think of what 's become of all the old boys ?
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 17]: They turn up so differently from what we expected , when they turn up at all .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 26]: We sized them up all right so far as character goes , I fancy , but we could n't size up the chances of life .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 18]: Take poor old Pickle Haines : who 'd have dreamed Pickle would shoot himself over a bankruptcy ?
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 22]: I dare say that was n't all of it -- might have been cherchez la femme , do n't you think ?
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 12]: What do you make of Pickle 's case , John ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 5]: There was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 38]: Harkless 's chair was directly in front of the mantel-piece , and upon the carved wooden shelf , amongst tobacco-jars and little curios , cotillion favors and the like , there were scattered a number of photographs .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 44]: One of these was that of a girl who looked straight out at you from a filigree frame ; there was hardly a corner of the room where you could have stood without her clear , serious eyes seeming to rest upon yours .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 6]: `` Cherchez la femme ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 6]: repeated Tom , puffing unconsciously .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 19]: `` Pickle was a good fellow , but he had the deuce of an eye for a girl .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 21]: Do you remember -- '' He stopped short , and saw the man and the photograph looking at each other .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 28]: Too late , he unhappily remembered that he had meant , and forgotten , to take that photograph out of the room before he brought Harkless in .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 39]: Now he would have to leave it ; and Helen Sherwood was not the sort of girl , even in a flat presentment , to be continually thrown in the face of a man who had lost her .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 23]: And it always went hard , Tom reflected , with men who stretched vain hands to Helen , only to lose her .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 17]: But there was one , he thought , whose outstretched hands might not prove so vain .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 10]: Why could n't she have cared for John Harkless ?
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 13]: Deuce take the girl , did she want to marry an emperor ?
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 14]: He looked at Harkless , and pitied him with an almost tearful compassion .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 31]: A feverish color dwelt in the convalescent 's cheek ; the apathy that had dulled his eyes was there no longer ; instead , they burned with a steady fire .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 10]: The image returned his unwavering gaze with inscrutable kindness .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 13]: `` You heard that Pickle shot himself , did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 3]: Meredith asked .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 11]: There was no answer ; John did not hear him .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 15]: `` Do you know that poor Jeny Haines killed himself , last March ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 4]: Tom said sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 8]: There was only silence in the room .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 25]: Meredith got up and rattled some tongs in the empty fireplace , but the other did not move or notice him in any way .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 22]: Meredith set the tongs down , and went quietly out of the room , leaving his friend to that mysterious interview .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 29]: When he came back , after a remorseful cigarette in the yard , Harkless was still sitting , motionless , looking up at the photograph above the mantel-piece .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 45]: They drove abroad every day , at first in the victoria , and , as Harkless 's strength began to come back , in a knock-about cart of Tom 's , a light trail of blue smoke floating back wherever the two friends passed .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 54]: And though the country editor grew stronger in the pleasant , open city , Meredith felt that his apathy and listlessness only deepened , and he suspected that , in Harkless 's own room , where the photograph reigned , the languor departed for the time , making way for a destructive fire .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 29]: Judge Briscoe , paying a second visit to Rouen , told Tom , in an aside , that their friend did not seem to be the same man .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 14]: He was altered and aged beyond belief , the old gentleman whispered sadly .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 28]: Meredith decided that his guest needed enlivening -- something to take him out of himself ; he must be stirred up to rub against people once more .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 171]: And therefore , one night he made a little company for him : two or three apparently betrothed very young couples , for whom it was rather dull , after they had looked their fill of Harkless -LRB- it appeared that every one was curious to see him -RRB- ; and three or four married young couples , for whom the entertainment seemed rather diverting in an absent-minded way -LRB- they had the air of remembering that they had forgotten the baby -RRB- ; and three or four bachelors , who seemed contented in any place where they were allowed to smoke ; and one widower , whose manner indicated that any occasion whatever was gay enough for him ; and four or five young women , who -LRB- Meredith explained to John -RRB- were of their host 's age , and had been `` left over '' out of the set he grew up with ; and for these the modest party took on a hilarious and chipper character .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 28]: `` It is these girls that have let the men go by because they did n't see any good enough ; they 're the jolly souls ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 7]: the one widower remarked , confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 22]: `` They 've been at it a long while , and they know how , and they 're light-hearted as robins .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 11]: They have more fun than people who have responsibilities . ''
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 56]: All of these lively demoiselles fluttered about Harkless with commiserative pleasantries , and , in spite of his protestations , made him recline in the biggest and deepest chair on the porch , where they surfeited him with kindness and grouped about him with extra cushions and tenderness for a man who had been injured .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 36]: No one mentioned the fact that he had been hurt ; it was not spoken of , though they wished mightily he would tell them the story they had read luridly in the public prints .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 7]: They were very good to him .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 28]: One of them , in particular , a handsome , dark , kind-eyed girl , constituted herself at once his cicerone in Rouen gossip and his waiting-maid .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 57]: She sat by him , and saw that his needs -LRB- and his not-needs , too -RRB- were supplied and oversupplied ; she could not let him move , and anticipated his least wish , though he was now amply able to help himself ; and she fanned him as if he were a dying consumptive .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 51]: They sat on Meredith 's big porch in the late twilight and ate a substantial refection , and when this was finished , a buzz of nonsense rose from all quarters , except the remote corners where the youthful affianced ones had defensively stationed themselves behind a rampart of plants .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 20]: They , having eaten , had naught to do , and were only waiting a decent hour for departure .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 55]: Laughing voices passed up and down the street , and mingled with the rhythmic plashing of Meredith 's fountain , and , beyond the shrubberies and fence , one caught glimpses of the light dresses of women moving to and fro , and of people sitting bareheaded on neighboring lawns to enjoy the twilight .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 98]: Now and then would pass , with pipe and dog , the beflanneled figure of an undergraduate , home for vacation , or a trio of youths in knickerbockers , or a band of young girls , or both trio and band together ; and from a cross street , near by , came the calls and laughter of romping children and the pulsating whirr of a lawn-mower : This sound Harkless remarked as a ceaseless accompaniment to life in Rouen ; even in the middle of the night there was always some unfortunate , cutting grass .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 38]: When the daylight was all gone , and the stars had crept out , strolling negroes patrolled the sidewalks , thrumming mandolins and guitars , and others came and went , singing , making the night Venetian .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 25]: The untrained , joyous voices , chording eerily in their sweet , racial minors , came on the air , sometimes from far away .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 32]: But there swung out a chorus from fresh , Aryan throats , in the house south of Meredith 's : `` Where , oh where , are the grave old Seniors ?
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 12]: Safe , now , in the wide , wide world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 10]: `` Does n't that thrill you , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 11]: said Meredith , joining the group about Harkless 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 12]: `` Those fellows are Sophomores , class of heaven knows what .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 9]: _ Are n't _ you feeling a fossil .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 4]: Father Abraham ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 40]: A banjo chattered on the lawn to the north , and soon a mixed chorus of girls and boys sang from there : `` O , ` Arriet , I 'm waiting , waiting alone out ` ere . ''
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 16]: Then a piano across the street sounded the dearthful harmonies of Chopin 's Funeral March .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 30]: `` You may take your choice , '' remarked Meredith , flicking a spark over the rail in the ash of his cigar , `` Chopping or Chevalier . ''
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 17]: `` Chopin , my friend , '' said the lady who had attached herself to Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 14]: She tapped Tom 's shoulder with her fan and smiled , graciously corrective .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 13]: `` Thank you , Miss Hinsdale , '' he answered , gratefully .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 30]: `` And as I , perhaps , had better say , since otherwise there might be a pause and I am the host , we have a wide selection .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 75]: In addition to what is provided at present , I predict that within the next ten minutes a talented girl who lives two doors south will favor us with the Pilgrims ' Chorus , piano arrangement , break down in the middle , and drift , into ` Rastus on Parade , ' while a double quartette of middle-aged colored gentlemen under our Jim will make choral offering in our own back yard . ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 17]: `` My dear Tom , '' exclaimed Miss Hinsdale , `` you forget Wetherford Swift ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 23]: `` I could stand it all , '' put forth the widower , `` if it were not for Wetherford Swift . ''
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 9]: `` When is Miss Sherwood coming home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 6]: asked one of the ladies .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 14]: `` Why does she stay away and leave him to his sufferings ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 11]: `` Us to his sufferings , '' substituted a bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 9]: `` He is just beginning ; listen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 35]: Through all the other sounds of music , there penetrated from an unseen source , a sawish , scraped , vibration of catgut , pathetic , insistent , painstaking , and painful beyond belief .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 14]: `` He is in a terrible way to-night , '' said the widower .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 4]: Miss Hinsdale laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 5]: `` Worse every night .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 13]: The violinist is young Wetherford Swift , '' she explained to Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 16]: `` He is very much in love , and it does n't agree with him .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 60]: He used to be such a pleasant boy , but last winter he went quite mad over Helen Sherwood , Mr. Meredith 's cousin , our beauty , you know -- I am so sorry she is n't here ; you 'd be interested in meeting her , I 'm sure -- and he took up the violin . ''
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 20]: `` It is said that his family took up chloroform at the same time , '' said the widower .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 32]: `` His music is a barometer , '' continued the lady , `` and by it the neighborhood nightly observes whether Miss Sherwood has been nice to him or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 11]: `` It is always exceedingly plaintive , '' explained another .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 9]: `` Except once , '' rejoined Miss Hinsdale .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 17]: `` He played jigs when she came home from somewhere or other , in June . ''
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 21]: `` It was Tosti 's ` Let Me Die , ' the very next evening , '' remarked the widower .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 22]: `` Ah , '' said one of the bachelors , `` but his joy was sadder for us than his misery .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 5]: Hear him now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 25]: `` I think he means it for ` What 's this dull town to me , ' '' observed another , with some rancor .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 31]: `` I would willingly make the town sufficiently exciting for him -- '' `` If there were not an ordinance against the hurling of missiles , '' finished the widower .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 73]: The piano executing the funeral march ceased to execute , discomfited by the persistent and overpowering violin ; the banjo and the coster-songs were given over ; even the collegians ' music was defeated ; and the neighborhood was forced to listen to the dauntless fiddle , but not without protest , for there came an indignant , spoken chorus from the quarter whence the college songs had issued : `` Ya-a-ay !
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 6]: Wetherford , put it away !
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 8]: _ She 'll _ come back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 5]: The violin played on .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 20]: `` We all know each other here , you see , Mr. Harkless , '' Miss Hinsdale smiled benignantly .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 14]: `` They did n't bother Mr. Wetherford Swift , '' said the widower .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 5]: `` Not that time .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 5]: Do you hear him ?
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 13]: -- ` Could ye come back to me , Douglas ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 24]: `` Oh , but it is n't absence that is killing him and his friends , '' cried one of the young women .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 7]: `` It is Brainard Macauley . ''
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 17]: `` That is a mistake , '' said Tom Meredith , as easily as he could .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 8]: `` There goes Jim 's double quartette .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 37]: Listen , and you will hear them try to -- '' But the lady who had mentioned Brainard Macauley cried indignantly : `` You try to change the subject the moment it threatens to be interesting .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 53]: They were together everywhere until the day she went away ; they danced and ` sat out ' together through the whole of one country-club party ; they drove every afternoon ; they took long walks , and he was at the Sherwoods ' every evening of her last week in town .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 8]: ` That is a mistake ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 16]: `` I 'm afraid it looks rather bleak for Wetherford , '' said the widower .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 39]: `` I went up to the ` Journal ' office on business , one day , and there sat Miss Sherwood in Macauley 's inner temple , chatting with a reporter , while Brainard finished some work . ''
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 25]: `` Helen is eccentric , '' said the former speaker , `` but she 's not quite that eccentric , unless they were engaged .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 14]: It is well understood that they will announce it in the fall . ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 36]: Miss Hinsdale kindly explained to Harkless that Brainard Macauley was the editor of the `` Rouen Morning Journal '' -- `` a very distinguished young man , not over twenty-eight , and perfectly wonderful . ''
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 50]: Already a power to be accounted with in national politics , he was `` really a tremendous success , '' and sure to go far ; `` one of those delicate-looking men , who are yet so strong you know they wo n't let the lightning hurt you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 39]: It really looked as if Helen Sherwood -LRB- whom Harkless really ought to meet -RRB- had actually been caught in the toils at tet , those toils wherein so many luckless youths had lain enmeshed for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 15]: He must meet Mr. Macauley , too , the most interesting man in Rouen .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 25]: After her little portrait of him , did n't Mr. Harkless agree that it looked really pretty dull for Miss Sherwood 's other lovers ?
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 11]: Mr. Harkless smiled , and agreed that it did indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 22]: She felt a thrill of compassion for him , and her subsequent description of the pathos of his smile was luminous .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 34]: She said it was natural that a man who had been through so much suffering from those horrible `` White-Cappers '' should have a smile that struck into your heart like a knife .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 34]: Despite all that Meredith could do , and after his notorious effort to shift the subject he could do very little , the light prattle ran on about Helen Sherwood and Brainard Macauley .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 58]: Tom abused himself for his wild notion of cheering his visitor with these people who had no talk , and who , if they drifted out of commonplace froth , had no medium to float them unless they sailed the currents , of local personality , and he mentally upbraided them for a set of gossiping ninnies .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 47]: They conducted a conversation -LRB- if it could be dignified by a name -RRB- of which no stranger could possibly partake , and which , by a hideous coincidence , was making his friend writhe , figuratively speaking , for Harkless sat like a fixed shadow .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 29]: He uttered scarcely a word the whole evening , though Meredith knew that his guests would talk about him enthusiastically , the next day , none the less .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 34]: The journalist 's silence was enforced by the topics ; but what expression and manner the light allowed them to see was friendly and receptive , as though he listened to brilliant suggestions .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 67]: He had a nice courtesy , and Miss Hinsdale felt continually that she was cleverer than usual this evening , and no one took his silence to be churlish , though they all innocently wondered why he did not talk more ; however , it was probable that a man who had been so interestingly and terribly shot would be rather silent for a time afterward .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 20]: That night , when Harkless had gone to bed Meredith sat late by his own window calling himself names .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 28]: He became aware of a rhomboidal patch of yellow light on a wall of foliage without , and saw that it came from his friend 's window .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 11]: After dubious consideration , he knocked softly on the door .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 4]: `` Come . ''
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 4]: He went in .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 12]: Harkless was in bed , and laughed faintly as Meredith entered .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 19]: `` I -- I 'm fearing you 'll have to let me settle your gas bill , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 11]: I 'm not like I used to be , quite .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 17]: I find -- since -- since that business , I ca n't sleep without a light .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 12]: I rather get the -- the horrors in the dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 27]: Incoherently , Meredith made a compassionate exclamation and turned to go , and , as he left the room , his eye fell upon the mantel-piece .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 24]: The position of the photographs had been altered , and the picture of the girl who looked straight out at you was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 19]: The mere rim of it was visible behind the image of an old gentleman with a sardonic mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 15]: An hour later , Tom came back , and spoke through the closed door .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 15]: `` Boy , do n't you think you can get to sleep now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 5]: `` Yes , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 5]: It 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 5]: You get to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 5]: Nothing troubles me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 29]: Meredith spent the next day in great tribulation and perplexity ; he felt that something had to be done , but what to do he did not know .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 34]: He still believed that a `` stirring-up '' was what Harkless needed -- not the species of `` stirring-up '' that had taken place last night , but a diversion which would divert .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 18]: As they sat at dinner , a suggestion came to him and he determined to follow it .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 44]: He was called to the telephone , and a voice strange to his ear murmured in a tone of polite deference : `` A lady wishes to know if Mr. Meredith and his visitor intend being present at the country-club this evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 42]: He had received the same inquiry from Miss Hinsdale on her departure the previous evening , and had answered vaguely ; hence he now rejoined : `` You are quite an expert ventriloquist , but you do not deceive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 14]: `` I beg your pardon , sir , '' creaked the small articulation .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 11]: `` This is Miss Hinsdale , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 14]: The lady wishes to know if you will kindly answer her question . ''
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 7]: `` Tell her , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 12]: He hung up the receiver , and returned to the table .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 12]: `` Some of Clara Hinsdale 's play , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 32]: `` You made a devastating impression on her , boy ; you were wise enough not to talk any , and she foolishly thought you were as interesting as you looked .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 9]: We 're going out to a country-club dance .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 29]: It 's given for the devotees who stay here all summer and swear Rouen is always cool ; and nobody dances but me and the very young ones .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 18]: It wo n't be so bad ; you can smoke anywhere , and there are little tables .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 5]: We 'll go . ''
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 23]: `` Thank you , Tom , you 're so good to think of it , but -- '' `` But what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 7]: `` Would you mind going alone ?
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 18]: I find it very pleasant sitting on your veranda , or I 'll get a book . ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 16]: `` Very well , if you do n't want to go , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 17]: I have n't had a dance for three months and I 'm still addicted to it .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 15]: But of course -- '' `` I think I 'd like to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 24]: Harkless acquiesced at once , with a cheerful voice and a lifeless eye , and the good Tom felt unaccountably mean in persisting .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 42]: They drove out into the country through mists like lakes , and found themselves part of a procession of twinkling carriage-lights , and cigar sparks shining above open vehicles , winding along the levels like a canoe fete on the water .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 28]: In the entrance hall of the club-house they encountered Miss Hinsdale , very handsome , large , and dark , elaborately beaming and bending toward them warmly .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 9]: `` Who do you think is here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 4]: `` Gomez ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 3]: ventured Meredith .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 5]: `` Helen Sherwood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 17]: `` Go and present Mr. Harkless before Brainard Macauley takes her away to some corner . ''
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 70]: PRETTY MARQUISE The two friends walked through a sort of opera-bouffe to find her ; music playing , a swaying crowd , bright lights , bright eyes , pretty women , a glimpse of dancers footing it over a polished floor in a room beyond -- a hundred colors flashing and changing , as the groups shifted , before the eye could take in the composition of the picture .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 26]: A sudden thrill of exhilaration rioted in John 's pulses , and he trembled like a child before the gay disclosure of a Christmas tree .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 19]: Meredith swore to himself that he would not have known him for the man of five minutes agone .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 44]: Two small , bright red spots glowed in his cheeks ; he held himself erect with head thrown back and shoulders squared , and the idolizing Tom thought he looked as a king ought to look at the acme of power and dominion .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 44]: Miss Hinsdale 's word in the hallway was the geniuses touch : a bent , gray man of years -- a word -- and behold the Great John Harkless , the youth of elder days ripened to his prime of wisdom and strength !
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 11]: People made way for them and whispered as they passed .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 53]: It had been years since John Harkless had been in the midst of a crowd of butterfly people ; everything seemed unreal , or like a ball in a play ; presently the curtain would fall and close the lights and laughter from his view , leaving only the echo of music .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 110]: It was like a kaleidoscope for color : the bouquets of crimson or white or pink or purple ; the profusion of pretty dresses , the brilliant , tender fabrics , and the handsome , foreshortened faces thrown back over white shoulders in laughter ; glossy raven hair and fair tresses moving in quick salutations ; and the whole gay shimmer of festal tints and rich artificialities set off against the brave green of out-doors , for the walls were solidly adorned with forest branches , with , here and there amongst them , a blood-red droop of beech leaves , stabbed in autumn 's first skirmish with summer .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 28]: The night was cool , and the air full of flower smells , while harp , violin , and ` cello sent a waltz-throb through it all .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 40]: They looked rapidly through several rooms and failed to find her indoors , and they went outside , not exchanging a word , and though Harkless was a little lame , Tom barely kept up with his long stride .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 19]: On the verandas there were fairy lamps and colored incandescents over little tables , where people sat chatting .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 5]: She was not there .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 29]: Beyond was a terrace , where a myriad of Oriental lanterns outlined themselves clearly in fantastically shaped planes of scarlet and orange and green against the blue darkness .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 26]: Many couples and groups were scattered over the terrace , and the young men paused on the steps , looking swiftly from group to group .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 5]: She was not there .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 20]: `` We have n't looked in the dancing-room , '' said Tom , looking at his companion rather sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 9]: John turned quickly and they reentered the house .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 36]: He had parted from her in the blackness of storm with only the flicker of lightning to show her to him , but it was in a blaze of lights that he saw her again .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 28]: The dance was just ended , and she stood in a wide doorway , half surrounded by pretty girls and young men , who were greeting her .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 8]: He had one full look at her .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 29]: She was leaning to them all , her arms full of flowers , and she seemed the radiant centre of all the light and gaiety of the place .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 37]: Even Meredith stopped short and exclaimed upon her ; for one never got used to her ; and he remembered that whenever he saw her after absence the sense of her beauty rushed over him anew .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 25]: And he believed the feeling on this occasion was keener than ever before , for she was prettier than he had ever seen her .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 5]: `` No wonder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 9]: he cried ; but Harkless did not understand .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 41]: As they pressed forward , Meredith perceived that they were only two more radii of a circle of youths , sprung from every direction as the waltz ended , bearing down upon the common focus to secure the next dance .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 11]: Harkless saw nothing but that she stood there before him .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 34]: He feared a little that every one might notice how he was trembling , and he was glad of the many voices that kept them from hearing his heart knock against his ribs .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 52]: She saw him coming toward her , and nodded to him pleasantly , in just the fashion in which she was bowing to half a dozen others , and at that a pang of hot pain went through him like an arrow -- an arrow poisoned with cordial , casual friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 31]: She extended her hand to him and gave him a smile that chilled him -- it , was so conventionally courteous and poised so nicely in the manner of society .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 36]: He went hot and cold fast enough then , for not less pleasantly in that manner did she exclaim : `` I am very glad to see you , Mr. Harkless , so extremely glad !
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 10]: And so delighted to find you looking strong again !
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 10]: Do tell me about all our friends in Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 13]: I should like to have a little chat with you some time .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 12]: So good of you to find me in this melee . ''
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 12]: And with that she turned from the poor fellow to Meredith .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 6]: `` How do you do .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 3]: Cousin Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 10]: I 've saved the next dance for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 22]: Then she distributed words here and there and everywhere , amongst the circle about her -- pretty Marquise with a vengeance !
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 27]: `` No , Mr. Swift , I shall not make a card ; you must come at the beginning of a dance if you want one .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 12]: I can not promise the next ; it is quite impossible .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 12]: No , I did not go as far north as Mackinac .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 8]: How do you do , Mr. Burlingame ?
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 30]: -- Yes , quite an age ; -- no , not the next , I am afraid ; nor the next ; -- I 'm not keeping a card .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 6]: Good evening , Mr. Baird .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 6]: No , not the next .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 10]: Oh , _ thank _ you , Miss Hinsdale !
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 16]: -- No , Mr. Swift , it is quite impossible -- I 'm so sorry .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 12]: Cousin , the music is commencing ; this is ours . ''
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 73]: As she took Meredith 's arm , she handed her flowers to a gentleman beside her with the slightest glance at the recipient ; and the gesture and look made her partner heartsick for his friend ; it was so easy and natural and with the air of habit , and had so much of the manner with which a woman hands things to a man who partakes of her inner confidences .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 17]: Tom knew that Harkless divined the gesture , as well as the identity of the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 14]: They started away , but she paused , and turned to the latter .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 10]: `` Mr. Macauley , you must meet Mr. Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 33]: We leave him in your care , and you must see that he meets all the pretty girls -- you are used to being nice to distinguished strangers , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 30]: Tom put his arm about her , and whirled her away , and Harkless felt as if a soft hand had dealt him blow after blow in the face .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 52]: Was this lady of little baffling forms and small cold graces the girl who had been his kind comrade , the girl who stood with him by the blue tent-pole , she who had run to him to save his life , she who walked at his side along the pike ?
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 11]: The contrast of these homely scenes made him laugh grimly .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 49]: Was this she who had wept before him -- was it she who had been redolent of kindness so fragrantly natural and true -- was it she who said she `` loved all these people very much , in spite of having known them only two days '' ?
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 9]: He cried out upon himself for a fool .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 22]: What was he in her eyes but a man who had needed to be told that she did not love him !
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 23]: Had he not better -- and more courteously to her -- have avoided the meeting which was necessarily an embarrassment to her ?
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 43]: But no ; he must rush like a Mohawk till he found her and forced her to rebuff him , to veil her kindness in little manners , to remind him that he put himself in the character of a rejected importunate .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 30]: She had punished him enough , perhaps a little too cruelly enough , in leaving him with the man to whom she handed bouquets as a matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 27]: And this man was one whose success had long been a trumpet at his ear , blaring loudly of his own failure in the same career .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 29]: It had been several years since he first heard of the young editor of the Rouen `` Journal , '' and nowadays almost everybody knew about Brainard Macauley .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 87]: Outwardly , he was of no unusual type : an American of affairs ; slight , easy , yet alert ; relaxed , yet sharp ; neat , regular , strong ; a quizzical eye , a business chin , an ambitious head with soft , straight hair outlining a square brow ; and though he was `` of a type , '' he was not commonplace , and one knew at once that he would make a rattling fight to arrive where he was going .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 18]: It appeared that he had heard of Harkless , as well as the Carlow editor of him .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 72]: They had a few moments of shop , and he talked to Harkless as a brother craftsman , without the offense of graciousness , and spoke of his pleasure in the meeting and of his relief at Harkless 's recovery , for , aside from the mere human feeling , the party needed him in Carlow -- even if he did not always prove himself `` quite a vehement partisan . ''
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 3]: Macauley laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 29]: `` But I 'm not doing my duty , '' he said presently ; `` I was to present you to the pretty ones only , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 9]: Will you designate your preferred fashion of beauty ?
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 6]: We serve all styles . ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 11]: `` Thank you , '' the other answered , hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 15]: `` I met a number last night -- quite a number , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 81]: He had seen them only in dim lights , however , and except Miss Hinsdale and the widower , had not the faintest recognition of any of them , and he cut them all , except those two , one after the other , before the evening was over ; and this was a strange thing for a politician to do ; but he did it with such an innocent eye that they remembered the dark porch and forgave him .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 10]: `` Shall we watch the dancing , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 3]: asked Macauley .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 8]: Harkless was already watching part of it .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 5]: `` If you will .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 13]: I have not seen this sort for more than five years . ''
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 26]: `` It is always a treat , I think , and a constant proof that the older school of English caricaturists did n't overdraw . ''
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 10]: `` Yes ; one realizes they could n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 49]: Harkless remembered Tom Meredith 's fine accomplishment of dancing ; he had been the most famous dancer of college days , and it was in the dancer that John best saw his old friend again as he had known him , the light lad of the active toe .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 45]: Other couples flickered about the one John watched , couples that plodded , couples that bobbed , couples that galloped , couples that slid , but the cousins alone passed across the glistening reflections as lightly as October leaves blown over the forest floor .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 71]: In the midst of people who danced with fixed , glassy eyes , or who frowned with determination to do their duty or to die , and seemed to expect the latter , or who were pale with the apprehension of collision , or who made visible their anxiety to breathe through the nose and look pleased at the same time , these two floated and smiled easily upon life .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 27]: Three or four steep steps made the portly and cigarette-smoking Meredith pant like an old man , but a dance was a cooling draught to him .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 24]: As for the little Marquise -- when she danced , she danced away with all those luckless hearts that were not hers already .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 29]: The orchestra launched the jubilant measures of the deux-temps with a torrent of vivacity , and the girl 's rhythmic flight answered like a sail taking the breeze .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 15]: There was one heart she had long since won which answered her every movement .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 32]: Flushed , rapturous , eyes sparkling , cheeks aglow , the small head weaving through the throng like a golden shuttle -- ah , did she know how adorable she was !
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 27]: Was Tom right : is it the attainable unattainable to one man and given to some other that leaves a deeper mark upon him than success ?
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 25]: At all events the unattainable was now like a hot sting in the heart , but yet a sting more precious than a balm .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 61]: The voice of Brainard Macauley broke in : `` A white brow and a long lash , a flushing cheek and a soft eye , a voice that laughs and breaks and ripples in the middle of a word , a girl you could put in your hat , Mr. Harkless -- and there you have a strong man prone !
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 18]: But I congratulate you on the manner your subordinates operate the ` Herald ' during your absence .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 10]: I understand you are making it a daily . ''
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 40]: Macauley was staring at him quizzically , and Harkless , puzzled , but without resentment of the other 's whimsey , could only decide that the editor of the Rouen `` Journal '' was an exceedingly odd young man .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 22]: All at once he found Meredith and the girl herself beside him ; they had stopped before the dance was finished .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 70]: He had the impulse to guard himself from new blows as a boy throws up his elbow to ward a buffet , and , although he could not ward with his elbow , for his heart was on his sleeve -- where he began to believe that Macauley had seen it -- he remembered that he could smile with as much intentional mechanism as any wornout rounder of afternoons .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 38]: He stepped aside for her , and she saw what she had known but had not seen before , for the thickness of the crowd , and this was that he limped and leaned upon his stick .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 26]: `` Do let me thank you , '' he said , with a louder echo of her manner of greeting him , a little earlier .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 12]: `` It has been such a pleasure to watch you dance .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 9]: It is really charming to meet you here .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 15]: If I return to Plattville I shall surely remember to tell Miss Briscoe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 28]: At this she surprised him with a sudden , clear look in the eyes , so reproachful , so deep , so sad , that he started .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 36]: She took her flowers from Macauley , who had the air of understanding the significance of such ceremonies very well , and saying , `` Sha n't we all go out on the terrace ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 45]: placed her arm in Harkless 's , and conducted him -LRB- and not the others -RRB- to the most secluded corner of the terrace , a nook illumined by one Japanese lantern ; to which spot it was his belief that he led her .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 20]: She sank into a chair , with the look of the girl who had stood by the blue tent-pole .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 29]: He could only stare at her , amazed by her abrupt change to this dazzling , if reproachful , kindness , confused by his good fortune . '' '
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 11]: _ If _ you go back to Plattville ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 7]: she said in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 16]: I 've been dull lately , and I thought I might go somewhere else . ''
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 50]: Caught in a witchery no lack of possession could dispel , and which the prospect of loss made only stronger while it lasted , he took little thought of what he said ; little thought of anything but of the gladness it was to be with her again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 5]: ` Somewhere else ? '
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 3]: Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 4]: `` Anywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 8]: `` Have you no sense of responsibility ?
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 9]: What is to become of your paper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 6]: `` The ` Herald ' ?
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 11]: Oh , it will potter along , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 13]: `` But what has become of it in your absence , already ?
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 8]: Has it not deteriorated very much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 18]: `` No , '' he said ; `` it 's better than it ever was before . ''
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 8]: she cried , with a little gasp .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 10]: `` You 're so astounded at my modesty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 14]: `` But please tell me what you mean , '' she said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 7]: `` What happened to it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 12]: `` Is n't the ` Herald ' rather a dull subject ?
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 30]: I 'll tell you how well Judge Briscoe looked when he came to see me ; or , rather , tell me of your summer in the north . ''
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 8]: `` No , '' she answered earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 17]: `` Do n't you remember my telling you that I am interested in newspaper work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 19]: `` I have even heard so from others , '' he said , with an instant of dryness .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 11]: `` Please tell me about the ` Herald ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 6]: `` It is very simple .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 32]: Your friend , Mr. Fisbee , found a substitute , a relative six feet high with his coat off , a traction engine for energy and a limited mail for speed .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 32]: He writes me letters on a type writer suffering from an impediment in its speech ; and in brief , he is an enterprising idiot with a mania for work-baskets . ''
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 7]: Her face was in the shadow .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 11]: `` You say the -- idiot -- is enterprising ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 11]: `` Far more enterprising and far less idiot than I .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 52]: They are looking for oil down there , and when he came he knew less about oil than a kindergarten babe , and spoke of ` boring for kerosene ' in his first letter to me ; but he knows it all now , and writes long and convincing geological arguments .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 15]: If a well comes in , he is prepared to get out an extra !
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 19]: Perhaps you may understand what that means in Plattville , with the ` Herald 's ' numerous forces .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 21]: I owe him everything , even the shares in the oil company , which he has persuaded me to take .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 15]: And he is going to dare to make the ` Herald ' a daily .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 12]: Do you remember asking me why I had never done that ?
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 64]: It seemed rather a venture to try to compete with the Rouen papers in offering State and foreign news , but this young Gulliver has tacked onto the Associated Press , and means to print a quarto -- that 's eight pages , you know -- once a week , Saturday , and a double sheet , four pages , on other mornings .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 8]: The daily venture begins next Monday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 6]: `` Will it succeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 6]: `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 3]: he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 6]: `` You think not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 25]: Her interest in this dull business struck him as astonishing , and yet in character with her as he had known her in Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 32]: Then he wondered unhappily if she thought that talking of the `` Herald '' and learning things about the working of a country newspaper would help her to understand Brainard Macauley .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 12]: `` Why have you let him go on with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 9]: `` I suppose you have encouraged him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , I encouraged him .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 7]: The creature 's recklessness fascinated me .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 10]: A dare-devil like that is always charming . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 17]: `` You think there is no chance for the creature 's succeeding with the daily ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 8]: `` None , '' he replied indifferently .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 9]: `` You mentioned work-baskets , I think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 4]: He laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 11]: `` I believe him to be the original wooden-nutmeg man .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 53]: Once a week he produces a ` Woman 's Page , ' wherein he presents to the Carlow female public three methods for making currant jelly , three receipts for the concoction of salads , and directs the ladies how to manufacture a pretty work-basket out of odd scraps in twenty minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 23]: The astonishing part of it is that he has not yet been mobbed by the women who have followed his directions . ''
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 18]: `` So you think the daily is a mistake and that your enterprising idiot should be mobbed ?
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 9]: She seemed to be taking him very seriously .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 16]: `` I think he may be -- for his ` Woman 's Page . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 10]: `` It is all wrong , you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 19]: `` What could a Yankee six-footer cousin of old Fisbee 's know about currant jelly and work-baskets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 11]: `` You know about currant jelly and work-baskets yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 11]: `` Heaven defend the right , I do not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 10]: `` You are sure he is six feet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 12]: `` You should see his signature ; that leaves no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 11]: And , also , his ability denotes his stature . ''
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 16]: `` You believe that ability is in proportion to height , do you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 9]: There was a dangerous luring in her tone .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 25]: His memory recalled to him that he was treading on undermined ground , so he hastened to say : `` In inverse proportion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 8]: `` Then your substitute is a failure .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 9]: I see , '' she said , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 62]: What muffled illumination there was in their nook fell upon his face ; her back was toward it , so that she was only an outline to him , and he would have been startled and touched to the quick , could he have known that her lip quivered and her eyes filled with tears as she spoke the last words .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 23]: He was happy as he had not been since his short June day ; it was enough to be with her again .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 12]: Nothing , not even Brainard Macauley , could dull his delight .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 14]: And , besides , for a few minutes he had forgotten Brainard Macauley .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 39]: What more could man ask than to sit in the gloom with her , to know that he was near her again for a little while , and to talk about anything -- if he talked at all ?
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 15]: Nonsense and idle exaggeration about young Fisbee would do as well as another thing .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 12]: `` The young gentleman is an exception , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 27]: `` I told you I owed everything to him ; my gratitude will not allow me to admit that his ability is less than his stature .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 69]: He suggested my purchase of a quantity of Mr. Watts 's oil stock when it was knocked flat on its back by two wells turning out dry ; but if Mr. Watts 's third well comes in , and young Fisbee has convinced me that it will , and if my Midas 's extra booms the stock and the boom develops , I shall oppose the income tax .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 27]: Poor old Plattville will be full of strangers and speculators , and the ` Herald ' will advocate vast improvements to impress the investor 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 16]: Stagnation and picturesqueness will flee together ; it is the history of the Indiana town .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 17]: Already the ` Herald ' is clamoring with Schofields ' Henry -- you remember the bell-ringer ?
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 8]: -- for Main Street to be asphalted .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 5]: It will all come .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 15]: The only trouble with young Fisbee is that he has too much ability . ''
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 10]: `` And yet the daily will not succeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 24]: That 's too big a jump , unless my young man 's expressions on the tariff command a wide sale amongst curio-hunters . ''
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 12]: `` Then he is quite a fool about political matters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 10]: `` Far from it ; he is highly ingenious .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 33]: His editorials are often the subtlest cups of flattery I ever sipped , many of them showing assiduous study of old files to master the method and notions of his eagle-eyed predecessor .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 9]: But the tariff seems to have got him .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 37]: He is a very masculine person , except for this one feminine quality , for , if I may say it without ungallantry , there is a legend that no woman has ever understood the tariff .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 49]: Young Fisbee must be an extremely travelled person , because the custom-house people have made an impression upon him which no few encounters with them could explain , and he conceives the tariff to be a law which discommodes a lady who has been purchasing gloves in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 26]: He thinks smuggling the great evil of the present tariff system ; it is such a temptation , so insidious a break-down of moral fibre .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 7]: His views must edify Carlow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 8]: She gave a quick , stifled cry .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 12]: there is n't a word of truth in what you say !
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 4]: Not a word !
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 11]: I did not think you could be so cruel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 10]: He bent forward , peering at her in astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 4]: `` Cruel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 13]: `` You know it is a hateful distortion -- an exaggeration ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 4]: she exclaimed passionately .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 15]: `` No man living could have so little sense as you say he has .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 9]: The tariff is perfectly plain to any child .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 20]: When you were in Plattville you were n't like this -- I did n't know you were unkind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 25]: `` I -- I do n't understand , please -- '' `` Miss Hinsdale has been talking -- raving -- to me about you !
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 20]: You may not know it -- though I suppose you do -- but you made a conquest last night .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 78]: It seems a little hard on the poor young man who is at work for you in Plattville , doing his best for you , plodding on through the hot days , and doing all he knows how , while you sit listening to music in the evenings with Clara Hinsdale , and make a mock of his work and his trying to please you -- '' `` But I did n't mention him to Miss Hinsdale .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 14]: In fact , I did n't mention _ anything _ to Miss Hinsdale .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 5]: What have I done ?
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 21]: The young man is making his living by his work -- and my living , too , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 14]: It only seems to me that his tariff editorials are rather humorous . ''
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 6]: She laughed suddenly -- ringingly .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 6]: `` Of course they are !
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 5]: How should I know ?
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 3]: Immensely humorous !
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 15]: And the good creature knows nothing beyond smuggling and the custom-house and chalk marks ?
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 13]: Why , even _ I _ -- ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 13]: -- even _ I _ -- should have known better than that .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 10]: What a little fool your enterprising idiot must be !
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 19]: -- with his work-baskets and currant jelly and his trying to make the ` Herald ' a daily !
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 11]: -- It will be a ludicrous failure , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 31]: No doubt he thought he was being quite wise , and was pleased over his tariff editorials -- his funny , funny editorials -- his best -- to please you !
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 5]: How immensely funny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 7]: `` Do you know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 4]: he asked abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 12]: `` I have not the honor of the gentleman 's acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 23]: Ah , '' she rejoined bitterly , `` I see what you mean ; it is the old accusation , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 14]: I am a woman , and I ` sound the personal note . '
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 17]: I could not resent a cruelty for the sake of a man I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 5]: But let it go .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 23]: My resentment is personal , after all , since it is against a man I do know -- _ you _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 11]: He leaned toward her because he could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 12]: `` I 'd rather have resentment from you than nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 13]: `` Then I will give you nothing , '' she answered quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 6]: `` You flout me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 8]: `` That is better than resentment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 35]: `` I hate you most , I think , '' she said with a tremulousness he did not perceive , `` when you say you do not care to go back to Plattville . ''
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 7]: `` Did I say it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 22]: `` It is in every word , and it is true ; you do n't care to go back there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 12]: `` Yes , it is true ; I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 31]: `` You want to leave the place where you do good ; to leave those people who love you , who were ready to die to avenge your hurt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 4]: she exclaimed vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 10]: `` Oh , I say that is shameful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 11]: `` Yes , I know , '' he returned gravely .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 6]: `` I am ashamed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 7]: `` Do n't say that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 10]: `` Do n't say you are ashamed of it .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 15]: Do you suppose I do not understand the dreariness it has been for you ?
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 40]: Do n't you know that I see it is a horror to you , that it brings back your struggle with those beasts in the dark , and revivifies all your suffering , merely to think of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 40]: Her turns and sudden contradictions left him tangled in a maze ; he could not follow , but must sit helpless to keep pace with her , while the sheer happiness of being with her tingled through his veins .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 37]: She rose and took a step aside , then spoke again : `` Well , since you want to leave Carlow , you shall ; since you do not wish to return , you need not .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 8]: -- Are you laughing at me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 18]: She leaned toward him , and looked at him steadily , with her face close to his .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 23]: He was not laughing ; his eyes shone with a deep fire ; in that nearness he hardly comprehended what she said .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 17]: `` Thank you for not laughing , '' she whispered , and leaned back from him .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 15]: `` I suppose you think my promises are quite wild , and they are .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 21]: I do not know what I was talking about , or what I meant , any better than you do .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 6]: You may understand some day .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 22]: It is all -- I mean that it hurts one to hear you say you do not care for Carlow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 4]: She turned away .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 4]: `` Come . ''
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 10]: `` It is my turn to conclude the interview .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 26]: You remember , the last time it was you who -- '' She broke off , shuddering , and covered her face with her hands .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 6]: `` Ah , that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 19]: `` I did not think -- I did not mean to speak of that miserable , miserable night .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 19]: And _ I _ to be harsh with you for not caring to go back to Carlow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 8]: `` Your harshness , '' he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 7]: `` A waft of eider . ''
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 9]: `` We must go , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 16]: He did not move , but sat staring at her like a thirsty man drinking .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 14]: With an impulsive and pretty gesture she reached out her hand to him .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 55]: Her little , white glove trembled in the night before his eyes , and his heart leaped to meet its sudden sweet generosity ; his thin fingers closed over it as he rose , and then that hand he had likened to a white butterfly lay warm and light and quiet in his own .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 32]: And as they had so often stood together in their short day and their two nights of the moon , so now again they stood with a serenading silence between them .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 97]: A plaintive waltz-refrain from the house ran through the blue woof of starlit air as a sad-colored thread through the tapestry of night ; they heard the mellow croon of the ` cello and the silver plaints of violins , the chiming harp , and the triangle bells , all woven into a minor strain of dance-music that beat gently upon their ears with such suggestion of the past , that , as by some witchcraft of hearing , they listened to music made for lovers dancing , and lovers listening , a hundred years ago .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 17]: `` I care for only one thing in this world , '' he said , tremulously .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 6]: `` Have I lost it ?
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 16]: I did n't mean to ask you , that last night , although you answered .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 5]: Have I no chance ?
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 6]: Is it still the same ?
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 7]: Do I come too late ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 10]: The butterfly fluttered in his hand and then away .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 10]: She drew back and looked at him a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 26]: `` There is one thing you must always understand , '' she said gently , `` and that is that a woman can be grateful .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 25]: I give you all the gratitude there is in me , and I think I have a great deal ; it is all yours .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 7]: Will you always remember that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 3]: `` Gratitude ?
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 18]: What can there -- '' `` You do not understand now , but some day you will .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 29]: I ask you to remember that my every act and thought which bore reference to you -- and there have been many -- came from the purest gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 16]: Although you do not see it now , will you promise to believe it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' he said simply .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 9]: `` For the rest -- '' She paused .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 12]: `` For the rest -- I do not love you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 10]: He bowed his head and did not lift it .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 6]: `` Do you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 10]: `` I understand , '' he answered , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 30]: She looked at him long , and then , suddenly , her hand to her heart , gave a little , pitying , tender cry and moved toward him .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 10]: At this he raised his head and smiled sadly .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 12]: `` No ; do n't you mind , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 6]: `` It 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 46]: I was such a cad the other time I needed to be told ; I was so entirely silly about it , I could n't face the others to tell them good-night , and I left you out there to go in to them alone .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 12]: I did n't realize , for my manners were all gone .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 36]: I 'd lived in a kind of stupor , I think , for a long time ; then being with you was like a dream , and the sudden waking was too much for me .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 24]: I 've been ashamed often , since , in thinking of it -- and I was well punished for not taking you in .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 16]: I thought only of myself , and I behaved like a whining , unbalanced boy .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 22]: But I had whined from the moment I met you , because I was sickly with egoism and loneliness and self-pity .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 8]: I 'm keeping you from the dancing .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 13]: Wo n't you let me take you back to the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 23]: A commanding and querulous contralto voice was heard behind them , and a dim , majestic figure appeared under the Japanese lantern .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 4]: `` Helen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 5]: The girl turned quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 6]: `` Yes , mamma . ''
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 15]: `` May I ask you to return to the club-house for supper with me ?
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 10]: Your father has been very much worried about you .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 9]: We have all been looking for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 9]: `` Mamma , this is Mr. Harkless . ''
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 7]: `` How do you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 36]: The lady murmured this much so far under her breath that the words might have been mistaken for anything else -- most plausibly , perhaps , for , `` Who cares if it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 11]: -- nor further did she acknowledge John 's profound inclination .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 24]: Frigidity and complaint of ill-usage made a glamour in every fold of her expensive garments ; she was large and troubled and severe .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 19]: A second figure emerged from behind her and bowed with the suave dignity that belonged to Brainard Macauley .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 18]: `` Mr. Macauley has asked to sit at our table , '' Mrs. Sherwood said to Helen .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 10]: `` May I beg you to come at once ?
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 9]: Your father is holding places for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 7]: `` Certainly , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 10]: `` I will follow you with Mr. Harkless . ''
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 15]: `` I think Mr. Harkless will excuse you , '' said the elder lady .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 6]: `` He has an engagement .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 17]: Mr. Meredith has been looking everywhere for him to take Miss Hinsdale out to supper . ''
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 14]: `` Good-night , Miss Sherwood , '' said John in a cheerful voice .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 13]: `` I thank you for sitting out the dance with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 13]: `` Good-night , '' she said , and gave him her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 32]: `` I 'm so sorry I sha n't see you again ; I am only in Rouen for this evening , or I should ask you to come to see me .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 6]: I am leaving to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 2]: Good-night .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 6]: -- Yes , mamma . ''
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 12]: The three figures went toward the bright lights of the club-house .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 17]: She was leaning on Macauley 's arm and chatting gaily , smiling up at him brightly .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 14]: John watched her till she was lost in the throng on the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 27]: There , in the lights , where waiters were arranging little tables , every one was talking and moving about , noisily , good-humored and happy .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 58]: There was a flourish of violins , and then the orchestra swung into a rampant march that pranced like uncurbed cavalry ; it stirred the blood of old men with militant bugle calls and blast of horns ; it might have heralded the chariot of a flamboyant war god rioting out of sunrise , plumed with youth .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 35]: Some quite young men on the veranda made as if they were restive horses champing at the bit and heading a procession , and , from a group near by , loud laughter pealed .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 22]: John Harkless lifted to his face the hand that had held hers ; there was the faint perfume of her glove .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 6]: He kissed his own hand .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 18]: Then he put that hand and the other to his forehead , and sank into her chair .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 10]: `` Let me get back , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 13]: `` Let me get back to Plattville , where I belong . ''
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 6]: Tom Meredith came calling him .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 3]: `` Harkless ?
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 4]: John Harkless ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 8]: `` Here I am , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 6]: `` Come along , boy .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 11]: What on earth are you doing out here all alone ?
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 14]: I thought you were with -- I thought some people were with you .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 28]: You 're bored to death , I know ; but come along and be bored some more , because I promised to bring you in for supper .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 6]: Then we 'll go home .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 12]: They 've saved a place for you by Miss Hinsdale . ''
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 20]: `` Very well , lad , '' answered Harkless , and put his hand on the other 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 5]: `` Thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 20]: The next day he could not leave his bed ; his wounds were feverish and his weakness had returned .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 25]: Meredith was shaken with remorse because he had let him wander around in the damp night air with no one to look after him .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 25]: HELEN 'S TOAST Judge Briscoe was sitting out under the afternoon sky with his chair tilted back and his feet propped against the steps .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 39]: His coat was off , and Minnie sat near at hand sewing a button on the garment for him , and she wore that dreamy glaze that comes over women 's eyes when they sew for other people .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 56]: From the interior of the house rose and fell the murmur of a number of voices engaged in a conversation , which , for a time , seemed to consist of dejected monosyllables ; but presently the judge and Minnie heard Helen 's voice , clear , soft , and trembling a little with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 18]: She talked only two or three minutes , but what she said stirred up a great commotion .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 47]: All the voices burst forth at once in ejaculations -- almost shouts ; but presently they were again subdued and still , except for the single soft one , which held forth more quietly , but with a deeper agitation , than any of the others .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 41]: `` You need n't try to bamboozle me , '' said the judge in a covert tone to his daughter , and with a glance at the parlor window , whence now issued the rumble of Warren Smith 's basso .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 14]: `` I tell you that girl would follow John Harkless to Jericho . ''
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 15]: Minnie shook her head mysteriously , and bit a thread with a vague frown .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 7]: `` Well , why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 5]: asked the judge crossly .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 11]: `` Why would n't she have him , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 12]: `` Well , who knows he 's asked her yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 24]: Minnie screamed derisively at the density of man , `` What made him run off that way , the night he was hurt ?
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 13]: Why did n't he come back in the house with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 4]: `` Pshaw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 10]: `` Do n't you suppose a woman understands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 21]: `` Meaning that you know more about it than I do , I presume , '' grunted the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 14]: `` Yes , father , '' she replied , smiling benignantly upon him .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 7]: `` Did she tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 4]: he asked abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 31]: I guess the truth is that women do n't know more than men so much as they see more ; they understand more without having to read about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 12]: `` That 's the way of it , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 3]: he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 18]: `` Well , it do n't make any difference , she 'll have him some time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 11]: `` No , father ; it 's only gratitude . ''
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 4]: `` Gratitude ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 5]: The judge snorted scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 17]: `` Girls do n't do as much as she 's done for him out of gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 31]: _ Look _ what she 's doing ; not only running the ` Herald ' for him , but making it a daily , and a good daily at that .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 32]: First time I saw her I knew right away she was the smartest girl I ever laid eyes on ; -- I expect she must have got it from her mother .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 2]: Gratitude !
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 2]: Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 20]: Look how she 's studied his interests , and watched like a cat for chances for him in everything .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 11]: Did n't she get him into Eph Watts 's company ?
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 38]: She talked to Watts and the other fellows , day after day , and drove around their leased land with 'em , and studied it up , and got on the inside , and made him buy .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 96]: Now , if they strike it -- and she 's sure they will , and _ I _ 'm sure she knows when to have faith in a thing -- why , they 'll sell out to the Standard , and they can all quit work for the rest of their lives if they want to ; and Harkless gets as much as any without lifting a finger , all because he had a little money -- mighty little , too -- laid up in bank and a girl that saw where to put it .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 11]: She did that for him , did n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 14]: `` Do n't you see what fun it 's been for her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 3]: returned Minnie .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 22]: `` She 's been having the best time she ever had ; I never knew any one half so happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 23]: `` Yes ; she went up and saw him at that party , and she knows he 's still thinking about her .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 21]: I should n't be surprised if he asked her then , and that 's what makes her so gay . ''
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 35]: `` Well , she could n't have said ` yes , ' because he went back to his bed the next day , and he 's been there most of the time since . ''
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 3]: `` Pshaw !
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 16]: He was n't over his injuries , and he was weak and got malaria . ''
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 23]: `` Well , she could n't be so happy while he 's sick , if she cared very much about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 7]: `` He 's not very sick .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 19]: She 's happy because she 's working for him , and she knows his illness is n't serious .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 12]: He 'll be a well man when she says the word .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 25]: He 's love-sick , that 's what he is ; I never saw a man so taken down with it in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 8]: `` Then it is n't malaria ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 10]: Minnie said , with a smile of some superiority .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 19]: `` You 're just like your poor mother , '' the old gentleman answered , growing rather red .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 8]: `` She never could learn to argue .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 40]: What I say is that Helen cares about him , whether she says she does or not , whether she acts like it or not -- or whether she thinks she does or not , '' he added irascibly .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 13]: `` Do you know what she 's doing for him to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 5]: `` Not exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 47]: `` Well , when they were talking together at that party , he said something that made her think he was anxious to get away from Plattville -- you 're not to repeat this , child ; she told me , relying on my discretion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 45]: `` Do you know why she 's got these men to come here to-day to meet her -- Warren Smith and Landis and Homer , and Boswell and young Keating of Amo , and Tom Martin and those two fellows from Gaines County ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 11]: `` Something about politics , is n't it ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 7]: ` Something about politics ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 3]: he echoed .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 7]: `` I should say it is !
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 22]: Wait till it 's done , and this evening I 'll tell you -- if you can keep a secret . ''
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 8]: Minnie set her work-basket on the steps .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 15]: `` Oh , I guess I can keep a secret , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 10]: `` But it wo n't make any difference . ''
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 24]: `` You mean you 've said it , and you 'll stick to it that it 's gratitude till their wedding day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 25]: `` She knows he gave her father something to do , and helped him in other ways , when no one else did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 7]: `` I know all about that .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 24]: She reproaches herself for having neglected Fisbee while a stranger took care of him , and saved him from starving -- and worse .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 18]: She 's unreasonable about it ; she did n't know he was in want till long after .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 12]: That 's just like Fisbee , to tell her , afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 31]: He did n't tell her how low he got ; but he hinted at it to her , and I guess she understood ; I gathered that much from him .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 15]: Of course she 's grateful , but gratefulness do n't account for everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 6]: `` Yes it does . ''
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 16]: `` Well , I never expected to have the last word with a woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 11]: `` Well , you need n't , '' said Minnie .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 5]: `` I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 8]: I never do , '' he retorted .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 17]: She did not answer , but hummed a little tune and looked up at the tree-tops .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 7]: Warren Smith appeared in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 13]: `` Judge , '' he said , `` will you step inside ?
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 5]: We need you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 7]: Briscoe nodded and rose at once .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 33]: As he reached the door , Minnie said in a piercing whisper : `` It 's hard to be sure about her , but I 'm right ; it 's gratitude . ''
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 21]: `` There , '' he replied , chuckling , `` I thought I should n't have the last word . ''
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 25]: Minnie began to sing , and the judge , after standing in the doorway till he was again summoned from within , slowly retired .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 32]: Briscoe had persisted in his own explanation of Helen 's gaiety ; nevertheless he did not question his daughter 's assumption that the young lady was enjoying her career in Carlow .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 23]: She was free as a bird to go and come , and her duties and pleasures ran together in a happy excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 20]: Her hands were full of work , but she sought and increased new tasks , and performed them also .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 34]: She came to Carlow as unused to the soil as was Harkless on his arrival , and her educational equipment for the work was far less than his ; her experience , nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 32]: But both were native to the State ; and the genius of the American is adaptability , and both were sprung from pioneers whose means of life depended on that quality .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 45]: There are , here and there , excrescent individuals who , through stock decadence , or their inability to comprehend republican conditions , are not assimilated by the body of the country ; but many of these are imports , while some are exports .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 116]: Our foreign-born agitators now and then find themselves removed by the police to institutions of routine , while the romantic innocents who set up crests in the face of an unimpressionable democracy are apt to be lured by their own curious ambitions , or those of their women-folk , to spend a great part of their time in or about the villas of Albion , thus paid for its perfidy ; and , although the anarchists and the bubble-hunters make a noise , it is enormously out of proportion to their number , which is relatively very small , and neither the imported nor the exported article can be taken as characteristic of our country .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 26]: For the American is one who soon fits any place , or into any shaped hole in America , where you can set him down .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 55]: It may be that without going so far as to suggest the halls of the great and good and rich , one might mention a number of houses of entertainment for man and beast in this country , in which Mr. Martin of the Plattville Dry Goods Emporium would find himself little at ease .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 87]: But even in the extreme case , if Mr. Martin were given his choice of being burned to death , or drowned , or of spending a month at the most stupendously embellished tavern located in our possessions , and supposing him to have chosen the third alternate , it is probable that he would have grown almost accustomed to his surroundings before he died ; and if he survived the month , we may even fancy him really enjoying moments of conversation with the night-clerks .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 21]: As Mr. Parker observed , Miss Sherwood did not do the Grand Duchess , giving the Carlow tenants a treat .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 82]: She felt no duchess symptoms within herself , and though , of course , she had various manners tucked away to wear as one suits garments to occasions -- and it was a Rouen `` party-gown '' wherewith she chose to abash poor John Harkless at their meeting -- here in Carlow , she was a woman of affairs , lively , shrewd , engaging , capable ; she was herself -LRB- at least she was that side of herself -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 46]: And it should be explained that Harkless had based his calumny regarding the tariff on a paragraph or two that crept inadvertently into an otherwise statesmanlike article , and that `` H. Fisbee '' understood the tariff as well as any woman who ever lived .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 11]: But the tariff inspired no more articles from that pen .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 26]: Rodney McCune had lifted his head , and those who had followed his stricken enemy felt that the cause was lost , without the leader .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 31]: The old ring that the `` Herald '' had crushed was a ring once more , and the heelers had rallied -- `` the boys were in line again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 17]: The work had been done quietly , and Halloway was already beaten , and beaten badly .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 19]: John Harkless lay sick , and Rodney McCune would sit in Congress , for the nomination meant election .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 24]: But one day the Harkless forces , demoralized , broken , almost hopeless , woke up to find that they had a leader .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 33]: Many of them were content with the belief that this was a young lawyer named Keating , who had risen up in Amo ; but Mr. Keating himself had a different impression .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 20]: Helen was a little nervous , and very much excited , over the political conference at Judge Briscoe 's .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 19]: She planned it with careful diplomacy , and arranged the details with a fine sense of the dramatic .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 67]: There was a suggestion she desired to have made in this meeting , which she wished should emanate from the Amo and Gaines County people , instead of proceeding from Carlow -- for she thought it better to make the outsiders believe her idea an inspiration of their own -- so she made a little comedy and provided for Briscoe 's entrance at an effective moment .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 50]: The judge was a substantial influence , strong in the councils of his party when he chose to be ; and though of late years he had contented himself with voting at the polls , every one knew what weight he carried when he saw fit to bestir himself .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 17]: When he entered the parlor , he found the politicians in a state of subdued excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 15]: Helen sat by the window , blushing , and talking eagerly to old Fisbee .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 19]: One of the gentlemen from Gaines County was walking about the room exclaiming , `` A glorious conception !
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 5]: A glorious conception ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 6]: addressing the bric-a-brac , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 9]: -LRB- He thought the conception his own . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 47]: Mr. Martin was tugging at his beard and whispering to Landis and Homer , and the two Amo men were consulting in a corner , but as the judge came in , one of them turned and said loudly , `` That 's the man . ''
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 9]: `` What man am I , Keating ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 5]: asked Briscoe , cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 27]: `` We better explain , I guess , '' answered the other ; and turning to his compatriot : `` You tell him , Boswell . ''
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 29]: `` Well -- it 's this way -- '' said Boswell , and came at once to an awkward pause , turning aside sheepishly and unable to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 13]: `` So that 's the way of it , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 5]: said the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 15]: Helen laughed cheerfully , and looked about her with a courageous and encouraging eye .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 9]: `` It is embarrassing , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 18]: `` Judge Briscoe , we are contemplating ' a piece of the blackest treachery and chicanery . '
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 13]: We are going to give Mr. Halloway the -- the go-by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 13]: The embarrassment fell away , and everybody began to talk at once .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 19]: `` Hold on a minute , '' said the judge ; `` let 's get at it straight .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 8]: What do you want with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 10]: `` I 'll tell you , '' volunteered Keating .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 15]: `` You see , the boys are getting in line again for this convention .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 43]: They are the old file that used to rule the roost before the ` Herald ' got too strong for them , and they rely on Mr. Harkless 's being sick to beat Kedge Halloway with that Gaines County man , McCune .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 12]: Now , none of us here want Rod McCune I guess .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 35]: We had trouble enough once with him and his heelers , and now that Mr. Harkless is down , they 've taken advantage of it to raise a revolution : Rod McCune for Congress !
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 47]: He 's a dirty-hearted swindler -- I hope Miss Sherwood will pardon the strong expression -- and everybody thought the ` Herald ' had driven him out of politics , though it never told how it did it ; but he 's up on top again .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 9]: Now , the question is to beat him .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 46]: We hold the committees , but the boys have been fighting the committees -- call 'em the ` Harkless Ring , ' and never understood that the ` Herald ' would have turned us down in a second if it thought we were n't straight .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 35]: Well , we saw a week ago that Kedge Halloway was going to lose to McCune ; we figured it out pretty exactly , and there ai n't a ray of hope for Kedge .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 131]: We wrote to Mr. Harkless about it , and asked him to come down -- if he 'd been on the ground last Monday and had begun to work , I do n't say but what his personal influence might have saved Halloway -- but a friend of his , where he 's staying , answered the letter : said Mr. Harkless was down with a relapse and was very fretful ; and he 'd taken the liberty of reading the letter and temporarily suppressing it under doctor 's orders ; they were afraid he 'd come , sick as he was , from a sense of duty , and asked us to withdraw the letter , and referred us to Mr. Harkless 's representative on the ` Herald . '
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 17]: So we applied here to Miss Sherwood , and that 's why we had this meeting .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 47]: Now , Halloway is honest -- everybody knows that -- and I do n't say but what he 's been the best available material Mr. Harkless had to send to Washington ; but he ai n't any too bright -- '' Mr. Martin interrupted the speaker .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 24]: `` I reckon , maybe , you never heard that lecture of his on the Past , Present , and Future ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 47]: `` Besides that , '' Keating continued , `` Halloway has had it long enough , and he 's got enough glory out of it , and , except for getting beat by Rod McCune , I believe he 'd almost as soon give it up .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 17]: Well , we discussed all this and that , and could n't come to any conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 55]: We did n't want to keep on with a losing fight if there was any way to put up a winner , though of course we all recognized that Mr. Harkless would want us to support Kedge to the death , and that 's what he 'd do if he was on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 44]: But Miss Sherwood mentioned that she 'd had one note since his last illness began , and he 'd entrusted her and her associates on the paper with the entire policy , and she would take the responsibility for anything we determined on .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 43]: Mr. Smith said the only thing to do was to give up Halloway and get a man that could beat McCune ; Kedge would recognize it himself , that that was the only thing to do , and he could retire gracefully .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 53]: Miss Sherwood said she was still more or less a stranger , and asked what man we could find who was strong enough to do it by popularity alone and who was also a man we wanted ; somebody that had worked a good deal , but had never had any office .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 37]: It was to such a man she could promise the ` Herald 's ' support , as for a time the paper was being operated almost independently , it might be said , of Mr. Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 27]: Well , I expect it came to all of us at the same time , but it was Mr. Bence here that said it first . ''
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 49]: Mr. Bence was the gentleman who had walked about saying `` A glorious conception , '' and he now thrust one hand into his breast and extended the other in a wide gesture , and looked as impressive as a very young man with white eyebrows can look .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 69]: `` The name of Harkless , '' he said abruptly , `` the name of Harkless will sweep the convention like the fire of a Western prairie ; the name of Harkless will thunder over their astonished heads and strike a peal of joy bells in every home in the district ; it will re-echo in the corridors of posterity and teem with prosperity like a mighty river .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 18]: The name of Harkless will reverberate in that convention hall , and they shall sit ashamed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 4]: `` Harkless ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 4]: exclaimed the judge .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 13]: `` Why did n't some one think of that long ago ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 6]: `` Then you approve ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 3]: asked Keating .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 9]: `` Yes , I think I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 8]: The Amo man shook hands with him .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 10]: `` We 'll swim out , '' he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 8]: `` It will be the same everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 19]: A lot of the old crowd themselves will be swept along with us when we make our nomination .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 28]: People feel that that Cross-Roads business ought never to have been allowed to happen , and they 'd like to make it up to him some way .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 12]: There are just two difficulties , Halloway and Mr. Harkless himself .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 27]: It 's a sure thing that he would n't come out against Kedge and that he 'd refuse to let his name be used against him .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 21]: Therefore , we 've got to keep it quiet from him ; the whole thing has to be worked quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 20]: The McCune folks were quiet until they thought they were sure ; we 've got to be quieter still .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 10]: Well , we 've made out a plan . ''
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 13]: `` And a plan that will operate , '' added Mr. Bence .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 43]: `` For the name of Harkless shall -- '' Mr. Keating interrupted him energetically : `` We explain it to all the Halloway delegates , you see , and to all the shaky McCune people , and interview all the undecided ones .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 21]: The McCune crowd may see them afterwards , but they ca n't fix men in this district against John Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 12]: All we 've got to do is to pass the word .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 9]: It 's all kept quiet , you understand .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 18]: We go into the convention , and the names of Halloway and McCune are placed before it .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 18]: Then will come a speech naming Harkless -- and you want to stuff your ears with cotton !
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 68]: On the first ballot Harkless gets the scattering vote that was going to nominate McCune if we 'd let things run , and Halloway is given every vote he 'd have got if he 'd run against McCune alone ; it 's as a compliment ; it will help him see how things were , afterwards ; and on the second ballot his vote goes to Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 29]: There wo n't be any hitch if we get down to work right off ; it 's a mighty short campaign , but we 've got big chances .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 28]: Of course , it ca n't be helped that Halloway has to be kept in the dark ; he wo n't spend any money , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 47]: `` It looks a little underhanded at first glance , '' said Warren Smith ; `` but , as Miss Sherwood said , you 've got to be a little underhanded sometimes , especially when you 're dealing with as scrupulous a man as John Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 29]: But it 's a perfectly honest deal , and it will be all right with him when he finds it 's all over and he 's nominated . ''
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 11]: `` It 's a plain case , '' added Boswell .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 14]: `` We want him , and we 've got to have him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 11]: `` There 's one danger , '' Mr. Keating continued .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 56]: `` Kedge Halloway is honest , but I believe he 's selfish enough to disturb his best friend 's deathbed for his own ends , and it 's not unlikely that he will get nervous towards the last and be telegraphing Harkless to have himself carried on a cot to the convention to save him .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 33]: That would n't do at all , of course , and Miss Sherwood thinks maybe there 'd be less danger if we set the convention a little ahead of the day appointed .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 35]: It 's dangerous , because it shortens our time ; but we can fix it for three days before the day we 'd settled on , and that will bring it to September 7th .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 27]: What we want of you , judge , is to go to the convention as a delegate , and make the nominating speech for Mr. Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 6]: Will you do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 5]: `` Do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 18]: cried the old man , and he struck the table a resounding blow with his big fist .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 4]: `` Do it ?
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 15]: I 'd walk from here to Rouen and back again to do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 31]: They were all on their feet at this , and they pressed forward to shake Briscoe 's hand , congratulating him and each other as though they were already victorious .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 29]: Mr. Martin bent over Helen and asked her if she minded shaking hands with a man who had voted for Shem at the first election in the Ark. .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 21]: `` I thought I 'd rightly ort to thank you for finishin ' off Kedge Halloway , '' he added .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 25]: `` I made up my mind I 'd never vote for him again , the night he killed that intellectual insect of his . ''
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 8]: `` Intellectual insect , Mr. Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 5]: she asked , puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 3]: He sighed .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 11]: `` The recollection never quits ha ` ntin ' me .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 12]: I reckon I have n't had a restful night since June .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 9]: Maybe you do n't remember his lecture . ''
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 24]: `` Oh , but I do , '' she laughed ; `` and I remember the story of the fly , vividly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 20]: `` I never was jest what you might exactly call gushin ' over Kedge , '' Mr. Martin drawled .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 50]: `` He does n't strike me as havin ' many ideas , precisely -- he had kind of a symptom of one once , that he caught from Harkless , but it did n't take ; it sloshed around in his mind and never really come out on him .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 10]: I always thought his brain was sort of syrupy .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 24]: Harkless thought there was fruit in it , and I reckon there is ; but some way it never seems to jell . ''
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 9]: `` Go on , '' said Helen gayly .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 8]: `` I want to hear him abused .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 16]: It helps me to feel less mean about the way we are treating him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 13]: `` Yes ; I 'm slickin ' over my conscience , too .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 21]: I feel awnrier about it because he done me a good turn once , in the Hayes and Wheeler campaign .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 20]: I went to a meetin ' to hear him speak , and he got sick and could n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 6]: Warren Smith addressed the company .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 11]: `` Well , is this all for the present ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 6]: `` Is everything settled ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 9]: `` Wait a minute , '' said Keating .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 23]: `` I 'd like to hear from the ` Herald ' about its policy , if Miss Sherwood will tell us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 9]: `` Yes , indeed , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 7]: `` It will be very simple .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 12]: Do n't you think there is only one course to pursue ?
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 52]: We will advocate no one very energetically , but we will print as much of the truth about Mr. McCune as we can , with delicacy and honor , in this case , but , as I understand it , the work is almost all to be done amongst the delegates .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 57]: We shall not mention our plan at all -- but -- but , when the convention is over , and he is nominated , we will get out an extra ; and I am so confident of your success that I 'll tell you now that the extra will be ready the night before the convention .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 40]: We will contrive that Mr. Harkless shall not receive his copy of the paper containing the notice of the change of date , and I think the chance of his seeing it in any Rouen paper may be avoided .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 8]: That is all , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 8]: `` Thank you , '' said Keating .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 10]: `` That is certainly the course to follow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 23]: Every one nodded , or acquiesced in words ; and Keating and Bence came over to Helen and engaged her in conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 15]: The others began to look about for their hats , vaguely preparing to leave .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 10]: `` Wait a minute , '' said the judge .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 10]: `` There 's no train due just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 33]: And Minnie appeared in the doorway with a big pitcher of crab-apple cider , rich and amber-hued , sparkling , cold , and redolent of the sweet-smelling orchard where it was born .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 21]: Behind Miss Briscoe came Mildy Upton with glasses and a fat , shaking , four-storied jelly-cake on a second tray .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 31]: The judge passed his cigars around , and the gentlemen took them blithely , then hesitatingly held them in their fingers and glanced at the ladies , uncertain of permission .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 27]: `` Let me get you some matches , '' Helen said , quickly , and found a box on the table and handed it to Keating .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 15]: Every one sat beaming , and fragrant veils of smoke soon draped the room .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 12]: `` Why do you call her ` Miss Sherwood ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 7]: Boswell whispered in Keating 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 7]: `` That 's her name . ''
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 16]: `` Ai n't she the daughter of that old fellow over there by the window ?
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 7]: Ai n't her name Fisbee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 25]: `` No ; she 's his daughter , but her legal name 's Sherwood ; she 's an adop -- '' `` Great Scott !
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 6]: I know all about that .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 25]: I 'd like to know if there 's a man , woman , or child in this part of the country that does n't .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 13]: I guess it wo n't be Fisbee or Sherwood either very long .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 13]: She can easy get a new name , _ that _ lady !
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 35]: And if she took a fancy to Boswell , why , I 'm a bach -- '' `` I expect she wo n't take a fancy to Boswell very early , '' said Keating .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 9]: `` They say it will be Harkless . ''
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 10]: `` Go ` way , '' returned Mr. Boswell .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 10]: `` What do you want to say that for ?
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 19]: Ca n't you bear for anybody to be happy a minute or two , now and then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 75]: Warren Smith approached Helen and inquired if it would be asking too much if they petitioned her for some music ; so she went to the piano , and sang some darky songs for them , with a quaint suggestion of the dialect -- two or three old-fashioned negro melodies of Foster 's , followed by some rollicking modern imitations with the movement and spirit of a tinshop falling down a flight of stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 59]: Her audience listened in delight from the first ; but the latter songs quite overcame them with pleasure and admiration , and before she finished , every head in the room was jogging from side to side , and forward and back , in time to the music , while every foot shuffled the measures on the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 35]: When the gentlemen from out of town discovered that it was time to leave if they meant to catch their train , Helen called to them to wait , and they gathered about her .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 69]: `` Just one second , '' she said , and she poured all the glasses full to the brim ; then , standing in the centre of the circle they made around her , she said : `` Before you go , sha n't we pledge each other to our success in this good , home-grown Indiana cider , that leaves our heads clear and our arms strong ?
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 40]: If you will -- then -- '' She began to blush furiously and her voice trembled , but she lifted the glass high over her head and cried bravely , `` Here 's to ` Our Candidate ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 22]: The big men , towering over her , threw back their heads and quaffed the gentle liquor to the last drop .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 20]: Then they sent up the first shout of the campaign , and cheered John Harkless till the rafters rang .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 42]: `` My friends , '' said Mr. Keating , as he and Boswell and the men from Gaines drove away in Judd Bennett 's omnibus , `` my friends , here is where I begin the warmest hustling I ever did .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 21]: I want Harkless , everybody wants him -- '' `` It is a glorious idea , '' said Mr. Bence .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 12]: `` The name of Harkless -- '' Keating drowned the oratory .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 7]: `` But that is n't all .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 15]: That little girl wants him to go to Congress , and that settles it .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 4]: He goes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 21]: That evening Minnie and her father were strolling up and down the front walk together , between the flowered borders .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 7]: `` Do you give up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 4]: asked the judge .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 5]: `` Give up what ?
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 3]: No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 4]: returned his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 8]: `` She has n't told you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 19]: `` Not yet ; she and Mr. Fisbee left for the office right after those men went . ''
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 19]: `` Have n't you discovered what the ` something about politics ' she 's doing for him is ?
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 13]: Did you understand what she meant by ` Our Candidate ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 5]: `` Not exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 13]: `` Did you see her blush when she proposed that toast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 19]: So would anybody -- with all those men , and their eyes hanging out on their cheeks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 7]: She got up the whole show .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 6]: Do you know why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 9]: `` I only know it 's politics . ''
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 4]: `` Politics ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 39]: He glanced over his shoulder , and then , leaning toward her , he said , in a low tone : `` I 'll tell you in confidence , Minnie ; she 's sending him to Congress ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 4]: she cried triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 17]: `` If she loved him she would n't do _ that _ , would she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 4]: `` Minnie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 6]: Briscoe turned upon her sternly .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 13]: `` I do n't want to hear any more talk like that .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 28]: It 's the way with some papers to jibe at our great institutions , and you 've been reading them ; that 's the trouble with you .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 26]: The only criticism any one has any business making against Congress is that it 's too good for some of the men we send there .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 15]: Congress is our great virtue , understand ; the congressmen are our fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 14]: `` I did n't mean anything like that , '' protested the girl .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 14]: `` I have n't been reading any papers except the ` Herald . '
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 15]: I meant why should she send him away if she cared about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 8]: `` She 'll go with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 7]: `` They could n't both go .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 10]: What would become of the ` Herald ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 30]: `` They 'd fix that easy enough ; there are plenty of smart young fellows in Rouen they could get to run it while they are in Washington . ''
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 13]: `` Mr. Harkless is sure to be elected , is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 10]: `` He is , if he 's nominated . ''
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 9]: `` Ca n't he get the nomination ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 4]: `` Get it !
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 54]: Nobody ever happened to think of him for it till it came into _ her _ head ; and the only thing I look to see standing in the way of it is Harkless himself ; but I expect we can leave it to her to manage , and I guess she will .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 8]: She 's got more diplomacy than Blaine .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 31]: Kedge Halloway is up the spout all right , but they want to keep it quiet ; that 's why she had them come here instead of the office . ''
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 20]: `` She would n't marry him a minute sooner because he went to Congress , '' said Minnie thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 10]: `` You 're giving up , '' he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 8]: `` You know I 'm right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 5]: `` Wait and see .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 13]: It might -- No , you 're wrong as wrong can be !
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 6]: I wish you were n't .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 5]: Do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 4]: You 're blind .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 16]: She _ could n't _ do all these things for him if she loved him .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 7]: That 's the very proof itself .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 12]: I suppose you -- well , you ca n't understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 12]: `` I 'll tell you one thing , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 21]: `` If she does n't , the rest of it wo n't amount to a rip with John Harkless . ''
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 6]: `` Yes , it will .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 21]: Nobody could help liking to find himself as big a man as he 'll be when he comes back here .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 27]: Besides , do n't you see , it 's her way of making it up to him for not liking him as much as he wants .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 11]: _ You _ give up , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 16]: `` No , '' he cried , with feeble violence , `` I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 15]: She 'll find out some things about herself when she sees him again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 5]: Minnie shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 39]: There was a sound of wheels ; the buckboard drew up at the gate , and Helen , returning from her evening 's labor , jumped out lightly , and ran around to pat the horses ' heads .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 16]: `` Thank you so much , Mr. Willetts , '' she said to the driver .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 38]: `` I know you will handle the two delegates you are to look after as well as you do the judge 's team ; and you ought to , you know , because the delegates are men .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 4]: You dears ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 15]: She stroked the sleek necks of the colts and handed them bunches of grass .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 27]: Briscoe came out , and let the friendly animals nose his shoulder as he looked gravely down on the piquant face beside him in the dusk .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 12]: `` Young lady , '' he said , `` go East .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 37]: Wait till we get on to Washington , and sit in the gallery , and see John Harkless rise up in his place , and hear the Speaker say : ` The Gentleman from Indiana ! '
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 27]: I know the chills would go up and down my spine , and I guess you 'd feel pretty well paid for your day 's work .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 7]: I guess we all would . ''
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 9]: `` Are n't you tired , Helen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 14]: asked Minnie , coming to her in the darkness and clasping her waist .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 3]: `` Tired ?
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 6]: No ; I 'm happy .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 10]: Did you ever see the stars so bright ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 46]: THE TREACHERY OF H. FISBEE An Indiana town may lie asleep a long time , but there always comes a day when it wakes up ; and Plattville had wakened in August when the `` Herald '' became a daily and Eph Watts struck oil .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 10]: It was then that history began to be made .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 27]: The `` Herald '' printed News , and the paper was sold every morning at stands in all the towns in that section of the State .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 4]: Its circulation tripled .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 26]: Parker talked of new presses ; two men were added to his staff , and a reporter was brought from Rouen to join Mr. Fisbee .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 24]: The `` Herald '' boomed the oil-field ; people swarmed into town ; the hotel was crowded ; strangers became no sensation whatever .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 34]: A capitalist bought the whole north side of the Square to erect new stores , and the Carlow Bank began the construction of a new bank building of Bedford stone on Main Street .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 29]: Then it was whispered , next affirmed , that the `` Herald '' had succeeded in another of its enterprises , and Main Street was to be asphalted .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 13]: That was the end of the `` old days '' of Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 59]: There was a man who had laid the foundation upon which the new Plattville was to be built ; he who , through the quiet labor of years , had stamped his spirit upon the people , as their own was stamped upon him ; but he lay sick in his friend 's house and did not care .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 24]: One day Meredith found him propped up in bed , reading a letter -- reading it listlessly , and with a dull eye .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 9]: `` PLATTVILLE , _ September 1st _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 12]: _ Dear Mr. Harkless _ : Yours of the 30th received .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 36]: Every one here is very glad to know that your health is so far improved as to admit of your writing ; and it is our strongest hope that you will soon be completely recovered .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 71]: `` New subscriptions are coming in at a slightly advanced rate since my last letter ; you will see they are distributed over several counties , when you examine the books on your return ; and I am glad to state that with our arrangement for Gainesville the ` Herald ' is now selling every morning at a prominent store in all the towns within the radius we determined on .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 21]: Our plan of offering the daily with no advance on the price of the former tri-weekly issue proves a success .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 22]: I now propose making the issue a quarto every day -LRB- at the same price -RRB- instead of once a week .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 8]: I think our experience warrants the experiment .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 15]: It is my belief that our present circulation will be increased forty per cent .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 7]: Please advise me if you approve .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 38]: Of course this would mean a further increase of our working force , and we should have to bring another man from Rouen -- possibly two more -- but I think we need not fear such enlargements .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 58]: `` I should tell you that I have taken you at your word entrusting me with the entire charge of your interests here , and I had the store-room adjoining the office put in shape , and offered it to the telegraph company for half the rent they were paying in their former quarters over the post-office .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 23]: They have moved in ; and this , in addition to giving us our despatches direct , is a reduction of expense .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 18]: `` Mr. Watts informs me that the Standard 's offer is liberal and the terms are settled .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 42]: The boom is not hollow , it is simply an awakening ; and the town , so long a dependent upon the impetus of agriculture or its trade , is developing a prosperity of its own on other lines as well .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 12]: Strangers come every day ; oil has lubricated every commercial joint .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 21]: Contracts have been let for three new brick business buildings to be erected on the east side of the Square .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 38]: The value of your Main Street frontage will have doubled by December , and possibly you may see fit to tear away the present building and put up another , instead ; the investment might be profitable .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 23]: The ` Herald ' could find room on the second and third floors , and the first could be let to stores .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 34]: `` I regret that you find your copy of the paper for the 29th overlooked in the mail and that your messenger could find none for you at the newspaper offices in Rouen .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 17]: Mr. Schofield was given directions in regard to supplying you with the missing issue at once .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 47]: `` I fear that you may have had difficulty in deciphering some of my former missives , as I was unfamiliar with the typewriter when I took charge of the ` Herald ' ; however , I trust that you find my later letters more legible .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 16]: `` The McCune people are not worrying us ; we are sure to defeat them .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 21]: The papers you speak of were found by Mr. Parker in your trunk , and are now in my hands .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 27]: `` I send with this a packet of communications and press clippings indicative of the success of the daily , and in regard to other innovations .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 51]: The letters from women commendatory of our ` Woman 's Page , ' thanking us for various house-keeping receipts , etc. , strike me as peculiarly interesting , as I admit that a ` Woman 's Page ' is always a difficult matter for a man to handle without absurdity .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 61]: `` Please do not think I mean to plume myself upon our various successes ; we attempted our innovations and enlargements at just the right time -- a time which you had ripened by years of work and waiting , and at the moment when you had built up the reputation of the ` Herald ' to its highest point .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 38]: Everything that has been done is successful only because you paved the way , and because every one knows it is your paper ; and the people believe that whatever your paper does is interesting and right .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 20]: `` Trusting that your recovery will be rapid , I am `` Yours truly , `` H. FISBEE . ''
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 9]: Harkless dropped the typewritten sheets with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 14]: `` I suppose I ought to get well , '' he said wearily .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 51]: `` Yes , '' said Meredith , `` I think you ought ; but you 're chock full of malaria and fever and all kinds of meanness , and -- '' `` You ` tend to your own troubles , '' returned the other , with an imitation of liveliness .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 17]: `` I -- I do n't think it interests me much , '' he said querulously .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 12]: He was often querulous of late , and it frightened Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 6]: `` I 'm just tired .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 50]: I am strong enough -- that is , I think I am till I try to move around , and then I 'm like a log , and a lethargy gets me -- that 's it ; I do n't think it 's malaria ; it 's lethargy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 7]: `` Lethargy comes from malaria . ''
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 9]: `` It 's the other way with me .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 16]: I 'd be all right if I only could get over this -- this tiredness .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 16]: Let me have that pencil and pad , will you , please , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 23]: He set the pad on his knee , and began to write languidly : `` ROUEN , _ September 2d _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 13]: _ Dear Mr. Fisbee _ : Yours of the 1st to hand .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 9]: I entirely approve all arrangements you have made .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 19]: I think you understand that I wish you to regard _ everything _ as in your own hands .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 32]: You are the editor of the ` Herald ' and have the sole responsibility for everything , including policy , until , after proper warning , I relieve you in person .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 16]: But until that time comes , you must look upon me as a mere spectator .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 27]: I do not fear that you will make any mistakes ; you have done very much better in all matters than I could have done myself .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 21]: At present I have only one suggestion : I observe that your editorials concerning Halloway 's renomination are something lukewarm .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 49]: `` It is very important that he be renominated , not altogether on account of assuring his return to Washington -LRB- for he is no Madison , I fear -RRB- , but the fellow McCune must be so beaten that his defeat will be remembered for twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 17]: Halloway is honest and clean , at least , while McCune is corrupt to the bone .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 41]: He has been bought and sold , and I am glad the proofs of it are in your hands , as you tell me Parker found them , as directed , in my trunk , and gave them to you .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 31]: `` The papers you hold drove him out of politics once , by the mere threat of publication ; you should have printed them last week , as I suggested .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 10]: Do so at once ; the time is short .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 41]: You have been too gentle ; it has the air of fearing to offend , and of catering , as if we were afraid of antagonizing people against us ; as though we had a personal stake in the convention .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 13]: Possibly you consider our subscription books as such ; I do not .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 11]: But if they are , go ahead twice as hard .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 36]: What if it does give the enemy a weapon in case McCune is nominated ; if he is -LRB- and I begin to see a danger of it -RRB- we will be with the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 17]: I do not carry my partisanship so far as to help elect Mr. McCune to Congress .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 25]: You have been as non-committal in your editorials as if this were a fit time for delicacy and the cheaper conception of party policy .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 31]: My notion of party policy -- no new one -- is that the party which considers the public service before it considers itself will thrive best in the long run .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 41]: The ` Herald ' is a little paper -LRB- not so little nowadays , after all , thanks to you -RRB- , but it is an honest one , and it is n't afraid of Rod McCune and his friends .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 25]: He is to be beaten , understand , if we have to send him to the penitentiary on an old issue to do it .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 15]: And if the people wish to believe us cruel or vengeful , let them .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 17]: Please let me see as hearty a word as you can say for Halloway , also .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 13]: You can write with ginger ; please show some in this matter .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 6]: `` My condition is improved .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 13]: `` I am , very truly yours , `` JOHN HARKLESS . ''
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 12]: When the letter was concluded , he handed it to Meredith .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 19]: `` Please address that , put a ` special ' on it , and send it , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 15]: It should go at once , so as to reach him by to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 5]: `` H. Fisbee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 7]: `` Yes ; H. Fisbee . ''
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 23]: `` I believe it does you good to write , boy , '' said the other , as he bent over him .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 13]: `` You look more chirrupy than you have for several days . ''
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 27]: `` It 's that beast , McCune ; young Fisbee is rather queer about it , and I felt stirred up as I went along . ''
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 25]: But even before the sentence was finished the favor of age and utter weariness returned , and the dark lids closed over his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 33]: They opened again , slowly , and he took the others hand and looked up at him mournfully , but as it were his soul shone forth in dumb and eloquent thanks .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 24]: `` I -- I 'm giving you a jolly summer , Tom , '' he said , with a quivering effort to smile .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 8]: `` Do n't you think I am ?
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 22]: I do n't -- I do n't know what I should have -- done -- '' `` You old Indian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 5]: said Meredith , tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 15]: Three days later , Tom was rejoiced by symptoms of invigoration in his patient .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 34]: A telegram came for Harkless , and Meredith , bringing it into the sick room , was surprised to find the occupant sitting straight up on his couch without the prop of pillows .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 23]: He was reading the day 's copy of the `` Herald , '' and his face was flushed and his brow stern .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 16]: `` Mismanagement , I hope , '' said the other , in a strong voice .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 5]: `` Worse , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 6]: It 's this young Fisbee .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 11]: I ca n't think what 's come over the fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 15]: I thought he was a rescuing angel , and he 's turning out bad .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 19]: I 'll swear it looks like they 'd been -- well , I wo n't say that yet .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 20]: But he has n't printed that McCune business I told you of , and he 's had two days .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 26]: There is less than a week before the convention , and -- '' He broke off , seeing the yellow envelope in Meredith 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 9]: `` Is that a telegram for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 7]: His companion gave it to him .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 9]: He tore it open and read the contents .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 6]: They were brief and unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 7]: `` Ca n't you do something ?
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 6]: Ca n't you come down ?
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 8]: It begins to look the other way .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 14]: `` K. H. '' `` It 's from Halloway , '' said John .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 7]: `` I have got to go .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 7]: What did that doctor say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 28]: `` He said two weeks at the earliest , or you 'll run into typhoid and complications from your hurts , and even pleasanter things than that .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 21]: I 've got you here , and here you stay ; so lie back and get easy , boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 10]: `` Then give me that pad and pencil . ''
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 16]: He rapidly dashed off a note to H. Fisbee : '' _ September 5th _ .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 12]: `` H. FISBEE , `` Editor ` Carlow Herald . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 55]: _ Dear Sir _ : You have not acknowledged my letter of the 2d September by a note -LRB- which should have reached me the following morning -RRB- , or by the alteration in the tenor of my columns which I requested , or by the publication of the McCune papers which I directed .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 9]: In this I hold you grossly at fault .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 53]: If you have a conscientious reason for refusing to carry out my request it should have been communicated to me at once , as should the fact -- if such be the case -- that you are a personal -LRB- or impersonal , if you like -RRB- friend of Mr. Rodney McCune .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 27]: Whatever the motive , ulterior or otherwise , which prevents you from operating my paper as I direct , I should have been informed of it .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 34]: This is a matter vital to the interests of our community , and you have hitherto shown yourself too alert in accepting my slightest suggestion for me to construe this failure as negligence .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 22]: Negligence I might esteem as at least honest and frank ; your course has been neither the one nor the other .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 14]: `` You will receive this letter by seven this evening by special delivery .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 13]: You will print the facts concerning McCune in to-morrow morning 's paper .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 23]: `` I am well aware of the obligations under which your extreme efficiency and your thoughtfulness in many matters have placed me .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 37]: It is to you I owe my unearned profits from the transaction in oil , and it is to you I owe the ` Herald 's ' extraordinary present circulation , growth of power and influence .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 19]: That power is still under my direction , and is an added responsibility which shall not be misapplied .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 11]: `` You must forgive me if I write too sharply .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 26]: You see I have failed to understand your silence ; and if I wrong you I heartily ask your pardon in advance of your explanation .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 9]: Is it that you are sorry for McCune ?
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 13]: It would be a weak pity that could keep you to silence .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 35]: I warned him long ago that the papers you hold would be published if he ever tried to return to political life , and he is deliberately counting on my physical weakness and absence .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 15]: Let him rely upon it ; I am not so weak as he thinks .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 12]: Personally , I can not say that I dislike Mr. McCune .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 45]: I have found him a very entertaining fellow ; it is said he is the best of husbands , and a friend to some of his friends , and , believe me , I am sorry for him from the bottom of my heart .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 8]: But the ` Herald ' is not .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 8]: `` You need not reply by letter .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 7]: To-morrow 's issue answers for you .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 12]: Until I have received a copy , I withhold my judgment .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 5]: `` JOHN HARKLESS . ''
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 216]: The morrow 's issue -- that fateful print on which depended John Harkless 's opinion of H. Fisbee 's integrity -- contained an editorial addressed to the delegates of the convention , warning them to act for the vital interest of the community , and declaring that the opportunity to be given them in the present convention was a rare one , a singular piece of good fortune indeed ; they were to have the chance to vote for a man who had won the love and respect of every person in the district -- one who had suffered for his championship of righteousness -- one whom even his few political enemies confessed they held in personal affection and esteem -- one who had been the inspiration of a new era -- one whose life had been helpfulness , whose hand had reached out to every struggler and unfortunate -- a man who had met and faced danger for the sake of others -- one who lived under a threat for years , and who had been almost overborne in the fulfilment of that threat , but who would live to see the sun shine on his triumph , the tribute the convention would bring him as a gift from a community that loved him .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 21]: His name needed not to be told ; it was on every lip that morning , and in every heart .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 10]: Tom was eagerly watching his companion as he read .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 30]: Harkless fell back on the pillows with a drawn face , and for a moment he laid his thin hand over his eyes in a gesture of intense pain .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 4]: Meredith said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 9]: `` Give me the pad , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 8]: `` What is it , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 7]: The other 's teeth snapped together .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 5]: `` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 11]: It 's treachery , and the worst I ever knew .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 15]: Not a word of the accusation I demanded -- lying _ praises _ instead !
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 11]: Read that editorial -- there , _ there _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 18]: He struck the page with the back of his hand , and threw the paper to Meredith .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 6]: `` Read that miserable lie !
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 17]: ` One who has won the love and respect of every person in the district ! '
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 13]: -- ` One who has suffered for his championship of righteousness ! '
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 3]: _ Righteousness !
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 6]: _ Save the mark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 7]: `` What does it mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 3]: `` Mean !
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 23]: It means McCune -- Rod McCune , ` who has lived under a threat for years ' -- _ my _ threat !
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 23]: I swore I would print him out of Indiana if he ever raised his head again , and he knew I could .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 11]: ` Almost overborne in the fulfilment of that threat ! '
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 4]: _ Almost _ !
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 12]: It 's a black scheme , and I see it now .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 20]: This man came to Plattville and went on the ` Herald ' for nothing in the world but this .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 8]: It 's McCune 's hand all along .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 11]: He dare n't name him even now , the coward !
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 15]: The trick lies between McCune and young Fisbee -- the old man is innocent .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 5]: Give me the pad .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 6]: Not _ almost _ overborne .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 31]: There are three good days to work in , and , by the gods of Perdition , if Rod McCune sees Congress it will be in his next incarnation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 17]: He rapidly scribbled a few lines on the pad , and threw the sheets to Meredith .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 15]: `` Get those telegrams to the Western Union office in a rush , please .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 5]: Read them first . ''
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 9]: With a very red face Tom read them .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 17]: One was addressed to H. Fisbee : `` You are relieved from the cares of editorship .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 15]: You will turn over the management of the ` Herald ' to Warren Smith .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 8]: You will give him the McCune papers .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 22]: If you do not , or if you destroy them , you can not hide where I shall not find you .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 5]: `` JOHN HARKLESS . ''
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 14]: The second was to Warren Smith : `` Take possession ` Herald . '
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 4]: Dismiss H. Fisbee .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 4]: This your authority .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 12]: Publish McCune papers so labelled which H. Fisbee will hand you .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 3]: Letter follows .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 3]: Beat McCune .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 5]: `` JOHN HARKLESS . ''
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 30]: The author of the curt epistles tossed restlessly on his couch , but the reader of them stared , incredulous and dumfounded , uncertain of his command of gravity .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 78]: His jaw fell , and his open mouth might have betokened a being smit to imbecility ; and , haply , he might be , for Helen had written him from Plattville , pledging his honor to secrecy with the first words , and it was by her command that he had found excuses for not supplying his patient with all the papers which happened to contain references to the change of date for the Plattville convention .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 32]: And Meredith had known for some time where James Fisbee had found a `` young relative '' to be the savior of the `` Herald '' for his benefactor 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 15]: `` You mean -- you -- intend to -- you discharge young Fisbee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 5]: he stammered at last .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 16]: Let me have the answers the instant they come , will you , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 33]: Then Harkless turned his face from the wall and spoke through his teeth : `` I mean to see H. Fisbee before many days ; I want to talk to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 29]: But , though he tossed and fretted himself into what the doctor pronounced a decidedly improved state , no answer came to either telegram that day or night .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 26]: The next morning a messenger boy stumbled up the front steps and handed the colored man , Jim , four yellow envelopes , night messages .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 12]: Three of them were for Harkless , one was for Meredith .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 22]: Jim carried them upstairs , left the three with his master 's guest , then knocked on his master 's door .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 5]: answered a thick voice .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 6]: Meredith had not yet risen .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 4]: `` A telegraph .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 5]: Mist ' Tawm . ''
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 6]: There was a terrific yawn .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 3]: `` O-o-oh !
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 11]: Slide it -- oh -- under the -- door . ''
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 4]: `` Yessuh . ''
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 18]: Meredith lay quite without motion for several minutes , sleepily watching the yellow rhomboid in the crevice .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 19]: It was a hateful looking thing to come mixing in with pleasant dreams and insist upon being read .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 22]: After a while he climbed groaningly out of bed , and read the message with heavy eyes , still half asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 14]: He read it twice before it penetrated : `` Suppress all newspapers to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 5]: Convention meets at eleven .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 12]: If we succeed a delegation will come to Rouen this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 4]: They will come .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 4]: `` HELEN . ''
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 41]: Tom rubbed his sticky eyelids , and shook his head violently in a Spartan effort to rouse himself ; but what more effectively performed the task for him were certain sounds issuing from Harkless 's room , across the hall .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 53]: For some minutes , Meredith had been dully conscious of a rustle and stir in the invalid 's chamber , and he began to realize that no mere tossing about a bed would account for a noise that reached him across a wide hall and through two closed doors of thick walnut .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 29]: Suddenly he heard a quick , heavy tread , shod , in Harkless 's room , and a resounding bang , as some heavy object struck the floor .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 14]: The doctor was not to come till evening ; Jim had gone down-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 10]: Who wore shoes in the sick man 's room ?
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 15]: He rushed across the hall in his pyjamas and threw open the unlocked door .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 7]: The bed was disarranged and vacant .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 22]: Harkless , fully dressed , was standing in the middle of the floor , hurling garments at a big travelling bag .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 25]: The horrified Meredith stood for a second , bleached and speechless , then he rushed upon his friend and seized him with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 6]: `` Mad , by heaven !
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 3]: Mad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 9]: `` Let go of me , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 3]: `` Lunatic !
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 3]: Lunatic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 9]: `` Do n't stop me one instant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 9]: Meredith tried to force him toward the bed .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 11]: `` For mercy 's sake , get back to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 7]: You 're delirious , boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 4]: `` Delirious nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 7]: I 'm a well man . ''
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 10]: `` Go to bed -- go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 11]: Harkless set him out of the way with one arm .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 6]: `` Bed be hanged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 8]: `` I 'm going to Plattville ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 5]: Meredith wrung his hands .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 6]: `` The doctor -- '' !
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 6]: `` Doctor be damned ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 12]: `` Will you tell me what has happened , John ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 56]: His companion slung a light overcoat , unfolded , on the overflowing , misshapen bundle of clothes that lay in the bag ; then he jumped on the lid with both feet and kicked the hasp into the lock ; a very elegantly laundered cuff and white sleeve dangling out from between the fastened lids .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 48]: `` I have n't one second to talk , Tom ; I have seventeen minutes to catch the express , and it 's a mile and a half to the station ; the train leaves here at eight fifty , I get to Plattville at ten forty-seven .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 27]: Telephone for a cab for me , please , or tell me the number ; I do n't want to stop to hunt it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 7]: Meredith looked him in the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 10]: In the pupils of Harkless flared a fierce light .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 67]: His cheeks were reddened with an angry , healthy glow , and his teeth were clenched till the line of his jaw stood out like that of an embattled athlete in sculpture ; his brow was dark ; his chest was thrown out , and he took deep , quick breaths ; his shoulders were squared , and in spite of his thinness they looked massy .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 17]: Lethargy , or malaria , or both , whatever were his ailments , they were gone .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 11]: He was six feet of hot wrath and cold resolution .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 9]: Tom said : `` You are going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' he answered , `` I am going . ''
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 9]: `` Then I will go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 12]: `` Thank you , Tom , '' said the other quietly .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 41]: Meredith ran into his own room , pressed an electric button , sprang out of his pyjamas like Aphrodite from the white sea-foam , and began to dive into his clothes with a panting rapidity astonishingly foreign to his desire .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 6]: Jim appeared in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 11]: `` The cart , Jim , '' shouted his master .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 7]: `` We want it like lightning .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 13]: Tell the cook to give Mr. Harkless his breakfast in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 15]: Set a cup of coffee on the table by the front door for me .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 5]: Run like the deuce !
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 8]: We 've got to catch a train .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 15]: -- That will be quicker than any cab , '' he explained to Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 15]: `` We 'll break the ordinance against fast driving , getting down there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 19]: Ten minutes later the cart swept away from the house at a gait which pained the respectable neighborhood .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 72]: The big horse plunged through the air , his ears laid flat toward his tail ; the cart careened sickeningly ; the face of the servant clutching at the rail in the rear was smeared with pallor as they pirouetted around curves on one wheel -- to him it seemed they skirted the corners and Death simultaneously -- and the speed of their going made a strong wind in their faces .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 4]: Harkless leaned forward .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 12]: `` Can you make it a little faster , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 48]: They dashed up to the station amid the cries of people flying to the walls for safety ; the two gentlemen leaped from the cart , bore down upon the ticket-office , stormed at the agent , and ran madly at the gates , flourishing their passports .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 13]: The official on duty eyed them wearily , and barred the way .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 15]: `` Been gone two minutes , '' he remarked , with a peaceable yawn .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 29]: Harkless stamped his foot on the cement flags ; then he stood stock still , gazing at the empty tracks ; but Meredith turned to him , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 7]: `` Wo n't it keep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 11]: `` Yes , it will keep , '' John answered .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 22]: `` Part of it may have to keep till election day , but some of it I will settle before night .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 27]: And that , '' he cried , between his teeth , `` and that is the part of it in regard to young Mr. Fisbee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 13]: `` Oh , it 's about H. Fisbee , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 9]: `` Yes , it 's H. Fisbee . ''
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 24]: `` Well , we might as well go up and see what the doctor thinks of you ; there 's no train . ''
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 19]: `` I do n't want to see a doctor again , ever -- as long as I live .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 8]: I 'm as well as anybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 20]: Tom burst out laughing , and clapped his companion lightly on the shoulder , his eyes dancing with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 15]: `` Upon my soul , '' he cried , `` I believe you are !
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 50]: It 's against all my tradition , and I see I am the gull of poetry ; for I 've always believed it to be beyond question that this sort of miracle was wrought , not by rage , but by the tenderer senti -- '' Tom checked himself .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 10]: `` Well , let 's take a drive . ''
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 43]: `` Meredith , '' said the other , turning to him gravely , `` you may think me a fool , if you will , and it 's likely I am ; but I do n't leave this station except by train .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 34]: I 've only two days to work in , and every minute lessens our chances to beat McCune , and I have to begin by wasting time on a tussle with a traitor .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 20]: There 's another train at eleven fifty-five ; I do n't take any chances on missing that one . ''
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 51]: `` Well , well , '' laughed his friend , pushing him good-humoredly toward a door by a red and white striped pillar , `` we 'll wait here , if you like ; but at least go in there and get a shave ; it 's a clean shop .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 17]: You want to look your best if you are going down to fight H. Fisbee . ''
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 34]: `` Take these , then , and you will understand , '' said Harkless ; and he thrust his three telegrams of the morning into Tom 's hand and disappeared into the barber-shop .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 32]: When he was gone , Meredith went to the telegraph office in the station , and sent a line over the wire to Helen : `` Keep your delegation at home .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 8]: He 's coming on the 11.55 . ''
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 11]: Then he read the three telegrams Harkless had given him .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 12]: They were all from Plattville : `` Sorry can not oblige .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 4]: Present incumbent tenacious .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 4]: Unconditionally refuses surrender .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 3]: Delicate matter .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 6]: No hope for K. H .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 5]: But do n't worry .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 4]: Everything all right .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 5]: `` WARREN SMITH . ''
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 17]: `` Harkless , if you have the strength to walk , come down before the convention .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 5]: Get here by 10.47 .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 3]: Looks bad .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 6]: Come if it kills you .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 20]: `` K. H. '' `` You entrusted me with sole responsibility for all matters pertaining to ` Herald . '
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 5]: Declared yourself mere spectator .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 12]: Does this permit your interfering with my policy for the paper ?
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 19]: Decline to consider any proposition to relieve me of my duties without proper warning and allowance of time .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 5]: `` H. FISBEE . ''
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 81]: THE GREAT HARKLESS COMES HOME The accommodation train wandered languidly through the early afternoon sunshine , stopping at every village and almost every country post-office on the line ; the engine toot-tooting at the road crossings ; and , now and again , at such junctures , a farmer , struggling with a team of prancing horses , would be seen , or , it might be , a group of school children , homeward bound from seats of learning .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 51]: At each station , when the train came to a stand-still , some passenger , hanging head and elbows out of his window , like a quilt draped over a chair , would address a citizen on the platform : `` Hey , Sam , how 's Miz Bushkirk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 6]: `` She 's wal . ''
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 9]: `` Where 's Milt , this afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 6]: `` Warshing the buggy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 20]: Then at the cry , `` All ` board '' -- `` See you Sunday over at Amo . ''
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 6]: `` You make Milt come .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 7]: I 'll be there , shore .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 4]: So long . ''
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 86]: There was an impatient passenger in the smoker , who found the stoppages at these wayside hamlets interminable , both in frequency and in the delay at each of them ; and while the dawdling train remained inert , and the moments passed inactive , his eyes dilated and his hand clenched till the nails bit his palm ; then , when the trucks groaned and the wheels crooned against the rails once more , he sank back in his seat with sighs of relief .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 30]: Sometimes he would get up and pace the aisle until his companion reminded him that this was not certain to hasten the hour of their arrival at their destination .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 20]: `` I know that , '' answered the other , `` but I 've got to beat McCune . ''
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 17]: `` By the way , '' observed Meredith , `` you left your stick behind . ''
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 16]: `` You do n't think I need a club to face -- '' Tom choked .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 5]: `` Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 12]: I was n't thinking of your giving H. Fisbee a thrashing .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 7]: I meant to lean on . ''
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 7]: `` I do n't want it .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 22]: I 've got to walk lame all my life , but I 'm not going to hobble on a stick . ''
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 24]: Tom looked at him sadly ; for it was true , and the Cross-Roaders might hug themselves in their cells over the thought .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 38]: For the rest of his life John Harkless was to walk with just the limp they themselves would have had , if , as in former days , their sentence had been to the ball and chain .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 55]: The window was open beside the two young men , and the breeze swept in , fresh from the wide fields , There was a tang in the air ; it soothed like a balm , but there was a spur to energy and heartiness in its crispness , the wholesome touch of fall .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 25]: John looked out over the boundless aisles of corn that stood higher than a tall man could reach ; long waves rippled across them .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 29]: Here , where the cry of the brave had rung in forest glades , where the painted tribes had hastened , were marshalled the tasselled armies of peace .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 62]: And beyond these , where the train ran between shadowy groves , delicate landscape vistas , framed in branches , opened , closed , and succeeded each other , and then the travellers were carried out into the level open again , and the intensely blue September skies ran down to the low horizon , meeting the tossing plumes of corn .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 39]: It takes a long time for the full beauty of the flat lands to reach a man 's soul ; once there , nor hills , nor sea , nor growing fan leaves of palm shall suffice him .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 12]: It is like the beauty in the word `` Indiana . ''
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 36]: It may be that there are people who do not consider `` Indiana '' a beautiful word ; but once it rings true in your ears it has a richer sound than `` Vallombrosa . ''
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 20]: There was a newness in the atmosphere that day , a bright invigoration , that set the blood tingling .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 11]: The hot months were done with , languor was routed .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 42]: Autumn spoke to industry , told of the sowing of another harvest , of the tawny shock , of the purple grape , of the red apple , and called upon muscle and laughter ; breathed gaiety into men 's hearts .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 44]: The little stations hummed with bustle and noise ; big farm wagons rattled away and raced with cut-under or omnibus ; people walked with quick steps ; the baggage-masters called cheerily to the trainmen , and the brakemen laughed good-bys to rollicking girls .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 37]: As they left Gainesville three children , clad in calico , barefoot and bareheaded , came romping out of a log cabin on the outskirts of the town , and waved their hands to the passengers .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 34]: They climbed on the sagging gate in front of their humble domain , and laughed for joy to see the monstrous caravan come clattering out of the unknown , bearing the faces by .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 43]: The smallest child , a little cherubic tow-head , whose cheeks were smeared with clean earth and the tracks of forgotten tears , stood upright on a fence-post , and blew the most impudent of kisses to the strangers on a journey .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 87]: Beyond this they came into a great plain , acres and acres of green rag-weed where the wheat had grown , all so flat one thought of an enormous billiard table , and now , where the railroad crossed the country roads , they saw the staunch brown thistle , sometimes the sumach , and always the graceful iron-weed , slender , tall , proud , bowing a purple-turbaned head , or shaking in an agony of fright when it stood too close to the train .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 93]: The fields , like great , flat emeralds set in new metal , were bordered with golden-rod , and at sight of this the heart leaped ; for the golden-rod is a symbol of stored granaries , of ripe sheaves , of the kindness of the season generously given and abundantly received ; more , it is the token of a land of promise and of bounteous fulfilment ; and the plant stains its blossom with yellow so that when it falls it pays tribute to the ground which has nourished it .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 75]: From the plain they passed again into a thick wood , where ruddy arrows of the sun glinted among the boughs ; and , here and there , one saw a courtly maple or royal oak wearing a gala mantle of crimson and pale brown , gallants of the forest preparing early for the October masquerade , when they should hold wanton carnival , before they stripped them of their finery for pious gray .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 104]: And when the coughing engine drew them to the borders of this wood , they rolled out into another rich plain of green and rust-colored corn ; and far to the south John Harkless marked a winding procession of sycamores , which , he knew , followed the course of a slender stream ; and the waters of the stream flowed by a bank where wild thyme might have grown , and where , beyond an orchard and a rose-garden , a rustic bench was placed in the shade of the trees ; and the name of the stream was Hibbard 's Creek .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 78]: Here the land lay flatter than elsewhere ; the sky came closer , with a gentler benediction ; the breeze blew in , laden with keener spices ; there was the flavor of apples and the smell of the walnut and a hint of coming frost ; the immeasurable earth lay more patiently to await the husbandman ; and the whole world seemed to extend flat in line with the eye -- for this was Carlow County .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 22]: All at once the anger ran out of John Harkless ; he was a hard man for anger to tarry with .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 17]: And in place of it a strong sense of home-coming began to take possession of him .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 5]: He was going home .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 28]: `` Back to Plattville , where I belong , '' he had said ; and he said it again without bitterness , for it was the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 13]: `` Every man cometh to his own place in the end . ''
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 38]: Yes , as one leaves a gay acquaintance of the playhouse lobby for some hard-handed , tried old friend , so he would wave the outer world God-speed and come back to the old ways of Carlow .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 21]: What though the years were dusty , he had his friends and his memories and his old black brier pipe .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 32]: He had a girl 's picture that he should carry in his heart till his last day ; and if his life was sadder , it was infinitely richer for it .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 32]: His winter fireside should be not so lonely for her sake ; and losing her , he lost not everything , for he had the rare blessing of having known her .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 13]: And what man could wish to be healed of such a hurt ?
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 14]: Far better to have had it than to trot a smug pace unscathed .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 17]: He had been a dullard ; he had lain prostrate in the wretchedness of his loss .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 20]: `` A girl you could put in your hat -- and there you have a strong man prone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 24]: He had been a sluggard , weary of himself , unfit to fight , a failure in life and a failure in love .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 20]: That was ended ; he was tired of failing , and it was time to succeed for a while .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 33]: To accept the worst that Fate can deal , and to wring courage from it instead of despair , that is success ; and it was the success that he would have .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 8]: He would take Fate by the neck .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 7]: But had it done him unkindness ?
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 21]: He looked out over the beautiful , `` monotonous '' landscape , and he answered heartily , `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 19]: There was ignorance in man , but no unkindness ; were man utterly wise he were utterly kind .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 11]: The Cross-Roaders had not known better ; that was all .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 12]: The unfolding aisles of corn swam pleasantly before John 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 20]: The earth hearkened to man 's wants and answered ; the clement sun and summer rains hastened the fruition .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 27]: Yonder stood the brown haystack , garnered to feed the industrious horse who had earned his meed ; there was the straw-thatched shelter for the cattle .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 9]: How the orchard boughs bent with their burdens !
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 43]: The big red barns stood stored with the harvested wheat ; and , beyond the pasture-lands , tall trees rose against the benign sky to feed the glance of a dreamer ; the fertile soil lay lavender and glossy in the furrow .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 31]: The farmhouses were warmly built and hale and strong ; no winter blast should rage so bitterly as to shake them , or scatter the hospitable embers on the hearth .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 12]: For this was Carlow County , and he was coming home .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 5]: They crossed a by-road .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 27]: An old man with a streaky gray chin-beard was sitting on a sack of oats in a seatless wagon , waiting for the train to pass .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 9]: Harkless seized his companion excitedly by the elbow .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 4]: `` Tommy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 8]: `` It 's Kim Fentriss -- look !
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 8]: Did you see that old fellow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 19]: `` I saw a particularly uninterested and uninteresting gentleman sitting on a bag , '' replied his friend .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 9]: `` Why , that 's old Kimball Fentriss .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 16]: He 's going to town ; he lives on the edge of the county . ''
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 7]: `` Can this be true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 4]: said Meredith gravely .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 25]: `` I wonder , '' said Harkless thoughtfully , a few moments later , `` I wonder why he had them changed around . ''
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 6]: `` Who changed around ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 4]: `` The team .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 20]: He always used to drive the bay on the near side , and the sorrel on the off . ''
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 32]: `` And at present , '' rejoined Meredith , `` I am to understand that he is driving the sorrel on the near side , and bay on the off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 10]: `` That 's it , '' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 19]: `` He must have worked them like that for some time , because they did n't look uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 11]: They 're all right about the train , those two .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 14]: I 've seen them stand with their heads almost against a fast freight .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 4]: See there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 11]: He pointed to a white frame farmhouse with green blinds .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 7]: `` That 's Win Hibbard 's .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 8]: We 're just outside of Beaver . ''
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 3]: `` Beaver ?
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 6]: Elucidate Beaver , boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 3]: `` Beaver ?
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 8]: Meredith , your information ends at home .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 15]: What do you know of your own State if you are ignorant of Beaver .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 16]: Beaver is that city of Carlow County next in importance and population to Plattville . ''
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 9]: Tom put his head out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 11]: `` I fancy you are right , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 9]: `` I already see five people there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 11]: Meredith had observed the change in his companion 's mood .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 74]: He had watched him closely all day , looking for a return of his malady ; but he came to the conclusion that in truth a miracle had been wrought , for the lethargy was gone , and vigor seemed to increase in Harkless with every turn of the wheels that brought them nearer Plattville ; and the nearer they drew to Plattville the higher the spirits of both the young men rose .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 16]: Meredith knew what was happening there , and he began to be a little excited .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 42]: As he had said , there were five people visible at Beaver ; and he wondered where they lived , as the only building in sight was the station , and to satisfy his curiosity he walked out to the vestibule .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 16]: The little station stood in deep woods , and brown leaves whirled along the platform .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 17]: One of the five people was an old lady , and she entered a rear car .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 6]: The other four were men .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 9]: One of them handed the conductor a telegram .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 10]: Meredith heard the official say , `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 3]: Decorate ahead .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 8]: I 'll hold it five minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 13]: The man sprang up the steps of the smoker and looked in .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 20]: He turned to Meredith : `` Do you know if that gentleman in the gray coat is Mr. Harkless ?
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 17]: He 's got his back this way , and I do n't want to go inside .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 14]: The -- the air in a smoker always gives me a spell . ''
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 9]: `` Yes , that 's Mr. Harkless . ''
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 7]: The man jumped to the platform .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 10]: `` All right , boys , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 6]: `` Rip her out . ''
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 23]: The doors of the freight-room were thrown open , and a big bundle of colored stuffs was dragged out and hastily unfolded .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 43]: One of the men ran to the further end of the car with a strip of red , white and blue bunting , and tacked it securely , while another fastened the other extremity to the railing of the steps by Meredith .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 21]: The two companions of this pair performed the same operation with another strip on the other side of the car .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 32]: They ran similar strips of bunting along the roof from end to end , so that , except for the windows , the car was completely covered by the national colors .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 8]: Then they draped the vestibules with flags .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 8]: It was all done in a trice .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 7]: Meredith 's heart was beating fast .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 8]: `` What 's it all about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 20]: `` Picnic down the line , '' answered the man in charge , removing a tack from his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 11]: He motioned to the conductor , `` Go ahead . ''
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 38]: The wheels began to move ; the decorators remained on the platform , letting the train pass them ; but Meredith , craning his neck from the steps , saw that they jumped on the last car .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 7]: `` What 's the celebration ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 7]: asked Harkless , when Meredith returned .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 10]: `` Picnic down the line , '' said Meredith .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 16]: `` Nipping weather for a picnic ; a little cool , do n't you think ?
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 11]: One of those fellows looked like a friend of mine .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 14]: Homer Tibbs , or as Homer might look if he were in disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 32]: He had his hat hung on his eyes , and he slouched like a thief in melodrama , as he tacked up the bunting on this side of the car . ''
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 24]: He continued to point out various familiar places , finally breaking out enthusiastically , as they drew nearer the town , `` Hello !
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 8]: Look there -- beyond the grove yonder !
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 5]: See that house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 6]: `` Yes , John . ''
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 7]: `` That 's the Bowlders ' .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 9]: You 've got to know the Bowlders . ''
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 7]: `` I 'd like to . ''
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 8]: `` The kindest people in the world .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 31]: The Briscoe house we ca n't see , because it 's so shut in by trees ; and , besides , it 's a mile or so ahead of us .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 9]: We 'll go out there for supper to-night .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 6]: Do n't you like Briscoe ?
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 7]: He 's the best they make .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 23]: We 'll go up town with Judd Bennett in the omnibus , and you 'll know how a rapid-fire machine gun sounds .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 22]: I want to go straight to the ` Herald ' office , '' he finished , with a suddenly darkening brow .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 19]: `` After all , there may be some explanation , '' Meredith suggested , with a little hesitancy .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 13]: `` H. Fisbee might turn out more honest than you think . ''
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 28]: Harkless threw his head back and laughed ; it was the first time Meredith had heard him laugh since the night of the dance in the country .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 3]: `` Honest !
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 9]: A man in the pay of Rodney McCune !
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 12]: Well , we can let it wait till we get there .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 2]: Listen !
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 12]: There 's the whistle that means we 're getting near home .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 9]: By heaven , there 's an oil-well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 6]: `` So it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 16]: `` And another -- three -- five -- seven -- seven in sight at once !
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 20]: They tried it three miles south and failed ; but you ca n't fool Eph Watts , bless him !
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 8]: I want you to know Watts . ''
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 29]: They were running by the outlying houses of the town , amidst a thousand descriptive exclamations from Harkless , who wished Meredith to meet every one in Carlow .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 13]: But he came to a pause in the middle of a word .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 7]: `` Do you hear music ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 4]: he asked abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 12]: `` Or is it only the rhythm of the ties ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 17]: `` It seems to me there 's music in the air , '' answered his companion .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 14]: `` I 've been fancying I heard it for a minute or so .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 4]: No -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 10]: It 's a band , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 36]: `` No ; what would a band -- '' The train slowed up , and stopped at a watertank , two hundred yards east of the station , and their uncertainty was at an end .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 13]: From somewhere down the track came the detonating boom of a cannon .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 22]: There was a dash of brass , and the travellers became aware of a band playing `` Marching through Georgia . ''
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 10]: Meredith laid his hand on his companion 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 31]: `` John , '' he said , `` John -- '' The cannon fired again , and there came a cheer from three thousand throats , the shouters all unseen .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 55]: The engine coughed and panted , the train rolled on , and in another minute it had stopped alongside the station in the midst of a riotous jam of happy people , who were waving flags and banners and handkerchiefs , and tossing their hats high in the air , and shouting themselves hoarse .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 14]: The band played in dumb show ; it could not hear itself play .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 30]: The people came at the smoker like a long wave , and Warren Smith , Briscoe , Keating , and Mr. Bence of Gaines were swept ahead of it .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 16]: Before the train stopped they had rushed eagerly up the steps and entered the car .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 11]: Harkless was on his feet and started to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 3]: He stopped .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 7]: `` What does it mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 9]: he said , and began to grow pale .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 23]: `` Is Halloway -- did McCune -- have you -- '' Warren Smith seized one of his hands and Briscoe the other .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 7]: `` What does it mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 21]: cried Warren ; `` it means that you were nominated for Congress at five minutes after one-o'clock this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 23]: `` On the second ballot , '' shouted the Judge , `` just as young Fisbee planned it , weeks ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 12]: It was one of the great crowds of Carlow 's history .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 34]: They had known since morning that he was coming home , and the gentlemen of the Reception Committee had some busy hours ; but long before the train arrived , everything was ready .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 35]: Homer Tibbs had done his work well at Beaver , and the gray-haired veterans of a battery Carlow had sent out in '61 had placed their worn old gun in position to fire salutes .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 79]: At one-o'clock , immediately after the nomination had been made unanimous , the Harkless Clubs of Carlow , Amo , and Gaines , secretly organized during the quiet agitation preceding the convention , formed on parade in the court-house yard , and , with the Plattville Band at their head , paraded the streets to the station , to make sure of being on hand when the train arrived -- it was due in a couple of hours .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 25]: There they were joined by an increasing number of glad enthusiasts , all noisy , exhilarated , red-faced with shouting , and patriotically happy .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 100]: As Mr. Bence , himself the spoiled child of another county , generously said , in a speech , which -LRB- with no outrageous pressure -RRB- he was induced to make during the long wait : `` The favorite son of Carlow is returning to his Lares and Penates like another Cincinnatus accepting the call of the people ; and , for the first time in sixteen years , Carlow shall have a representative to bear the banner of this district and the flaming torch of Progress sweeping on to Washington and triumph like a speedy galleon of old .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 40]: And his friends are here to take his hand and do him homage , and the number of his friends is as the number given in the last census of the population of the counties of this district ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 16]: And , indeed , in this estimate the speaker seemed guilty of no great exaggeration .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 40]: A never intermittent procession of pedestrians and vehicles made its way to the station ; and every wagon , buckboard , buggy , and cut-under had its flags or bunting , or streamer of ribbons tied to the whip .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 52]: The excitement increased as the time grew shorter ; those on foot struggled for better positions , and the people in wagons and carriages stood upon seats , while the pedestrians besieged them , climbing on the wheels , or balancing recklessly , with feet on the hubs of opposite wagons .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 9]: Everybody was bound to see _ him _ .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 44]: When the whistle announced the coming of the train , the band began to play , the cannon fired , horns blew , and the cheering echoed and reechoed till heaven 's vault resounded with the noise the people of Carlow were making .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 9]: There was one heart which almost stopped beating .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 63]: Helen was standing on the front seat of the Briscoe buckboard , with Minnie beside her , and , at the commotion , the horses pranced and backed so that Lige Willetts ran to hold them ; but she did not notice the frightened roans , nor did she know that Minnie clutched her round the waist to keep her from falling .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 51]: Her eyes were fixed intently on the smoke of the far-away engine , and her hand , lifted to her face in an uncertain , tremulous fashion , as it was one day in a circus tent , pressed against the deepest blush that ever mantled a girl 's cheek .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 61]: When the train reached the platform , she saw Briscoe and the others rush into the car , and there ensued what was to her an almost intolerable pause of expectation , while the crowd besieged the windows of the smoker , leaning up and climbing on each other 's shoulders to catch the first glimpse of _ him _ .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 32]: Briscoe and a red-faced young man , a stranger to Plattville , came down the steps , laughing like boys , and then Keating and Bence , and then Warren Smith .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 23]: As the lawyer reached the platform , he turned toward the door of the car and waved his hand as in welcome .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 8]: `` Here he is , boys ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 8]: he shouted , `` Welcome Home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 21]: At that it was as if all the noise that had gone before had been mere leakage of pent-up enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 69]: A thousand horns blared deafeningly , the whistles of the engine and of Hibbard 's mill were added to the din , the court-house bell was pealing out a welcome , and the church bells were ringing , the cannon thundered , and then cheer on cheer shook the air , as John Harkless came out under the flags , and passed down the steps of the car .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 64]: When Helen saw him , over the heads of the people and through a flying tumult of flags and hats and handkerchiefs , she gave one frightened glance about her , and jumped down from her high perch , and sank into the back seat of the buckboard with her burning face turned from the station and her eyes fixed on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 21]: She wanted to run away , as she had run from him the first time she had ever seen him .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 61]: Then , as now , he came in triumph , hailed by the plaudits of his fellows ; and now , as on that long-departed day of her young girlhood , he was borne high over the heads of the people , for Minnie cried to her to look ; they were carrying him on their shoulders to his carriage .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 44]: She had had only that brief glimpse of him , before he was lost in the crowd that was so glad to get him back again and so proud of him ; but she had seen that he looked very white and solemn .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 17]: Briscoe and Tom Meredith made their way through the crowd , and climbed into the buckboard .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 21]: `` All right , Lige , '' called the judge to Willetts , who was at the horses ' heads .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 14]: `` You go get into line with the boys ; they want you .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 26]: We 'll go down on Main Street to see the parade , '' he explained to the ladies , gathering the reins in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 65]: He clucked to the roans , and by dint of backing and twisting and turning and a hundred intricate manoeuvres , accompanied by entreaties and remonstrances and objurgations , addressed to the occupants of surrounding vehicles , he managed to extricate the buckboard from the press ; and once free , the team went down the road toward Main Street at a lively gait .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 19]: The judge 's call to the colts rang out cheerily ; his handsome face was one broad smile .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 28]: `` This is a big day for Carlow , '' he said ; `` I do n't remember a better day 's work in twenty years . ''
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 10]: `` Did you tell him about Mr. Halloway ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 7]: asked Helen , leaning forward anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 14]: `` Warren told him before we left the car , '' answered Briscoe .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 27]: `` He 'd have declined on the spot , I expect , if we had n't made him sure it was all right with Kedge . ''
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 21]: `` If I understood what Mr. Smith was saying , Halloway must have behaved very well , '' said Meredith .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 4]: The judge laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 33]: `` He saw it was the only way to beat McCune , and he 'd have given his life and Harkless 's , too , rather than let McCune have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 12]: `` Why did n't you stay with him , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 3]: asked Helen .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 4]: `` With Halloway ?
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 7]: I do n't know him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 18]: `` One forgives a generous hilarity anything , even such quips as that , '' she retorted .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 11]: `` Why did you not stay with Mr. Harkless ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 14]: `` That 's very hospitable of you , '' laughed the young man .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 14]: `` You forget that I have the felicity to sit at your side .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 33]: Judge Briscoe has been kind enough to ask me to review the procession from his buckboard and to sup at his house with other distinguished visitors , and I have accepted . ''
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 13]: `` But did n't he wish you to remain with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 22]: `` But this second I had the honor to inform you that I am here distinctly by his invitation . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 5]: _ His _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 5]: `` Precisely , his .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 14]: Judge Briscoe , Miss Sherwood will not believe that you desire my presence .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 27]: If I intrude , pray let me -- '' He made as if to spring from the buckboard , and the girl seized his arm impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 8]: `` You are a pitiful nonsense-monger ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 18]: she cried ; and for some reason this speech made him turn his glasses upon her gravely .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 19]: Her lashes fell before his gaze , and at that he took her hand and kissed it quickly .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 9]: `` No , no , '' she faltered .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 7]: `` You must not think it .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 14]: It is n't -- you see , I -- there is nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 26]: `` You shall not dull the edge of my hilarity , '' he answered , `` especially since so much may be forgiven it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 9]: `` Why did you leave Mr. Harkless ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 8]: she asked , without raising her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 101]: `` My dear girl , '' he replied , `` because , for some inexplicable reason , my lady cousin has not nominated me for Congress , but instead has chosen to bestow that distinction upon another , and , I may say , an unworthier and unfitter man than I. And , oddly enough , the non-discriminating multitude were not cheering for me ; the artillery was not in action to celebrate me ; the band was not playing to do me honor ; therefore why should I ride in the midst of a procession that knows me not ?
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 47]: Why should I enthrone me in an open barouche -- a little faded and possibly not quite secure as to its springs , but still a barouche -- with four white horses to draw it , and draped with silken flags , both barouche and steeds ?
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 26]: Since these things were not for me , I flew to your side to dissemble my spleen under the licensed prattle of a cousin . ''
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 10]: `` Then who _ is _ with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 15]: `` The population of this portion of our State , I take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 20]: `` Oh , it 's all right , '' said the judge , leaning back to speak to Helen .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 16]: `` Keating and Smith and your father are to ride in the carriage with him .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 19]: You need n't be afraid of any of them letting him know that H. Fisbee is a lady .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 31]: Everybody understands about that ; of course they know it 's to be left to you to break it to him how well a girl has run his paper . ''
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 23]: The old gentleman chuckled , and looked out of the corner of his eye at his daughter , whose expression was inscrutable .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 4]: `` I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 4]: cried Helen . ''
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 6]: _ I _ tell him !
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 6]: No one must tell him .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 7]: He need never know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 8]: Briscoe reached back and patted her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 19]: `` How long do you suppose he will be here in Plattville without it 's leaking out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 15]: `` But they kept guard over him for months and nobody told him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 14]: `` Ah , '' said Briscoe , `` but this is different . ''
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 8]: `` No , no , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 12]: `` It _ must _ be kept from him somehow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 18]: `` He 'll know it by to-morrow , so you 'd better tell him this evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 5]: `` This evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 8]: You 'll have a good chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 5]: `` I will ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 9]: `` He 's coming to supper with us .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 22]: He and your father , of course , and Keating and Bence and Boswell and Smith and Tom Martin and Lige .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 40]: We 're going to have a big time , with you and Minnie to do the honors ; and we 're all coming into town afterwards for the fireworks ; I 'll let him drive you in the phaeton .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 20]: You 'll have plenty of time to talk it over with him and tell him all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 6]: Helen gave a little gasp .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 4]: `` Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 4]: `` Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 33]: The buckboard stopped on the `` Herald '' corner , and here , and along Main Street , the line of vehicles which had followed it from the station took their places .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 35]: The Square was almost a solid mass of bunting , and the north entrance of the court-house had been decorated with streamers and flags , so as to make it a sort of stand .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 15]: Hither the crowd was already streaming , and hither the procession made its way .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 40]: At intervals the cannon boomed , and Schofields ' Henry was winnowing the air with his bell ; nobody had a better time that day than Schofields ' Henry , except old Wilkerson , who was with the procession .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 72]: In advance , came the boys , whooping and somersaulting , and behind them , rode a band of mounted men , sitting their horses like cavalrymen , led by the sheriff and his deputy and Jim Bardlock ; then followed the Harkless Club of Amo , led by Boswell , with the magnanimous Halloway himself marching in the ranks ; and at sight of this the people shouted like madmen .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 50]: But when Helen 's eye fell upon his fat , rather unhappy face , she felt a pang of pity and unreasoning remorse , which warned her that he who looks upon politics when it is red must steel his eyes to see many a man with the heart-burn .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 25]: After the men of Amo , came the Harkless Club of Gainesville , Mr. Bence in the van with the step of a grenadier .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 72]: There followed next , Mr. Ephraim Watts , bearing a light wand in his hand and leading a detachment of workers from the oil-fields in their stained blue overalls and blouses ; and , after them , came Mr. Martin and Mr. Landis at the head of an organization recognized in the `` Order of Procession , '' printed in the `` Herald , '' as the Business Men of Plattville .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 43]: They played in such magnificent time that every high-stepping foot in all the line came down with the same jubilant plunk , and lifted again with a unanimity as complete as that of the last vote the convention had taken that day .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 52]: The leaders of the procession set a brisk pace , and who could have set any other kind of a pace when on parade to the strains of such a band , playing such a tune as `` A New Coon in Town , '' with all its might and main ?
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 31]: But as the line swung into the Square , there came a moment when the tune was ended , the musicians paused for breath , and there fell comparative quiet .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 49]: Amongst the ranks of Business Men ambled Mr. Wilkerson , singing at the top of his voice , and now he could be heard distinctly enough for those near to him to distinguish the melody with which it was his intention to favor the public : `` Glory !
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 2]: Glory !
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 2]: Hallelujah !
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 7]: As we go marching on . ''
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 27]: The words , the air , that husky voice , recalled to the men of Carlow another day and another procession , not like this one .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 18]: And the song Wilkerson was singing is the one song every Northern-born American knows and can sing .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 53]: The leader of the band caught the sound , signalled to his men ; twenty instruments rose as one to twenty mouths ; the snare-drum rattled , the big drum crashed , the leader lifted his baton high over his head , and music burst from twenty brazen throats : `` Glory !
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 2]: Glory !
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 3]: Hallelujah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 56]: Instantaneously , the whole procession began to sing the refrain , and the people in the street , and those in the wagons and carriages , and those leaning from the windows joined with one accord , the ringing bells caught the time of the song , and the upper air reverberated in the rhythm .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 20]: The Harkless Club of Carlow wheeled into Main Street , two hundred strong , with their banners and transparencies .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 45]: Lige Willetts rode at their head , and behind him strode young William Todd and Parker and Ross Schofield and Homer Tibbs and Hartley Bowlder , and even Bud Tipworthy held a place in the ranks through his connection with the `` Herald . ''
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 5]: They were all singing .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 25]: And , behind them , Helen saw the flag-covered barouche and her father , and beside him sat John Harkless with his head bared .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 22]: She glanced at Briscoe ; he was standing on the front seat with Minnie beside him , and both were singing .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 15]: Meredith had climbed upon the back seat and was nervously fumbling at a cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 6]: `` Sing , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 7]: the girl cried to him excitedly .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 31]: `` I should be ashamed not to , '' he answered ; and dropped the cigarette and began to sing `` John Brown 's Body '' with all his strength .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 30]: With that she seized his hand , sprang up beside him , and over the swelling chorus her full soprano rose , lifted with all the power in her .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 70]: The barouche rolled into the Square , and , as it passed , Harkless turned , and bent a sudden gaze upon the group in the buckboard ; but the western sun was in his eyes , and he only caught a glimpse of a vague , bright shape and a dazzle of gold , and he was borne along and out of view , down the singing street .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 3]: `` Glory !
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 2]: Glory !
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 2]: Hallelujah !
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 2]: Glory !
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 2]: Glory !
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 2]: Hallelujah !
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 2]: Glory !
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 2]: Glory !
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 2]: Hallelujah !
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 7]: As we go marching on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 23]: The barouche stopped in front of the courthouse , and he passed up a lane they made for him to the steps .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 25]: When he turned to them to speak , they began to cheer again , and he had to wait for them to quiet down .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 21]: `` We ca n't hear him from over here , '' said Briscoe , `` we 're too far off .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 19]: Mr. Meredith , suppose you take the ladies closer in , and I 'll stay with the horses .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 8]: You want to hear his speech . ''
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 12]: `` He is a great man , is n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 16]: Meredith said to Helen , gravely , as he handed her out of the buckboard .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 31]: `` I 've been trying to realize for the last few minutes , that he is the same old fellow I 've been treating so familiarly all day long . ''
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 13]: `` Yes , he is a great man , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 8]: `` This is only the beginning . ''
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 14]: `` That 's true , '' said Briscoe , who had overheard her .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 7]: `` He 'll go pretty far .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 44]: A man that people know is steady and strong and level-headed can get whatever he wants , because a public man can get anything , if people know he 's safe and honest and they can rely on him for _ sense _ .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 26]: It sounds like a simple matter ; but only three or four public men in the country have convinced us that they are like that .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 7]: Hurry along , young people . ''
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 32]: Crossing the street , they met Miss Tibbs ; she was wiping her streaming eyes with the back of her left hand and still mechanically waving her handkerchief with her right .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 7]: `` Is n't it beautiful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 16]: she said , not ceasing to flutter , unconsciously , the little square of cambric .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 16]: `` There was such a throng that I grew faint and had to come away .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 9]: I do n't mind your seeing me crying .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 20]: Pretty near everybody cried when he walked up to the steps and we saw that he was lame . ''
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 68]: Standing on the outskirts of the crowd , they could hear the mellow ring of Harkless 's voice , but only fragments of the speech , for it was rather halting , and was not altogether clear in either rhetoric or delivery ; and Mr. Bence could have been a good deal longer in saying what he had to say , and a thousand times more oratorical .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 47]: Nevertheless , there was not a man or woman present who did not declare that it was the greatest speech ever heard in Plattville ; and they really thought so -- to such lengths are loyalty and friendship sometimes carried in Carlow and Amo and Gaines .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 82]: He looked down upon the attentive , earnest faces and into the kindly eyes of the Hoosier country people , and , as he spoke , the thought kept recurring to him that this was the place he had dreaded to come back to ; that these were the people he had wished to leave -- these , who gave him everything they had to give -- and this made it difficult to keep his tones steady and his throat clear .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 88]: Helen stood so far from the steps -LRB- nor could she be induced to penetrate further , though they would have made way for her -RRB- that only fragments reached her , but what she heard she remembered : `` I have come home ... Ordinarily a man needs to fall sick by the wayside or to be set upon by thieves , in order to realize that nine-tenths of the world is Samaritan , and the other tenth only too busy or too ignorant to be .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 49]: Down here he realizes it with no necessity of illness or wounds to bring it out ; and if he does get hurt , you send him to Congress ... There will be no other in Washington so proud of what he stands for as I shall be .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 42]: To represent you is to stand for realities -- fearlessness , honor , kindness ... We are people who take what comes to us , and it comes bountifully ; we are rich -- oh , we are all Americans here !
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 33]: ... This is the place for a man who likes to live where people are kind to one another , and where they have the old-fashioned way of saying ` Home . '
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 17]: Other places , they do n't seem to get so much into it as we do .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 48]: And to come home as I have to-day ... I have come home ... '' Every one meant to shake hands with him , and , when the speech was over , those nearest swooped upon him , cheering and waving , and grasping at his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 48]: Then a line was formed , and they began to defile by him , as he stood on the steps , and one by one they came up , and gave him hearty greetings , and passed on through the court-house and out at the south door .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 64]: Tom Meredith and Minnie Briscoe came amongst the others , and Tom said only , `` Good old boy , '' as he squeezed his friend 's hand ; and then , as he went down the hall , wiping his glasses , he asked Minnie if she believed the young man on the steps had risen from a sick bed that morning .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 26]: It was five-o'clock when Harkless climbed the stairs to the `` Herald '' office , and his right arm and hand were aching and limp .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 46]: Below him , as he reached the landing , he could see boys selling extras containing his speech -LRB- taken by the new reporter -RRB- , and long accounts of the convention , of the nominee 's career , and the celebration of his home-coming .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 31]: The sales were rapid ; for no one could resist the opportunity to read in print descriptions of what his eyes had beheld and his ears had heard that day .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 39]: Ross Schofield was the only person in the editorial room , and there was nothing in his appearance which should cause a man to start and fall back from the doorway ; but that was what Harkless did .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 10]: `` What 's the matter , Mr. Harkless ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 17]: cried Ross , hurrying forward , fearing that the other had been suddenly reseized by illness .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 6]: `` What are those ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 17]: asked Harkless , with a gesture of his hand which seemed to include the entire room .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 4]: `` Those ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 6]: repeated Ross , staring blankly .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 16]: `` Those rosettes -- these streamers -- that stovepipe -- all this blue ribbon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 4]: Ross turned pale .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 4]: `` Ribbon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 5]: he said , inquiringly .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 4]: `` Ribbon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 10]: He seemed unable to perceive the decorations referred to .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 24]: `` Yes , '' answered John ; `` these rosettes on the chairs , that band , and -- '' `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 3]: Ross exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 4]: `` That ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 17]: He fingered the band on the stovepipe as if he saw it for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 7]: `` Yes ; I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 8]: `` But what are they for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 10]: asked Harkless , touching one of the streamers curiously .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 14]: `` Why -- it 's -- it 's likely meant for decorations . ''
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 22]: John picked up the ink-well , staring in complete amazement at the hard knot of ribbon with which it was garnished .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 11]: `` They seem to have been here some time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 15]: `` They have ; I reckon they 're almost due to be called in .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 20]: They 've be 'n up ever sence -- sence -- '' `` Who put them up , Ross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 5]: `` We did . ''
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 5]: Ross was visibly embarrassed .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 11]: `` Why -- fer -- fer the other editor . ''
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 6]: `` For Mr. Fisbee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 5]: `` Land , no !
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 24]: You do n't suppose we 'd go to work and bother to brisken things up fer that old gentleman , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 18]: `` I meant young Mr. Fisbee -- he is the other editor , is n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 5]: said Ross , coughing .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 5]: `` Young Mr. Fisbee ?
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 10]: Yes ; we put 'em up fer him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 4]: `` You did !
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 6]: Did he appreciate them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 13]: `` Well -- he seemed to -- kind of like 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 6]: `` Where is he now ?
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 8]: I came here to find him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 6]: `` He 's gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 3]: `` Gone ?
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 9]: Has n't he been here this afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 8]: `` Yes ; some ` the time .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 22]: Come in and stayed durin ' the leevy you was holdin ' , and saw the extra off all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 8]: `` When will he be back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 46]: `` Sence it 's be 'n a daily he gits here by eight , after supper , but do n't stay very late ; the new man and old Mr. Fisbee and Parker look after whatever comes in late , unless it 's something special .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 14]: He 'll likely be here by half-past eight at the farthest off . ''
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 9]: `` I ca n't wait till then . ''
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 9]: John took a quick turn about the room .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 29]: `` I 've been wanting to see him every minute since I got in , '' he said impatiently , `` and he has n't been near me .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 9]: Nobody could even point him out to me .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 5]: Where has he gone ?
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 10]: I want to see him _ now _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 8]: `` Want to discharge him again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 20]: said a voice from the door , and turning , they saw that Mr. Martin stood there observing them .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 18]: `` No , '' said Harkless ; `` I want to give him the ` Herald . '
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 8]: Do you know where he is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 7]: Mr. Martin stroked his beard deliberately .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 19]: `` The person you speak of had n't ort to be very hard to find -- in Carlow .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 54]: The committee was reckless enough to hire that carriage of yours by the day , and Keating and Warren Smith are setting in it up at the corner , with their feet on the cushions to show they 're used to ridin ' around with four white horses every day in the week .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 15]: It 's waitin ' till you 're ready to go out to Briscoe 's .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 19]: It 's an hour before supper time , and you can talk to young Fisbee all you want .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 6]: He 's out there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 78]: As they drove along the pike , Harkless 's three companions kept up a conversation sprightly beyond the mere exhilaration of the victorious ; but John sat almost silent , and , in spite of their liveliness , the others eyed him a little anxiously now and then , knowing that he had been living on excitement through a physically exhausting day , and they were fearful lest his nerves react and bring him to a breakdown .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 30]: But the healthy flush of his cheek was reassuring ; he looked steady and strong , and they were pleased to believe that the stirring-up was what he needed .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 86]: It had been a strange and beautiful day to him , begun in anger , but the sun was not to go down upon his wrath ; for his choleric intention had almost vanished on his homeward way , and the first words Smith had spoken had lifted the veil of young Fisbee 's duplicity , had shown him with what fine intelligence and supreme delicacy and sympathy young Fisbee had worked for him , had understood him , and had _ made _ him .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 36]: If the open assault on McCune had been pressed , and the damnatory evidence published in Harkless 's own paper , while Harkless himself was a candidate and rival , John would have felt dishonored .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 40]: The McCune papers could have been used for Halloway 's benefit , but not for his own ; he would not ride to success on another man 's ruin ; and young Fisbee had understood and had saved him .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 27]: It was a point of honor that many would have held finicky and inconsistent , but one which young Fisbee had comprehended was vital to Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 49]: And this was the man he had discharged like a dishonest servant ; the man who had thrown what was -LRB- in Carlow 's eyes -RRB- riches into his lap ; the man who had made his paper , and who had made him , and saved him .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 19]: Harkless wanted to see young Fisbee as he longed to see only one other person in the world .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 35]: Two singular things had happened that day which made his craving to see Helen almost unbearable -- just to rest his eyes upon her for a little while , he could ask no more .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 47]: And as they passed along that well-remembered road , every tree , every leaf by the wayside , it seemed , spoke to him and called upon the dear memory of his two walks with her -- into town and out of town , on show-day .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 27]: He wondered if his heart was to project a wraith of her before him whenever he was deeply moved , for the rest of his life .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 16]: For twice to-day he had seen her whom he knew to be so far away .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 15]: She had gone back to her friends in the north , Tom had said .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 19]: Twice that afternoon he had been momentarily , but vividly , conscious of her as a living presence .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 99]: As he descended from the car at the station , his eyes , wandering out over the tumultuous crowd , had caught and held a picture for a second -- a graceful arm upraised , and a gloved hand pressed against a blushing cheek under a hat such as is not worn in Carlow ; a little figure poised apparently in air , full-length above the crowd about her ; so , for the merest flick of time he had seen her , and then , to his straining eyes , it was as though she were not .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 4]: She had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 147]: And again , as his carriage reached the Square , a feeling had come to him that she was near him ; that she was looking at him ; that he should see her when the carriage turned ; and in the same instant , above the singing of a multitude , he heard her voice as if there had been no other and once more his dazzled eyes beheld her for a second ; she was singing , and as she sang she leaned toward him from on high with the most ineffable look of tenderness and pride and affection he had ever seen on a woman 's face ; such a look , he thought , as she would wear if she came to love some archangel -LRB- her love should be no less -RRB- with all of her heart and soul and strength .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 10]: And so he knew he had seen a vision .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 14]: But it was a cruel one to visit a man who loved her .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 56]: He had summoned his philosophy and his courage in his interview with himself on the way to Carlow , and they had answered ; but nothing could answer if his eyes were to play him tricks and bring her visibly before him , and with such an expression as he had seen upon her face .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 5]: It was too real .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 17]: It made his eyes yearn for the sight of her with an ache that was physical .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 27]: And even at that moment , he saw , far ahead of them on the road , two figures standing in front of the brick house .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 7]: One was unmistakable at any distance .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 39]: It was that of old Fisbee ; and the other was a girl 's : a light , small figure without a hat , and the low , western sun dwelt on a head that shone with gold .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 20]: Harkless put his hand over his eyes with a pain that was like the taste of hemlock in nectar .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 7]: `` Sun in your eyes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 16]: asked Keating , lifting his hat , so as to shield the other 's face .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 10]: When he looked again , both figures were gone .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 49]: He made up his mind that he would think of the only other person who could absorb his attention , at least for a time ; very soon he would stand face to face with the six feet of brawn and intelligence and manhood that was young Fisbee .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 9]: `` You are sure he is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 5]: he asked Tom Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' answered Martin , with no need to inquire whom the editor meant .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 48]: `` I reckon , '' he continued , solemnly , peering at the other from under his rusty hat-brim , `` I reckon when you see him , maybe you 'll want to put a kind of codicil to that deed to the ` Herald . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 8]: `` How 's that , Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 18]: `` Why , I guess maybe you 'll -- well , wait till you see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 38]: `` I do n't want to wait much longer , when I remember what I owe him and how I have used him , and that I have been here nearly three hours without seeing him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 84]: As they neared the brick house Harkless made out , through the trees , a retreative flutter of skirts on the porch , and the thought crossed his mind that Minnie had flown indoors to give some final directions toward the preparation of the banquet ; but when the barouche halted at the gate , he was surprised to see her waving to him from the steps , while Tom Meredith and Mr. Bence and Mr. Boswell formed a little court around her .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 23]: Lige Willetts rode up on horse back at the same moment , and the judge was waiting in front of the gate .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 11]: Harkless stepped out of the barouche and took his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 10]: `` I was told young Fisbee was here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 11]: `` Young Fisbee is here , '' said the judge .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 8]: `` Where , please , Briscoe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 9]: `` Want to see him right off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 8]: `` I do , very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 13]: `` You 'll withdraw his discharge , I expect , now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 4]: exclaimed the other .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 21]: `` I want to make him a present of the ` Herald , ' if he 'll take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 12]: He fumed to Meredith , who had come to the gate .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 8]: `` Tom , where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 19]: Meredith put his hand on his friend 's shoulder , and answered : `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 8]: God bless you , old fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 30]: `` The truth is , '' said the judge , as they entered the gate , `` that when you drove up , young Fisbee ran into the house .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 33]: Minnie -- '' He turned , but his daughter had disappeared ; however , she came to the door , a moment later , and shook her head mysteriously at her father .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 10]: `` Not in the house , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 14]: Mr. Fisbee came around the corner of the porch and went toward Harkless .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 15]: `` Fisbee , '' cried the latter , `` where is your nephew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 34]: The old man took his hand in both his own , and looked him between the eyes , and thus stood , while there was a long pause , the others watching them .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 16]: `` You must not say that I told you , '' he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 7]: `` Go into the garden . ''
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 15]: But when Harkless 's step crunched the garden path there was no one there .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 30]: Asters were blooming in beds between the green rose-bushes , and their many-fingered hands were flung open in wide surprise that he should expect to find young Fisbee there .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 6]: It was just before sunset .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 10]: Birds were gossiping in the sycamores on the bank .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 54]: At the foot of the garden , near the creek , there were some tall hydrangea bushes , flower-laden , and , beyond them , one broad shaft of the sun smote the creek bends for a mile in that flat land , and crossed the garden like a bright , taut-drawn veil .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 12]: Harkless passed the bushes and stepped out into this gold brilliance .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 8]: Then he uttered a cry and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 21]: Helen was standing beside the hydrangeas , with both hands against her cheeks and her eyes fixed on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 31]: She had run away as far as she could run ; there were high fences extending down to the creek on each side , and the water was beyond . ''
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 5]: _ You _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 4]: he said . ''
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 7]: _ You -- you _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 19]: She did not lift her eyes , but began to move away from him with little backward steps .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 25]: When she reached the bench on the bank , she spoke with a quick intake of breath and in a voice he scarcely heard .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 18]: It was the merest whisper , and her words came so slowly that sometimes minutes separated them .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 16]: `` Can you -- will you keep me -- on the ` Herald ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 15]: `` Keep you -- '' `` Will you -- let me -- help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 5]: He came near her .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 6]: `` I do n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 12]: Is it you -- you -- who are here again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 7]: `` Have you -- forgiven me ?
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 10]: You know now why I would n't -- resign ?
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 8]: You forgive my -- that telegram ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 5]: `` What telegram ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 13]: `` That one that came to you -- this morning . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 6]: _ Your _ telegram ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 8]: `` Did you send me one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 9]: `` It did not come to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 7]: `` Yes -- it did . ''
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 10]: `` But there -- What was it about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 48]: `` It was signed , '' she said , `` it was signed -- '' She paused and turned half way , not lifting the downcast lashes ; her hand , laid upon the arm of the bench , was shaking ; she put it behind her .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 32]: Then her eyes were lifted a little , and , though they did not meet his , he saw them , and a strange , frightened glory leaped in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 14]: Her voice fell still lower and two heavy tears rolled down her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 20]: `` It was signed , '' she whispered , `` it was signed -- ` H. Fisbee . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 9]: He began to tremble from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 6]: There was a long silence .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 8]: She had turned quite away from him .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 21]: When he spoke , his voice was as low as hers , and he spoke as slowly as she had .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 12]: `` You mean -- then -- it was -- you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 4]: `` You ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 11]: `` And you have been here all the time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 20]: `` All -- all except the week you were -- hurt , and that -- that one evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 20]: The bright veil which wrapped them was drawn away , and they stood in the silent , gathering dusk .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 14]: He tried to loosen his neck-band ; it seemed to be choking him .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 13]: `` I -- I ca n't -- I do n't comprehend it .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 18]: I am trying to realize what it -- '' `` It means nothing , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 23]: `` There was an editorial , yesterday , '' he said , `` an editorial that I thought was about Rodney McCune .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 6]: Did you write it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 12]: `` It was about -- me -- was n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 21]: `` It said -- it said -- that I had won the love of every person in Carlow County . ''
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 6]: Suddenly she found her voice .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 11]: `` Do not misunderstand me , '' she said rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 15]: `` I have done the little that I have done out of gratitude . ''
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 11]: She faced him now , but without meeting his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 25]: `` I told you , remember , that you would understand some day what I meant by that , and the day has come .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 29]: I owed you more gratitude than a woman ever owed a man before , I think , and I would have died to pay a part of it .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 27]: I set every gossip 's tongue in Rouen clacking at the very start , in the merest amateurish preparation for the work Mr. Macauley gave me .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 4]: That was nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 12]: And the rest has been the happiest time in my life .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 10]: I have only pleased myself , after all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 9]: `` What gratitude did you owe me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 4]: `` What gratitude ?
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 9]: For what you did for my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 24]: `` I have only seen your father once in my life -- at your table at the dance supper , that night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 3]: `` Listen .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 14]: My father is a gentle old man with white hair and kind eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 40]: You saw my uncle , that night ; he has been as good to me as a father , since I was seven years old , and he gave me his name by law and I lived with him .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 17]: My father came to see me once a year ; I never came to see him .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 16]: He always told me everything was well with him ; that his life was happy .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 22]: Once he lost the little he had left to him in the world , his only way of making his living .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 15]: He had no friends ; he was hungry and desperate , and he wandered .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 16]: I was dancing and going about wearing jewels -- only -- I did not know .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 11]: All the time the brave heart wrote me happy letters .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 17]: I should have known , for there was one who did , and who saved him .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 14]: When at last I came to see my father , he told me .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 23]: He had written of his idol before ; but it was not till I came that he told it all to me .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 7]: Do you know what I felt ?
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 43]: While his daughter was dancing cotillions , a stranger had taken his hand -- and -- '' A sob rose in her throat and checked her utterance for a moment ; but she threw up her head and met his eyes proudly .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 7]: `` Gratitude , Mr. Harkless ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 9]: `` I am James Fisbee 's daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 20]: He fell back from the bench with a sharp exclamation , and stared at her through the gray twilight .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 42]: She went on hurriedly , again not looking at him : `` When you showed me that you cared for me -- when you told me that you did -- I -- do you think I wanted to care for you ?
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 30]: I wanted to do something to show you that I could be ashamed of my vile neglect of him -- something to show you his daughter could be grateful .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 23]: If I had loved you , what I did would have been for that -- and I could not have done it .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 16]: And how could I have shown my gratitude if I had done it for love ?
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 33]: And it has been such dear , happy work , the little I have done , that it seems , after all , that I have done it for love of myself .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 57]: But -- but when you first told me -- '' She broke off with a strange , fluttering , half inarticulate little laugh that was half tears ; and then resumed in another tone : `` When you told me you cared that night -- that night we were here -- how could I be sure ?
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 30]: It had been only two days , you see , and even if I could have been sure of myself , why , I could n't have told you .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 103]: I had so brazenly thrown myself at your head , time and again , those two days , in my -- my worship of your goodness to my father and my excitement in recognizing in his friend the hero of my girlhood , that you had every right to think I cared ; but if -- but if I had -- if I had -- loved you with my whole soul , I could not have -- why , no woman could have -- I mean the sort of girl I am could n't have admitted it -- must have denied it .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 20]: And what I was trying to do for you when we met in Rouen was -- was courting you .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 14]: You surely see I could n't have done it if I had cared .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 6]: It would have been brazen !
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 30]: And do you think that then I could have answered -- ` Yes ' -- even if I wanted to -- even if I had been sure of myself ?
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 12]: And now -- '' Her voice sank again to a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 24]: `` And now -- '' From the meadows across the creek , and over the fields , came a far tinkling of farm-bells .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 70]: Three months ago , at this hour , John Harkless had listened to that sound , and its great lonesomeness had touched his heart like a cold hand ; but now , as the mists were rising from the water and the small stars pierced the sky one by one , glinting down through the dim , immeasurable blue distances , he found no loneliness in heaven or earth .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 12]: He leaned forward toward her ; the bench was between them .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 10]: The last light was gone ; evening had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 8]: `` And now -- '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 8]: She moved backward as he leaned nearer .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 30]: `` You promised to remember on the day you understood , '' she answered , a little huskily , `` that it was all from the purest gratitude . ''
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 10]: `` And -- and there is nothing else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 54]: `` If there were , '' she said , and her voice grew more and more unsteady , `` if there were , ca n't you see that what I have done -- '' She stopped , and then , suddenly , `` Ah , it would have been _ brazen _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 23]: He looked up at the little stars and he heard the bells , and they struck into his heart like a dirge .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 22]: He made a singular gesture of abnegation , and then dropped upon the bench with his head bowed between his hands .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 23]: She pressed her hand to her bosom , watching him in a startled fashion , her eyes wide and her lips parted .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 19]: She took a few quick , short steps toward the garden , still watching him over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 23]: `` You must n't worry , '' he said , not lifting his bent head , `` I know you 're sorry .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 10]: I 'll be all right in a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 64]: She gave a hurried glance from right to left and from left to right , like one in terror seeking a way of escape ; she gathered her skirts in her hand , as if to run into the garden ; but suddenly she turned and ran to him -- ran to him swiftly , with her great love shining from her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 8]: She sank upon her knees beside him .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 14]: She threw her arms about his neck and kissed him on the forehead .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 12]: `` Oh , my dear , do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 15]: she whispered , `` do n't you see -- do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 20]: When they heard the judge calling from the orchard , they went back through the garden toward the house .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 12]: It was dark ; the whitest asters were but gray splotches .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 13]: There was no one in the orchard ; Briscoe had gone indoors .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 19]: `` Did you know you are to drive me into town in the phaeton for the fireworks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 4]: `` Fireworks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 11]: `` Yes ; the Great Harkless has come home . ''
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 22]: Even in the darkness he could see the look the vision had given him when the barouche turned into the Square .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 21]: She smiled upon him and said , `` All afternoon I was wishing I could have been your mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 7]: He clasped her hand more tightly .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 6]: `` This wonderful world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 16]: `` Yesterday I had a doctor -- a doctor to cure me of love-sickness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 7]: They went on a little way .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 9]: `` We must hurry , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 12]: `` I am sure they have been waiting for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 7]: This was true ; they had .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 21]: From the dining-room came laughter and hearty voices , and the windows were bright with the light of many lamps .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 20]: By and by , they stood just outside the patch of light that fell from one of the windows .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 7]: `` Look , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 10]: `` Are n't they good , dear people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 6]: `` The beautiful people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 3]: he answered .
