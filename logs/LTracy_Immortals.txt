Parsing [sent. 1 len. 30]: A Son of the Immortals By LOUIS TRACY Author of `` The Stowaway , '' `` The Message , '' `` The Wings of the Morning , '' etc. .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 59]: Illustrations by HOWARD CHANDLER CHRISTY A SON OF THE IMMORTALS CHAPTER I THE FORTUNE TELLER On a day in May , not so long ago , Joan Vernon , coming out into the sunshine from her lodging in the Place de la Sorbonne , smiled a morning greeting to the statue of Auguste Comte , founder of Positivism .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 26]: It would have puzzled her to explain what Positivism meant , or why it should be merely positive and not stoutly comparative or grandly superlative .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 11]: As a teacher , therefore , Comte made no appeal .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 20]: She just liked the bland look of the man , was pleased by the sleekness of his white marble .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 34]: He seemed to be a friend , a counselor , strutting worthily on a pedestal labeled '' _ Ordre et Progrès _ '' ; for Joan was an artist , not a philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 26]: Perhaps there was an underthought that she and Comte were odd fish to be at home together in that placid backwater of the Latin Quarter .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 41]: Next door to the old-fashioned house in which she rented three rooms was a cabaret , a mere wreck of a wineshop , apparently cast there by the torrent of the Boule Mich , which roared a few yards away .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 33]: Its luminous sign , a foaming tankard , showed gallantly by night , but was garish by day , since gas is akin to froth , to which the sun is pitiless .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 48]: But the cabaret had its customers , quiet folk who gathered in the evening to gossip and drink strange beverages , whereas its nearest neighbor on the boulevard side was an empty tenement , a despondent ghost to-day , though once it had rivaled the flaunting tankard .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 9]: Its frayed finery told of gay sparks extinguished .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 21]: A flamboyant legend declared , `` Ici on chante , on boit , on s ` amuse -LRB- ? -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 37]: Joan always smirked a little at that suggestive note of interrogation , which lent a world of meaning to the half-obliterated statement that Madame Lucette would appear `` tous les soirs dans ses chansons d'actualités . ''
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 60]: Nodding to Léontine , the cabaret 's amazingly small maid of all work , who was always washing and never washed , Joan saw the query for the hundredth time , and , as ever , found its answer in the blistered paint and dust covered windows : Madame Lucette 's last song of real life pointed a moral .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 11]: Joan 's bright face did not cloud on that account .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 54]: Paul Verlaine , taking the air in the Boulevard Saint Michel , had he chanced to notice the dry husk of that Cabaret Latin , might have composed a chanson on the vanity of dead cafés ; but this sprightly girl had chosen her residence there chiefly because it marched with her purse .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 29]: Moreover , it was admirably suited to the needs of one who for the most part gave her days to the Louvre and her evenings to the Sorbonne .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 7]: She was rather late that morning .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 31]: Lest that precious hour of white light should be lost , she sped rapidly across the place , down the boulevard , and along the busy Quai des Grands Augustins .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 20]: On the Pont Neuf she glanced up at another statuesque acquaintance , this time a kingly personage on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 17]: She could never quite dispel the notion that Henri Quatre was ready to flirt with her .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 34]: The roguish twinkle in his bronze eye was very taking , and there were not many men in Paris who could look at her in that way and win a smile in return .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 50]: To be sure , it was no new thing for a Vernon to be well disposed toward Henry of Navarre ; but that is ancient history , and our pretty Joan , blithely unconscious , was hurrying that morning to take an active part in redrafting the Berlin treaty .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 21]: At the corner of the bridge , where it joins the Quai du Louvre , she met a young man .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 32]: Each pretended that the meeting was accidental , though , after the first glance , the best-natured recording angel ever commissioned from Paradise would have refused to believe either of them .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 8]: `` What a piece of luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 5]: cried the young man .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 9]: `` Are you going to the Louvre ? ''
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 4]: And you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 6]: demanded Joan , flushing prettily .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 18]: `` I am killing time till the afternoon , when I play Number One for the Wanderers .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 8]: To-day 's match is at Bagatelle . ''
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 4]: She laughed . ''
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 20]: ` Surely thou also art one of them ; for thy speech betrayeth thee , ' '' she quoted .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 12]: `` I do n't quite follow that , Miss Vernon . ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 3]: `` No ?
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 8]: Well , I 'll explain another time .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 8]: I must away to my copying . ''
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 9]: `` Let me come and fix your easel .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 10]: Really , I have nothing else to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 5]: `` Worse and worse !
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 7]: En route , _ alors _ !
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 7]: You can watch me at work .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 11]: That must be a real pleasure to an idler . ''
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 10]: `` I am no idler , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 24]: Who spoke but now of ` killing time , ' ` play , ' ` Number One , ' and ` Bagatelle ' ?
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 6]: Really , Mr. Delgrado ! ''
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 11]: `` Oh , is that what you are driving at ?
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 4]: But you misunderstood .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 25]: Bagatelle is near the polo ground in the Bois , and , as Number One in my team , I shall have to hustle .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 13]: Four stiff chukkers at polo are downright hard work , Miss Vernon .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 9]: By teatime I shall be a limp rag .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 18]: I promised to play nearly a month ago , and I can not draw back now . ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 16]: `` Polo is a man 's game , at any rate , '' she admitted .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 11]: `` Would you care to see to-day 's tie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 4]: he asked eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 34]: `` We meet Chantilly , and , if we put them out in the first round of the tournament , with any ordinary luck we ought to run right into the semi-final . ''
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 5]: She shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 23]: `` You unhappy people who have to plan and scheme how best to waste your hours have no notion of their value .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 9]: I must work steadily from two till five .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 8]: That means a sixteenth of my picture .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 15]: Divide two hundred and fifty by sixteen , and you have -- dear me !
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 8]: I am no good at figures . ''
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 15]: `` Fifteen francs , sixty-two and a half centimes , '' said he promptly .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 8]: She flashed a surprised look at him .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 12]: `` That is rather clever of you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 33]: `` Well , fancy a poor artist sacrificing all that money in order to watch eight men galloping after a white ball and whacking it and each other 's ponies unmercifully . ''
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 41]: `` To hit an adversary 's pony is the unforgivable sin , '' he cried , smiling at her , and she hastily averted her eyes , having discovered an unnerving similarity between his smile and -- Henri Quatre 's !
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 7]: They walked on in eloquent silence .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 21]: The man was cudgeling his brains for an excuse whereby he might carry her off in triumph to the Bois .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 13]: The girl was fighting down a new sensation that threatened her independence .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 13]: Never before had she felt tonguetied in the presence of an admirer .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 7]: She had dismissed dozens of them .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 26]: She refrained now from sending this good-looking boy packing only because it would be cruel , and Joan Vernon could not be cruel to anyone .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 26]: Nevertheless , she had to justify herself as a free lance , and it is the rôle of a lance to attack rather than defend .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 21]: `` What do you occupy yourself with when you are not playing polo or lounging about artists ' studios ? ''
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 4]: she asked suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 8]: `` Not much , I am afraid .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 15]: I like shooting and hunting ; but these Frenchmen have no backbone for sport .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 29]: Will you believe it , one has the greatest difficulty in getting a good knock at polo unless there is a crowd of ladies on the lawn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 7]: I begin to see light . ''
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 12]: `` That is not the reason I asked you to come .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 25]: If you honored me so greatly you would be the first woman , my mother excepted , I have ever driven to the club .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 9]: To-day 's players are mostly Americans or English .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 28]: Of course there are some first-rate French teams ; but you can take it from me that they show their real form only before the ladies . ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 9]: `` As in the tourneys of old ? ''
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 3]: `` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 8]: It is the same at the châteaux .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 14]: Everyone wants his best girl to watch his prowess with the gun . ''
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 26]: He stopped , wishing he had left the best girl out of it ; but Joan was kind hearted and did not hesitate an instant .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 17]: `` So you are what is known as a gentleman of leisure and independent means ? ''
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 4]: she said suavely .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 7]: `` Something of the sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 11]: `` I am sorry for you , Mr. Delgrado . ''
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 35]: `` I am rather sorry for myself at times , '' he admitted , and if Joan had chanced to glance at him she would have seen a somewhat peculiar expression on his face .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 11]: `` But why do you call me Mr. Delgrado ? ''
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 19]: She gazed at him now in blank bewilderment -- just a second too late to see that expression .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 8]: `` Is n't Delgrado your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 7]: `` Yes , in a sense .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 6]: People mostly call me Alec .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 19]: Correctly speaking , Alec is n't mother 's darling for Alexis ; but it goes , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 13]: `` Sometimes I think you are an American , '' she vowed .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 7]: `` Half , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 19]: `` My mother is an American , my father a Kosnovian -- well , just a Kosnovian . ''
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 8]: `` And pray what is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 8]: `` Have n't you heard of Kosnovia ?
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 8]: It is a little Balkan State . ''
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 13]: `` Is there some mystery , then , about your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 9]: `` Oh , no ; plain Alec . ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 10]: `` Am I to call you plain Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 13]: `` But it follows that you would call me plain Joan . ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 8]: `` Let it go at Joan . ''
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 6]: Good morning , Alec . ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 8]: `` No , no , Miss Vernon .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 5]: Do n't be vexed .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 9]: I really did not mean to be rude .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 8]: And you promised , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 5]: `` Promised what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 9]: `` That I might help carry your traps .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 8]: Please do n't send me away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 9]: He was so contrite that Joan weakened again .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 17]: `` It is rather friendly to hear one 's Christian name occasionally , '' she declared .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 22]: `` I will compound on the Alec if you will tell me why the Delgrado applies only in a sense . ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 12]: `` Done -- Joan , '' said he , greatly daring .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 14]: He waited the merest fraction of time ; but she gave no sign .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 20]: `` My stipulation is of the slightest , '' he added , `` that I discourse in the Louvre .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 6]: Where are you working ? ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 15]: `` In the Grande Galerie ; on a subject that I enjoy , too .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 10]: People have such odd notions as to nice pictures .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 8]: They choose them to match the furniture .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 15]: Now , this one is quite delightful to copy , and not very difficult .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 6]: But you shall see . ''
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 8]: They entered the Louvre from the Quai .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 5]: Joan was undoubtedly flurried .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 21]: Here , in very truth , was that irrepressible Henri descended from his bronze horse and walking by her side .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 14]: That his later name happened to be Alec did not matter at all .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 76]: She knew that a spiteful Bourbon had melted down no less than two statues of Napoleon in order to produce the fine cavalier who approved of her every time she crossed the Pont Neuf , and it seemed as if some of the little Corsican 's dominance was allied with a touch of Béarnais swagger in the stalwart youth whom she had met for the first time in Rudin 's studio about three weeks earlier .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 8]: They were steel and magnet at once .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 39]: Delgrado had none of the boulevardier 's abounding self-conceit , or Joan would never have given him a second look , while Joan 's frank comradeship was vastly more alluring than the skilled coquetry that left him cold .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 20]: Physically , too , they were well mated , each obviously made for the other by a discriminating Providence .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 14]: They were just beginning to discover the fact , and this alarmed Joan .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 28]: She could not shake off the notion that he had waylaid her this morning for a purpose wholly unconnected with the suggested visit to the polo ground .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 29]: So , tall and athletic though he was , she set such a pace up the steps and through the lower galleries that further intimate talk became impossible .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 33]: Atalanta well knew what she was about when she ran her suitors to death , and Meilanion showed a deep insight into human nature when he arranged that she should loiter occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 49]: Delgrado , however , had no golden apples to drop in Joan 's path , could not even produce a conversational plum ; but he was young enough to believe in luck , and he hoped that fortune might favor him , once the painting was in hand .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 15]: Each was so absorbed in the other that the Louvre might have been empty .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 33]: Certainly , neither of them noticed that a man crossing the Pont du Carrousel in an open cab seemed to be vastly surprised when he saw them hastening through the side entrance .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 15]: He carried his interest to the point of stopping the cab and following them .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 67]: Young , clear skinned , black-haired , exceedingly well dressed , with the eyes and eyelashes of an Italian tenor , he moved with an air of distinction , and showed that he was no stranger to the Louvre by his rapid decision that the Salle des Moulages , with its forbidding plaster casts , was no likely resting place for Delgrado and his pretty companion .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 56]: Making straight for the nearest stairs , he almost blundered upon Alec , laden with Joan 's easel and canvas ; but this exquisite , having something of the spy 's skill , whisked into an alcove , scrutinized an old print , and did not emerge until the chance of being recognized had passed .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 7]: After that , he was safe .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 20]: He appeared to be amused , even somewhat amazed , when he learned why Delgrado was patronizing the arts .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 7]: Yet the discovery was evidently pleasing .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 25]: He caressed a neat , black mustache with a well-manicured hand , while taking note of Joan 's lithe figure and well poised head .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 43]: The long , straight vista of the gallery did not permit of a near view , and he could not linger in the narrow doorway , used chiefly by artists and officials , whence he watched them for a minute or more .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 36]: So he turned on his heel and descended to the street and his waiting victoria , waving that delicate hand and smiling with the manner of one who said , `` Fancy that of Alec !
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 5]: The young scamp ! ''
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 23]: Joan was copying Caravaggio 's `` The Fortune Teller , '' a masterpiece that speaks in every tongue , to every age .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 5]: Its keynote is simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 63]: A gallant of Milan , clothed in buff-colored doublet slashed with brown velvet , a plumed cavalier hat set rakishly on his head , and a lace ruffle caught up with a string of seed pearls round his neck , is holding out his right palm to a Gypsy woman , while the fingers of his left hand rest on a swordhilt .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 35]: The woman is young and pretty , her subject a mere boy , and her smug aspect of divination is happily contrasted with the youth 's excitement at hearing what fate has in store .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 3]: cried Joan .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 9]: `` What do you think of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 28]: She had almost completed the Gypsy , and there was already a suggestion of the high lights in the youngster 's face and his brightly colored garb .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 14]: `` I like your copy more than the original , '' said Delgrado .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 20]: `` Your visits to Rudin have not taught you much about art , then , '' said she tartly .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 14]: `` Not even that great master would wish me to be insincere . ''
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 15]: `` No , indeed ; but he demands knowledge at the back of truth .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 5]: Now , mark me !
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 16]: You see that speck of white fire in the corner of the woman 's eye ?
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 9]: It gives life , intelligence , subtle character .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 27]: Just a little blob of paint , put there two hundred years ago , yet it conveys the whole stock in trade of the fortune teller .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 41]: Countless numbers of men and women have gazed at that picture , a multitude that must have covered the whole range of human virtues and vices ; but it has never failed to carry the same message to every beholder .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 12]: Do you think that my poor reproduction will achieve that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 17]: `` You have chosen the only good bit in the painting , '' he declared stoutly .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 8]: `` Look at the boy 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 10]: Caravaggio must have modeled them from a girl 's .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 20]: What business has a fellow with pouting red lips like them to wear a sword on his thigh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 10]: Joan laughed with joyousness that was good to hear .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 12]: Run away and smite that ball with a long stick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 3]: `` Hum !
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 9]: More than the Italian could have done . ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 6]: He was ridiculously in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 11]: Joan colored suddenly and busied herself with tubes of paint .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 10]: She believed he was jealous of the handsome Lombard .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 10]: She began to mix some pigments on the palette .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 42]: Delgrado , already regretting an inexplicable outburst , turned from the picture and looked at Murillo 's `` woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and upon her head a diadem of twelve stars . ''
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 22]: `` Now , please help me to appreciate that and you will find me a willing student , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 7]: But Joan had recovered her self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 20]: `` Suppose we come off the high art ladder and talk of our uninteresting selves , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 12]: `` What of the mystery you hinted at on the Quai ?
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 9]: Why should n't I call you Mr. Delgrado ?
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 15]: One can not always say ` Alec , ' it 's too short . ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 6]: Then he reddened with confusion .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 13]: `` Delgrado is my name , right enough , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 9]: `` It is the prefix I object to .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 18]: It implies that I am sailing under false colors , and I do n't like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 17]: `` I am not good at riddles , and I suspect prefix , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 14]: `` Ah , well , I suppose I must get through with it .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 9]: Have you forgotten how Rudin introduced me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 8]: She knitted her brows for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 12]: Pretty women should cultivate the trick , unless they fear wrinkles .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 17]: It gives them the semblance of looking in on themselves , and the habit is commendable .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 15]: `` Rudin is fond of his little joke , '' she announced at last .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 9]: `` But -- what did he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 8]: `` Oh , there was some absurdity .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 26]: He addressed me as if I were a royal personage , and asked to be allowed to present his Serene Highness Prince Alexis Delgrado . ''
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 5]: The man smiled constrainedly .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 11]: `` It sounds rather nonsensical , does n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 6]: `` Rudin often invents titles .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 9]: I have heard efforts much more amusing . ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 8]: `` That is when he is original .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 12]: Unfortunately , in my case , he was merely accurate . ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 6]: Joan whirled round on him .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 7]: `` Are you a Prince ? ''
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 11]: she gasped , each word marking a crescendo of wonder .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 6]: `` Yes -- Joan . ''
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 8]: `` But what am I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 6]: What am I to say ?
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 12]: Must I drop on one knee and kiss your hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 11]: `` I can not help it , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 9]: `` And I was obliged to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 16]: You would have been angry with me if I had kept it hidden from you .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 12]: Oh , dash it all , Joan , do n't laugh !
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 5]: That is irritating . ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 5]: `` My poor Alec !
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 9]: Why did they make you a Prince ? ''
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 7]: `` I was born that way .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 5]: My father is one .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 22]: Do you mean to say you have lived in Paris a year and have never seen our names in the newspapers ?
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 6]: My people gad about everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 11]: The Prince and Princess Michael Delgrado , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 11]: `` I do not know , '' said Joan deliberately .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 11]: Her alert brain was slowly assimilating this truly astonishing discovery .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 42]: She did not attempt to shirk its significance , and her first thought was to frame some excuse to abandon work for the day ; since , no matter what the cost to herself , this friendship must go no farther .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 24]: The decision caused a twinge ; but she did not flinch , for Joan would always visit the dentist rather than endure toothache .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 31]: She could not dismiss a Serene Highness merely because he declared his identity , nor was she minded to forget his rank because she had begun to call him Alec .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 4]: But it hurt .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 10]: She was conscious of a longing to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 19]: If not in love , she was near it , and hard-working artists must not love Serene Highnesses .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 14]: Delgrado was watching her with a glowering anxiety that itself carried a warning .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 16]: `` You see , Joan , I had to tell you , '' he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 18]: `` People make such a fuss about these empty honors -- '' Joan caught at a straw .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 12]: She hoped that a display of sarcastic humor might rescue her .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 4]: `` Honors ! ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 19]: she broke in , and she laughed almost shrilly , for her voice was naturally sweet and harmonious .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 15]: `` Is it an honor , then , to be born a Prince ? ''
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 24]: `` If a man is worth his salt , the fact that he is regarded as a Prince should make him princely . ''
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 6]: `` That is well said .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 7]: Try and live up to it .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 18]: You will find it a task , though , to regulate your life by copybook maxims . ''
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 8]: `` The princedom is worth nothing otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 9]: In its way , it is a handicap .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 29]: Most young fellows of my age have some sort of career before them , while I -- I really am what you said I was , an idler .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 15]: I did n't like the taunt from your lips ; but it was true .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 10]: Well , I am going to change all that .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 16]: I am tired of posturing as one of Daudet 's ` Kings in Exile . '
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 15]: We expelled potentates all live in Paris ; that is the irony of it .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 10]: I want to be candid with you , Joan .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 30]: I have seen you every day since we met at Rudin 's ; but I did not dare to meet you too often lest you should send me away .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 9]: You have given me a purpose in life .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 28]: You have created a sort of hunger in me , and I refuse to be satisfied any longer with the easygoing existence of the last few years .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 8]: No , you must hear me out .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 15]: No matter what you say now , the new order of things is irrevocable .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 27]: I almost quarreled with my father last night ; but I told him plainly that I meant to make a place for myself in the world .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 29]: At any rate , I refuse to live the life he lives , and I am here to-day because the awakening is due to you , Joan . ''
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 15]: A tremor ran through the girl 's limbs ; but she faced him bravely .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 17]: Though her lips quivered , she forced herself to utter words that sounded like a jibe .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 34]: `` I am to play Pallas Athene to your Perseus , '' she said , and it seemed to him for a moment that she was in a mood to jest at heroics .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 22]: `` If you mean that I regard you as my goddess , I am well content , '' he answered quickly .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 6]: `` Ah , but wait .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 20]: Pallas Athene came to Perseus in a dream , and let us make believe that we are dreaming now .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 26]: She had great gray eyes , clear and piercing , and she knew all thoughts of men 's hearts and the secrets of their souls .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 37]: My eyes are not gray , Alec , nor can they pierce as hers ; but I can borrow her beautiful words , and tell you that she turns her face from the creatures of clay .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 26]: They may ` fatten at ease like sheep in the pasture , and eat what they did not sow , like oxen in the stall .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 53]: They grow and spread , like the gourd along the ground ; but , like the gourd , they give no shade to the traveler , and when they are ripe death gathers them , and they go down unloved into hell , and their name vanishes out of the land . '
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 26]: But to the souls of fire she gives more fire , and to those who are manful she gives a power more than man 's .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 11]: These are her heroes , the sons of the Immortals .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 14]: They are blest , but not as the men who live at ease .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 53]: She drives them forth ` by strange paths ... through doubt and need and danger and battle ... Some of them are slain in the flower of their youth , no man knows when or where , and some of them win noble names and a fair and green old age . '
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 25]: Not even the goddess herself can tell the hap that shall befall them ; for each man 's lot is known only to Zeus .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 10]: Have you reflected well on these things , Alec ?
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 5]: Be sure of yourself !
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 14]: There may be Gorgons to encounter , and monsters of the deep . ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 7]: He came very near to her .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 5]: Her eyes were glistening .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 12]: For one glowing second they looked into each other 's hearts .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 17]: `` And perhaps a maiden chained to a rock to be rescued , '' he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 7]: Then she drew herself up proudly .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 14]: `` Do not forget that I am Pallas Athene , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 26]: `` My shield of brass is an easel and my mighty spear a mahl-stick ; but -- I keep to my rôle , Alec . ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 33]: He longed to clasp her in his arms ; but it flashed upon him with an inspiration from topmost Olympus that , all unwittingly , she had bound herself to his fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 13]: `` Then I leave it at that , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 8]: This sudden air of confidence was bewildering .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 26]: She had been swept off her feet by emotion , and the very considerations she thought she had conquered were now tugging at her heart-strings .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 20]: He must not go away as her knight errant , eager and ready to slay dragons for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 10]: `` Do not misunderstand me , '' she faltered .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 26]: `` I was only quoting a passage from one of Kingsley 's Greek fairy tales that has always had a peculiar fascination for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 10]: `` I 'll get that story and read it .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 18]: But I am interfering with your work , and here comes your friend , the Humming Bee .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 17]: If he said anything funny to me just now , I should want to strangle him .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 6]: So good-by , dear Joan .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 17]: I will turn up again to-morrow and tell you how I fared in each round . ''
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 41]: And he was gone , leaving her breathless and shaken ; for well she knew that he held her pledged to unspoken vows , that his eager confidences would apply alike to the day 's sport and his future life .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 53]: With hands that trembled she essayed a further mixing of colors ; but she scarcely realized what she was doing , until a queer , cracked voice that yet was musical sang softly in German at her elbow : If the Song should chance to wander Forth the Minstrel too must go .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 61]: It was passing strange that crooked little Felix Poluski , ex-Nihilist , the wildest firebrand ever driven out of Warsaw , and the only living artist who could put on canvas the gleam of heaven that lights the Virgin 's face in the `` Immaculate Conception , '' should justify his nickname of Le Bourdon by humming those two lines .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 21]: `` I hope you are not a prophet , Felix , '' said Joan with a catch in her throat .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 20]: `` No , _ ma belle _ , no prophet , merely an avenger , a slayer of Kings .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 9]: I see you have just routed one . ''
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 29]: She turned and looked into the deepset eyes of the old hunchback , and for the first time noted that they were gray and very bright and piercing .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 27]: At the same time the fancy crossed her mind that perhaps Henri Quatre had had blue eyes , bold yet tender , like unto Alec 's .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 14]: `` So you too are aware that Monsieur Delgrado is a Prince ? ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 11]: she said , letting her thought bubble forth at random .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 20]: `` Some folk call him that , and it is the worst thing I know of him so far .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 19]: It may spoil him in time ; but at present I find him a nice young man . ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 7]: Joan swung round to her picture .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 24]: `` If Alec had the chance of becoming a King , he would be a very good one , '' she said loyally .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 9]: Poluski 's wizened cheeks puckered into a grin .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 14]: He glanced at the easel and thence to the picture on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 11]: `` Perfectly , my dear Joan , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 20]: `` And , by the bones of Kosciusko , you have chosen a proper subject , The Fortune Teller !
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 10]: Were you filling our warrior with dreams of empire ?
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 19]: Well , well , I do n't know which is more potent with monarchs , woman or dynamite .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 13]: In Alec 's case I fancy I should bet on the woman .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 63]: Here , for example , is one that shook Heaven , and I have always thought that Eve was not given fair treatment , or she would surely have twisted the serpent 's tail , '' and , humming the refrain of `` Les Demi-Vièrges , '' he climbed the small platform he had erected in front of the world famous Murillo .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 25]: Back to back , separated by little more than half the width of the gallery , Joan and Poluski worked steadily for twenty minutes .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 35]: The Pole sang to himself incessantly , now bassooning between his thin lips the motif of some rhapsody of Lizst 's , now murmuring the words of some catchy refrain from the latest review .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 47]: Anybody else who so transgressed the rules would have been summarily turned out by the guards ; but the men knew him , and the Grande Galerie , despite its treasures , or perhaps because of them , is the least popular part of the Louvre .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 57]: Artists haunt it ; but the Parisian , the provincial , the globe trotter , gape once in their lives at Andrea del Sarto , Titian , Salvator Rosa , Murillo of course , and the rest of the mighty dead , and then ask with a yawn , `` Where are the Crown Jewels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 47]: So the Humming Bee annoyed none by his humming ; but he stopped short in an improvised variation on the theme of Vulcan 's song in `` Philemon and Baucis '' when he heard a subdued but none the less poignant cry of distress from Joan .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 33]: In order to turn his head he was compelled to twist his ungainly body , and Joan , who was standing well away from her canvas , was aware of the movement .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 4]: She too turned .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 9]: `` I am going , '' she announced .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 9]: `` I can not do anything right to-day .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 8]: Just look at that white feather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 10]: `` In the boy 's hat , you tease !
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 7]: Where else would you look ? ''
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 15]: `` In your face , _ belle mignonne _ , '' said the Pole .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 4]: It was true .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 27]: Joan was not ill ; but she was undeniably low spirited , and the artist 's mood has a way of expressing itself on the palette .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 10]: She laughed , with a certain sense of effort .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 11]: `` I like you best when you sing , Felix .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 11]: Sometimes , when you speak , you are Infelix . ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 11]: `` By all means go home , '' he grinned .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 12]: `` One can not both joke and copy a Caravaggio . ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 28]: He began to paint with feverish industry , did not look at her again , but tossed an adieu over his humped shoulder when she hurried away .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 17]: Then he gazed reproachfully , almost vindictively , at the uplifted eyes of the transfigured Virgin .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 6]: `` Now , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 3]: he growled .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 9]: `` Vous êtes bénie entre toutes les femmes !
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 7]: This affair is in your line .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 6]: Why do n't you help ?
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 3]: _ Saperlotte !
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 8]: _ The girl is worth it . ''
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 8]: CHAPTER II MONSEIGNEUR The Wanderers beat Chantilly .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 16]: One minute before the close of the fourth chukkur the score stood at four all .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 41]: Both teams were playing with desperation to avoid a decider on tired ponies , when the Wanderers ' third man extricated the ball from a tangle of prancing hoofs and clattering sticks , and Alec Delgrado got away with it .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 19]: He thought his pony was good for one last run at top speed , that and no more .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 21]: Risking it , he sprinted across two hundred yards of green turf with the Chantilly Number One in hot chase .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 38]: His opponent was a stone lighter and better mounted ; so Alec 's clear start would not save him from being overhauled and ridden off ere he came within a reasonable striking distance of the opposing goalposts .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 35]: That was the Chantilly man 's supreme occupation , -- some experts will have it that the ideal Number One should not carry a polo stick , -- and the pursuer knew his work .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 21]: A hundred , eighty , sixty , yards in front Alec saw a goal keeping centaur waiting to intercept him .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 20]: In another couple of strides a lean , eager head would be straining alongside his own pony 's girths .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 32]: So he struck hard and clean and raced on , and the goalkeeper judged the flight of the white wooden ball correctly , and smote it back again fair and straight .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 28]: It traveled so truly that it would have passed Alec three feet from the ground to drop almost exactly on the spot whence he had driven it .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 24]: But there was more in that last gallop along the smooth lawn than might be realized by any one present save Alec himself .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 8]: It was his farewell to the game .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 30]: From that day he would cease to be dependent on a begrudged pittance for the upkeep of his stable , and that meant the end of his polo playing .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 15]: But he was not made of the stuff that yields before the twelfth hour .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 31]: His mallet whirled in the air , there was a crack like a pistol shot , and the ball flew over the amazed goalkeeper 's head and between the posts .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 15]: The yelling and handclapping of the few spectators almost drowned the umpire 's whistle .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 10]: `` By gad , that was a corker ! ''
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 16]: said he of Chantilly , as the ponies ' wild gallop eased to a canter .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 19]: `` I hope that flourish of mine did not come too close , Beaumanoir , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 14]: `` Do n't give a tuppenny now , '' laughed Lord Adalbert Beaumanoir .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 27]: `` The match is over , and you 've won it , and if you play till Doomsday you 'll never score a better notch . ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 10]: `` It was lucky , a sheer fluke . ''
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 10]: `` Oh , that be jiggered for a yarn !
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 8]: A fellow flukes with his eyes shut .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 5]: You meant it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 7]: `` Yes , that is right .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 14]: So would you , Berty , if it was your last knock . ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 16]: `` Well , time 's up , anyhow , '' said Beaumanoir , not comprehending .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 10]: They trotted off to the group of waiting grooms .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 24]: Delgrado ran the gauntlet of congratulations , for Paris likes to see Chantilly 's flag lowered , and escaped to the dressing room .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 21]: He gave a letter , already written and sealed , to an attendant , and drove away in his dogcart .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 31]: Bowling quickly along the broad Allée de Longchamps , he turned into the Route de l'Etoile , and so to the fine avenue where all Paris takes the summer air .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 14]: He found himself eying the parade of fashion in a curiously detached mood .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 12]: Yesterday he thought himself part and parcel of that gay throng .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 7]: To-day he was a different being .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 16]: All that had gone before was merged in `` yesterday 's seven thousand years . ''
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 25]: His cob 's pace did not slacken until he drew rein at the giant doorway of a block of flats in the Rue Boissière .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 19]: It was then about five o'clock , and he meant to appear at his mother 's tea table .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 16]: He was far from looking the `` limp rag '' of his phrase to Joan .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 23]: Indeed , it might have taxed the resources of any crack regiment in Paris that day to produce his equal in condition .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 46]: Twenty-four years old , nearly six feet in height , lean and wiry , square wristed , broad shouldered , and straight as a spear , he met the physical requirements , at least , of those classic youths beloved of Joan 's favorite goddess .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 41]: Usually his clean cut face , typically American in its high cheekbones , firm chin , mobile mouth , and thoughtful eyes , wore a happy-go-lucky expression that was the despair of matchmaking mamas ; but to-day Alec was serious .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 28]: He was thinking of the promise that to the souls of fire would be given more fire , to the manful a might more than man 's .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 24]: If he had not been so preoccupied , he would certainly have heard the raucous shouts of newsboys running frantically along the boulevards .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 27]: That is to say , he heard , but did not heed , else some shadow of a strange destiny must have dimmed his bright dreams .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 11]: Their nature might be guessed from his words to Joan .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 14]: The question he addressed to the concièrge proved that his intent was fixed .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 7]: `` Is Monseigneur at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 4]: he asked . ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 7]: _ Oui , m ` sieur .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 15]: _ His Excellency has mounted a little half-hour ago , '' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 3]: Alec nodded .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 6]: `` Now for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 39]: His father , a born fop , a boulevardier by adoption , cultivated habits that seemed to follow the mechanical laws of those clockwork manikins that ingenious horologists contrive for the amusement of children , big and little .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 36]: Whether eating , sleeping , driving , strolling , chatting or card playing , the whereabouts and occupation of Prince Michael Delgrado could be correctly diagnosed at any given hour of the day and night .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 12]: Fortune delights at times in tormenting such men with great opportunities .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 35]: Prince Michael , standing now with his back to the fireplace in his wife 's boudoir , was fated to be an early recipient of that boon for which so many sigh in vain .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 8]: Of course he knew nothing of that .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 26]: His round , plump , rosy face , at first sight absurdly disproportionate to his dapper and effeminate body , wore a frown of annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 17]: In fact , he had been obliged to think , and the effort invariably distressed him .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 22]: Apparently he had a big head , and big headed men of diminutive frame usually possess brains and enjoy using them .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 19]: But closer inspection revealed that his Highness ' skull resembled an egg , with the narrow end uppermost .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 30]: Thus , according to Lavater , he was richly endowed with all the baser qualities that pander to self , and markedly deficient in the higher attributes of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 31]: The traits of the gourmand , the cynic , the egoist , were there ; but the physiognomist would look in vain for any sign of genius or true nobility .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 16]: Recognition of his undoubted rank had , of course , given him the grand manner .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 11]: That was unavoidable , and it was his chief asset .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 40]: He liked to be addressed as `` Monseigneur '' ; he had a certain reputation for wit ; he carried himself with the ease that marks his caste ; and he had shown excellent taste in choosing a wife .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 9]: The Princess did indeed look the great lady .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 51]: Her undoubted beauty , aided by a touch of Western piquancy , had captivated the Paris salons of an earlier generation , and those same salons repaid their debt by conferring the repose , the dignity , the subtle aura of distinction , that constitute the aristocrat in outward bearing .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 36]: For this reason , Princess Delgrado was received in poverty stricken apartments where her husband would be looked at askance , since the frayed Boulevard Saint Germain still shelters the most exclusive circle in France .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 13]: Here , then , was an amazing instance of a one-sided heredity .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 12]: Alexis Delgrado evidently owed both mind and body to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 21]: Looking at the Princess , one saw that such a son of such a father did not become sheerly impossible .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 18]: To-day , unhappily , neither Prince Michael nor his wife was in tune for a family conclave .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 16]: Monseigneur was ruffled , distinctly so , and Madame was on the verge of tears .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 22]: When Alec entered the room he was aware of a sudden silence , accentuated by a half-repressed sob from his mother .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 10]: Instantly he took the blame on his own shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 13]: He expected difficulties ; but he was not prepared for a scene .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 32]: `` Why , mother dear , '' he said , bending over her with a tenderness that contrasted strongly with Prince Michael 's affected indifference , `` what is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 11]: Surely you and dad have not been worrying about me !
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 13]: You ca n't keep me in the nest always , you know .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 11]: And I only want to earn the wherewithal to live .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 11]: That is not so very terrible , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 12]: The distressed woman looked up at him with a wan smile .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 9]: She seemed to have aged since the morning .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 41]: There was a pathetic weakness in her mouth and chin that was noticeably absent from her son 's strong lineaments , and it occurred to Alec with a pang that he had never before seen his mother so deeply moved .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 15]: `` I suppose one must endure the world 's changes , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 36]: `` It was foolish on my part to imagine that things could continue forever on the same lines ; but I shall not grieve , Alec , if no cloud comes between you and me .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 14]: It would break my heart -- '' `` Oh , come now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 14]: he cried , simulating a lively good humor he was far from feeling .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 7]: `` What has dad been saying ?
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 2]: Clouds !
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 4]: Where are they ?
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 9]: Not around my head , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 29]: I have dispelled the only one that existed , the silly halo of class that stops a fellow from working because he happens to be born a Prince .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 9]: It was different for dad , of course .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 29]: My respected grandfather , Ferdinand VII. , was really a King , and dad was a grown man when the pair of them were slung out of Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 14]: Sorry , sir ; but that is the way they talk history nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 7]: It has ceased to be decorous .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 8]: I am afraid Paris is largely responsible .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 29]: You see , we have an Emperor in the next block , two Kings in the Avenue Victor Hugo , and a fugitive ex-President in the Hôtel Métropole .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 18]: I have seen the whole lot , even our noble selves , burlesqued in a Montmartre review .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 4]: And I laughed !
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 8]: That is the worst part of it .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 3]: I roared !
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 7]: We looked such a funny crew .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 25]: And we were all jolly hard up , borrowing five-franc pieces from one another , and offering to sell scepters at a ridiculous sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 6]: That came rather near home .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 16]: We have n't got what the storybooks calls an embarrassment of riches , have we ?
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 20]: So , a cup of tea , please , mother , and I 'll hear the Czar 's edict .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 4]: It is pending .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 9]: I can see it in his eye . ''
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 11]: Usually Prince Michael responded to that sort of airy nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 21]: When sure of his audience , he had spoken much more disrespectfully of the Parisian band of Kings in exile .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 12]: But to-day his chubby cheeks refused to crease in a grin .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 9]: He remained morose , oracular , heavy jowled .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 12]: In fact , he had set himself a very difficult task .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 14]: Now that the moment had arrived for its fulfilment , he shirked it .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 16]: `` May I ask , Alec , if you have any scheme in view ? ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 16]: he said , strutting on the hearthrug in front of a grate filled with ferns .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 31]: He always stood there , -- in winter because it was warm , and he was a martyr to chilblains ; in summer because of the habit contracted in winter .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 12]: `` Well , sir , candidly speaking , I have not .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 18]: But I saw in a newspaper the other day a paragraph of advice to a young man .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 25]: ` No matter how small your income may be , live within it : that is the beginning of wealth , ' it said .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 3]: How profound !
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 6]: I applied it to myself .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 5]: My income is nil .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 16]: There I encountered a serious obstacle at the very start of the Great Money Stakes .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 12]: But -- '' `` This is a grave discussion , Alec .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 10]: I have that to say which may pain you .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 5]: Pray be serious . ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 9]: `` Oh , I am -- quite serious .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 15]: My ponies and the dogcart are in Dumont 's catalogue for the next sale .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 10]: I resigned my membership of the polo club to-day .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 12]: To-morrow , or eke to-night , I look for a job .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 25]: As you , mother o ' mine , have heard men say in your beloved west , I 'm going to butt in . ''
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 18]: `` I -- er -- suppose you -- er -- look to me for some assistance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 4]: coughed Prince Michael .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 4]: His wife rose .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 9]: Her face was gray-white , her eyes blazed .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 7]: `` Alec knows we are poor .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 7]: Why torture him -- and me ?
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 6]: I refuse to allow it .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 4]: I refuse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 50]: Her voice took a tragic note , thin and shrill ; there was a pitiful quivering of her lips that wrung her son 's heart , and he was utterly at a loss to understand why a discussion as to his future should lead to this display of passion .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 17]: `` But , mother darling , '' he cried , `` why are you grieving so ?
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 35]: You and dad must maintain a certain state , -- one begins by assuming that , -- and it is no secret that the Delgrado side of the family was not blessed with wealth .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 14]: Let me try to adjust the balance -- the bank balance , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 6]: Really , why weep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 11]: Alec 's gallant attempt to avert the storm failed again .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 15]: His Serene Highness muttered words in a foreign tongue that sounded anything but serene .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 11]: The Princess did not understand ; but her son did .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 15]: His brows wrinkled , and the good humored gleam died out of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 25]: `` Perhaps , sir , '' he said stiffly , `` this subject had better be discussed when my mother is not present . ''
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 7]: Prince Michael looked at him fixedly .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 23]: For some reason the little man was very angry , and he seemed to resent the implied slur on his good taste .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 17]: `` I am determined to end this farce once and for all , '' he vowed .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 18]: `` Before you joined us , I told the Princess -- '' The door was flung open .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 17]: The young man who had followed Joan and Alec into the Louvre that morning rushed in .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 20]: His pink and white face was crimson now , and his manner that of unmeasured , almost uncontrollable excitement .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 29]: He gazed at them with a wildness that bordered on frenzy , yet it was clear that their own marked agitation was only what he expected to find .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 8]: `` Ah , you have heard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 8]: he snapped , biting at each syllable .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 7]: `` Heard what , Julius ? ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 24]: demanded Monseigneur , with an instant lowering of the princely mask , since Julius dabbled in stocks and was reputed well to do .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 4]: `` The news !
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 6]: The news from Kosnovia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 6]: Prince Michael affected to yawn .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 8]: `` Oh , is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 3]: `` All !
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 11]: _ Grand Dieu _ , what more would you have ?
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 6]: It means -- everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 14]: `` My good Julius , it is long since I was so disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 7]: What , then , has happened ?
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 10]: The Danube in flood is no new thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 5]: `` The Danube ! ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 7]: and the newcomer 's voice cracked .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 10]: `` So you do not know -- sire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 12]: The little word seemed to have the explosive force of nitroglycerine .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 23]: Its detonation rang through the room and left them all silent , as though their ears were stunned and their tongues paralyzed .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 30]: Alec was the first to see that some event far out of the common had reduced his cousin , Count Julius Marulitch , almost to a state of hysteria .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 12]: `` We are at cross purposes , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 30]: `` My father , like the rest of us , read this morning 's telegram about the overflowing of the river -- '' Count Marulitch waved his hands frantically .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 6]: He was literally beside himself .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 25]: His full red lips , not at all unlike those of the youth in Joan 's picture , moved several times before sounds came .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 18]: `` It is at least my good fortune to be the first to congratulate my King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 5]: he cried at last .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 18]: `` Be calm , I pray you ; but a tremendous change has been affected at Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 17]: Last night , while Theodore and the Queen were at dinner , the Seventh Regiment mutinied .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 8]: It was on guard at the Schwarzburg .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 6]: Officers and men acted together .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 5]: There was no resistance .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 4]: It was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 7]: Theodore and Helena were killed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 17]: This man , who appealed for calmness , was himself in a white heat of emotion .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 33]: A stifled scream , a sob , almost a groan , broke from the Princess , and she clung to her son as though she sought protection from that bloodthirsty Seventh Regiment .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 14]: Prince Michael , fumbling with an eyeglass , dropped it in sheer nervousness .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 20]: Alec , throwing an arm round his mother , recalled the hoarse yelling of the newsboys on the boulevards .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 15]: Was it this latest doom of a monarchy that they were bawling so lustily ?
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 20]: He glanced at his father , and the dapper little man found it incumbent on him to say something .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 9]: `` But , Julius -- is this true ?
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 6]: There are so many canards .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 22]: You know our proverb : ' A stone that falls in the Balkans causes an earthquake in St. Petersburg . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 9]: `` Oh , it is true , sire .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 13]: And the telegrams declare that already you have been proclaimed King . ''
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 4]: `` I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 8]: Prince Michael 's exclamation was most unkingly .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 17]: Rather was it the wail of a criminal on being told that the executioner waited without .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 19]: His ruddy cheeks blanched , and his hands were outstretched as if in a piteous plea for mercy .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 22]: There was a tumult of objurgations in the outer passage ; but this King in spite of himself paid no heed .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 4]: `` I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 8]: he gasped again , with relaxed jaws .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 9]: `` You , sire , '' cried Marulitch .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 6]: `` Our line is restored .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 13]: There will be fighting , of course ; but what of that ?
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 13]: One audacious week will see you enthroned once more in the Schwarzburg .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 6]: Here come Stampoff and Beliani .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 19]: You are quick on my heels , messieurs ; but I promised my cabman a double fare . ''
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 42]: A scared manservant , vainly endeavoring to protect his master 's private apartments , was rudely thrust aside , and a fierce looking old warrior entered , followed by a man who was obviously more of a Levantine than a Serb .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 33]: The older man , small , slight , gray haired , and swarthy , but surprisingly active in his movements for one of his apparent age , raced up to Prince Michael .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 19]: He fell on his knees , caught that nerveless right hand , and pressed it to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 17]: `` Thank Heaven , sire , that I have been spared to see this day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 13]: The Greek , less demonstrative , nevertheless knelt by Stampoff 's side .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 17]: `` I too am your Majesty 's most dutiful and loyal subject , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 14]: The Prince did then make a supreme effort to regain his self possession .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 18]: `` Thank you , General , '' he murmured , `` and you also , Monsieur Beliani .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 7]: I have only just been told .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 6]: Theodore and Helena both dead !
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 4]: What a thing !
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 16]: They were my enemies ; but I am shocked , I may almost say grieved .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 7]: And what am I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 12]: I am practically powerless , -- few friends , no money .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 17]: One does not merely pack a valise and go off by train to win a throne .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 9]: You say I am proclaimed King , Julius .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 3]: By whom ?
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 5]: Have the representatives met ?
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 9]: Is there an invitation from the people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 7]: Stampoff was on his feet instantly .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 18]: A man of steel springs and volcanic energy , his alertness waged constant war against his years .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 5]: `` The people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 5]: `` What of them ?
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 5]: What do they know ?
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 7]: There is talk of a Republic .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 4]: Think of that !
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 5]: Could folly go farther ?
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 28]: A Republic in the Balkans , with Russia growling at one door , Austria picking the lock of another , and the Turk squatting before a third !
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 4]: No , Monseigneur .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 41]: Start from Paris to-night , cross the Danube , reveal yourself to your supporters , and you will soon show these windbags that a man who means to rule is worth a hundred demagogues who exist only to spout . ''
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 11]: His Serene Highness was slowly but surely recovering lost ground .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 16]: He grasped the eyeglass again , and this time gouged it into its accustomed crease .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 20]: `` You , Beliani , you are not one to be carried away by emotion , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 8]: `` Count Marulitch spoke of a proclamation .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 4]: Who issued it ?
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 8]: Was there any authority behind it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 5]: `` God 's bones !
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 11]: what better authority is there than your Majesty 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 3]: roared Stampoff .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 8]: But the Prince extended a protesting palm .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 18]: `` An excellent sentiment , my friend ; but let us hear Beliani , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 19]: The Greek , thus appealed to , seemed to find some slight difficulty in choosing the right words .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 14]: `` At present , everything is vague , Monseigneur , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 19]: `` It is certain that a battalion of the Seventh Regiment revolted and declared for the Delgrado dynasty .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 14]: Two other battalions of the same regiment in the capital followed their lead .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 21]: But the Chamber met this morning , and there was an expression of opinion in favor of a democratic Government .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 14]: No vote was taken ; but the latest reports speak of some disorder .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 10]: The approaches to the Schwarzburg are held by troops .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 9]: There are barricades in the main streets . ''
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 9]: Prince Michael 's hands went under his coattails .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 39]: His face had not regained its claret red color , and its present tint suggested that it had been carved out of a Camembert cheese ; but he was gradually taking the measure of current events in Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 29]: `` Barricades seem to argue decided opinions , '' he said , and there was a perceptible tinge of cynicism in the phrase that jarred on his hearers .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 13]: `` One must be bold at times , '' muttered Count Julius .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 19]: General Stampoff was chewing an end of his long mustaches in impotent wrath , and Beliani merely shrugged .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 44]: `` Of course , my father means that prudence must be allied with boldness , '' broke in Alec , who had placed his mother in a chair and was now gazing sternly at Marulitch as if he would challenge the unspoken thought .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 6]: `` Exactly , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 3]: Well said !
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 10]: One looks before one leaps , that is it !
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 22]: Now I am not so young , not so young , and I have not forgotten the pleasant ways of Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 16]: Theodore thought all was well ; but you see what has happened after thirty years .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 5]: Just think of it .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 3]: A lifetime !
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 30]: Why , I came to Paris twenty-four years ago , just after you were born , Alexis , and even then the Obrenovitch line seemed to be well established .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 22]: And here you are , a grown man , and Theodore and his Queen are lying dead in the Black Palace .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 6]: It gives one to think .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 19]: Now , our good Stampoff here would have me rush off and buy a ticket for Delgratz to-night .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 34]: As if Austria had not closed every frontier station and was not waiting to pounce on any Delgrado who turned up at this awkward moment on the left bank of the Danube ! ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 34]: Beliani was stroking his nose ; Stampoff evidently meant to shorten his mustache by inches ; and Julius Marulitch was waxen , and thereby rendered more than ever like a clothier 's model .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 6]: Alec was a dutiful son .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 27]: There were elements in the composition of the senior Delgrado that he did not admire ; but he had never before suspected his father of cowardice .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 42]: His cousin Julius , whom he thoroughly disliked , was betraying a whole world of meaning in the scorn that leaped from his eyes , and there was no mistaking the thoughts that inspired the furious General and the impassive Greek .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 13]: For the first time in his life , Alec despised Prince Michael .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 42]: There was a quickening in his veins , a tingling at the roots of his hair , a tension of his muscles , at the repulsive notion that a Serene Highness might , after all , be molded of common clay .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 24]: And in that spasm of sheer agony he remembered how Joan 's sweet voice had thrilled him with the message of Pallas Athene .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 32]: Was he , indeed , one of those sons of the immortals whom the goddess `` drives forth by strange paths ... through doubt and need and danger and battle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 13]: Surely some such hazardous track was opening up now before his feet !
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 9]: His whole nature was stirred in unknown depths .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 24]: It seemed to him that there was only one man in the room whose words had the ring of truth and honest purpose .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 12]: He strode forward and caught old Paul Stampoff by the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 38]: `` I 'll tell you what , '' he said , unconsciously adopting the free and easy style of speech that came naturally to him , `` you and I must carry this thing through , General !
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 10]: My father is glued to Paris , you know .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 37]: He has lost some of his enthusiasm , and one must be enthusiastic to the point of death itself if he would snatch a Kingdom out of such a fire as is raging now in Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 14]: Austria has never seen me , probably has never even heard of me .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 14]: I can slip through her cordon , swim ten Danubes if need be .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 6]: What say you , General ?
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 6]: Will I fill the bill ?
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 9]: If I fail , what does it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 26]: If I win -- well , we must reverse the usual order of things , and my respected parent can step into my shoes . ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 38]: `` Alexis , I am proud of you -- '' began Prince Michael pompously ; but a sigh that was blended with a groan came again from his wife , and Princess Delgrado drooped in a faint .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 13]: Alec lifted her in his arms and carried her to a bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 12]: A queer silence fell on the four men in the boudoir .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 21]: Even his Serene Highness was discomfited , and abandoned his position on the hearthrug to gaze out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 11]: To his displeased surprise , a small crowd had gathered .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 9]: A man was pointing to the Delgrado apartments .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 38]: Another man , carrying a bundle of newspapers , bore one of the curious small Parisian contents bills , but its heavy black type was legible enough : `` Assassination of the King and Queen of Kosnovia !
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 6]: King Michael in Paris ! ''
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 16]: Alec , having given the Princess to the care of her maid , came back .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 26]: He found his father looking into the street , General Stampoff standing on the hearthrug , and Count Julius whispering something in Beliani 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 14]: `` My mother will soon be all right , '' he announced cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 27]: `` She was a bit upset , I suppose , by our warlike talk ; but we were so excited that we forgot she was present .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 12]: Well , father , what say you to my proposal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 4]: Prince Michael turned .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 9]: His face was no longer in the light .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 12]: Perhaps that was his notion when he first approached the window .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 13]: `` I think it is an excellent one , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 22]: `` Of course , there is a regrettable element of risk -- '' `` But what are we to understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 7]: broke in Stampoff 's gruff accents .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 15]: `` These things are not to be settled as a shopkeeper appoints an agent .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 18]: Does your Highness renounce all claim to the throne of Kosnovia in favor of your son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 9]: Words have a peculiar value on such occasions .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 29]: The substitution of `` Highness '' for `` Majesty '' was not devoid of significance ; for Stampoff , though loyal to the backbone , was no courtier .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 4]: cried Alec sharply .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' said Prince Michael , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 16]: Count Julius Marulitch breathed heavily , and Constantine Beliani threw a wary eye over Alec .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 3]: said Stampoff .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 6]: `` That clears the air .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 26]: I shall be ready to accompany your Majesty by the train that leaves the Gare de l'Est at seven-thirty P.M. '' Prince Michael laughed dryly .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 8]: `` You see , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 13]: `` I was sure Stampoff would interfere with my dinner hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 11]: There was almost a touch of genius in the remark .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 25]: Its very vacuity told of the man 's exceeding unfitness for the rôle thrust upon him by certain desperadoes in the far off Balkans .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 23]: `` We must have money , '' growled Stampoff with a most unflattering lack of recognition of the elder Delgrado 's humor .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 17]: said Prince Michael , plunging both hands into his trousers ' pockets and keeping them there .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 5]: `` How much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 3]: inquired Beliani .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 9]: `` To begin with , fifty thousand francs .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 10]: After that , all that can be raised . ''
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 25]: `` It is most unfortunate , but my -- er -- investments have been singularly unremunerative of late , '' said his Serene Highness .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 7]: `` Why fifty thousand francs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 30]: inquired Alec , half choked with wrath at sight of his father 's obvious relief when the terrifying phantom of the Black Castle was replaced by this delectable Paris .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 16]: Yet , with it all , he was aware of a consuming desire to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 23]: There was a sense of utter farce in thus disposing of the affairs of nations in a flat in the Rue Boissière .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 22]: He recalled the exiled potentates of the music hall review , and the bitter wit of the dramatist was now justified .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 17]: It was ludicrous , too , of Stampoff to address him as `` your Majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 14]: `` Even Kings must give bribes occasionally , '' explained the impetuous General .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 10]: `` Or promise them , '' said Count Julius .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 9]: `` Or take them , '' said Beliani .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 22]: `` If I am to be a King , I mean to dispense with these bad habits , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 10]: `` We need our railway fares only , General .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 15]: Once at Delgratz , our fickle Kosnovia must either maintain us or shoot us .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 10]: In either event , we are provided for . ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 17]: `` Still , we must have sufficient funds to secure a foothold , '' urged Stampoff .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 15]: `` I charge myself with providing ten thousand francs , '' said the Greek .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 6]: Alec glanced at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 7]: `` Give the money to Stampoff .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 5]: He may want it .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 8]: I do not , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 12]: `` Dumont , though a horse dealer , is fairly honest .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 19]: My four ponies are worth another ten , and he will surely pay me five , cash down .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 8]: We meet at the Gare de l'Est .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 3]: Who goes ?
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 5]: You , Julius ? ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 19]: `` No , '' said the Count , `` I shall follow when you have made a beginning .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 7]: My presence would hamper you now .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 21]: I am too well known , and secrecy is all-important until you are at the head of the army . ''
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 19]: Alec turned on him with an air that would have delighted Joan , could she have been present .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 5]: `` The army ! ''
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 8]: `` I know nothing of leading armies .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 13]: I mean to place myself at the head of the people . ''
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 5]: `` Nonsense , Alexis !
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 5]: Make for the troops .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 13]: They alone can make or mar you , '' said Prince Michael .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 15]: `` We shall settle those points at Delgratz , '' declared the brusk Stampoff .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 16]: `` You will bring the money , half in gold , to the station ? ''
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 5]: he added to Beliani .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 4]: Gold is best .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 11]: For the remainder , you will want Russian notes . ''
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 12]: Something seemed to be troubling the august mind of Prince Michael .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 24]: `` By the way , my dear Beliani , '' he began ; but the Greek awoke into a very panic of action .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 12]: `` Pray forgive me , your Highness , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 21]: `` If I have to raise such a large sum before seven o'clock I can not lose an instant . ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 26]: `` I shall see you off from the Gare de l'Est , '' cried Marulitch hurriedly , and the two quitted the room in company .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 23]: Alec went to pay a brief visit to his mother , and Prince Michael was left alone with the rugged old General .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 12]: Then , for a few seconds , he became a man .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 13]: `` You must forgive me , Paul , '' he said huskily .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 9]: `` I am not fitted for the work .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 14]: I am broken down , a trifler , a worn out old dandy .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 9]: You have got the right metal in Alexis .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 19]: See to it that he does not follow my example , but keeps unstained the family name . ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 5]: `` God 's bones !
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 11]: he will do that at least , '' muttered Stampoff .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 25]: `` If you or your father had possessed half his spirit , there would never have been an Obrenovitch on the throne of Kosnovia !
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 10]: Ferdinand VII. , Michael V. , Alexis III . !
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 4]: By the patriarch !
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 13]: somehow you Delgrados have managed at last to breed a King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 21]: CHAPTER III IN THE ORIENT EXPRESS After some haggling , Alec wrung four thousand five hundred francs out of Dumont .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 23]: Then , at five minutes past six , he jumped into a cab and was driven to the Place de la Sorbonne .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 10]: Of course he had ascertained Joan 's address easily .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 32]: He made no secret of the fact that he had seen her on her way to the Louvre nearly every day of the twenty that had elapsed since their first meeting .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 17]: His knowledge of the route she followed advanced quickly until he found out where she lived .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 38]: He would not have dared to call on her now , if it had not been for the tremendous thing that had happened in his life ; for he was sure he would become King of Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 35]: The art that conceals art is good ; but the art that is unconscious of artifice is better , and never had soothsayer arranged more effective preliminaries for astounding prediction than sibyl Joan herself .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 13]: Paris , too , might well witness the rising of his star .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 10]: What other city stages such memorials to inspire ambition ?
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 74]: Behind him , as his cab sped down the Champs Elysées , rose the splendid pile of the Arch of Triumph ; in front , beyond the Place de la Concorde , the setting sun gilded a smoke blackened fragment that marked the site of the Tuileries ; while near at hand the statue of France , grief stricken yet defiant , gazed ever and longingly in the direction of her lost Provinces .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 26]: Here , within a short mile , stood the silent records of three Empires , founded , as time counts , within a few years .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 8]: Two were already crumbled to the dust .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 15]: The survivor , consolidated on the ruins of France , flourished beyond the Rhine .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 24]: Perhaps , if read aright , these portents were not wholly favorable to one about to try his luck in that imperial game .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 45]: But Alec , though a good deal of a democrat at heart , was cheered by the knowledge that so long as the world recognizes the divine right of Kings , no monarch by descent could lay better claim to a throne than he .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 30]: And he was young , and in love , and ready to believe that youth and love can level mountains , make firm the morass , bridge the ocean .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 10]: He wondered how Joan would take his great news .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 8]: He thought he could guess her attitude .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 17]: At first she would urge him to forget that such a person as Joan Vernon existed .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 18]: Then he would plead that she was asking that which was not only impossible but utterly unheroic .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 6]: And the minutes were flying .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 34]: He would remind her that time does not wait even for Kings , nor would the Orient Express delay its departure by a single second to oblige such a fledgling potentate as he .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 14]: `` We must part now , my sweet , '' he would say .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 9]: `` I am going to demand my birthright .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 13]: When I am admittedly a King , I shall send for you .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 13]: If you do not answer , I shall become my own envoy .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 9]: You will make a beautiful Queen , Joan .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 14]: You and I together will raise Kosnovia from the mire of centuries . ''
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 37]: Somewhat stilted lovemaking this ; but what was a poor fellow to do who had been taken from the Rue Boissière and plunged into empire making , all in the course of a summer 's evening ?
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 13]: He crossed the Pont Neuf without ever a look at Henri Quatre .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 5]: That was a pity .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 15]: The sarcastic Béarnais grin might have revealed some of the pitfalls that lay ahead .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 54]: At any rate , the King of Navarre could have given him many instances of a woman 's fickleness -- and fickleness was the ugly word that leaped into Alec 's puzzled brain when an ancient dame at Joan 's lodgings told him that Mademoiselle and her maid had gone away that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 3]: `` Gone !
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 4]: Gone where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 4]: he asked blankly .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 49]: `` It is necessary to write , '' said Madame , and shut the door in his face , since it is forbidden in the Quartier for good looking and unknown young men to make such urgent inquiries concerning the whereabouts of discreet young women like Mademoiselle Joan .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 10]: Léontine , still scrubbing , came to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 12]: Never had she seen any one so distinguished as this Monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 4]: _ Mon Dieu !
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 19]: _ but it was a pity that the belle Américaine should have packed her boxes that very day !
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 13]: And diminutive Léontine was romantic to the tips of her stubby fingers .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 4]: `` M'sieu ' ?
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 15]: wishes to know where he will find the young lady who lives there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 16]: said she archly , jerking her head and a broom handle toward the neighboring house .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 12]: `` But yes , my pretty one , '' cried Alec .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 25]: `` Well , Pauline said -- Pauline is her domestic , see you -- said they were going to the forest to paint . ''
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 5]: `` To Fontainebleau ? ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 17]: `` Perhaps , m ` sieu ' -- to the forest , that was it . ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 4]: `` No name ?
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 3]: Barbizon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 5]: `` It might be .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 15]: I have no head for those big words , m ` sieu ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 7]: Alec gave her a five-franc piece .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 20]: It was the first coin he found in his pocket , and the sight of it caused a frown .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 5]: Confound those Montmartre playwrights !
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 11]: Why was their stupid travesty constantly recurring to his mind ?
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 18]: He frowned again , this time at Auguste Comte 's smugness , and looked at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 5]: Twenty-five minutes to seven !
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 15]: It was too late now to do other than write -- if he succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 7]: If not -- ah , well !
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 14]: `` Some of them are slain in the flower of their youth . ''
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 26]: At least , she would remember , and those glorious eyes of hers would glisten with tears , and the belief helped to console him .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 11]: Still , he was saddened , disappointed , almost dulled .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 26]: Doubt came darkly with the dispelling of the dream that he might commence his Odyssey with Joan 's first and farewell kiss on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 18]: Love and ambition seemed to be at variance ; but love had flown , whereas ambition remained .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 19]: Back , then , to the Rue Boissière , to an uproar of visitors , sightseers , journalists .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 7]: Prince Michael had become Monseigneur again .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 6]: He was holding a reception .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 13]: Alec , pressing through the throng , was waylaid by a servant .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 25]: `` This way , monsieur , '' whispered the man , drawing him into a passage and thence to the room of Princess Delgrado .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 25]: Alec was soothing his mother 's grief when his father entered secretly on tiptoe with the hushed voice and stealthy air of a conspirator .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 14]: He carried a parcel , long and narrow , wrapped in brown paper .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 12]: `` I have been consumed with anxiety , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 16]: `` Julius came and warned me that your departure from Paris ought to be incognito .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 13]: This is wise ; so I remain King-elect till you reach Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 10]: The newspapers are pestering me to declare a program .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 13]: They all expect that I shall leave Paris to-night or early to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 28]: Indeed , an impudent fellow representing ' _ Le Soir _ ' says that if I do n't bestir myself I shall be christened the Sluggard King .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 7]: But I shall humbug them finely .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 5]: Leave that to me .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 20]: Your portmanteaus have been smuggled out by way of the servants ' quarters , and you must vanish unseen .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 21]: Buy a ticket for Vienna , ignore Stampoff during the journey , accept my blessing , and take this . ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 6]: He held out the parcel .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 3]: inquired Alec .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 11]: `` My father 's sword , your grandfather 's sword .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 9]: I have kept it bright for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 3]: Alec squirmed .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 24]: He knew the weapon , a curved simitar inlaid with gold , and reposing in a scabbard of gilt metal and purple velvet .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 39]: In its wrapping of brown paper and twine it suspiciously resembled a child 's toy , and Prince Michael 's grandiloquent manner added a touch of buffoonery to a farewell scene made poignant by a woman 's tears .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 18]: `` I shall use it only on the skulls of eminent personages , '' said Alec gravely .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 11]: In truth , this Parisian kingship was rapidly becoming farcical .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 12]: What a line , what a situation , for that review !
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 7]: But there was worse to come .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 12]: Checked in his outburst of family pride , Monseigneur became practical .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 6]: `` What of Dumont ? ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 14]: `` He was touched ; but he knocked off five hundred francs . ''
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 5]: `` Ah , bah !
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 17]: I rather hoped -- well , I must return to the salon and play my part .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 16]: Remember , you will see no one except a servant at the Gare de l'Est .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 8]: Julius has arranged passports , everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 10]: `` He is taking an extraordinary interest in me .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 14]: Of course , if I pull through , he becomes heir presumptive . ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 3]: `` Parbleu !
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 4]: That is so .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 6]: But -- you will marry .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 6]: Bide your time , though .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 48]: Choose a Queen who -- '' his shifty eyes fell on the trembling form of his wife , who had remained strangely silent during this somewhat strained interview , -- `` who will be as good a wife to you as your mother has been to me .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 2]: Farewell !
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 6]: may God guard you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 18]: Twice in one day had the pompous little man been betrayed into an avowal of honest sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 5]: But he soon recovered .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 34]: Once reëstablished on the hearthrug , with his eyeglass properly adjusted , his hands tucked under his coattails when they were not emphasizing some well turned phrase , Prince Michael enjoyed himself hugely .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 10]: And then Alec clasped his mother in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 7]: She was almost incoherent with terror .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 19]: Bid him remain she dare not ; she lacked the force of character that such a step demanded .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 28]: She had given too many years to this chimera of royalty now suddenly grown into a monster to be sated only by the sacrifice of her son !
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 19]: But she mourned as if he was already dead , and a lump rose in Alec 's throat .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 21]: He had always loved his mother ; his father had ever been remote , a dignified trifler , a poser .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 7]: The three held nothing in common .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 34]: It could hardly be doubted that every good quality of mind and body the boy possessed was a debt to the brokenhearted woman now clinging to him in a very frenzy of lamentation .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 12]: Small wonder if his eyes were misty and his voice choked .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 18]: if Joan but knew of this sorrowing mother 's plight , surely she would come to her !
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 7]: At last he tore himself away .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 12]: Grasping that ridiculous parcel , he hurriedly descended a back staircase .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 29]: Owing to the paternal watchfulness that the French Government exercises over its subjects , he was obliged to pass the concièrge ; but none paid heed to him .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 20]: If it came to that , all Paris would guffaw at the notion of dear Alec becoming a filibuster .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 6]: He hailed a passing cab .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 19]: If he would catch his train , they must drive furiously , which is nothing new in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 23]: Climbing the Rue La Fayette , he passed Count Julius Marulitch and Constantine Beliani coming the other way in an open victoria .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 14]: They were so deeply engaged in conversation that they did not see him .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 8]: Julius was talking and the Greek listening .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 28]: It flashed into Alec 's mind that the presence in Paris of the Greek on the very day of the Delgratz regicide offered a most remarkable coincidence .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 38]: Beliani was no stranger to him , since he and General Stampoff , the one as Finance Minister and the other as Commander in Chief , were exiled from Kosnovia after an abortive revolution ten years ago .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 63]: But Beliani usually lived in Vienna , indeed , he was sometimes regarded as an active agent in Austria 's steady advance on Salonica , -- whereas dear old Paul Stampoff hated Austria , was a frequent visitor to the Delgrado receptions , and it was largely to his constant urging and tuition that Alec owed his familiarity with the Slav language .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 48]: The Greek , it was evident , heard of the murders at the earliest possible moment ; Julius too was singularly well informed , though his interest in Kosnovian affairs had long seemed dormant ; even the fiery Stampoff was no laggard once the news was bruited .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 19]: Alec went so far as to fix the exact time at which Julius appeared in the Rue Boissière .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 28]: He knew something of the ways of newspapers , and was well aware that no private person could hope to obtain such important intelligence before the press .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 30]: He himself had unwittingly heard the first public announcement of the tragedy , and the three men had certainly lost no time in hurrying to greet their new sovereign .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 9]: What a madly inconsequent jumble it all was !
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 47]: Little more than two hours ago he was driving through the Bois with no other notion in his brain than to seek a means of earning a livelihood ; yet here he was at the Gare de l'Est carrying a sword as a symbol of kingship .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 12]: A sword , wrapped in brown paper , tied with string !
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 19]: Suppose , by some lucky chance , Joan met him now , would she sympathize , or laugh ?
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 15]: He found his father 's valet waiting with his luggage near the ticket office .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 7]: The man gave him an envelop .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 21]: It contained a passport , viséd by the Turkish Embassy , and a few scribbled words : Note the name .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 11]: It is the nearest to your initials B. could procure .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 9]: I shall come to you on the train .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 3]: Destroy this .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 2]: S .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 27]: The name was that on the passport , `` Alexandre George Delyanni ; nationality , Greek ; business , carpet merchant ; destination , Constantinople . ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 3]: Alec smiled .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 16]: The humor of it was steeling him against the canker of Joan 's untimely disappearance .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 28]: `` I do n't look much like a Greek , '' he said to himself ; `` but the ` Alexandre ' sounds well as an omen .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 7]: I 'm not so sorry now .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 9]: This business would tickle Joan to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 49]: So , on the whole , it was a resigned if not light-hearted adventurer who disposed himself and his belongings in the Orient Express , after experiencing the singular good luck of securing a section in the sleeping car returned by a Viennese banker at the last moment .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 28]: He went about the business of buying his ticket and passing the barrier with a careless ease that would have excited the envy of a Russian Terrorist .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 42]: Sharp eyes attend the departure of every international train from Paris ; but never a spy gave more than casual scrutiny to this broad shouldered youth strolling down the platform , the latest passenger to arrive , and the least flurried .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 8]: He neither saw nor looked for Stampoff .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 49]: Having a minute to spare , he obtained a newspaper , took a seat voucher for the first dinner , lighted a cigarette , entered his reserved compartment , arranged his luggage , and burnt General Stampoff 's scrawl just as the train moved out of the station .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 36]: Then he read an account of the Delgratz crime , -- for it was only a crime , a brutal and callous murder , not worthy to be dignified by the mantle of political hate .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 36]: The unhappy King and Queen of Kosnovia were dining in company with the Queen 's brother and the Minister of Ways and Communications when the regiment on duty in the palace burst in on them .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 12]: King Theodore was shot down while endeavoring to protect the Queen .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 16]: She too fell riddled with bullets , and both corpses were flung into a courtyard .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 36]: The unhappy guests were wounded , and still remained prisoners in the hands of the regicides , who vaunted that they had `` saved '' the country , and meant to restore the ancient sovereignty .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 44]: Beliani 's summary of subsequent events was accurate ; but it struck Alec at once that he had said nothing of the minister nor of Sergius Vottisch , Queen Helena 's brother , who was mainly instrumental in defeating Beliani 's half-forgotten revolt .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 7]: Did he know of their presence ?
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 13]: How peculiar that he should utter no word of triumph concerning Vottisch !
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 6]: Alec threw aside the paper .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 6]: He was sick at heart .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 19]: He loathed the thought that the first step toward his throne lay across the body of a woman .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 10]: `` Nice guards , the noble Seventh Regiment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 35]: `` Now , when I am King -- '' Then he realized that during the few minutes that had elapsed since the train started , the whole aspect of the adventure had changed completely .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 42]: It was no longer a snatch of opera bouffe , a fantastic conceit engendered in the brain of that elderly beau whom he had left in the Rue Boissière , a bit of stage trifling happily typified by the property sword .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 9]: It had become real , grim , menacing .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 5]: It reeked of blood .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 11]: Its first battle was there , recorded in the newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 24]: He pictured those brutal soldiers mauling the warm bodies , thrusting them through an open window and proclaiming their loyalty -- to him !
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 28]: The train was rushing through an estate noted for its game , and he had been one of a party of guns in its coverts last October .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 15]: He remembered shooting a pheasant of glorious plumage , and saying : `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 4]: What a pity !
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 19]: I ought to have spared him , if only on account of his coat of many colors . ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 73]: `` When birds are flying fast , even you , Alec , have to shoot _ passim _ , '' said a witty Hebrew , and Delgrado did not appreciate the _ mot _ until some one told him that _ passeem _ in Hebrew meant `` patchwork , '' and that Jacob 's offense to Joseph 's brethren lay in the gift of a Prince 's robe to his favorite son .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 20]: The quip came to mind now with sinister significance ; he wished most heartily he had missed that pheasant .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 43]: It was quite a relief when dinner was announced , and he made his way to the dining car , where a polyglot gathering showed that although the Orient Express had not quitted Paris fifteen minutes it had already crossed many frontiers .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 14]: There were few French or English on board , and not one American .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 31]: A couple of Turks , a Bulgarian , a sprinkling of Russians and Levantines , and a crowd of Teutons , either German or Austrian , made up the company .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 27]: Stampoff remained invisible , and Alec shared a table with an Armenian , who insisted on speaking execrable English , though he understood French far better .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 49]: Then this newest of all Kings felt very lonely , and he began to understand something of the isolation that would surround him in that Black Castle of his daydream , where , if all went well with him , he alone would be the `` foreigner . ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 8]: A longing for companionship came upon him .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 48]: He wanted some one who would laugh and talk airy nonsense , some one whose mind would not be running everlastingly in the political groove , and an irresistible impulse urged him to ask for a telegraph form and write : BEAUMANOIR , Villa Turquoise , Chantilly .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 7]: Come and join in the revel .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 2]: ALEC .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 15]: He gave the message to an attendant , bidding him despatch it from Chalons .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 24]: He reasoned that Beaumanoir would be puzzled , would call at the Rue Boissière , see his father , and solve the mystery .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 43]: In all likelihood , Lord Adalbert , who cheerfully answered to the obvious nickname -- would accept the invitation , and by the time he reached Delgratz the succession to the throne of Kosnovia would be in a fair way toward settlement .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 37]: Moreover , by depriving the Chantilly team of their crack Number One , Alec would equalize matters for the Wanderers , and the love of sport is ever the ruling passion in healthy and vigorous youth .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 5]: `` By gad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 12]: he said to himself , `` I 'm showing craft already .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 7]: That is a Machiavellian wire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 33]: It was , as it happened , a stroke worthy of the wily Florentine himself ; but neither he nor his latest pupil could possibly have estimated its true bearing on events .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 6]: After dinner Stampoff found him .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 6]: Delgrado was astounded at first .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 14]: Stampoff , shorn of his immense mustache , ceased to be a General .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 57]: In fact , the wizened , keen faced old man bore a striking resemblance to a certain famous actor of the Comédie Française ; but he was not seated in Alec 's compartment ten seconds with the door closed ere he showed that the loss of his warrior aspect had in no way tamed his heart .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 25]: `` Yes , '' he said , passing a lean hand over his blue-black upper lip , `` it was necessary to disguise myself .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 15]: Ten years are not so long , and I am known on the Danube .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 13]: You see , we must get through to Delgratz and the Schwarzburg .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 15]: Once there , with three thousand bayonets behind us , we can do things .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 23]: Leave the fighting to me , your -- '' He stopped , and glanced at a fat Turk lumbering along the corridor .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 12]: `` Exactly , my dear old friend , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 15]: `` Drop titles , please , until we have a right to use them .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 13]: Even then they can be left to gentlemen ushers and court chamberlains .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 8]: Alec and Paul sound better , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 7]: But you were outlining a scheme .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 24]: I go with you as far as Delgratz ; but those bayonets in the Schwarzburg will not be behind me , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 31]: Some of them may come within measurable distance of my manly chest ; but even that is improbable , for I have always noticed that vulgar assassins are cowards . ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 21]: Stampoff 's bushy eyebrows had been spared , and they formed a hairy seam now straight across eyes and nose .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 28]: `` You forget , perhaps you do not know , that these men alone have actually declared for you -- for a Delgrado , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 11]: `` And a pretty gang of cutthroats they must be !
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 8]: I read the details after leaving Paris .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 6]: That poor woman , Paul !
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 11]: She was pretty and vivacious , I have been told .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 9]: Just picture the scene in the dining hall .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 26]: One woman , three unarmed men , the King leaping up and endeavoring to shield her -- and the gallant Seventh firing volleys at them .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 23]: Then , when the last sob is uttered , the last groan stilled , husband and wife are pitched to the dogs .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 8]: Oh , it makes my blood boil !
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 4]: By the Lord !
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 12]: when I am King I shall hang the whole crew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 5]: He spoke very quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 29]: Any one looking through the window in the upper half of the door would have seen a young man seemingly telling an older one something of ordinary import .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 8]: But the words were crisp and hot .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 14]: They came like drops of molten steel from the furnace of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 7]: Stampoff 's thin face grew swarthier .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 10]: He bent forward , his hands on his knees .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 13]: `` Will you tell me why you are going to Delgratz ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 10]: he asked with a curious huskiness in his voice .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 10]: `` To occupy a throne -- or a tomb .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 20]: In either event , I am only copying the example of the vast majority of my revered ancestors . ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 8]: `` The throne is yours by right .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 10]: Theodore has fallen almost precisely as your grandfather fell .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 26]: Ferdinand was shot , and escaped with his life only because there was a struggle and a few faithful followers carried him into safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 23]: `` If I depended on the fealty of the Seventh Regiment , I should not expect to find even the faithful few .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 15]: Poor Theodore may have looked for them ; but they did not exist . ''
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 16]: `` Then we had better leave the train at Chalons and return to Paris . ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 16]: `` Certainly , if the butchers of the Schwarzburg are to form my cohort . ''
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 5]: `` God 's bones !
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 10]: never have I been so mistaken in a man !
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 21]: Your father , now , -- one feared he might have lost his nerve , -- but you , Alec !
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 5]: The devil take it !
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 6]: I thought better of you .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 12]: I suppose then , it will have to be Marulitch . ''
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 3]: `` Julius !
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 10]: Is he a candidate -- or a rival ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 5]: Stampoff paused , irresolute .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 14]: He was deeply troubled , and his fierce eyes searched Delgrado 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 12]: `` I had real hope of you , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 16]: `` You would appeal to the women , and they are ever half the battle .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 6]: Why are you so squeamish ?
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 10]: You need n't embrace the men of the Seventh .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 10]: You can use them , and kick them aside .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 11]: That is the fate of ladders that lead to thrones .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 4]: I know it .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 9]: I am old enough not to care . ''
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 12]: `` I am not thinking of ladders as yet , Paul .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 24]: Sufficient for the day is the foundation thereof , and I refuse to build my Kingdom on the broken vows of traitors . ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 3]: Stupid words !
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 6]: The ravings of cheap philosophers !
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 11]: By your own showing , I am a traitor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 8]: `` Yes , but an honest one .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 7]: You fought fairly and were beaten .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 19]: Were it otherwise , Theodore would never have tried so often to tempt you to his service . ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 13]: The General flung himself back in the carriage and folded his arms .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 6]: The steel spring was relaxed .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 18]: He was baffled , and the weariness of life had suddenly enveloped him in its chilling fog .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 6]: `` Very well , then .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 20]: We descend at Chalons , '' he said , with a sigh that was a tribute to adverse fate .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 23]: `` Having paid for your ticket , you may as well come on to Vienna , '' said Alec with irritating composure .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 4]: `` Curse Vienna !
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 11]: Why should I take that long journey for nothing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 6]: `` To oblige me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 7]: `` You 'll drive me crazy .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 7]: How will it oblige you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 25]: `` Because I am going to Delgratz , General , and there is a whole lot of things I want to ask you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 5]: Stampoff bounced up again .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 14]: `` Will you be so kind as to explain what you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 4]: he cried indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 22]: We are going to talk far into the night , and it is only fair that you should know my intentions .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 63]: Otherwise , the valuable counsel you will give me might be misdirected , as it is , for instance , at the present moment , when you are heatedly advising me to throw in my lot with a set of rascals who , when I fail to satisfy their demands , would turn and rend me just as they have rended Theodore .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 10]: Be sure that their object was selfish , Stampoff .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 13]: Not one of these men has ever seen Prince Michael or myself .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 12]: Even their leaders must have been mere boys when Ferdinand VII .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 8]: was attacked -- probably by their fathers .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 9]: Well , I shall have none of them .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 10]: They and their like are the curse of Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 15]: Who will pay taxes to keep me in the state that becomes a King ?
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 3]: Not they .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 13]: Who will benefit by good government and honest administration of the laws ?
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 20]: Assuredly not they , for they batten on corruption ; they are the maggots not the bees of industry .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 9]: Over whom , then , shall I reign ?
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 63]: `` I am young , Paul ; but I have read and thought , -- not very deeply , perhaps , but I have looked at things in that strong , clear light of Paris , which is heady at times , like its good wine , but which enables men to view art and politics and social needs in their nakedness .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 23]: And I am half an American , too , which accounts for certain elements in my composition that detract from French ideals .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 26]: A Frenchman can not understand , Paul , why some of my excellent kith and kin across the Atlantic should condemn studies of the nude .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 23]: But somehow I have a glimmering sense of the moral purpose that teaches us to avoid that which is not wholly decent .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 29]: So I am a blend of French realism and American level headedness , and both sides of my nature warn me that a King should trust his people .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 11]: Sometimes the people are slow to learn that vital fact .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 36]: Well , they must be taught , and the first lesson in a State like Kosnovia might well be given by trying those felons of the Schwarzburg before a duly constituted court of law . ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 6]: `` Fine talk , Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 3]: Fine talk !
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 20]: You do not know our Serbs , '' yet Stampoff was moved , and his Slavonic sympathies were touched .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 23]: `` Well , ' A King should die standing , ' said one poor monarch , who thought he did know Frenchmen .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 15]: I ask only for a few hours in my boots once I reach Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 15]: I shall say things that will not be forgotten for a day or two .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 15]: Come , now , my old war-horse , join me in this new campaign !
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 35]: It may well prove your last as it is my first ; but we shall fall honorably , you and I. '' There were tears in Stampoff 's eyes when Alec made an end .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 10]: `` Perhaps you are right , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 12]: `` I have always given my mind to the military element .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 23]: It seemed to me that the common folk require to be driven , not led , into the path they should tread .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 15]: I am growing old , Alec ; yours is a new creed to me .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 33]: I never thought to hear it from a Delgrado , and it will make a rare stir in more places than Kosnovia ; but by Heaven it is worth a trial ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 17]: So Alec had won a convert , and that is the first essential of a reformer .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 66]: Long and earnestly did they discuss the men and manners of Kosnovia and its chief city , and ever the Danube drew nearer ; but not a word did Alec say of his telegram to Beaumanoir until a man met him in the Western Station at Vienna , wrung his hand , and rushed away again with the words : `` Beaumanoir leaves Paris to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 3]: He understands .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 9]: So do I. Good luck , old chap !
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 12]: If you have to hit , hit hard and quickly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 6]: Stampoff did not speak English .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 26]: He was greatly distressed that Alec should have been recognized the instant he alighted from the train , though Paris was then twenty-two hours distant .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 6]: `` Who is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 4]: he asked anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 9]: `` A friend from the British Embassy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 5]: `` From an Embassy !
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 6]: Then we are lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 13]: `` It seemed to me that I was found , rather . ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 20]: `` But if the Embassies know -- '' `` They are invariably the worst informed centers in any country .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 14]: The facts of which they profess total ignorance would fill many interesting volumes .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 6]: Have no fear , General .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 7]: I said ' a friend . '
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 8]: He gave me a pleasant message . ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 11]: `` Ah , from a woman , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 22]: But -- '' Delgrado wheeled round to face a tall burly man standing stiffly at his side as though awaiting orders .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 24]: Stampoff , who had been following the vanishing figure of Beaumanoir 's emissary with suspicious eyes , turned and looked at the newcomer .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 23]: `` Oh , that is Bosko , '' he said , `` my servant -- yours , too , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 8]: You can trust Bosko with your life .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 9]: Ca n't he , you dog ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 7]: _ Oui , m ` sieur !
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 5]: _ '' said Bosko .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 30]: CHAPTER IV THE WHITE CITY Alec was sound asleep when the Orient Express rumbled over the Danube for the last time during its slow run to the Near East .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 23]: He was aroused by an official examining passports , which he was informed would be restored in the railway station at Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 13]: He disliked the implied subterfuge ; but it could not be helped .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 19]: Austria , gracious to travelers within her bounds , excepts those who mean to cross her southeastern frontier .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 6]: There she frowns and inquires .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 28]: If it was known that a Delgrado was in the train , he would have been stopped for days , pestered by officialdom ; and possibly deported .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 16]: A curious element of safety was , however , revealed by newspapers purchased at Budapest .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 10]: The various factions in Delgratz had declared a truce .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 43]: The Delgrado partizans had telegraphed an invitation to Prince Michael to come and occupy the throne , and the Prince , or some wiser person , had sent a gracious reply stating that his matured decision would reach Kosnovia in due course .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 23]: The National Assembly was still coquetting with the republican idea ; but , in the same breath , avowed its patriotic impartiality .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 8]: In a word , Delgratz wanted peace .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 30]: Toward that end , the Seventh Regiment continued to occupy the Black Castle , the remainder of the troops stood fast , and the citizens pulled down their barricades .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 31]: Oddly enough , the Paris correspondent of `` The Budapest Gazette '' pointed out that Prince Michael 's son was playing polo in the Bois during the afternoon of Tuesday .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 24]: The journalist little dreamed that Alec was reading his sarcastic comments on the Delgrado lack of initiative at Budapest at midnight on Wednesday .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 26]: The train was about to cross the River Tave -LRB- Delgratz stands on the junction of that stream and the Danube -RRB- when Stampoff appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 6]: The Albanian servant accompanied him .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 11]: `` Leave everything to Bosko , '' said the General .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 18]: `` We must display no haste , and he will smooth the way through the customs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 14]: `` I suppose you do n't want me to ask any questions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 3]: laughed Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 4]: `` Better not .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 12]: Do you still adhere to your program of last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 4]: `` Absolutely . ''
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 30]: Stampoff took off his hat , pointed through the window , and said quietly , `` There , then , God willing , is your Majesty 's future capital .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 14]: I wish to congratulate your Majesty on your first sight of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 18]: Beyond a level stretch of meadowland rose the spires and domes and minarets of a white city .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 41]: The sun , not long risen , gilded its graceful contours and threw the rest of a wondrous picture into shadow so sharp that the whole exquisite vista might have been an intaglio cut in the sapphire of the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 21]: The Danube , a broad streak of silver , blended with the blue Tave to frame a glimpse of fairyland .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 21]: For one thrilling moment Alec forgot its bloodstained history and looked only on the fair domain spread before his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 34]: Then the black girders and crude latticework of a bridge shut out the entrancing spectacle , and he was conscious that Stampoff had caught his hand and was pressing it to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 22]: The gallant old Serb meant well , for he was a patriot to the core ; but his impulsive action grated .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 6]: Perhaps it was better so .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 52]: Alec , bred in a society that treated such demonstrations with scant respect , was suddenly recalled to earth , and the business that lay before him seemed to be more in keeping with the modern directness of the railway bridge than with daydreams founded on a picturesque vision of Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 34]: The city , too , lost its glamour when seen from those backdoor suburbs that every railway in every land appears to regard as the only natural avenue of approach to busy communities .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 29]: The line turned sharply along the right bank of the Tave and ran past tobacco factories , breweries , powder mills , scattered hovels , and unkempt streets .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 11]: Here was no sun , but plenty of bare whitewash .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 29]: Even Alec , accustomed to the singularly ugly etchings of Paris viewed from its chief railways , was completely disillusioned by these drab adumbrations of commerce and squalor .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 17]: The Tave was no longer blue , but dull brown with the mud of recent rain .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 7]: Not even the inhabitants were attractive .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 20]: They were not garbed as Serbs , but wore ungainly costumes that might have passed unnoticed in the Bowery .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 39]: He was irresistibly reminded of the stage , with its sharp contrasts between the two sides of the footlights , and in the luggage net near his head reposed that melodramatic sword , still wrapped in brown paper .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 11]: The train slowed , and Stampoff went into the corridor .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 5]: He came back instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 12]: `` The station is guarded by troops , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 9]: `` Some of the officers may recognize me .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 7]: Perhaps we ought to separate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 9]: `` No , no , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 9]: `` Let us stick to the other passengers .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 20]: I am the real stranger here , and they can look at me as much as they like . ''
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 12]: It was , indeed , easy to concede that Alexis III .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 8]: was a man apart from his people .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 46]: Swarthy old Stampoff , Prince Michael Delgrado , the pink and white Julius Marulitch , even the olive skinned , oval faced Beliani , might have mingled with the throng on the platform and found each his racial kith and kin ; not so Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 41]: His stature , his carriage , his fair complexion tanned brown with an open air life , picked him out among these Balkan folk almost as distinctly as a Polar bear would show among the denizens of an Indian jungle .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 20]: Moreover , every man of importance wore some sort of uniform , whereas Alec was quietly dressed in tweeds .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 34]: Thus , he drew many eyes , and evoked many a whispered comment ; but never a man or woman in that crowded terminus harbored the remotest notion that he was a Delgrado .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 34]: There were guesses in plenty , wherein he ranged from an English newspaper correspondent to a Greek Prince , the latter wild theory originating in the discovery of his name on the passport .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 22]: Stampoff was ignored , and all went well till Bosko , laden with portmanteaus , led the way to the exit .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 21]: Alec , swayed by a desire to please his father , carried under his arm the sword of Ferdinand VII .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 25]: The customs officials at the barrier allowed the party to pass ; but a shrewd visaged officer standing just outside eyed Alec 's package .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 7]: `` What have you there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 19]: he asked , probably more anxious to exchange a word with this distinguished looking stranger than really inquisitive .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 8]: `` A sword , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 10]: `` And why are you carrying a sword ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 16]: said the other , who seemed hardly to expect this prompt reply in the vernacular .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 11]: `` It is a curiosity , a veritable antique . ''
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 6]: I must see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 18]: `` Come with me to Monsieur Nesimir 's house and I will show it to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 16]: The suspicious one became apologetic , since Monsieur Nesimir was President of the National Assembly .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 10]: `` I pray your pardon , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 9]: `` Any friend of the President passes unchallenged .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 16]: But these are troublous times in Kosnovia , so you understand -- '' `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 25]: Brains are far more useful than swords in Delgratz to-day , and this , at the best , is but a gilded toy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 28]: Stampoff was already inside a closed carriage , and Bosko was holding the door open for Alec , who gave the driver clear instructions before he entered .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 10]: The vehicle rattled off , and Stampoff swore bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 3]: `` Gods !
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 12]: I thought there would be a row , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 18]: `` That fellow is Captain Drakovitch , I remember him well ; he is all nose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 14]: `` I shall appoint him sanitary inspector , '' said Alec , sniffing .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 3]: Stampoff laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 17]: Now that they were fairly committed to Alec 's scheme , he was in excellent spirits .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 5]: `` By the patriarch !
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 16]: you certainly believe in yourself , and I am beginning to believe in you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 3]: he vowed .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 17]: But his faith was rudely shaken when Alec insisted on sending his own card to Nesimir .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 11]: `` That is a mad thing , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 16]: `` He will refuse to receive you and hand you over to the guard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 12]: `` On the contrary , he will hasten to meet us .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 9]: Curiosity is the most potent of human attributes .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 6]: Even Presidents yield to it .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 17]: At this moment , in all likelihood , he is struggling into a frock coat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 4]: Alec was right .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 29]: A portly person , wearing , indeed , a frock coat , a sash , and peg top trousers , appeared in the doorway of the presidential mansion .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 9]: He also wore an expression of deep amazement .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 19]: He glanced from the tall smiling youth to the diminutive General , on whom his eyes dwelt searchingly .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 23]: `` Yes , '' said Stampoff abruptly , speaking in French , `` I am Paul Stampoff , shorn of his fleece .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 12]: This is the King , '' and he nodded to Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 5]: `` The King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 26]: `` Alexis III. , grandson of Ferdinand VII. , and son of Michael V. '' Nesimir hastily ordered a servant to close the outer door .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 57]: As it happened , the President 's military guard was stationed at a gate on the other side of the main courtyard , and no one could be aware of the visitor 's identity , except the man who had taken Alec 's card , while he , probably , was unable to read Roman script .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 16]: `` Your Excellency will doubtless permit our baggage to be placed in the hall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 15]: said Alec , using the most musical of all the Slavonic tongues with fluency .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 41]: The President , in that state of trepidation best described by the homely phrase , `` You could have knocked him down with a feather , '' seemed to collapse utterly when he heard the stranger talking like a native .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 7]: `` Certainly , your -- certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 18]: I do n't understand , of course ; but I shall give directions ... '' he stuttered .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 15]: `` You have come by train , from -- er -- from the west ?
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 5]: You have not breakfasted ?
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 5]: A cup of chocolate ?
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 9]: Ah , yes , a cup of chocolate .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 6]: Then we can discuss matters .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 44]: The Assembly meets at ten , and I am very busy ; but I can give you half an hour , Monsieur -- '' he looked at the card in his hand , -- `` Monsieur -- '' Then he gave it up .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 27]: He simply dared not pronounce the name ; so , with hospitable flourish , he ushered the two up a broad staircase and into a room .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 29]: While climbing the stairs he recovered sufficiently to tell the doorkeeper that the gentlemen 's portmanteaus were to be brought within and no one admitted without specific permission .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 28]: Once in the room he closed the door , stood with his back to it , and gasped at Stampoff with one word : `` Now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 7]: `` As soon as you like .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 4]: I am famished .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 26]: I ate but little en route , because I detest German cooking , '' said Stampoff , on whom Alec 's methods were taking effect .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 17]: `` But -- '' `` Ah , you wonder why his Majesty should appear without ceremony ?
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 21]: Well , he quitted Paris on Tuesday night , an hour after Prince Michael had abdicated in his favor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 4]: `` Abdicated ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 4]: wheezed the President .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 18]: `` Our friend takes too much for granted , '' broke in Alec , smiling and unembarrassed .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 13]: `` My father could not vacate a throne he did not occupy .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 9]: He merely resigned his claims in my favor .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 28]: Kosnovia should be governed by a constitutional King , and the power to choose him now rests solely with the honorable house of which you are chief .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 13]: If that is your view , I share it to the uttermost .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 25]: It is reported in the press that the men who murdered King Theodore and Queen Helena have declared their allegiance to the Delgrado line .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 9]: My reply is that I refuse their nomination .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 32]: If I am elected King by the representatives of the people , I shall have much pleasure in hanging every officer who took part in the infamy of the Black Castle .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 10]: But -- it is an early hour for politics .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 9]: You mentioned breakfast , Monsieur le Président ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 19]: Fat and asthmatic Sergius Nesimir was not the man to deal with a candid adventurer of this type .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 21]: It occurred to him that he ought to summon help and clap the soi-disant King and his henchman into prison .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 5]: But on what charge ?
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 10]: Could any royal pretender put forth more reasonable plea ?
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 16]: And Kosnovia is near enough to the East to render sacred the claims of hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 11]: `` One moment , I beg , '' he stammered .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 12]: `` Why has your -- why have you come to me ?
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 6]: What am I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 17]: The Assembly -- '' `` The Assembly seems to favor a Republic , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 5]: `` Be it so .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 21]: There are certain arguments against such a course which I would be glad of an opportunity to place before members .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 13]: If you introduce me , they will give me a fair hearing .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 8]: Let a vote be taken at once .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 37]: If it is opposed to a monarchy , I am ready to be conducted to either the railway station or the scaffold , whichever the Assembly in its wisdom may deem best fitted to national needs .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 11]: If it is in my favor , I am King .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 9]: What more is there to be said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 6]: `` What , indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 3]: growled Stampoff .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 6]: `` Why so much talk ?
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 5]: Let us eat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 3]: Poor Nesimir !
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 29]: He had the unhappy history of his country at his fingers ' ends , and never before had Delgrado or Obrenovitch striven for kingship in this kid-glove fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 22]: `` Breakfast shall be served instantly , '' he said , trying vainly to imitate the cool demeanor of his guests .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 12]: `` But -- you will appreciate the difficulties of my position .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 8]: I must consult with the ministers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 40]: `` I hope I may call your Excellency a friend , '' said Alec , `` and I shall be ever ready to accept your Excellency 's counsel ; but on this exceptional occasion I venture to advise you .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 7]: Let none know I am here .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 26]: In the present disturbed condition of affairs there must be almost as many hidden forces existing in Delgratz as there are men in the Cabinet .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 16]: Why permit them to fret and fume when you alone have power to control them ?
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 12]: I promise faithfully to abide by the decision of the Assembly .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 51]: Should it favor me , your position is consolidated ; should it prove adverse to my cause , you still remain the chief man in the State , since the world will realize that it was to you , and you only , I submitted in the first instance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 12]: `` By all the saints , that is well put ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 3]: cried Stampoff .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 32]: `` Now , Sergius , my lamb , a really good omelet , something grilled , and a bottle of sound Karlowitz -- none of your Danube water for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 6]: The President surrendered at discretion .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 10]: Alec 's appeal to his self importance was irresistible .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 38]: He was excited , elated , frightened ; but happily he was strong enough to perceive that a chance of obtaining distinction was within his grasp , and he clutched at it , though with palsied hands .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 75]: So it came to pass that when the hundred and fifty members of the National Assembly gathered in the great hall of the convention , none there knew why a tall , pleasant faced young man should be sitting in the President 's private room , and apparently not caring a jot who came or went during the half-hour 's lobbying and retailing of political gossip that preceded the formal opening of the sitting .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 28]: But there was an awkward moment when Nesimir , pale and shaken , entered the chamber through the folding doors at the back of the presidential dais .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 9]: `` Silence for his Excellency the President ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 28]: shouted a loud voiced usher , and all men looked up in wonder when they discovered that the youthful stranger was standing by the President 's side .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 9]: The session was to be a secret one .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 6]: Press and public were excluded .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 32]: Who , then -- `` Gentleman , '' said Sergius Nesimir , and he spoke with the slowness of ill repressed agitation , `` I have a momentous announcement to make .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 33]: This honorable house has almost committed itself to the republican form of Government -- '' -LSB- Illustration : `` Gentlemen , here stands Alexis Delgrado '' Page 75 -RSB- `` Definitely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 4]: cried a voice .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 5]: this from a Senator .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 6]: The President lifted a hand .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 53]: In other circumstances , the interruptions would have provoked rival storms of agreement and dissent from the many groups into which the Assembly was split up ; but now there was an electric feeling in the air that their trusted chief would not broach this grave question so suddenly without good cause .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 7]: And -- who was his companion ?
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 7]: Why did he occupy the dais ?
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 10]: `` I ask for silence , '' said Nesimir .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 10]: `` The fortunes of Kosnovia tremble in the balance .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 14]: You will be given ample time for discussion ; but hear me first .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 14]: I have said that the republican idea has been mooted in all seriousness .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 22]: We , in common with the rest of humanity , have been horror stricken by recent events in our beloved land .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 10]: Our reigning dynasty has been blotted out of existence .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 9]: There is no heir of the Obrenovitch line .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 31]: Were we , the representatives of the people , to declare in favor of a King , we should naturally turn to the other royal house of our own blood .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 7]: We should send for a Delgrado .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 14]: Gentlemen , here stands Alexis Delgrado -- '' He could go no further .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 14]: A yell of sheer amazement came from all parts of the crowded chamber .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 12]: Ministers , Senators , Representatives , joined in that bewildered roar .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 25]: Those who were sitting rose ; those in the back benches stood on the seats in order to gaze over the heads in front .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 71]: Men shouted and glared and turned to shout again at one another ; but through all the turmoil Alec faced them , smiling and imperturbable , and , at what he judged to be the right moment -- for that volcanic outburst must be given time to exhaust itself -- he placed his one hand on the President 's shoulder and with the other signaled his desire to be heard .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 13]: Again he placed implicit confidence in the all powerful element of curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 40]: He knew full well that these emotional Serbs could not hear his name unmoved , while the extraordinary racial difference between himself and every other man in the Assembly must have made a strong appeal to their dramatic instincts .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 26]: And again was he justified ; for the mere expression of his wish to address them was obeyed by an instant hushing of the storm .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 35]: `` My fellow countrymen , '' he began , `` you whom I expect to count among my friends ere this day is out -- '' Another wave of sound ran through the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 21]: Men still wondered ; but their hearts were beating high , and a new note had come into their voices .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 39]: He was speaking their own language , speaking it as one to the manner born , speaking it as no Austrian could ever speak it , since harsh , dominant German can never reproduce the full Slavonic resonance .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 24]: Alec , but yesterday Joan 's typical idler , had fathomed some uncharted deep in the mysterious art of swaying his fellow men .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 19]: He realized at once that this rumble of astonishment was the very best thing that could have happened .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 32]: He waited just long enough for the sympathetic murmur to merge into nods and whisperings , then he continued : `` It is true that I am here as a Delgrado .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 10]: I come as a candidate , not a claimant .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 40]: It rests with you whether I shall remain among you as Alexis III. , King of Kosnovia , or go back to my father and tell him that our people are anxious to try a new form of Government .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 19]: Of course , '' and here Alec beamed on them most affably , `` there are other alternatives .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 33]: You may elect to put me in jail , or throw me into the Danube , or swing me from a gibbet as a warning to all would-be monarchs and other malefactors .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 10]: But there is one thing you can not do .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 17]: You can never persuade me to wade to a throne through the blood of innocent people !
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 27]: And that is why I am here , and not in the company of the wretched conspirators now skulking behind the walls of the Schwarzburg . ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 44]: Then a hurricane of cheers made the windows rattle , and a deputy from the Shumadia , `` the heart of Kosnovia , '' a bigchested , deep voiced forester , sent forth a trumpet shout that reached every ear : `` Hola !
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 5]: That 's a King !
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 5]: Look at him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 19]: From that instant Alec was as surely King of Kosnovia as the German Emperor is King of Prussia .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 61]: Of course , he had to talk till he was hoarse , and wring strong hands till he was weary , and Stampoff had to make more than one gruff speech , and eloquent Senators and Deputies had to proclaim the inviolate nature of the new constitution , and Alec had to sign it amid a scene of riotous enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 16]: But these things were the aftermath of a harvest reaped by half a dozen sentences .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 10]: The Shumadia man 's simple phrases became a formula .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 8]: Men laughed and said : `` Hola !
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 5]: That 's a King !
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 5]: Look at him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 7]: In time it reached the streets .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 10]: The people took it up as a popular catchword .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 6]: It whirled through all Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 42]: Those who had never seen Alec , nor heard of him before they were told he was King , adopted it as a token of their belief that the nation had at last obtained a ruler who surpassed all other Kings .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 7]: But that was to come later .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 25]: While Alec was listening to the plaudits that proclaimed his triumph , Stampoff growled at him from behind the half-closed door : `` Gods !
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 5]: You 've done it !
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 5]: And without a blow !
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 7]: Never was Kingdom won so easily .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 5]: God bless your Majesty !
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 9]: May you live long and reign worthily ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 15]: Good wishes these ; but in them was the germ of an abiding canker .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 5]: What would Joan say ?
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 38]: He had taken a sleeping car ticket from Paris and had stepped into his patrimony with as little anxiety or delay as would herald a royal succession in the oldest and most firmly established monarchy in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 30]: What of the goddess with the great gray eyes , clear and piercing , who knew all the thoughts of men 's hearts and the secrets of their souls ?
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 23]: What of her warning that she would drive her chosen ones by strange paths through doubt and need and danger and battle ?
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 24]: Which of these had he encountered , beyond the vanished phantoms of idle hours passed in the cozy comfort of the Orient Express ?
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 9]: `` Never was kingdom won so easily ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 7]: Well meant ; but it rankled .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 11]: That ominous line of Vergil 's came to his mind .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 17]: _ Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes _ -LRB- I fear the Greeks even bringing gifts -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 18]: Truly the Greeks were come speedily , carrying in full measure the gifts of loyalty and dominion .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 5]: Yet he feared them .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 39]: A whiff of peril , pitfalls to be leaped , some days or weeks of dire uncertainty , men to be won , and factions placated , any or all of these might have appeased the jealous gods .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 8]: But this instant success would shock Olympus .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 12]: It cried for contrast by its very flight to the pinnacle .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 9]: None suspected this mood in the chosen King .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 11]: He charmed these volatile and romantic Serbs by his naturalness .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 33]: He seemed to take it so thoroughly for granted that he was the one man living who could rule them according to their aspirations , that they adopted the notion without reserve .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 9]: The morning passed in a blaze of enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 25]: Alec , outwardly calm and hale fellow with all who came in contact with him , was really in a state of waking trance .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 17]: His brain throbbed with ideas , words that he had never conned flowed from his lips .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 33]: Thus , when asked to sign the constitution , he wrote `` Alexis , Rex , '' with a firm hand , and then looked round on the circle of intent faces .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 16]: `` Gentlemen , '' he said , `` I hereby pledge myself to our land .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 26]: When I am dead , if my successor shows signs of faltering , make my skin into a drumhead for the cause of Kosnovia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 22]: At the moment he really did not know that this was borrowed thunder , and assuredly the Kosnovians did not care .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 9]: Already his utterances were being retailed with gusto .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 35]: Before night , every adult inhabitant of Delgratz was likening their marvelous King , fallen from the skies , to a drum that should summon the Serbs to found the Empire of their dreams .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 26]: He was asked if he would not order the Seventh Regiment to evacuate the Black Castle so that he might take up his quarters there .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 10]: `` There is no hurry , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 7]: `` The place needs cleaning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 46]: A review of the troops stationed in other parts of the capital was arranged for the afternoon in the beautiful park that crowns the promontory formed by the two rivers , and it was suggested that he should drive thither in the President 's carriage .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 11]: `` I would prefer to ride , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 12]: `` Then the people and I can see one another . ''
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 30]: A number of horses were brought from the late King 's stables and Alec selected a white Arab stallion that seemed to have mettle and be up to weight .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 9]: Soldiers and civilians exchanged underlooks at the choice .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 34]: Selim was the last horse ridden by the ill fated Theodore , and , after the manner of Arabs , he had stumbled on the level roadway and the royal equestrian was thrown .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 25]: During the procession , while passing through the densely packed Wassina-st. , Selim stumbled again and was promptly pulled back almost on his haunches .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 21]: At that very instant a revolver was fired from the crowd and a bullet flattened itself on the opposite wall .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 33]: The would-be assassin was seized instantly , a hundred hands were ready to tear him to shreds , when the King 's white horse suddenly pranced into the midst of the press .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 15]: Grasping the man by the neck , Alec drew him free by main force .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 5]: `` Kill him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 4]: yelled the mob .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 25]: `` No , '' cried Alec , `` we will put him in the recruits ' squad and teach him how to shoot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 67]: Throughout a long day he displayed a whole hearted abandonment to the joy of finding himself accepted by the people as their ruler that did more than a year 's session of the Assembly to endear him to them ; but the seal of national approval was conferred by his action next day , when news came that Lord Adalbert Beaumanoir was a prisoner at Semlin !
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 41]: Naturally , the telegraph wires had thrilled Europe during every hour after ten o'clock on Thursday morning , but the thrills felt in Germany , Russia , and Turkey were supplemented by agonized squirming on the part of official Austria .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 65]: That an upstart , a masquerader , a mountebank of a King , should actually have traversed Austria from west to east , without ever a soul cased in uniform knowing anything about him , was ill to endure , and the minions of Kosnovia 's truculent neighbor swore mighty oaths that no bottle holder from Paris or elsewhere should be allowed to follow .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 39]: So Lord Adalbert Beaumanoir was watched from Passau to Maria Theresiopel , and telegrams flew over the face of the land , and Alec 's British ally was hauled from the train at Semlin soon after dawn Friday .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 36]: Captain Drakovitch , anxious to atone for his prying of the previous day , brought circumstantial details to his Majesty Alexis III. , who was breakfasting with Nesimir , Stampoff , and Ministers of State .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 33]: There could be no doubting Beaumanoir 's identity , since his baggage was on the train , and Drakovitch had made sure of his facts before hurrying to the President 's house .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 19]: `` Has Austria any right to arrest a British subject merely because he wishes to enter Kosnovia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 10]: asked Alec , looking round at the assembled gray-heads .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 8]: `` None whatever , '' said Nesimir .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 12]: `` It is an outrage , '' puffed the War Minister .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 15]: `` She would not dare act in that way on any other frontier ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 6]: cried he of the Interior .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 11]: `` What , then , is to be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 4]: demanded the King .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 14]: `` Make the most emphatic protest to Vienna , '' came the chorus .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 8]: `` Through the usual diplomatic channels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 7]: `` Yes -- of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 15]: `` But that means leaving my friend in prison for an indefinite period . ''
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 6]: Eloquent shrugs expressed complete agreement .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 20]: `` Has it been the habit of Kosnovia to accept tamely such treatment at the hands of Austria ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 8]: inquired Alec , looking at the President .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 8]: `` I fear so , your Majesty .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 15]: We are small and feeble ; she is mighty in size and armament . ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 19]: `` So was Goliath , yet David slew him with a pebble , '' said Alec , rising .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 16]: `` Come , Captain Drakovitch , you and I will call on the Austrian Ambassador .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 26]: Stampoff , will you kindly arrange that a regiment of cavalry and six guns shall parade outside the station in half an hour 's time ?
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 22]: You might also ask the railway people to provide the necessary transport , though I hardly expect it will be needed .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 14]: Still , we ought to make a show , just for practice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 7]: Several faces at the table blanched .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 11]: `` What does your Majesty mean by these preparations ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 3]: asked Nesimir .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 6]: `` Preparations -- for what ?
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 18]: Surely we can inspect our own troops and test our own railway accommodation , '' laughed Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 20]: `` As for the Austrian Ambassador , I intend to make an emphatic protest through the usual diplomatic channel .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 10]: Is n't that what you all agreed to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 8]: He went out , followed by Drakovitch .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 41]: In five minutes they were clattering through the streets accompanied by a small escort , which Alec would have dispensed with if it was not absolutely needed to clear a passage when once Delgratz knew that the King was abroad .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 14]: Neither the Austrian nor Russian representative had recognized the new régime as yet .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 26]: Each was waiting to see how the other would act ; so Baron von Rothstein viewed with mixed feelings the arrival of his royal visitor .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 28]: But he met him with all ceremony , and began to say that instructions might reach him from Vienna at any moment to pay an official call .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 12]: `` Quite correct , Herr Baron , '' said Alec cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 24]: `` I am a novice at this game ; but I fully understand that you act for your Government and not for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 12]: That fact renders easy the favor I have to ask . ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 21]: `` Anything that lies in my power , your Majesty -- '' `` Oh , this is a simple matter .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 26]: A friend of mine , Lord Adalbert Beaumanoir , who was coming here from Paris to visit me , was arrested at Semlin this morning .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 12]: There is , or can be , no charge against him .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 12]: Some of your zealous agents have blundered , that is all .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 40]: Now , I want you to go to Semlin in a special train I will provide and bring his Lordship here before -- '' Alec looked at his watch -- `` It is now nine -- shall we say ?
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 7]: -- by eleven o'clock sharp . ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 10]: Von Rothstein was startled , and he showed it .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 16]: `` But this is the first I have heard of it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 3]: `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 12]: That is why I came in person to tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 12]: `` I fear I can not interfere , your Majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 5]: `` Is that so ?
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 16]: Why , then , Herr Baron , are you Minister for Austria at Delgratz ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 13]: `` I mean that this matter is not within my province . ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 6]: `` Surely it must be .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 17]: I can not allow my friends to be collared by Austrian police for no reason whatsoever .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 9]: This passport question concerns Kosnovia , not Austria .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 11]: The action of the Semlin authorities is one of brigandage .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 12]: It can be adjusted amicably by you , Herr von Rothstein .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 5]: Do you refuse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 15]: `` I fear I can not do what you desire , your Majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 5]: That is a pity !
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 16]: In that event , I must go to Semlin myself and liberate Lord Adalbert . ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 18]: `` I do n't quite understand -- '' `` Is my German so poor , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 3]: laughed Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 15]: `` I mean , of course -- '' `` You think I am bluffing .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 6]: Do you know the word ?
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 13]: It is American for a pretense that is not backed by action .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 7]: I intend nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 10]: Either you or I must start for Semlin forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 19]: If I go , I take with me a bodyguard sufficiently strong to insure my friend 's freedom .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 8]: I am not declaring war against Austria .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 35]: If any jack in office in Kosnovia acts like these Semlin policemen , and a Kosnovian official refuses to put matters straight , by all means let Austria teach the offenders a sharp lesson .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 19]: She will have my complete approval , as I hope I have yours on the present occasion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 21]: `` But , your Majesty , such action on your part does really amount to a declaration of war ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 3]: `` Ridiculous !
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 50]: Austria seizes an inoffensive British gentleman merely because he travels from Paris to Delgratz , I appeal to you , the Austrian minister , to go and release him , and you refuse ; yet you tell me I am making war on your country if I rescue him .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 5]: The notion is preposterous !
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 10]: At any rate , it can be argued later .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 22]: I have sufficient cavalry and guns assembled near the station , and I hope to be in Semlin in twenty minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 6]: Good morning , Baron . ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 14]: `` Your Majesty , I implore you to forego this rash enterprise . ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 10]: `` It is you or I for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 6]: `` Let me telegraph . ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 3]: `` Useless .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 4]: That spells delay .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 10]: You or I must go to Semlin -- now !
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 7]: Which is it to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 26]: The Austrian diplomat , pallid and bewildered , yet had the wit to believe that this quiet voiced young man meant every word he said .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 23]: He reasoned quickly that the freeing of a pestiferous Englishman at Semlin could have no possible effect on Austria 's subsequent action .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 42]: She might please herself whether or not the threatened invasion of her territory should be deemed a cause of war , while to yield for the hour robbed this extraordinary adventurer of the prestige that would accrue from his bold act .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 17]: `` I will go , your Majesty , '' said he , after a fateful pause .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 3]: `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 14]: Permit me to congratulate you on a wise decision , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 12]: `` I shall wait your return in patience until eleven . ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 5]: `` And then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 13]: `` Oh , then -- I follow you , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 8]: Baron von Rothstein thought silence was best .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 16]: He drove to the station , and did not fail to note the military preparations .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 8]: His special quitted Delgratz at nine-twenty A.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 18]: At ten-forty A.M. it came back and Alec met him and Lord Adalbert Beaumanoir on the platform .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 17]: `` Sorry you were held up , old chap , '' was the King 's greeting .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 37]: `` Some of these frontier police are fearful asses ; but Herr von Rothstein rushed off the instant he heard of your predicament , and here you are , only five hours late after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 17]: `` Would n't have missed it for a pony , dear boy , '' grinned Beaumanoir .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 21]: `` There was a deuce of a shindy when three fat johnnies tried to pull me out of my compartment .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 22]: I told 'em I did n't give a tinker 's continental for their bally frontier , and then the band played .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 8]: I slung one joker through the window .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 18]: Good job it was open , or he might have been guillotined , eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 10]: `` No one was injured , I hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 20]: `` Another fellow said I bent his ribs ; but they sprang all right under the vet 's thumb .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 12]: Tell me , why does our baronial friend look so vinegary ?
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 20]: He chattered like a magpie in the police bureau , or whatever it is called , at Semlin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 22]: `` Lord Adalbert wishes me to explain that a disagreeable incident had ended happily , '' said Alec to von Rothstein .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 19]: `` I am not sure that it has ended , your Majesty , '' was the grim reply .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 16]: `` Well , then , shall we say that it has taken a satisfactory turn ?
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 28]: You see , my dear Baron , I am quite a young King , and I shall commit many blunders before I learn the usages of diplomacy .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 23]: But I mean well , and that goes a long way , -- much farther than Semlin , even beyond Vienna . ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 53]: CHAPTER V FELIX SURMOUNTS A DIFFICULTY Count Julius Marulitch and his friend Constantine Beliani , the one savagely impatient , the other moody and preoccupied , sprawled listlessly in Marulitch 's flat in the Avenue Victor Hugo , and , though it was evening , each was reading `` The Matin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 21]: That is to say , each was pretending to read ; but their thoughts did not follow the printed words .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 3]: Alexis III .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 34]: had reigned only ten days , yet the most enterprising of the Paris newspapers was already making a feature of a column headed : `` Our dear Alec , day by day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 37]: It ought to be an interesting record to these two men , yet it evidently was not one-tenth so humorous as `` The Matin '' believed , since there was a deep frown on both faces .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 12]: At last Marulitch flung the paper aside with an angry snarl .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 6]: `` Ah , bah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 3]: he growled .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 17]: `` May the devil fly away with our dear Alec and his doings day by day !
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 17]: A nice pair of fools we made of ourselves when we pitchforked him into power ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 9]: `` Patience , my friend , patience ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 4]: said the Greek .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 18]: `` Everything comes to him who waits , and Alec will fall far when his luck changes .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 16]: It may be to-morrow , or next week ; but he must experience a reverse .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 20]: He is like a gambler at Monte Carlo who stakes maximums just because the table is running favorably . ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 4]: `` Fish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 3]: snorted Marulitch .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 9]: `` What else would a gambler do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 5]: `` What indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 20]: agreed Beliani , though a far less alert intelligence than Marulitch 's might have known that he was annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 73]: The pink and white Julius , whom his friends had nicknamed `` le beau Comte , '' did not fail to catch the contemptuous note of that purred answer ; he sprang up from his chair , ransacked a cupboard , and threw on the table a box of those priceless cigarettes , the produce of a single southwesterly hillside at Salonica , that are manufactured solely for the Sultan of Turkey .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 13]: `` There , smoke , my Constantine , '' he laughed harshly .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 6]: `` Why should we quarrel ?
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 4]: We were idiots .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 9]: Let us , then , admit it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 5]: `` Were we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 6]: `` Can you deny it ?
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 7]: We arranged the first move beautifully .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 20]: With Theodore out of the way -- '' The Greek turned his head swiftly and looked at the door .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 5]: Marulitch lowered his voice .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 12]: `` No need to refer to Theodore , you will say ?
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 6]: How can one avoid it ?
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 9]: His death was the cornerstone of the edifice .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 25]: If only that senile uncle of mine had become King the path would be clear for the final coup before the year was out .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 6]: And now where are we ?
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 9]: What purpose do we serve by self delusion ?
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 10]: Each day 's newspaper bears witness to our folly .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 182]: Alec carries the Assembly by storm ; Alec captures a would-be assassin ; Alec flouts Austria ; Alec disbands the Seventh Regiment and hands its officers to the police ; Alec attends the funeral of Theodore and Helena , and takes over their servants and debts ; Alec tells the Sultan that he exists in Europe only on sufferance ; Alec draws a map of Kosnovia and decorates it with railways ; Alec bathes in the Danube at six , breakfasts at seven , attends a christening at eight , a wedding at nine , a review at ten , a memorial service in the cathedral at eleven , lunches at twelve , receives provincial deputations at one , inaugurates the Delgratz Polo Club at two and the Danubian Rowing Club at three , -- Alec round the clock , and all Europe agape to know what next he will be up to -- and you and I here , unknown , unrecorded , -- you and I , the brains , the eyes , the organizers of the whole affair !
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 43]: Oh , it makes me sick when I remember how I stood like a stuck pig in old Delgrado 's flat and let the son jump in and snatch from the father 's hands the scepter I had purchased so dearly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 15]: The Greek rose languidly , strolled to the door , and threw it open .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 35]: A page boy was in the lobby , and it was easy to see by his innocent face that his presence there was inspired by no more sinister motive than to deliver a newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 18]: Beliani took it , closed the door , listened a moment , and unfolded the damp sheet .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 8]: He glanced at its foreign news . ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 23]: ` Le Soir ' gives prominence to a rumor that King Alexis will marry a Montenegrin Princess , '' he murmured composedly .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 7]: `` Mirabel , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 6]: `` She is unnamed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 5]: `` That 's it .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 6]: I know , I know !
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 5]: He will marry Mirabel .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 3]: By Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 11]: if he does , I 'll shoot him myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 23]: `` The trial of the regicides is fixed for June , '' went on Beliani , wholly unmoved by Marulitch 's vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 17]: `` Now , the vital question is , How far can Stampoff be relied on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 11]: `` How does our reliance on Stampoff concern Mirabel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 14]: `` I am not thinking of Mirabel , but of Julius and Constantine .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 21]: If Stampoff tells our young Bayard everything , Delgratz is no place for you and me , my veteran . ''
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 34]: Marulitch , though trembling with passion , could not fail to see that the Greek was remarkably nonchalant for one who had witnessed the utter collapse of ten years of work and expenditure .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 7]: `` Are we going there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 8]: he managed to ask without a curse .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 14]: `` Soon , quite soon , provided Stampoff keeps a still tongue . ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 4]: `` But why ?
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 9]: To grace the coronation by our presence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 5]: `` It may be .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 14]: Remember , if you please , that we are Alec 's best friends .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 6]: We gave him his chance .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 12]: I offered to finance him ; did finance Stampoff in fact .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 11]: We are unknown personally to the officers of the Seventh .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 12]: That was wise , Julius , far-seeing , on my part .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 10]: Oh , yes , we must go to Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 8]: Delgratz is the nerve center now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 9]: `` You are keeping something from me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 7]: `` On my honor , no .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 18]: But you sneered at my parable of the successful gambler , whereas I believe in it implicitly .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 42]: I have seen that type of fool backing the red , staking his six thousand francs on every coup , and have watched a run of twelve , thirteen , seventeen , twenty-one ; but the smash came at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 4]: `` What matter ?
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 14]: A man who wins twenty times can well afford to lose once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 14]: `` I said a gambler , not a financier , '' smiled Beliani .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 6]: `` But let it pass .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 32]: I thought you told me there was a girl here in Paris -- '' `` So there is , a beauty too ; but Alec has meanwhile become a King . ''
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 6]: `` A somewhat peculiar King .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 14]: He has borrowed his regal notions from America rather than Kosnovia , Julius .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 10]: He would laugh at any claim of divine right .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 21]: One of these days you will find him chaffing the Hohenzollerns , and that is dangerous jesting in the Balkans .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 15]: If he loves a girl in Paris , he will not marry your Mirabel .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 8]: I fancy I have taken his measure .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 19]: If I am right , he is far too honest to occupy the throne of Kosnovia . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 4]: _ Grand Dieu !
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 9]: _ the country is pining for honest government .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 7]: Even you will grant that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 14]: `` Even I , as you say ; but I should be wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 14]: If I have an ax to grind , so has the other fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 12]: Kosnovia is in the East , and the East loves deceit .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 10]: Alec has dazzled the people for a few days .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 14]: Wait till he begins to sweep the bureaus free of well paid sinecurists .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 25]: Wait till he finds out how the money is spent that the Assembly votes for railways , education , forestry , and the like .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 13]: Wait till he reduces the staff of the army and the secretaries .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 11]: I know Delgratz and Kosnovia , and he does not .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 31]: He will win the people , it is true ; but he will alienate the men who can twist the people this way and that to suit their own purposes .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 13]: Before a month is out he will be wrangling with the Assembly .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 8]: See if I am not a prophet .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 14]: Oh , yes , Julius , you and I must go to Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 7]: No hurry ; slow but sure .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 8]: I 'll break the journey at Vienna .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 6]: We must sound Stampoff too .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 19]: But before I go , I should like to be sure that the girl has gone there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 8]: `` The artist girl to Delgratz ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 21]: Julius was bitter and skeptical ; but he reposed such confidence in Beliani 's judgment that he choked his doubts .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 6]: Can it be managed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 13]: Le beau Comte leered , and the satyr grin was highly expressive .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 10]: It seemed to show the man 's real nature .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 17]: In repose his face was insipid ; now for an instant he resembled the god Pan .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 9]: `` You called Alec a Bayard just now .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 7]: Not a bad title for him .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 10]: He has that kind of repute among his friends .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 31]: Perhaps the girl is built on the same lines , and we do n't want to send a pretty saint to Delgratz merely to inspire him to fresh efforts . ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 11]: The Greek inhaled a deep breath of the aromatic smoke .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 24]: `` You 'll be an average sort of King , Julius ; but you are not a philosopher , '' said he thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 19]: `` I tell you we are safer than ever if we can bring him and the girl together .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 22]: He will marry her , you short sighted one -- marry her , and thus alienate every Slav in the Balkans .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 29]: I have turned this thing in my mind constantly since I recovered from the first shock of his achievement , and I am fairly certain of my ground .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 17]: Mark you , Princess Mirabel of Montenegro will be reported to-morrow as out of the running .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 25]: If that is so , you will begin to believe me and stop clawing your hair and injuring your fine complexion by scowling . ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 34]: Next morning 's `` Matin '' announced that King Alexis was greatly annoyed by the mischievous and utterly unfounded canard that bracketed his name with that of a woman he had never seen .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 10]: Count Julius read , and made a hasty toilet .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 20]: Beliani and he had laid their plans overnight , and he lost no time in opening the new campaign .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 11]: It was a difficult and delicate task he had undertaken .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 51]: Paris , big in many respects , is small in its society , which , because of its well marked limits , makes a noise in the world quite incommensurate with its importance ; whereas London , close neighbor and rival , contains a dozen definite circles that seldom overlap .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 28]: The woman Julius had seen with Alec in the Louvre was not on Princess Michael 's visiting list , of that he had no manner of doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 48]: Therefore , from his point of view , the only possible solution of their apparent friendship would prove to be something underhanded and clandestine , an affair of secret meetings , and letters signed in initials , and a tacit agreement to move unhindered in different orbits .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 17]: Being of the nature of dogs and aboriginal trackers , Marulitch made straight for the Louvre .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 16]: There he had quitted the trail , and there must he pick it up again .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 8]: But the hunt demanded the utmost wariness .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 38]: If he startled the quarry , he might fail at the outset , and , supposing his talking was successful , both he and Beliani must still beware of a King 's vengeance if their project miscarried .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 14]: Neither man had the slightest belief in Alec 's innate nobility of character .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 32]: Beliani likened him to Bayard , it is true , and Marulitch had scoffingly adopted the simile ; but that was because each thought Bayard not admirable , but a fool .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 49]: The somber history of the Kosnovian monarchy , a record of crass stupidity made lurid at times by a lightning gleam of passion , justified the belief that Alexis would follow the path that led Theodore , and Ferdinand , and Ivan , and Milosch to their ruin .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 42]: Each of these rulers began to reign under favorable auspices , yet each succumbed to the siren 's spell , and there was no reason at all , according to such reckoning , why the handsome and impulsive Alexis should escape .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 27]: That a pretty Parisienne who was also an artist should fail to offer herself as a willing bait did not enter at all into the calculation .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 18]: `` Be suave , spend money , and keep in the background , '' said the Greek .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 19]: Julius entered the Grande Galerie prepared to apply these instructions through the medium of his own subtle wit .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 8]: At the outset , luck favored him .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 33]: Somehow , it is always easier to do evil than good , and the longevity of evil is notorious , whereas the short lived existence of good would horrify an insurance agent .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 21]: Joan was not present ; but Felix Poluski was preparing a canvas for his twenty-seventh copy of the famous Murillo .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 100]: Two of his `` Immaculate Conceptions '' were in private collections ; one had been sold to a South American millionaire as the Spanish artist 's own duplicate of the picture , though Poluski was unaware of the fraud ; and twenty-three adorned the high altars of various continental churches , where they edified multitudes happily ignorant of the irreverent conditions under which the cheery souled anarchist hunchback droned his snatches of song and extracted from a few tubes of paint some glimpse of heaven , and rays of sunlight , and hints of divine love and divine maternity .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 15]: The crooked little Pole 's genius and character were alike unknown to Count Julius .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 24]: He saw only a quaintly artistic personage who might possibly be acquainted with such a remarkable looking habitué of the gallery as Joan .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 36]: Instead , therefore , of appealing to one of the officials , he approached Poluski , and the two exchanged greetings with the politeness that Paris quickly teaches to those who dwell within her gates .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 12]: `` You work in this gallery most days , monsieur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 3]: said Julius .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 10]: `` But yes , monsieur , '' said Felix .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 38]: `` About a fortnight ago , monsieur , '' explained Marulitch , `` I happened to be here at this hour , and I noticed a young lady copying one of the pictures on the opposite wall .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 9]: Can you tell me who she was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 12]: `` Can you tell me which picture she was copying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 3]: said Poluski .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 23]: `` I am not sure ; this one , I think , '' and Julius pointed to `` The Fortune Teller . ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 6]: Describe her , monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 14]: `` She was tall , elegant , charming in manner and appearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 5]: Poluski appeared to reflect .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 38]: `` The vision sounds entrancing , monsieur , '' he said ; `` but that sort of girl does n't usually earn her crusts by daubing canvas in the Louvre at so much a square foot . ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 10]: `` Yet I saw her , without a doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 7]: She was not alone that morning .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 12]: In fact , a friend of mine was with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 6]: Poluski turned to his easel .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 13]: He was in no mind to discuss Joan with this inquiring dandy .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 13]: `` That simplifies your search , monsieur , '' said he carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 13]: `` All that is necessary is to go to your friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 5]: `` I can not .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 7]: He is not in Paris . ''
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 6]: `` Where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 16]: `` Far enough away to render it impossible that he should solve my dilemma to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 6]: And the thing is urgent .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 11]: I have a commission to offer , a good one .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 22]: If you help , you will be doing the young lady a turn -- and yourself , too , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 7]: `` Kindly explain , monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 13]: `` I mean that I will gladly pay for any information . ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 4]: `` How much ?
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 9]: Five , ten francs , a louis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 10]: The Pole 's sarcasm was not to be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 8]: Julius was warned and drew back hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 40]: `` I really beg your pardon , '' he said ; `` but I am so anxious to carry out my undertaking that I have expressed myself awkwardly , and I see now that you are misinterpreting my motives .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 6]: Let me speak quite candidly .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 11]: I have no desire to meet the lady in person .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 25]: An art connoisseur , who admires her work , wishes to send her to a cathedral in a distant city to copy a painting .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 5]: He will pay well .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 13]: He offers traveling expenses , hotel bill , and five thousand francs .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 23]: The picture is not a large one , and the work easy , a Byzantine study of Saint Peter , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 27]: If you tell me , monsieur , that you can arrange the matter , I shall be pleased to leave it entirely in your hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 10]: `` Since when did Alec become a connoisseur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 5]: demanded Poluski , grinning .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 17]: Marulitch was startled ; but he smiled with a ready self possession that did him credit .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 28]: `` It was in Monsieur Delgrado 's company I saw the fair unknown , '' he admitted ; `` but this affair does not rest with him .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 7]: It is genuine , absolutely . ''
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 15]: `` Nevertheless , this Byzantine Saint Peter hangs in Delgratz , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 8]: `` I -- I think so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 11]: `` Five thousand francs , you said , and expenses .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 3]: Not bad .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 8]: I 'm a pretty good hand myself .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 5]: Will I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 40]: The Pole was enjoying the stupid little plot ; for it could wear no other guise to him , and Count Julius was mortified by the knowledge that he had blundered egregiously at the first step in the negotiation .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 5]: What would Beliani say ?
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 30]: This wizened elf of a man had seen clear through their precious scheme in an instant , and , worst of all , it had not advanced an inch .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 16]: Julius made a virtue of necessity , and placed all his cards on the table .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 14]: `` I want you to credit my statements , '' he said emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 7]: `` This proposal is quite straightforward .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 25]: My principal is prepared to pay half the money down before the lady leaves Paris , and the balance when the picture is delivered .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 29]: Further , he will bear the expenses of any one who accompanies her , -- a relative , or a friend , such as yourself , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 10]: I do n't figure in the matter at all .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 17]: I am a mere go-between , and if you think otherwise you are utterly mistaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 25]: Felix began to whistle softly between his teeth , and the action annoyed Julius so greatly that he decided to try a new line .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 14]: `` I seem to have amused you by my sincerity , monsieur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 3]: he snapped .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 17]: `` Pray forget that I have troubled you -- '' `` But why , my paragon ?
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 4]: _ Que diable !
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 11]: _ one does not spurn five thousand francs like that !
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 22]: I hum or whistle when I am thinking , and just now I am wondering how this business can be arranged .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 6]: Who is your client ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 6]: `` Who is yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 3]: retorted Julius .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 9]: `` She exists , at any rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 7]: `` So does the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 19]: `` Well , then , let us meet to-morrow -- '' `` But time is all important . ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 27]: `` There ca n't be such a mortal hurry , seeing that Saint Peter has hung so long undisturbed in Delgratz , '' said Felix dryly .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 34]: `` Moreover , it will clear the air if I tell you that the lady is not in Paris , so I can not possibly give you her answer before to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 18]: `` How can I be sure that she is the person actually intended for this commission ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 15]: `` There wo n't be the least doubt about it when King Alexis III .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 6]: sets eyes on her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 8]: Julius was certainly not himself that day .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 8]: His pink face grew crimson with amazement .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 20]: `` If you tell her that you will defeat my friend 's object in sending her to Delgratz ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 4]: he blurted out .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 8]: `` Eh , what are you saying ?
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 12]: What , then , becomes of that poor Saint Peter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 3]: `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 15]: She is going there to copy it , not to philander with Alec . ''
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 24]: Poluski screwed his eyes up until he was peering at Julius 's excited features as if endeavoring to catch some transient color effect .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 20]: `` Frankly , you puzzle me , '' he said after a pause ; `` but come again to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 12]: And no tricks , no spying or that sort of thing !
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 8]: I am the wrong man for it .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 15]: If you doubt me , ask some one who has heard of Felix Poluski .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 15]: You see , Count Julius Marulitch , I am far more open than you .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 26]: I knew you all the time , and as to your motives , I can guess a good deal that I do n't actually know .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 13]: Still , there is nothing positively dishonest about a Byzantine Saint Peter .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 13]: It is not art , but five thousand francs sounds like business .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 16]: Half the cash down , you said ; anything by way of preliminary expenses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 4]: `` Meaning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 10]: `` Say , one per cent. , fifty francs .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 20]: Otherwise , I must paint all day and trust to the post -- the least eloquent of ambassadors . ''
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 18]: `` Oh , as to that , '' and Julius produced a hundred-franc note from his pocketbook .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 6]: The Pole accepted it gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 11]: `` I go instantly , monsieur , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 14]: He began to fold his easel and put away his brushes and colors .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 10]: Once he glanced up at the rapt Madonna . ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 13]: _ Au ` voir , ma belle _ , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 10]: `` This affair of Saint Peter must be arranged .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 3]: It presses .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 17]: They change Kings speedily in Delgratz nowadays , and their taste in saints may follow suit .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 4]: But , courage !
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 21]: I shall return , and who knows what will come of this excursion into the forgotten realm of Byzantium ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 41]: Count Marulitch , of course , had not counted on one who was a complete stranger not only recognizing him but stripping the pretense so thoroughly of the artistic commission offered to Alec 's fair companion of that memorable morning .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 32]: He must put the best face on his blunder when discussing it with Beliani , and he promised himself a quite definite understanding with Poluski ere another sou left his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 6]: Meanwhile , who was Poluski ?
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 11]: That question , at least , could be answered easily .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 7]: One clue might lead to another .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 18]: To-morrow , when they met , it might be his turn to astonish the warped little Pole .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 19]: Felix , feeling that he had spoiled the Egyptians excellently well , hobbled off to his favorite café .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 36]: Early as the hour was , various cronies were there already , sipping their morning refreshments ; but he passed them with a nod and made for the fat proprietress throned behind a high desk .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 42]: When she caught sight of him , a certain air of firmness seemed to struggle with sympathy for possession of her bulging features , and she hastily thumbed a small account book taken from beneath a pile of waiter 's dockets .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 7]: `` How much , madame ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 10]: asked Felix , who had missed none of this .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 9]: `` Twenty-seven seventy-five , '' she said severely .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 12]: `` Can one make it thirty , _ mignonne _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 3]: `` Thirty !
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 20]: Tell me , then , how market bills are to be met when one is owed these thirties ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 16]: `` Dear angel , Providence has decided that you shall deal with such problems . ''
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 16]: `` Well , well , no more , not a centime beyond the thirty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 8]: `` Monstrous , yet all heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 3]: murmured Felix .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 22]: He struck an attitude , and sang with exquisite feeling the opening bars of the Jewel Song from `` Faust . ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 21]: As applied to the earthly tabernacle of madame 's generous soul , the effect of that impassioned address was ludicrous .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 7]: But Felix recked little of that .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 9]: He threw the hundred-franc note on the counter .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 18]: `` There , _ ma petite _ , be rewarded for your trust , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 34]: `` Now give me the railway timetable ; for I have far to go ere I return , when you and I shall crack a bottle of Clos Vosgeot with our dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 30]: Madame , who had not betrayed the least embarrassment when she and her café were apostrophized in Gounod 's impassioned strains , was utterly bewildered by Poluski 's wealth .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 32]: Not once in many years had he owned so much at one time , since he always drew small sums on account of his pictures and kept himself going hand-to-mouth fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 26]: But here was Felix intent on the timetable and sweeping seventy-two francs twenty-five centimes of change into his pocket without troubling to count a coin .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 12]: `` You have found a mad Englishman , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 3]: tittered madame .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 23]: `` Better , far better , _ ma chérie _ ; I have met a man who would be a King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 18]: He hurried out , climbed into a passing omnibus , and descended at the Gare de Lyon .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 46]: Joan was just leaving the pretty hotel at Barbizon , meaning to put in some hours of work after a distracted morning , when Felix emerged from the interior of a ramshackle cab that had carried him from Melun to the edge of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 29]: Now , a cab drive of several miles , plus a journey from Paris , was a sufficiently rare event in Poluski 's life to make Joan stare .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 15]: His unexpected appearance chimed so oddly with her own disturbed thoughts that she paled .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 15]: `` Felix , '' she cried , `` have you brought ill news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 10]: `` Of whom , _ chère mademoiselle _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 8]: `` Of -- of any one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 13]: `` Alec still reigns , if that is what you mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 8]: `` But he has sent you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 11]: `` What , do I look like an envoy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 3]: He laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 17]: `` Well , well , _ ma belle _ , there is some truth in that .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 18]: I come in behalf of one before whom even Kings must bow ; I represent Saint Peter !
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 8]: But even an apostolic dynamitard must eat .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 14]: I am starving , having sacrificed my luncheon to my love of you .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 24]: Commend me , then , to some deft handed waiter , and let hunger and curiosity be sated at the same time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 14]: Joan knew that Poluski would choose his own way of explaining his presence .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 28]: The hour for luncheon was long past ; but she hurried to the empty dining room and was able to secure some soup and a cold chicken .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 6]: Felix eyed the bird distrustfully .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 32]: `` Although I am here in behalf of Saint Peter , there is no sense in asking me to chew the wretched fowl that proclaimed his downfall , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 15]: `` Oh , Felix dear , please do tell me what has happened ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 10]: said Joan , clasping her hands in real distress .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 10]: `` I received a letter from Alec this morning .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 28]: It was sent to me from my lodgings , and , what between that and the extraordinary things in the newspapers , I think I am bewitched .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 12]: Now I am sure that you too have heard from him .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 6]: Is it a telegram ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 41]: `` Yes , '' he said , `` a message sent without wires ; it came by one of those underground currents that convulse an unconscious world , sometimes agonizing mountains , at others perplexing a simple maid like yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 15]: You see , Joan , all things conspire to draw you to Delgratz . ''
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 7]: `` I am not going ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 44]: she vowed , thereby giving Poluski the exact information he needed ; for his nimble brain was beginning to see the connection between Alec 's letter and Count Julius Marulitch 's intense desire to avail himself of Joan 's skill as a copyist .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 23]: `` You are , my dear , '' he said , dropping his bantering tone and looking her straight in the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 11]: `` How can such an absurdity be dreamed of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 4]: she demanded breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 11]: `` Because it is a dream that will come true .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 29]: Listen , now , and do n't be afraid , for these gray old trees of Barbizon have heard madder whisperings than that you should become a Queen .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 40]: It is in the natural order of things that I , who gave my best years to devising the ruin of Kings , should be chosen in my dotage to help in fixing a King firmly on his throne .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 44]: It is some sport of the gods , I suppose , a superhuman jest , perhaps the touch of farce that makes tragedy more vivid , since even that colossal Shakespeare of yours thought fit to lighten Hamlet by introducing a comic gravedigger .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 32]: Be that as it may , Joan , you are Alec 's Queen , and , as he can not come for you it follows that you must go to him .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 6]: Shall I tell you why ?
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 6]: You are necessary to him .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 12]: It is decreed , and you can not shirk your lot .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 13]: He knows it , and he has written to bid you come .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 41]: His enemies know it ; but there is a kind of knowledge that leads its votaries blindfold to the pit , and Alec 's enemies are blindly plotting now to send you to Delgratz and thus compass his ruin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 3]: `` Felix !
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 6]: What are you saying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 8]: `` The truth , the simple truth .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 13]: Not a whiff of metaphor or extravagance about that statement , Joan .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 11]: This morning a man came to me in the Louvre .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 5]: He was seeking you .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 23]: He wants to pay you five thousand francs for a copy of some blazoned daub that hangs in the cathedral at Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 19]: He will pay double , four times , the money if only you will consent to go there .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 39]: Because he believes that Alec is infatuated about you , and that the mere hint of marriage with one who is not a Slav princess will shatter the throne of Kosnovia about the ears of its present occupant .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 9]: My anxious visitor is mistaken , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 32]: He is trying to do good that evil may come of it ; but while there is justice in Heaven any such perversion of an eternal principle is foredoomed to failure .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 37]: `` But just think of that man coming to me , Felix Poluski , who has an ear for every sob that rises from the unhappy people who dwell in the borderland between Teuton and Tartar !
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 8]: Is n't that the cream of comedy ?
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 50]: When I make everything clear to you , when I show you how and by whom the killing of Theodore and his wife was engineered , you will begin to understand the fantastic trick that Fate played when she sent her emissary to the hunchback artist in the Louvre .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 37]: But it is a long story , and it will beguile the journey across Austria , while there are many things you must attend to ere you leave Paris in the Orient Express to-morrow night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 8]: `` Felix , it is impossible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 9]: Then you do n't love our Alec . ''
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 27]: `` I -- I have not heard a word from his lips -- well , hardly a syllable -- '' `` Not in the letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 5]: `` That is different .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 7]: Felix , I can trust you .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 18]: Perhaps , under other conditions , I might marry Alec ; but now I can not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 8]: `` Because he is a King . ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 14]: `` The best of reasons , if he was bred in a palace .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 12]: But he has lived long enough to become a man first .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 19]: Frankly , Joan , I like Alec , and I think he ought to be given a chance .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 16]: At any rate , I do n't see why you are afraid of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 5]: `` I am not .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 7]: Indeed , I am not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 6]: Joan 's voice was tremulous .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 31]: She was on the verge of tears ; for the little Pole 's persistence was breaking down the barrier that she had striven to erect against her lover 's pleading .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 20]: Alec had not said much in his letter ; but what he did say was wholly to the point .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 11]: `` Come to me , Joan , '' he wrote .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 5]: `` Do n't wait .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 22]: Do n't stop and worry about what the world will say , since it will surely be something bitter and untrue .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 52]: The people here are all right , and I think they are beginning to like me ; but I can see quite plainly that they will not be content until I am married , and hints are being thrown out already that there are several eligible young ladies in neighboring States .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 26]: But if these Kosnovians take me they must take you too , and it will be far easier for me when they have seen you .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 16]: `` Now , no hesitation , no doubts , no weighing of pros and cons .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 33]: Just set your teeth and toss your head up , and tell Pauline to sling your belongings into your boxes , and before you start send me one word in a telegram .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 40]: I am horribly busy , of course -LRB- for details see daily papers -RRB- , and this must be the most extraordinary love letter ever written ; but what does that matter when you and I understand each other ?
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 8]: It was you who sent me here .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 37]: Do n't forget that , dear teller of fortunes , and I want you to be standing by my side when the storm breaks that must surely be brewing for me after an incredible success . ''
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 8]: There was more in the same vein .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 29]: Alexis the King seemed to differ in no essential from the Alec Delgrado who used to wait for her every day in the neighborhood of the Pont Neuf .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 5]: Dare she risk it ?
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 11]: The question had tortured her ever since the early morning .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 36]: It was not that the prospect of being a Queen was dazzling or even dismaying in itself ; she really dreaded the result of such a marriage on the fortunes of the man she loved .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 22]: But against that self sacrificing attitude she was forced to admit the plea of Alec 's own bewildering lack of conventionality .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 21]: If half the stories in the newspapers were true , he was the most original minded monarch that ever reigned .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 38]: She was quite sure that his answer to any evasive reply on her part would be a public announcement of the fact that his promised bride was a young lady in Paris , Joan Vernon by name .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 16]: And that would be worse almost than going quietly to Delgratz and being married there .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 6]: What was she to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 12]: She found Felix Poluski 's gray eyes looking at her steadfastly .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 19]: In this dilemma he was her only trusted counselor , and he had already advised her to yield .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 12]: `` If I even knew his relatives , '' she faltered .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 7]: `` His parents live in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 5]: We have never met .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 17]: How can I say to his mother , ` Your son wants me to marry him .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 8]: What do you think of me ? '
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 12]: She , a Princess , would scoff at the idea . ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 24]: `` Alec is well aware of that ; hence he has written direct to you , and said nothing to any other person .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 23]: Let me assure you that if Prince Michael Delgrado had gone to Delgratz he would have died a sudden and violent death .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 10]: Prince Michael knew it , and declined the distinction .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 23]: Believe me , too , Alec has the very best of reasons for consulting no one in his choice of a wife .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 7]: Now , Joan , be brave !
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 46]: When all is said and done , it should be far more pleasant to marry a King than fling a bomb at him , and I have met several young ladies almost as pretty as you who were ready enough to adopt the latter alternative .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 13]: At any rate you will take no harm by crossing the Danube .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 23]: It is not the Rubicon , you know , and you have Saint Peter to lean on in case of difficulty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 52]: So Felix did not return to Paris alone , and when he met Count Julius Marulitch next morning in the Louvre he was able to announce that Miss Joan Vernon had accepted the commission to copy the Delgratz Saint Peter and was ready to start for Kosnovia by the night mail .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 13]: CHAPTER VI JOAN GOES INTO SOCIETY Joan did not telegraph to Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 17]: She destroyed each of half a dozen attempts , and ended by taking refuge in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 18]: It was impossible to say what she had to say in the bald language of a telegram .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 45]: Merely to announce her departure from Paris would put her in the false position of having accepted Alec 's proposal apparently without reserve , which was exactly what she meant not to do , and any other explanation of the journey would bewilder him .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 30]: Her friend Léontine , housemaid at the Chope de la Sorbonne , did not fail to tell her of Alec 's call the day she left Paris for Barbizon .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 15]: There was no mistaking Léontine 's description , which was impressionist to a degree .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 26]: It was evident , then , that he not only possessed her address , as shown by the letter , but knew of her absence .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 25]: So she reasoned that if he did not hear from her within forty-eight hours he would assume that she was still away from home .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 30]: By that time she would be in Delgratz , and , although she felt some uneasiness at the prospect , she was brave enough not to shirk meeting him .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 46]: They were not children that they should be afraid of speaking their thoughts , nor lovesick romanticists , apt to be swayed wholly by sentiment , and she could trust Alec to see the folly of rushing into a union that might imperil his career .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 35]: In the depths of her heart she confessed herself proud and happy at the prospect of becoming his wife ; but she would never consent to a marriage that was not commended by prudence .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 26]: Better , far better , they should part forever than that the lapse of a few months should prove how irretrievably she had ruined him .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 38]: This might be sound commonsense , but it was not love , yet all this , and more , Joan said to Felix Poluski , and the little man had nodded his head with grins of approval .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 8]: Meanwhile , he sang and was busy .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 27]: Count Julius , posted now in the Pole 's mottled history , had demanded absolute anonymity before he carried the negotiations for the picture any further .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 21]: Felix gave the pledge readily , since Joan could not be in Delgratz a day ere she suspected the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 28]: At any rate , Marulitch was satisfied ; he introduced Felix to a well-known dealer in the Rue St. Honoré , and thenceforth disappeared from the transaction .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 18]: Joan herself entered into the necessary business arrangements , about which there was nothing hidden or contraband .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 21]: The terms proposed were liberal , considering her poor status in the art world ; but they were quite straightforward .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 59]: She was given return tickets to Delgratz for herself and her maid ; Felix was similarly provided for ; five hundred dollars was paid in advance , and a written guaranty was handed to her that a similar sum , together with hotel expenses , would be forthcoming in exchange for a copy of the Byzantine Saint Peter .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 24]: Of course , reviewing matters calmly in the train , she hardly expected that the second portion of the contract would be fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 39]: She knew quite well that the conspirators hoped to turn her presence in the Kosnovian capital to their own account , and when their scheme was balked they would devise some means of wriggling out of the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 25]: But she laughed at the notion that she , an unknown student , should have suddenly become a pawn in the game of empire .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 18]: There was an element of daring , almost of peril , in the adventure that fascinated her .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 40]: It savored of those outlandish incidents recorded in novels of a sensational type , wherein fur coated , sallow faced , cigarette smoking scoundrels plotted the destruction of dynasties , and used fair maidens as decoys for susceptible Kings .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 57]: Certainly , Felix Poluski , judged by his past , was no bad prototype of a character in that class of fiction ; regarded in his present guise , as he sat opposite her in the dining car of the Orient Express , he looked the most harmless desperado that ever preyed on a quivering world .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 12]: His face seemed to be smaller and more wrinkled than usual .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 62]: From Joan 's superior height his hump was accentuated till it showed above the top of his head , and the girl was conscious , though she resolutely closed her eyes to the fact , that the admiring glances with which she was favored by some of her fellow passengers were somewhat modified by the humorous incongruity of Poluski 's appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 13]: At first , they tacitly avoided any reference to Alec or Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 26]: Their talk dealt with art and artists , and Joan had a good deal to say about the delights of painting in the open air .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 6]: Felix blinked at her sagely .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 12]: `` Behold , then , the beginning of the end ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 3]: he cackled .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 7]: `` The end of what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 24]: she asked , with some kindling of suspicion , since her queer little friend 's tricks of conversation were not new to her .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 8]: `` Of your career as an artist .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 7]: Barbizon is fatal to true emotion .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 29]: It induces a fine sense of the beauty of sunsets , of diffused light in sylvan solitudes , of blues that are greens and browns that are reds .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 21]: In a word , the study of nature inclines one toward truth , whereas art is essentially a gracious lie .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 17]: That is why the Greeks were the greatest artists : because they were most pleasing liars .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 7]: They understood the crassness of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 59]: Long before Browning wrote _ Fra Lippo Lippi _ they realized that `` We 're made so that we love First when we see them painted , things we have passed Perhaps a hundred times , nor cared to see ; And so they are better painted -- better to us , Which is the same thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 20]: Joan laughed , and the cheery sound of her mirth seemed to startle the staid folk in the car .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 45]: At a neighboring table a middle aged couple were dining , the woman dignified and matronly , the man small , slight , with a curiously bloated aspect which , on analysis , seemed to arise from puffy cheeks and thick , sensual lips .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 42]: He said something that caused his companion to turn and look at Joan ; for the woman is yet unborn who will hear another woman described as pretty and not want to decide for herself how far the statement is justified .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 40]: So the eyes of the two met , and Joan saw a worn , kindly face , endowed with a quiet charm of expression and delicacy of contour that offered a marked contrast to the man 's unprepossessing features .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 65]: Both women were too well bred to stare , and Joan instantly brought her wits to bear on Poluski 's quip ; but that fleeting glimpse had thrilled her with subtle recognition of something grasped yet elusive , of a knowledge that trembled on the lip of discovery , like a half remembered word murmuring in the brain but unable to make itself heard .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 13]: `` Do you ever say what you really mean , Felix ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 8]: `` Far too often , my belle .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 9]: That is why I am only a copyist .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 20]: `` I am a painter who can not paint ; In my life , a devil rather than saint .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 16]: `` Believe me , we artists err ridiculously when we depart from the Greek standard .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 21]: Your Whistler never achieved fame until he stopped reproducing bits of nature and devoted his superb talent to caricature . ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 3]: `` Caricature !
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 3]: Whistler ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 3]: she repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 9]: `` Name of a good little gray man !
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 3]: what else ?
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 5]: Not portraits , surely ?
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 27]: Wise that he was , he left those to the snapshot photographer ; for even the camera can be given the artistic kink by the toucher-up .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 22]: Have you forgotten , then , the rage of a stolid Englishman when he saw his wife as Whistler painted her ?
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 16]: Oh , yes , art lies outrageously and lives long , like other fables . ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 17]: `` But Whistler might have been bluntly accurate , a thing that is not always pleasing .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 39]: For instance , '' and here her voice sank a little , `` it might not be altogether gratifying to my pride if some one was to analyze mercilessly the precise reasons of my present journey . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 3]: _ Tiens !
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 6]: _ Let us do it .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 9]: It will serve to pass the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 5]: She laughed and blushed .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 5]: `` Wait a little .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 8]: We have many hours before us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 23]: `` You will never have a more appreciative audience , if only you could make your voice heard above this din . ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 7]: `` What are you driving at ?
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 5]: Please tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 12]: `` You have seen the two people sitting over there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 15]: and he twisted eyebrows and mouth awry , with a whimsical leer of caution .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 8]: `` Yes ; what of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 7]: `` Do you know them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 7]: `` Not even the lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 14]: `` She reminds me of some one -- why do you ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 9]: `` I am surprised at you , Joan .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 9]: Those charming eyes of yours should be keener .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 19]: True , there is nothing feminine about Alec , and he has not suffered , like his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 8]: Still , there is a resemblance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 9]: `` Felix , are you in earnest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 3]: `` Absolutely .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 11]: I , at least , have not the Greek temperament .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 15]: Our friends across the gangway are none other than Prince and Princess Michael Delgrado .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 30]: You will discover no prophecy of Alec in his father ; but he is his mother 's own son , despite her weak chin and air of resignation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 14]: Joan was dismayed , utterly astonished ; the color ebbed from her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 8]: `` Are they going to Delgratz ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 4]: she almost whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 5]: `` I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 16]: It is one of the oddest things about our lives how they run in grooves .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 16]: Just now all the tiny furrows of our separate existences are converging on the Danube .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 23]: We are like ships foredoomed to collision , that hurry remorselessly from the ends of the earth to the preordained crash . ''
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 18]: `` Oh , Felix , if you knew of this why did you bring me here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 11]: `` Who am I to resist when the gods beckon ?
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 38]: I love you , Joan , and I hate Kings ; but it is decreed that you shall be a Queen , so I fold my arms and bow my head like the meekest of mortals . ''
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 13]: `` I shall quit the train at the next stopping place . ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 4]: `` But why ?
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 23]: If Alec and you are to wed , it is only fit and proper that his parents should grace the ceremony . ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 12]: `` You harp on marriage when there may be no marriage .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 36]: If Alec was not a King , it might be different ; but the world will scoff when it hears that his chosen bride came to him from lodgings in the Place de la Sorbonne .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 24]: What will Princess Delgrado think , now that she has seen me here , rushing off to Delgratz the instant I was summoned ?
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 8]: Felix , I must return to Paris .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 38]: Happily , I have some two thousand francs due within a week , and I can then refund the cost of our tickets , and perhaps the railway people will allow something for the incompleted journey . ''
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 8]: `` Calm yourself , _ ma petite !
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 11]: _ You count like the proprietress of my favorite café !
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 5]: And to what purpose ?
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 12]: It would be a pity to act in that foolish way .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 21]: There is no compulsion on you to marry Alec , and the Byzantine Saint Peter still hangs in the cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 25]: Let any one so much as hint that you are throwing yourself at Alec 's head , and I shall have the hinter dynamited .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 41]: No , no , my Joan , we may yield to higher powers ; but we do not abandon our pilgrimage because it is shared by an old scamp of a father whose sole anxiety is to fleece his son .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 23]: Come , now , finish your dinner in peace , and let me explain to you why it is that Alexis III .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 8]: and not Michael V. reigns in Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 11]: You do n't glean many facts about monarchs from newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 37]: If I brought you to a certain wineshop in the Rue Taitbout any evening after dinner you would hear more truth about royalty in half an hour than you will read in half a year . ''
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 30]: Joan , conscious of a telltale pallor , was leaning forward with an elbow on the table and shielding her face with widespread fingers propped against cheek and forehead .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 67]: In the noise and flurry of the train it was easy to tune the voice to such a note that it must be inaudible to those at the adjacent tables ; but Poluski seemed to be careless whether or not he was overheard , and the girl fancied that Princess Delgrado had caught the words `` Alexis , '' `` Michael , '' `` Delgratz . ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 27]: Certainly the Princess turned again and looked at her , while she did not fail to glance swiftly at the misshapen figure visible only in profile .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 11]: `` Not so loud , Felix , '' murmured Joan .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 12]: `` Come to my compartment when you have smoked a cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 25]: By that time I shall have recovered my wits , and I may be able to decide what to do for the best . ''
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 5]: `` Wrong again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 3]: he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 14]: `` Obey your heart , not your brain , _ mignonne _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 17]: -LRB- He bent nearer , and his extraordinarily bright gray eyes peered up into hers . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 9]: `` That is how Alec won his throne .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 5]: He is all heart .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 11]: Those who paved the way for him were all brain .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 22]: They plotted , and contrived , and spun their web with the murderous zeal of a spider ; but , poof !
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 11]: in buzzes bluebottle Alec , and where are the schemers ?
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 25]: Ah , my angel , if you knew everything you would be cheery as I and marry your King with a light conscience . ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 20]: The two persons who were the unwitting cause of Joan 's sudden misgivings rose and quitted the dining car .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 10]: No one seemed to be aware of their identity .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 50]: Even the brown-liveried attendants did not give them any more attention than was bestowed on the other passengers , and the girl realized that the parents of a King , even such a newly fledged King as Alec , did not usually travel with this pronounced lack of state .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 13]: `` Are you quite sure they are the Prince and Princess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 20]: she asked , scanning Poluski 's wrinkled face to learn if he had not been playing some sorry jest .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 8]: `` Quite sure , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 17]: `` But -- '' `` You wonder why they condescend to mix with the common horde ?
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 25]: Learn then , my Joan , that a French booking clerk is a skeptic who can be convinced only by the sight of money .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 52]: Consider the number of brokendown royalties in Paris , and picture , if you can , the scowl of disbelief that would cloud the official features of the Gare de l'Est if Prince Michael asked for a special train to Delgratz ; booked it on the nod , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 20]: It could not be done , Joan , not if one substituted ` Archangel ' for ` Prince . '
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 21]: As it is , the senior Delgrado has probably touched a friend for the money to buy the tickets . ''
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 9]: `` Yet their names would be recognized . ''
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 5]: Felix called an attendant .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 19]: `` The lady and gentleman who sat at the opposite table were the Count and Countess Polina ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 8]: `` I can not say , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 5]: Shall I inquire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 7]: `` No need , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 31]: To be precise , since you demand it , '' went on Poluski when the man had gone , `` I asked who they were the moment we left Paris .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 20]: I saw them on the platform , and the absence of any display showed that they were traveling incognito .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 11]: I doubt very much if Alec knows of their journey .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 9]: Can you guess why I think that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 6]: Joan shook her head wearily .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 14]: `` I am living in a land of dreams , '' she sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 13]: `` I do not understand the why or wherefore of anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 20]: `` Listen , then , and you will see that your dreamland is a prosaic place , after all .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 26]: There is a man in Paris who receives letters daily from Kosnovia , and they tell of events that are not printed for the multitude .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 22]: Last night , when I was certain we should go to Delgratz , I sought him and heard the latest news .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 6]: Your Alec means to economize .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 48]: He has promulgated the absurd theory that the people 's taxes should be spent for the people 's benefit , and he says that no King is worth more than five thousand pounds a year , while many of his contemporaries would be dear at the price .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 27]: He has also set up this ridiculous maximum as a standard , and intends to reduce the official salary list to about half its present dimensions .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 28]: `` This fantasy has reached his father 's ears , and the old gentleman is hurrying to Delgratz to check the madness ere it is too late .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 45]: It is a simple bit of arithmetic : if a King , who works like a horse , is to receive only five thousand a year , what is the annual value of his father , who does nothing but lounge about the boulevards ?
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 13]: No wonder old Michael is off hotfoot to the White City ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 18]: Despite her perplexities , Joan had to laugh , and Felix bent nearer to clinch his argument .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 12]: `` You and I must stand by Alec , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 8]: I too am breathing a new atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 22]: I fought against Kings because they were tyrants ; but I am ready to fight for one who is a deliverer .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 7]: What do you fear , you ?
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 3]: The world ?
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 15]: Has the world ever done anything for you that its opinion should be considered ?
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 20]: It will fawn or snarl as it thinks best fitted to its own ends ; but help or pity ?
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 2]: Never !
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 18]: Its votaries in Delgratz will strive to rend Alec when they realize that their interests are threatened .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 34]: We must be there , you and I , you to aid him in winning the fickle mob , and I to watch those secret burrowings more dangerous to thrones than open revolt .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 9]: It is a sacred mission , my Joan !
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 10]: They who named you were wiser than they knew .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 34]: You were christened a King 's helpmate , while I , Felix Poluski , am fated to be the most amazing product of modern civilization , -- an anarchist devoted to a monarchy .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 11]: `` It came on me yesterday morning in the Louvre .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 11]: I saw my principles crucified for the good of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 27]: Through the eyes of the Virgin I looked into a heaven of achievement , and I care not what the means so long as good results .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 24]: One honest King is worth a million revolutionaries , and God , who made Alec a King , also made him honest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 38]: Excited , exuberant , bubbling over with that very emotionalism at which he had scoffed a few minutes earlier , Felix leaned back in his chair and sang a quatrain in his singularly sweet and penetrating tenor .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 10]: Instantly every head was turned and necks were craned .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 23]: A waiter , serving coffee , was so electrified that he poured no small quantity into the lap of an indignant German .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 36]: Joan , too wrathful for mere words , dared not rush away instantly to her compartment , though she would have given a good deal at that moment to be safe in its kindly obscurity .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 22]: And the worst thing was that she saw the coffeepot incident , and was forced to laugh till the tears came .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 6]: Cries of `` Bravo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 4]: `` Again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 26]: mingled with the iron-clamped syllables of Teutonic protest , and she distinctly heard a well bred English voice say : `` Foreign music hall artists !
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 12]: I told you so , though the girl looks an American .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 5]: But , by gad !
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 8]: ca n't that humpbacked johnny sing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 8]: `` Felix , how could you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 7]: she managed to gasp at last .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 5]: `` I 'm sorry .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 8]: I forgot we were not in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 10]: But there are some here who appreciate good music .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 19]: If you do n't mind , I 'll give them Béranger 's ` Adieu to Mary Stuart . '
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 18]: You remember , it goes this way -- '' Joan fled , making play with her handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 26]: The fast speeding train threw her from side to side of the corridor during a hurried transit ; but the exquisite lines followed her clearly .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 11]: Felix sang like a robin till the mood exhausted itself .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 13]: Then , deaf to enthusiastic plaudits and cries for `` More ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 10]: he lit a long thin cigar and smoked furiously .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 9]: Passing Joan 's berth later , he knocked .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 6]: `` Who is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 8]: `` I , the Humming Bee . ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 7]: `` Leave me to-night , Felix .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 5]: I must think . ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 4]: `` Better sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 4]: Thinking creates wrinkles .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 9]: Look on me as a horrible example . ''
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 36]: He went away , bassooning some lively melody , but grinning the while , and if his thoughts took shape they would run : `` The struggle has ended ere it began , sweet maid .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 16]: You are in love ; but have not yet waked up to that astonishing fact .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 21]: Now , why did the good God give me a big heart and a small head and a twisted spine ?
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 13]: Why not have made me either a man or an imp ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 15]: Joan could not face strangers in the dining car after Poluski 's strange outburst .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 36]: She remained in her own cramped quarters all next day , ate some meals there as best she could , and kept Felix at arm 's length so far as confidence or counsel was concerned .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 19]: On the platform at Vienna , where the train was made up afresh , she encountered Princess Delgrado .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 11]: To her consternation , the older woman stopped and spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 52]: `` I am sorry I missed the delightful little concert your friend provided in the dining car last night , '' she said in French , and her voice had that touch of condescension with which a society leader knows how to dilute her friendliness when addressing a singer or musician .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 16]: `` My husband and I retired early , to our great loss , I hear .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 6]: Are you traveling beyond Vienna ?
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 28]: If so , and you give us another musical this evening -- '' `` There is some mistake , '' faltered Joan , unconsciously answering in English .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 16]: `` People who do not know Monsieur Poluski often take him for an operatic artiste .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 5]: He is a painter .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 22]: He sings only to amuse himself , and seldom waits to consider whether the time and place are well chosen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 7]: `` But , gracious me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 17]: cried the Princess , amazed to find that Joan spoke English as to the manner born .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 8]: `` Some one said you were Polish .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 22]: I doubted my eyes when I looked at you ; but your companion -- well , he might be anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 16]: `` Both he and I earn our bread by painting pictures , '' said Joan .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 16]: `` Indeed , we are now bound for Delgratz to carry out a commission . ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 3]: `` Delgratz !
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 3]: How extraordinary !
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 6]: I too am going there .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 23]: It is so disturbed at present that it is the last place in the world I should have suspected of artistic longings .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 10]: May I ask who has sent for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 32]: Luckily , in the bustle and semiobscurity of the station , Princess Delgrado did not pay much heed to the furious blushing of the pretty girl who had aroused her interest .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 56]: It was impossible to regard one whom she now believed to be an American like herself as being in any way concerned with the intrigues that centered in the capital of Kosnovia , and she attributed Joan 's confusion to the pardonable error that arose from the talk Prince Michael brought from the smoking car .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 7]: But what was Joan to answer ?
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 22]: She could not blurt out to Alec 's mother the contents of that exceedingly plainspoken epistle now reposing in her pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 47]: For one mad instant she wondered what would happen if she said : `` I am being sent to Delgratz by people who wish to drive Alec out of the kingdom , and I am really considering whether or not I ought to marry him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 36]: Then she lifted her head valiantly , with just that wood-nymph flinging back of rebellious hair that Alec was thinking of while riding to his Castle of Care after a long day in the saddle .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 18]: `` There is nothing unusual in my being chosen to copy a picture , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 8]: `` Art connoisseurs care little for politics .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 29]: To them a new Giotto is vastly more important than a new King , and I am told that both are to be found in Delgratz nowadays . ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 5]: Prince Michael strolled up .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 26]: He was pleased that his wife had made the acquaintance of the charming unknown , whom he had looked for in vain during the day .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 41]: `` Ah , '' he said , with polite hat flourish , `` I feared we had lost the pleasant company of which I heard -- '' `` You were misinformed , '' broke in his wife hastily in English .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 11]: `` This young lady is visiting Delgratz for art purposes .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 24]: The gentleman who sang last night is the celebrated painter , Monsieur -- Monsieur -- '' `` Felix Poluski , '' said Joan .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 16]: Prince Michael started as though a scorpion had found a crack in his patent boots .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 7]: `` Poluski -- Felix Poluski ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 23]: `` I know that name ; but he was fond of using strange colors on his palette if I remember rightly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 22]: Felix , owing to his small stature , was compelled to dodge among the crowd on the platform like a child .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 15]: He appeared now unexpectedly , and Michael 's exclamation was not lost on him .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 6]: `` Excellent , Monseigneur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 9]: `` You always had a turn for epigram .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 40]: I am glad to find that you have not forgotten the brave days of old when you and I used to spout treason together , you because you hungered after a dynasty , and I because I preferred dynamite .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 22]: Odd thing , both words mean power , strength , sovereignty ; the difference lies only in the method of application .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 15]: But that was in our hot youth , Michael -- '' `` Imbecile ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 27]: hissed the Prince , his red face blanching , as once before when a man spoke of the perils that hedge a throne in the Balkans .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 5]: `` This is Vienna .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 6]: I shall be recognized ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 5]: Felix snapped his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 14]: `` They do n't care that for you , Monseigneur -- never did !
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 16]: You could have come and gone as you pleased any time during these thirty years .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 21]: If any one is feared here , it is I. But , my veteran , why this display of wrath ?
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 6]: You know me well enough .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 9]: Did n't you see me last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 11]: `` No -- that is , I did not recollect .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 6]: Your face was hidden . ''
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 11]: `` Ah , you had something better to look at .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 7]: Well , who goes to Delgratz ?
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 6]: Get aboard , all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 44]: During this brief but illuminating conversation the Princess and Joan could do nothing else but gaze from one man to the other in mute surprise , and Joan was grieved beyond measure that Felix should treat Alec 's father with such scant courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 32]: Even while they were making for the steps of the sleeping cars , she managed to whisper tremulously to the Princess : `` Please do n't be angry with Monsieur Poluski .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 9]: His brusk manner often gets him into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 43]: Forgive me for saying it , but your son knows him well , and is very fond of him , and I am sure Felix would do anything that lay in his power to help -- to help King Alexis III . ''
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 4]: `` My son !
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 7]: Do you also know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 9]: `` Have you met him in Paris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 13]: `` But I have never seen you at the Rue Boissière . ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 13]: We met at Rudin 's , and sometimes in the Louvre . ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 13]: `` And does he know that you are coming to Delgratz ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 9]: I assure you -- '' The Princess hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 19]: It was not in her kind heart to think evil of this singularly frank looking and attractive girl .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 9]: `` Will you tell me your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 20]: she said , turning with one foot on the step ; for they were about to enter separate carriages .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 5]: `` Joan Vernon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 16]: `` I suppose it is idle to ask , but you are not married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 14]: `` No , nor likely to be for a very long time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 4]: `` Aboard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 19]: cried a guard , marveling that women could find so much to say at the very last moment .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 17]: `` Well , '' said the Princess , `` I hope to see you at dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 7]: If not , in Delgratz . ''
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 19]: Joan took good care that no one except her maid and an attendant saw her again that evening .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 18]: She felt bruised and buffeted as though she had been carried among rocks by some irresistible current .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 7]: Even her mind refused to act .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 15]: The why and the wherefore of events were dim and not to be grasped .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 16]: Over and over again she regretted the impulse that led her to take this journey .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 57]: Felix , as friend and artistic tutor , was invaluable ; but in the guise of mentor for a young woman who had her own way to make in the world , and nothing more to depend on than her artistic faculties and a small income from a trust fund , he was a distinct failure .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 8]: What would Alec think of it all ?
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 23]: And what would Alec 's mother say when her son told her that Joan Vernon was the woman he meant to marry ?
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 27]: So Joan grew miserable , and developed a headache , and wept a little over perplexities that were very real though she could not define them .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 51]: And Felix dined alone , and smoked in dumb reverie , and when Prince Michael , warmed with wine and cheered by the knowledge that a wearisome journey was drawing to a close , unbent so far as to ask him to sing , the little man shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 15]: `` You 'll hear me singing in Delgratz , Monseigneur , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 23]: `` I shall have something to think about then , and I sing to think , just as you live to eat .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 12]: At present , there is n't a note in the box .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 23]: Now , if madame can spare you , just sit down there , and you and I will talk of old times .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 20]: For instance , poor Amélie Constant -- she died the other day -- '' `` Ah , bah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 3]: growled Michael .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 6]: `` That is not interesting .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 13]: Old times of that sort generally mean times one would rather forget .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 9]: _ Au ` voir _ , M'sieur Poluski .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 7]: We shall meet across the Danube .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 13]: If your principles permit , come and see me at court . ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 16]: `` My principles carry me into strange company , Monseigneur , '' said Felix gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 21]: CHAPTER VII JOAN BECOMES THE VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES On arriving at Delgratz , Joan still avoided her distinguished traveling companions .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 59]: Indeed , no one paid any heed to her , since Prince Michael 's vanity could not resist the temptation of making himself known , and when the word went round that the King 's father was in the station , there was such a press around him and the Princess that ordinary passengers were of little account .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 29]: Monseigneur was flattered by the excitement caused by his unexpected appearance , and he momentarily regretted the lack of display that resulted from his decision to travel incognito .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 28]: It would have been so much more effective if he had been greeted by the King and a glittering staff the moment he descended from the train .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 41]: It was undignified , too , to pass through the streets of the capital in a disheveled hired vehicle , when a royal carriage , surrounded by a cavalry escort , might have brought him to the palace in style .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 16]: It was somewhat late in the day , however , to rectify the mistake now .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 28]: He could not hang round the station while a messenger went to his son , and if he meant to effect a surprise he had succeeded admirably .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 37]: Leaving a valet and maid to bring the luggage , which an obsequious customs officer cleared at once , he ushered his wife into a ramshackle victoria and told the man to drive to the Schwarzburg .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 48]: Every Serb is a born gossip ; but a policeman had whispered the names of the eminent pair , and awe kept the driver 's tongue from wagging , else Prince Michael would have received a greater shock than the welcoming bump of a singularly bad pavement .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 38]: Luckily the Black Castle lay no great distance from the railway , since Delgratz was but a small place when the palace was built , and the town had long ago closed around it on every hand .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 19]: During the short drive Michael tried to be cheery , though he had slept little during two nights .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 14]: `` These old streets have really changed very little , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 14]: `` When I was a boy I remember thinking how magnificent they were .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 24]: What an eye opener it must have been for Alec when he realized that he had given up Paris -- for this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 41]: and he waved a deprecating hand toward the unkempt houses , yellow washed and dingy ; for the White City , though white when seen from a distance , turns out to be an unhealthy looking saffron at close quarters .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 11]: The Princess cared nothing for the squalor of the town .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 7]: She was thinking of her son .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 17]: `` I wish we had told Alec we were coming , Michael , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 22]: `` Now that we are here , the reasons you urged for secrecy seem to be less convincing than ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 15]: `` Alec would have telegraphed his prompt advice to remain where we were . ''
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 21]: `` Perhaps -- '' `` Perhaps you will allow me to decide what is best to be done , Marie .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 7]: Our affairs had reached a crisis .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 18]: So long as there was a chance of my becoming King I was able to finance myself .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 33]: Now that Alec is firmly established , and filling empty heads with all this nonsense as to retrenchment and economical administration , every creditor I had in the world is pestering me .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 17]: You can not realize the annoyance to which I have been subjected during the last fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 19]: Life was becoming intolerable , just because Alec was talking galimatias to a number of irresponsible journalists . ''
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 10]: `` Why not write and tell him our troubles ?
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 10]: He would have helped us , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 16]: And that which you call rubbish seems to have caught the ear of all Europe .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 18]: Even ` The Journal des Débats ' published a most eulogistic article about him last week . ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 4]: `` Poof ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 3]: snorted Monseigneur .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 8]: `` Those Paris rags pander to republicanism .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 22]: Every word , every act , of an impetuous youngster like Alec is twisted into an argument against the older monarchies .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 12]: Give an eye to the mean looking building on the right .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 7]: That is the Chamber of Deputies .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 11]: Alec made the speech there that won him a throne .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 6]: Who would have believed it ?
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 11]: Just a few words , and he became King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 15]: Something in Prince Michael 's tone caused his wife to look at him sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 10]: `` You are not growing envious , Michael ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 10]: `` No ; but I was a fool . ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 29]: `` Because I shall keep you to our compact , '' she said , with a firmness of manner that surprised the pompous little man by her side .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 19]: He had been answered in that way so seldom during their married life that the novelty was displeasing .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 5]: `` Ah , bah !
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 6]: what are you saying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 33]: He stifled the next words on his lips ; for the horse passed under an arch , and not even the studied repose of a princely boulevardier could conceal his new amazement .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 17]: An industrial army was busy in and around the famous residence of the Kings of Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 7]: They were tearing it to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 20]: The roof was off , one wing was wholly dismantled , and the beautiful gardens were strewn with débris .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 13]: `` In the name of Providence , what is going on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 6]: demanded Monseigneur of the driver .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 29]: `` It is the King 's order , your Highness , '' said the man , glorying in the fact that the muzzle was off -- by request .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 19]: `` The castle is to be demolished , and a new National Assembly built on the site . ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 14]: `` Our ancient house pulled down and made a sty for those hogs !
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 7]: The King must be mad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 14]: `` We esteem him highly in Delgratz , '' said the man stoutly .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 29]: `` He thinks more of the people than of palaces , and they say that he means to convert some of the gold lace into white bread . ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 31]: The bewildered and infuriated Michael now remembered that the few officers encountered in the railway station or the streets seemed to be far less gaudily attired than in former years .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 35]: In a passing thought he attributed the alteration to the wearing of undress uniform during the early hours ; but the cab driver 's words seemed to hint at some fresh wave of reform .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 30]: His bulging eyes continued to glare at the ruined palace ; but native caution warned him against being too outspoken in the presence of one of the lower order .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 8]: `` When was this work begun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 8]: `` Three days ago , your Highness .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 15]: The King decided that the banqueting hall should be destroyed as quickly as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 7]: He says it taints the air .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 9]: As for the Assembly , it must wait .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 7]: Money is not so plentiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 8]: `` What is it , Michael ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 26]: cried the Princess , aware that something unforeseen had happened ; but unable to grasp its significance , owing to her ignorance of the language .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 13]: Monseigneur , who had stood up in the carriage , subsided again .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 10]: He raised both hands in a gesture of bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 4]: `` Alexis III .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 24]: has signalized the first month of his reign by destroying the historic home of our race -- that is all , madame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 4]: he muttered bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 8]: `` But why are we remaining here ?
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 5]: Where does Alec live ?
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 9]: He must inhabit a house of some sort .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 10]: Tell the man to drive there at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 7]: The Prince affected not to hear .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 13]: `` What could Stampoff be thinking of to permit this outrage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 3]: he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 7]: `` Why was not I consulted ?
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 9]: Idiot that I am , and coward too !
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 8]: I see now the mistake I made .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 5]: Can it be rectified ?
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 6]: Is it too late ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 14]: A second carriage , laden with luggage , drove in through the gateway .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 24]: The valet and a French maid gazed in discreet wonder at their master and mistress seated disconsolately in front of a tumbledown building .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 13]: `` Michael , I insist that you give the driver directions ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 5]: cried his wife vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 7]: `` We can not remain here .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 16]: The least shred of commonsense should warn you that we are making ourselves ridiculous . ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 14]: `` Ah , yes , one must act , '' agreed the Prince .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 12]: He glanced up at the enthusiastic supporter of the new régime .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 41]: `` We have traveled here from Paris , and his Majesty 's recent letters have missed us , '' he said , with a perceptible return of the grand air that had served him in good stead for many years .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 10]: `` Take us to his Majesty 's present residence .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 5]: The error is mine .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 12]: I should have told you that in the first instance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 13]: `` The King is living in the President 's house , Excellency .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 16]: It is not far ; but you will not find his Majesty there this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 16]: At four o'clock he rode to Grotzka with the mad Englishman -- '' `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 7]: and who may that be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 37]: `` An English milord , who laughs always , even when his Majesty and he are trying to break their necks at a game they play on horseback , hitting a white ball with long sticks .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 5]: I have seen them .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 16]: They make the young officers play it , and there are three in hospital already .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 11]: This is hot weather for such an infernal amusement ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 4]: Prince Michael nodded .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 54]: Like every other person watching affairs on the Danube , he had read of Lord Adalbert Beaumanoir 's adventure with the Austrian authorities , -- indeed , Europe had almost expected a declaration of war over the incident , -- but he did not know that Beaumanoir was still an inhabitant of Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 7]: `` To Monsieur Nesimir 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 33]: he said sullenly , and left it to the Princess to give instructions to the servants to follow , though the poor woman did not yet know whither she was being taken .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 23]: She was very angry with her husband , and she blamed herself for not having telegraphed to her son before leaving Paris .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 65]: But she had yielded to Michael Delgrado during so many years that it was difficult to abandon the habit now ; yet she promised herself a full explanation with Alec when they met , and that must be soon , since here she was in Delgratz , where , judging by the newspapers , the King was in evidence every hour of the day .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 26]: The President 's house was distant only a stone 's throw , and , though obviously mystified , stout Nesimir met his unexpected guests cordially .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 16]: He was disconsolate because of the King 's probable absence till late in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 17]: `` What a pity his Majesty chose to-day for a visit to the artillery camp ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 14]: `` But I shall send a courier ; he can return by noon .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 13]: How is it nothing was said as to your Highnesses ' visit .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 22]: I dined with the King last night -- '' `` We wished to surprise his Majesty , '' explained Prince Michael .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 30]: `` You know how outspoken he is , and how easily these things get into the newspaper ; so we started from Paris without a word to a soul .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 9]: Send no courier after him , I beg .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 16]: A rest of a few hours will be most acceptable to the Princess and myself .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 45]: Madame is fatigued after a long journey , while I would ask nothing better than an armchair , a cup of coffee , a cigarette , and a chat ; that is , if you can spare the time , Monsieur le Président . ''
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 14]: Nesimir would be charmed to comply with Monseigneur 's desires in every respect .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 32]: Really , the elder Delgrado seemed to be even more approachable than his son ; for the President was unable to fathom many of the social views propounded by Alexis III .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 16]: This unheralded advent of the King 's parents , too , betokened some secret move .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 41]: He was sure of that , and , being a man to whom political intrigue was the breath of life , he saw that a gossip with Prince Michael might convey information of much possible value in the near future .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 28]: So the Princess Delgrado was ushered to a room by Madame Nesimir with all possible ceremony , and the two men established themselves on a cool veranda .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 15]: By this time , Joan and Felix were seated at breakfast in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 46]: Joan had wisely left the bargaining with the landlord to her companion , and he , knowing something of Serbian ways , which reck little of politeness when curiosity can be sated , chose a sitting room on the first floor with three bedrooms adjoining .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 18]: The sitting room was a huge place , big enough to serve as a studio if necessary .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 30]: Three large windows commanded a view of the main street , and the solid oak door opened into the corridor behind , which also gave access to the bedrooms .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 17]: Poluski 's only motive in selecting this particular suite was to secure the maximum of privacy .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 23]: Joan 's appearance was far too striking that she should be subjected to the scrutiny of every lounger in the restaurant beneath .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 25]: In this primitive community she would probably receive several offers of marriage the first time she sat at table in the public dining room .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 19]: It was he , too , who advised her never to go out unless she was deeply veiled .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 11]: Joan laughed at the reason -- but followed his counsel .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 43]: During their first stroll in the open air she said she felt like a Mohammedan woman ; yet she soon realized that a double motor veil not only shielded her from impertinent eyes but kept her face free from dust and insects .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 26]: Naturally , they made straight for the cathedral and examined the quaint picture that had provided an excuse for their visit to the Near East .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 5]: They were much impressed .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 14]: They gazed at its brilliant coloring and stiff pose for fully a minute .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 10]: Then Joan broke a silence that was becoming irksome .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 26]: `` If it is really a Giotto , '' she whispered , `` it was painted before he broke away from the Byzantine tradition . ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 21]: `` Yes , '' murmured Poluski , `` here we have both Giotto and Saint Peter at their worst . ''
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 10]: `` Felix , how can I copy that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 6]: `` Impossible , my belle .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 10]: You must improvise , using it as a theme .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 17]: When all is said and done , you know far more than Giotto about Saint Peter .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 3]: Holy blue !
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 24]: if you bring that back to Paris as a veritable likeness of the Chief Apostle you will be placed on the Index Expurgatorius .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 16]: Moreover , it would not be fair to him , after all these years . ''
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 14]: `` It needed only this to prove how farcical is the whole scheme .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 11]: I am beginning to dread the idea of meeting Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 7]: He will laugh at me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 7]: `` That will do him good .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 10]: I am told he is becoming most serious . ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 6]: `` Told -- by whom ?
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 9]: Surely you have not sent any message ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 5]: `` Not a word .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 11]: I leave that to you -- or Princess Delgrado . ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 6]: `` How snappy you are !
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 12]: It was not my fault that the Princess spoke to me .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 17]: She would never have known I was on the train if you had n't sung . ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 20]: `` Ah , by the way , we ought to hear some decent Gregorian music in this old place .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 14]: See , where they have put the choir , nearly under the dome .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 8]: Yes , we must attend a service .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 20]: The bass should roll like thunder up yonder -- '' `` Felix , who told you about Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 26]: `` A waiter in the hotel , a waiter rejoicing in the noble name of John Sobieski , a Pole , therefore , like myself .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 11]: I said to him ` What of the King ? '
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 33]: He answered , ` Everything that is good , if one listens to the people ; but the officers who come here to drink and play cards do not like him . '
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 65]: I explained that I wished to know the King 's whereabouts , and he said that if I was anxious to see the gracious youth I should have a splendid opportunity at four o'clock this afternoon , as his Majesty will pass the hotel at that hour on his way to the University , where he has promised to attend a prize giving . ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 5]: `` At four o'clock !
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 7]: What shall we do meanwhile ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 4]: asked Joan innocently .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 7]: Felix winked brazenly at the picture .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 11]: `` Delgratz is a picturesque city , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 7]: `` Let us inspect it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 21]: `` You do not think Alec will learn of our presence and visit us before going to the University ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 4]: `` Very improbable .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 13]: He is out in the country , watching artillery at field exercise .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 18]: Of course , he knows nothing about artillery ; but Kings have to pretend a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 74]: Now , if I were a young lady who had been traveling for a day and two nights , especially if I had slept badly during the second night , I should stroll about the principal streets till I was tired , eat a light luncheon , sleep for an hour afterward , dress myself in some muslin confection , and be ready to dine with the King at seven-thirty or thereabouts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 10]: `` I shall do nothing of the kind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 9]: cried Joan , blushing behind her motor veil .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 9]: Behold in me your slave of the lamp .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 6]: What shall we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 45]: `` I do n't object to looking at the shops and the people for a little while , '' she admitted , and this time Felix did not wink at the picture , but contented himself with an expressive raising of his bushy eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 10]: The program he mapped out was adhered to faithfully .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 19]: Joan was really tired , and the midday heat of Delgratz was not only novel but highly disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 22]: She retired to her room at one o'clock , and Felix heard her telling her maid to call her at three .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 31]: The elderly Frenchwoman whom Joan employed as a compendium of all the domestic virtues was scandalized by the pestering she had already undergone at the hands of the hotel employees .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 43]: They wanted to know everything about her mistress as soon as they were told that she was not Poluski 's wife , and the staid Pauline was at her wit 's end to parry the questions showered on her in bad French .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 33]: Felix advised her not to understand when spoken to , and relieved her manifest distress by the statement that the hotel would see the last of them in a day or two .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 35]: Then , anxious himself to be rid of Pauline , he strolled out into Fürst Michaelstrasse , entered the hotel 's public restaurant by another door , and sat there , musing and alone .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 24]: Thus far , Joan and he had passed through the simple vicissitudes that might beset any other strangers in the capital of Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 54]: Though the little man expected developments when Alec heard of Joan 's presence , he certainly did not look for squalls forthwith ; yet he had not been smoking and humming and sipping a cup of excellent coffee more than a minute before he became aware that the sunlit street was curiously alive .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 28]: The hottest hours of a hot day might well have driven the citizens of Delgratz indoors ; but some powerful inducement was drawing loiterers to Fürst Michaelstrasse .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 20]: It was evident that the attraction , whatsoever it might be , was not supplied by the thoroughfare itself .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 19]: Men lounged along the pavements or gathered in groups , and Poluski noted that few women were present .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 21]: Soon a regiment of soldiers marched up , formed into two ranks , and lined the street on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 29]: Felix betook himself to the door , where his compatriot was dusting marble topped tables with an apron that , under other conditions , would have soiled them .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 11]: `` Does the King arrive earlier than four o'clock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 9]: John Sobieski looked around furtively before he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 21]: `` No , '' said he in a low tone , `` the crowd is gathering to see the regicides .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 19]: Their trial ended to-day , and they are being taken to the Old Fort to await sentence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 5]: `` Found guilty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 10]: `` I should think so , indeed , monsieur !
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 6]: They gloried in their crime .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 11]: They claim that they cleared the way for Alexis III .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 4]: by removing Ferdinand .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 24]: Some people say the King can not really be severe on them , though it was he who brought them to justice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 7]: `` Have they many sympathizers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 16]: The waiter , a pallid creature , flicked a table loudly to cover his reply .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 30]: `` Some of our customers talk big ; but it is a strange thing that the authorities allow the men of the disbanded Seventh Regiment to remain in Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 13]: There are hundreds of them in the street at this moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 8]: `` It reminds one of Warsaw . ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 10]: A sudden moisture glistened in John Sobieski 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 6]: `` Ah , Warsaw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 10]: `` Shall I ever see my beautiful city again ?
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 8]: But it is different here , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 18]: Even though they quarrel among themselves , they have at least got rid of their conquerors . ''
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 36]: A quickening of interest on the part of the mob , a general craning of necks , and a sharp command to the soldiers showed that the criminals were en route from the law courts .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 14]: A squad of cavalry trotted into sight , followed by eight closed carriages .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 18]: An armed policeman sat near every driver , and another stood on the step outside each door .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 19]: Mounted soldiers in single file surrounded the dismal procession , and a second strong detachment guarded the rear .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 23]: It was a doleful spectacle , and Felix was puzzled by the absence of anything in the nature of a popular demonstration .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 30]: He had been led to believe that Delgratz abhorred these murders committed in the name of progress , and he naturally expected an emotional people to betray their feelings .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 10]: He listened in vain for a yell of execration .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 21]: A queer murmur ran through the crowd , that was all , a murmur that was ominous , almost sinister .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 15]: He scanned the faces of the crowd , trying to pierce their stolid aspect .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 24]: Some of the bystanders obviously belonged to the mutinous regiment ; but he looked in vain for any sign of anger or regret .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 45]: Skilled conspirator that he was , Poluski seemed rather to discern a deep laid purpose behind their unnatural phlegm , yet his suspicions died away when the street began to empty as soon as the prisoners ' vehicles and the escort had clattered past .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 50]: The foot regiment marched off , and within ten minutes Felix was back in his nook , smoking and coffee drinking , and thanking the chance that left Joan unconscious of this grim episode , since her bedroom windows looked out on the garden in rear of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 40]: He sat there quietly , sternly repressing his musical instincts when he caught himself humming some favorite melody ; nor would he have budged until Alec appeared had not his keen eyes noted another curious movement in the street .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 22]: About half-past three several men strolled past the café , men whom he distinctly remembered having seen in the earlier crowd .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 23]: In twos and threes they came , and he fancied that the complete disregard each set paid the others was rather overdone .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 17]: At any rate , he ordered a fresh supply of coffee and sought enlightenment from Sobieski .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 28]: `` Just peep at some of those fellows in the street and tell me if they are not soldiers of the Seventh Regiment , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 4]: The waiter obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 6]: He determined the point quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 22]: `` I recognize a few , monsieur , '' he muttered , `` and I believe there are scores of them .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 9]: I wish they would patronize some other street .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 12]: Our patrons will not care to mix with such rascals . ''
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 25]: Poluski rose wearily ; for his energetic soul was housed in a frail body , and the long journey from Paris had exhausted him .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 16]: `` I have read in the newspapers that King Alexis dispenses with a bodyguard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 8]: he said , lighting a fresh cigar .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 15]: `` He hates ceremony , that young man , '' was the ready answer .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 8]: `` At first the people mobbed him .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 26]: Now he rides through Delgratz like a courier , sometimes alone , at others with a friend or two , and perhaps an orderly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 3]: Felix laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 11]: `` He is a fine fellow , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 27]: `` Do the King a good turn , John , and you will be able to buy a café in Warsaw one of these days . ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 5]: `` Me , monsieur !
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 13]: How can a poor waiter hope to serve a King ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 4]: _ Que diable !
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 7]: _ You never know your luck .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 16]: Life is a lottery , and some day you may draw the great prize . ''
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 14]: Felix sauntered into the street and took a keen interest in its architecture .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 37]: In front of the hotel and down a slight gradient to the right it was a wide and straight thoroughfare ; but to the left and uphill it narrowed rapidly and took a sharp left turn .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 22]: In the angle stood a popular restaurant , and the rooms on the first and second stories were full of customers .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 50]: No one , apparently , was looking out ; but small parties of men sat near each open window , and they were not playing cards or dominoes , though the greater part of the male inhabitants of Delgratz seem to do little else when not eating or sleeping .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 16]: Moreover , an empty bullock cart was halted in front of the ground floor entrance .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 26]: `` There 's thunder in the air , '' said Poluski to himself ; but he continued to admire the irregular outlines of Fürst Michaelstrasse .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 62]: Thus , he could not fail to notice that the upper rooms of three cafés exactly similar to that at the corner were untenanted , while there was a disposition on the part of the late Seventh Regiment to group itself either at the turning or a good deal lower down the street , perhaps a hundred yards beyond the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 23]: `` Yes , '' said he , eying the glittering expanse of unclouded blue overhead , `` a storm is certainly brewing .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 8]: I can feel it in my bones .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 13]: It reminds me of the afternoon we removed the Governor of Silesia .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 14]: He was fused by a thunderbolt , from just such a summer sky .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 10]: Obviously , what he lacked was a lightning conductor .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 21]: Now , the question is , even if he had owned one , whereabouts would he have put it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 25]: The reply was given by the appearance of two men on horseback advancing at a fast trot up the easy slope of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 35]: They were notable because they wore the ordinary costume adopted by riders in the Bois or the Row , and in Delgratz , where rank was marked by uniform , this fact conferred distinction .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 11]: A few yards behind them cantered a couple of soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 16]: `` You are ten minutes before time , my dear Alec , '' murmured Felix .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 19]: `` Joan will never forgive me if she is still asleep ; but what is one to do ?
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 3]: _ Saperlotte !
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 6]: _ One must act . ''
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 40]: A hasty glance over his shoulder showed that the gentry in the corner café were stirred by some common impulse that led them to the windows , while the bullock cart was now drawn awkwardly across the narrow way .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 27]: As the horsemen came near , the loungers in the lower part of the street displayed a singularly unanimous desire to close in and follow them .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 53]: There were hundreds of townspeople gathered on the pavements , and not a few vehicles occupied the roadway ; so these concerted movements were not discernible to any one who was not a past master in the revolutionary art like Poluski , and to him only because his suspicions were already active .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 67]: The King and Beaumanoir were coming on at such a pace that Felix , owing to his low stature , would be quite invisible to them if he stood among the crowd now hovering on the curb ; so he pushed boldly out into the middle of the street , took off his hat with a flourish , and sang lustily : `` O , Alec !
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 6]: _ O , mon roi !
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 61]: _ '' The thunderbolt that removed the Governor of Silesia , had it struck the paving stones in front of the King 's horse , could hardly have startled Alec more than the sight of Felix , standing there , bare headed and grinning , and chanting an improvised version of a famous song at the top of his voice .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 6]: `` You , Felix ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 5]: `` You here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 21]: `` It is far more to the point that Joan is there , '' said Poluski , with expressive pantomime .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 6]: `` In the hotel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 17]: `` Yes , up the stairs , first door on the right , across the landing .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 8]: You have a few minutes to spare .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 4]: Go quickly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 6]: Alec required no second bidding .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 15]: Leaping from the saddle , he threw the reins to one of the orderlies .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 35]: `` Give me a few seconds , Berty , '' he cried to Beaumanoir , and before the onlookers could grasp the motive of this sudden halt , he had vanished through the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 19]: `` You come , too ; you are wanted , '' said Felix , addressing Beaumanoir in English .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 4]: `` Sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 15]: asked his Lordship , gazing at the quaint figure with some degree of astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 12]: `` Yes , it is a matter of life or death .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 3]: Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 4]: Beaumanoir dismounted leisurely .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 8]: `` Who 's going to die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 20]: he demanded , drawing the reins over his charger 's head ere he handed them to the second soldier .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 26]: Felix quivered , yet he realized that the Englishman 's cool demeanor was wholly in accord with the plan outlined in his own alert brain .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 20]: `` Everybody of any consequence in this bally menagerie if you do n't hurry up , '' said Felix .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 15]: The use of British slang at that crisis was a touch of real genius .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 5]: It appealed to Beaumanoir .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 3]: `` Gad !
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 23]: it 's a treat to hear you talk , '' he grinned ; but he thrust through the gapers in his turn .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 9]: Felix rushed into the restaurant and clutched Sobieski .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 7]: `` Here 's your chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 5]: he growled in Polish .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 9]: `` The King 's life is in danger .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 20]: Run to the President and tell him to despatch a strong body of troops on whom he can rely .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 23]: If he refuses to listen , say that Felix Poluski sent you , and bid him ask Prince Michael what that signifies .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 11]: Remember the names -- Poluski , Michael -- now run !
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 10]: Delay , and your throat will be cut ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 7]: John Sobieski was trained to obey .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 7]: He made off without a word .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 9]: Felix entered the hotel by a side door .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 11]: He darted up the stairs , breathless and almost spent .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 20]: He was in time to see Beaumanoir open the door of the sitting room and close it again hastily .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 8]: `` Oh , dash it all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 20]: began his Lordship ; for Alec , not to be denied , had just clasped Joan in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 5]: `` In , in !
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 6]: Not a second to lose !
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 5]: Barricade the door ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 3]: gasped Felix .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 12]: `` But , man alive , where is the fire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 7]: `` In , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 4]: _ Sacré nom !
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 8]: _ Act first and talk afterward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 28]: Felix himself flung wide the door , and Alec , at this second interruption , was compelled to free the scarlet faced Joan from his eager embrace .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 5]: `` Too bad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 3]: he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 10]: `` You promised me a minute , Felix ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 38]: Beaumanoir came in , diffident for once in his life , since none knew so well as he how dear to his friend was the blushing and embarrassed girl whom he now met for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 27]: `` Sorry , old chap , '' he said ; `` but this other johnny will have it that somebody is thirsting for your gore . ''
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 19]: Poluski , all trembling with excitement , slammed and locked the door and pointed to a heavy sideboard .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 6]: `` Drag it here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 7]: he shrieked in a high falsetto .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 26]: `` The street is crammed with men belonging to the Seventh Regiment , and they have a short way with Kings they do n't like .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 20]: The instant they see how they have been tricked they will be after you like a pack of wolves .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 8]: I have sent a messenger for help .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 18]: I dared not use one of your orderlies , because that would have given the game away .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 17]: While the men sit their horses out there the mutineers may believe you will soon reappear .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 10]: Nevertheless , block the doorway with all the furniture .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 15]: We must gain ten minutes at least , or it may be twenty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 20]: -LSB- Illustration : Beaumanoir and Felix fortified the position Page 155 -RSB- Joan was the first to credit him .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 6]: She ran to the window .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 10]: `` Oh , Alec , it is true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 17]: `` I was watching the crowd before you came , and it looks quite different now .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 15]: Hundreds of men have gathered , and they are armed with knives and pistols .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 14]: Something has made them angry , and the two soldiers are becoming alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 8]: Oh , my dear , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 12]: misfortune and I have come to you hand in hand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 19]: `` It seems to me that you and Felix have saved my life , '' said Alec quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 13]: `` Now , Beaumanoir , you and I must fortify the position .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 13]: Joan , stand with your back to the wall between the windows .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 20]: Felix , watch the houses opposite , and do n't let the enemy take us in flank without warning .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 11]: Thank goodness for an oak sideboard and a heavy table !
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 6]: Are you ready , Berty ?
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 5]: Heave away , then !
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 16]: We shall occupy a box in the front row when Stampoff arrives with his hussars !
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 3]: By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 4]: what a day !
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 14]: Twelve hours in that scorching sun and Joan waiting here all the time !
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 7]: Well , wonders will never cease !
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 16]: I wish we had one of those live shells we were experimenting with this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 13]: It would come in handy when the first panel gives way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 17]: CHAPTER VIII SHOWING HOW THE KING KEPT HIS APPOINTMENT Joan 's eyes could not leave Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 27]: She followed each movement of his lithe , strongly knit frame as he and Beaumanoir hauled the heavy pieces of furniture into position behind the door .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 38]: She was not fully alive as yet to the real menace of the gesticulating mob surging in the street beneath , and her thoughts ran riot in the newly discovered paradise of being loved and in love .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 12]: For Alec had asked no questions , listened to no explanations .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 46]: When he entered the room , he found her , half turned from the window , conscious that he was near , though trying to persuade her throbbing heart that Felix would not depart from an implied promise by sending him to her without warning .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 9]: She strove to utter some words of greeting .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 25]: Before she could speak , Alec 's arms were around her , and he was kissing her lips , her forehead , her hair .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 8]: She saw him as through a mist .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 16]: Her first fleeting impression was that he had become older , sterner , more commanding .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 8]: Kingship had set its seal on him .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 16]: A short month of power had stamped lines on his face that would never vanish .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 15]: But that sense of imperiousness was quickly dispelled by the enchantment of her presence .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 19]: Somehow , almost without spoken word , he brought the thrilling conviction that he was hungering for her .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 62]: The light in his eyes , the overwhelming ardor of his embrace , the magnetic force that leaped the intervening space while yet they were separated by half the length of the room , -- these things bewildered , charmed , subdued her wholly , and she kindled under them ere her brain could summon to aid the feeblest of remonstrances .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 33]: She abandoned the nebulous idea of protest when she found that she in turn was clinging to him , giving kiss for kiss with a delirious intensity that refused to be denied .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 33]: Nevertheless , the sheer joy of her emotions frightened her , and she was endeavoring to subdue its too sensuous expression when Beaumanoir opened the door , to close it again hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 6]: She recovered her faculties slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 57]: She was still quivering under the stress of that moment of ineffable delight , and her brown eyes sparkled with the glow of a soul on fire , and she was brought back to earth only by the knowledge that Felix , standing at his post near a window , was on the verge of collapse .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 23]: The sideboard contained a flask of brandy , which Pauline had insisted on stowing in a dressing bag in case of illness .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 25]: Joan , glad of the pretext to do some commonplace thing , thankful for the mere utterance of commonplace words , called for help .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 13]: `` Please remove the table for an instant , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 20]: `` Felix is ill , and I want to get at some cognac that is in the cellarette . ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 3]: `` Ill !
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 35]: He was lively enough in the street a minute ago , singing like a thrush , '' said Alec cheerily , though he did not fail to pull the table clear of the cupboard .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 10]: `` What is it , my Humming Bee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 7]: he demanded , turning to Poluski .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 16]: `` Is it a surfeit of excitement , or late hours , or what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 19]: `` I am yielding to the unusual , my King , '' crackled the Pole 's voice thinly .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 27]: `` During three whole days I have done naught but think , and that would incommode an elephant , leave alone a rat like me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 5]: `` Rat , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 24]: When we are all out of this trap , Felix , you must tell me what caused your alarming exercise of brain power .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 19]: Already you have bothered me to guess how you fathomed the pretty scheme you are now upsetting . ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 22]: `` There , dear Felix , drink that , and you will soon feel strong again , '' put in Joan .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 9]: `` Ha , dear Felix , am I ?
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 16]: I expected to be called anything but that after breaking my word so disgracefully ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 15]: `` You are forgiven , '' said she with a tender smile at Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 18]: Beaumanoir , discreetly peeping through the window over Poluski 's shoulder , saw something that perplexed him .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 30]: `` I say , Alec , '' he exclaimed , `` I thought you told me that Stampoff 's man Bosko was a thoroughly reliable sort of chap . ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 9]: `` I have always found him so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 13]: `` Well , just at present he looks jolly like a deserter .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 15]: He is making a speech to the mob and tearing off his uniform obligato .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 9]: The other joker is scared to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 6]: `` Bosko making a speech !
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 32]: Why , he never says anything but ' _ Oui , monsieur _ , ' or ' _ Non , monsieur _ , ' which is all the French he knows .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 12]: Well , this is a day of wonders , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 23]: Neglecting the precautions he had insisted on a minute earlier , Alec himself went to the window and drew Joan with him .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 37]: There were two other windows in the room ; but the four clustered in the one deep recess , for the thick walls of this old building were meant to defy extremes of heat and cold .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 39]: By this time one of the two orderlies had dismounted and was stamping on his smart cavalry jacket and plumed shako , thus announcing by eloquent pantomime , that he was discarding forever the livery of a tyrant .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 33]: The mob in the street was now swollen to unrecognizable dimensions , and Alec 's charger , which Bosko was holding , resented the uproar by lashing out viciously with his heels .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 26]: A man who had narrowly escaped being kicked drew a revolver , fired , and the spirited Arab fell with a bullet in its brain .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 29]: The dastardly act was cheered ; for the Seventh Regiment remembered that this same white horse had stumbled and thrown King Theodore on the day of his murder .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 11]: `` Oh , the coward , the hateful coward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 20]: wailed Joan , and two of the men muttered expressions of opinion that must be passed over in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 26]: But Felix happened to be watching Bosko , and noted the black rage that convulsed his face when the Arab dropped dead at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 11]: The Albanian 's feelings mastered him only for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 33]: He began at once to harangue the crowd again , evidently offering to lead his own horse out of harm 's way , and loudly bidding his frightened comrade to do likewise .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 24]: A path was being cleared when some one looked up at the window , and a fierce yell proclaimed the King 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 4]: Bosko was forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 9]: Sight of their quarry had frenzied the pack .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 5]: `` Down everyone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 11]: cried Alec , bending double and dragging Joan with him .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 31]: Several panes of glass were starred with little round holes , mortar fell from the ceiling , and the crackle of shots below showed that revolvers were popular in Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 12]: But Felix had seen enough to set his shrewd wits working .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 11]: `` That man of yours -- is Bosko his name ?
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 26]: -- is no fool , '' said he , when they had crept from the glass strewn area into the shelter of the stout wall .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 10]: `` He is gulling your beloved subjects , Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 17]: He realizes that trouble is brewing , and he means to steal off and bring help .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 34]: Fortunately , my brave Sobieski will be at the President 's house by this time , and your guards may arrive before those cutthroats in the street decide to storm the hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 8]: `` Sobieski -- who is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 3]: asked Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 7]: `` A waiter in the restaurant .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 18]: I have pledged you to buy him a café in Warsaw if the troops come speedily . ''
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 19]: `` Make it a brewery , Alec , '' said Beaumanoir ; `` these bounders mean business . ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 25]: A constant fusillade of bullets was now tearing the windows to atoms , and shattering the ceiling on the other side of the room .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 11]: Lord Adalbert was justified in offering liberal terms for relief .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 22]: The King , standing with one arm thrown round Joan 's shoulders , felt the tremors she strove vainly to repress .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 8]: `` Do n't be afraid , sweetheart .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 11]: They can not reach us here , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 21]: `` I have one unknown protector , it seems , and I feel sure that Felix is right about Bosko .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 29]: The only drawback is that our friendly waiter may find some difficulty in persuading the officers on duty at Monsieur Nesimir 's house that we are in danger .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 6]: We must risk that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 21]: `` Oh , to safeguard against delay , I told him to ask for the Prince , '' said Felix .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 5]: `` What Prince ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 7]: `` Your father , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 8]: Name of a good little gray man !
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 15]: You do n't know that Prince Michael and your mother are in Delgratz . ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 5]: `` Mark cock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 20]: cried Beaumanoir , as a bullet flew breast high across the room and imbedded itself in the inner wall .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 17]: The heroes of the Seventh Regiment were firing from the upper floors of the houses opposite .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 7]: Alec did not seem to heed .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 35]: The look of blank amazement on his face proved that he had ridden straight from the review ground to the university , whereas a call at the President 's house would have enlightened him .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 11]: `` It is true , dear , '' whispered Joan .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 16]: `` They came with us from Paris ; in the same train , that is .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 8]: We all arrived at Delgratz this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 12]: Your mother spoke to me on the platform at Vienna . ''
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 13]: He smiled with something of the old careless humor of Paris days .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 13]: `` I suppose everything is for the best , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 33]: `` Nothing surprises me now , not even this , '' and he nodded cheerfully toward the landing and stairs , whence a rush of footsteps and clamor of voices were audible .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 41]: The handle of the door was wrenched violently , and shots were fired into the lock and at the panels ; but the wood was seasoned and stanch , and nothing short of a rifle would drive a bullet through .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 14]: The door creaked and strained under the pressure of the mutineers ' shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 20]: Had it not been reinforced by the solid sideboard and equally heavy table , it must have given way .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 26]: As it was , no four men in Delgratz could hope to force an entrance , and no more than four could attack it simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 14]: It was noteworthy that no one called on the King to come out .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 43]: These hirelings , enraged against a ruler who had brought to the Danube a new evangel of justice and uprightness , of honest government and clean handed service to the State , made no pretense of requesting a hearing for their grievances .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 32]: They had planned to shoot him in cold blood while he and his three companions were momentarily delayed by the barrier of the bullock cart in front of the corner café .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 17]: Balked of this easy means of attaining their end , they were still sure of success .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 12]: But their cries and curses were intended only for self encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 17]: Not even the bloodstained Seventh Regiment had the effrontery to ask their victim to admit them .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 18]: There was a momentary quieting of their wild beast fury when the door resisted their utmost efforts .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 13]: Joan tried to persuade her tortured mind that the conspiracy had failed .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 12]: `` They will not dare to remain , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 11]: `` They know that assistance may arrive at any moment .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 8]: Listen , they are going now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 7]: `` Are you gentlemen armed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 5]: asked Felix , grimly .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 11]: `` Yes , with riding whips , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 56]: `` For my part , I have refused to carry any more dangerous weapon ; though it is true that I entered Delgratz with a sword in my hand , '' he added , remembering with a twinge his imagining of Joan 's ready laugh when she heard of Prince Michael 's brown paper parcel .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 10]: `` Pity you do n't possess a revolver apiece .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 33]: They would prove useful when the panels are broken , which will happen just as soon as these high spirited politicians on the landing secure axes , '' went on Felix remorselessly .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 17]: He wanted Joan to realize the certain fate that awaited her once the door gave way .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 15]: Concealment was useless , and he hoped she would faint before the end came .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 10]: `` What price the leg of a chair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 3]: asked Beaumanoir .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 17]: The Pole bent his gleaming gray eyes on the Briton with a curious underlook of inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 7]: We can do better than that .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 11]: You would be shot before you could strike a blow .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 18]: Joan , please crawl past the window and stand upright in the corner close to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 5]: You follow , Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 35]: I go next , and this young gentleman , who must be Lord Adalbert Beaumanoir , since he has all the outward signs of the British aristocracy , will place himself near the door .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 17]: If he does exactly what I tell him , we still have a fighting chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 29]: The change of position advised by Poluski rendered them safe from their assailants ' bullets until the door was actually off its hinges and the furniture thrust aside .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 28]: In the last resort , Alec meant to show himself at a window and offer a fair target to the men in the houses across the street .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 11]: When he fell the shooting from that quarter would cease .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 26]: Then , acting on his precise instructions , Beaumanoir and Felix must lift Joan through another window and allow her to drop to the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 5]: It was not far .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 33]: She might escape uninjured , and there was a possibility that the mob would spare a woman who was an utter stranger , one in no way mixed up in Kosnovian affairs .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 19]: Time enough to take this final step when their defense was forced , and that would be soon .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 23]: In all likelihood , he had not much more than a minute to live , and he devoted that minute to Joan .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 32]: `` Sweetheart , '' he murmured tenderly , `` you saw the beginning of my career as a King , and it seems that you are fated to see its end .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 10]: Have you forgotten what Pallas Athene said to Perseus ?
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 13]: It is not so long ago , that morning in the Louvre .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 9]: But why did you run away from Paris ?
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 6]: Why have you not written ?
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 12]: If you knew how I hoped for a word from you !
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 24]: My heart told me you loved me ; but even one 's heart likes to be assured that it is not mistaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 7]: He was looking into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 23]: The fantasy seized her that he was able to read her secret soul , and she swept aside any thought of concealment .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 20]: `` Alec , '' she said , `` tell me truly , are we in danger of death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 9]: `` I am , '' he replied simply .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 8]: It was better so , he thought .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 15]: `` Then I thank God that I am here to die with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 9]: He dared not hint that she might escape .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 13]: `` We still have a remote chance , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 12]: `` Let us talk of ourselves , not of death . ''
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 16]: `` But I do n't want to die , Alec , '' she whispered brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 8]: `` I want to live , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 9]: I want to live and be your wife .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 34]: Oh , Alec , let us ask Heaven for one year of happiness , one short year -- '' She choked , and the tears so bravely repressed hitherto dimmed her glorious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 10]: Her piteous appeal increased the torment of his impotence .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 20]: His face grew marble white beneath the bronze , and he bent in mute agony over her bowed head .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 32]: Felix , crouching behind Beaumanoir , assured himself that the King and his chosen lady were momentarily deaf to all else than the one supreme fact that each loved the other .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 22]: He sighed , and touched the stalwart Beaumanoir 's shoulder , which he was just able to reach with uplifted hand .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 10]: `` Drop on your knees , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 9]: `` I want to tell you something . ''
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 17]: `` You think it is high time I said my prayers -- eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 31]: Yet the younger man obeyed , since there was a calm authority in the pinched and wrinkled face raised to his that seemed to despise the uproar of the mob .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 9]: Felix was singularly unmoved by the bestial din .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 35]: He evidently cared naught for the continuous shooting from street and houses , or the renewed outburst on the stairs that welcomed the arrival of axes and sledge hammers rifled from a neighboring shop .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 40]: `` Pay heed to what I am going to say , '' he muttered , bringing his mouth close to Beaumanoir 's ear , `` I do n't wish Joan or the King to know what we are doing .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 20]: They will be wise after the event , not before , which is often the better part of wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 6]: Have you a steady hand ?
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 20]: Will you flinch if I ask you to destroy every man on the other side of that door ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 8]: Beaumanoir twisted his head round and grinned .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 12]: `` If asking will do the trick , try me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 13]: Felix took from an inner pocket of his coat a gunmetal cigarcase .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 11]: He pressed a spring , and the lid flew open .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 16]: Inside were four cigar shaped cylinders , each studded with a number of tiny knobs .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 28]: He withdrew a cylinder , and from a small cup in its base obtained six percussion caps , which he proceeded to adjust on the iron nipples .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 6]: `` My own patent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 15]: he exclaimed , with an air of pride that was grotesque under the conditions .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 17]: `` Each cigar is a bomb , warranted to clear any ordinary room of its occupants .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 5]: It does not discriminate .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 9]: It will dismember the most exalted personages . ''
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 5]: `` By gad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 7]: ejaculated Beaumanoir , shrinking away slightly .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 7]: Felix pressed closer in his enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 11]: `` The point carrying the detonators is loaded with lead .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 15]: If properly handled , it is sure to fly with that end in front .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 70]: You take it between your thumb and second finger , thus , and poise it by placing the tip of the first finger behind it , thus ; but you must throw hard , and wait until the upper part of the door is smashed , and you can fling it clear , or three ounces of dynamite will explode in front of your nose , with disastrous effect .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 19]: I will have a second bomb ready if the first one fails ; but it will not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 5]: `` By gad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 15]: said Beaumanoir again , gazing at the deadly contrivance as if fascinated by it .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 12]: He could retreat no farther , being jammed against the sideboard .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 6]: `` Do you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 4]: demanded Felix coolly .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 3]: `` Perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 10]: Is it -- er -- Russian or Spanish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 3]: `` Neither .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 6]: I call it the International .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 5]: Are you ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 7]: A thunderous blow shook the door .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 9]: Another and another fell on lock and hinges .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 4]: `` Felix ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 12]: said Alec , turning from Joan and stooping over the hunchback .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 15]: `` Do n't bother me , I am busy , '' growled the Pole .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 6]: `` But we must act .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 12]: We are done for now , and Joan must be saved .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 9]: I mean to draw the enemy 's fire .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 40]: When I am hit , you and Beaumanoir must take Joan to the third window over there -- take her by force if necessary -- '' `` My good Alec , at present you are a King without power .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 6]: Please do n't talk nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 16]: Keep in your corner , pacify Joan , and leave the rest to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 21]: `` Felix , '' and Alec 's tone grew curt and sharp , `` this is no time for jest !
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 10]: Look , you madman , the door is splitting !
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 12]: Is Joan to die , then , to please your whim ?
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 9]: Either attend to me or stand aside ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 3]: Poluski groaned .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 32]: He was such an amalgam of contrarieties that he hated the notion of explaining to a monarch the subtle means he had devised for ridding the world of its unpopular rulers .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 18]: Where Alec was concerned , the bomb ought to remain a trade secret , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 25]: He would not have trusted even Beaumanoir with its properties had he not known that his own nerve would fail at the critical moment .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 8]: For that was Felix Poluski 's weakness .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 22]: He could not use his diabolical invention -- an anarchist in theory , in practice he would not harm a fly .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 12]: `` I think just as much of Joan as you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 17]: he blazed back at the pallid man whose next step promised to lead to the grave .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 9]: `` I am King here , not you !
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 15]: Keep yourself and Joan out of harm 's way , and do n't interfere !
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 10]: Stand flat against the wall , both of you !
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 5]: Back , I say !
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 6]: There is the first axhead !
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 19]: Now you , who were born a lord , be ready to lord it over these groundlings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 36]: He whirled round on Beaumanoir , and Alec saw in his friend 's hand some object , what he could not guess , while Felix carried a similar article in reserve , as it were .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 26]: The little man 's earnestness was so convincing that the King could not choose but believe that some scheme that offered salvation was in train .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 5]: But it might fail !
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 28]: The door might be forced before his own desperate alternative could be adopted , and the consequences to Joan of failure were too horrible to be risked .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 16]: A panel shivered into splinters and the muzzles of two revolvers frowned through the aperture .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 4]: `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 10]: bellowed Poluski ; for Beaumanoir 's hand was raised .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 7]: Lord Adalbert did more than wait .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 31]: With the quickness born of many a hard won victory on the polo ground , his free left hand flew out and grasped the wrist behind one of the pistols .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 6]: He pulled fiercely and irresistibly .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 14]: An arm appeared , and a yell of pain signalized a dislocated shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 10]: The weapon exploded harmlessly and fell to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 27]: A living stop gap now plugged the first hole made by the ax wielders , while the writhing body of their comrade interfered with further operations .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 13]: Beaumanoir gave an extra wrench , and his victim howled most dolorously .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 9]: He slipped the bomb into his coat pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 12]: `` Pick up that revolver , Alec , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 16]: `` If it is still loaded it will help us to hold the fort . ''
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 13]: The King rushed forward , and butted against Beaumanoir in his haste .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 26]: Felix , whose skin was always sallow , became livid ; but nothing happened , and he snatched the bomb from its dangerous resting place .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 21]: Then he burst into a paroxysm of hysterical laughter which drowned for an instant a new hubbub in the street .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 14]: Alec , hastily examining his prize , found that three chambers were loaded .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 35]: He was about to search for a crack in the door through which he could fire at least one telling shot , when his ear caught the prancing of horses on the paving stones .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 31]: Joan , thoroughly enlightened now as to their common peril , had behaved with admirable coolness since Alec implored her not to stir from the corner between door and window .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 50]: She was sure they would all be killed , and her lips moved in fervent prayer that death might be merciful in its haste ; but she was not afraid ; that storm of tears had been succeeded by a spiritual exaltation that rescued her from any ignoble panic .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 55]: Yet her senses were strained to a tension far more exhausting than the display of emotion natural to one plunged without warning into the most horrible of the many horrors of civil war , and she had heard , long before the others , the onrush of cavalry and the stampede of the mob .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 35]: So , when her eyes met Alec 's , and she saw that questioning look in his face , she smiled at him with a radiant confidence that was astounding at such a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 14]: `` Heaven has been good to us , dear , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 6]: `` Your soldiers are here .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 6]: Your enemies are running away .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 2]: Listen !
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 8]: they are fighting now on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 13]: The unhappy men who raved for our lives will lose their own .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 9]: Can nothing be done to save them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 6]: He ran to the window .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 66]: Those leaden blasts that had swept the room from the first floors of the opposite houses had ceased , and not one potvaliant marksman of them all was to be seen ; but the street was full of hussars , and directly beneath , mounted on an excited horse , Stampoff was giving furious orders which evidently demanded an energetic storming of the hotel entrance .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 9]: Alec threw open the window and leaned out .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 9]: `` Just in time , old friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 7]: Stampoff heard him and looked up .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 6]: `` God 's bones ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 3]: he roared .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 9]: `` Here is the King safe and sound .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 6]: At them , my children !
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 7]: Dig them out with your sabers !
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 8]: Do n't leave a man alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 4]: `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 3]: shouted Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 5]: `` No more slaughter !
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 5]: I forbid it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 44]: Stampoff wheeled round on his charger and addressed the press of soldiers who had been unable to take any part in the street clearing , since the mob broke and fled when the first rank of plumed caps and flashing swords became visible .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 11]: `` You hear , my children , '' he vociferated .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 10]: `` Do n't harm anybody who does not resist .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 9]: The King 's commands must be obeyed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 28]: Joan , of course , could only guess what was being said ; but she could not fail to recognize the sounds of conflict on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 30]: Men are strangely akin to tigers when they see red , and the tiger 's roar when he pounces on a victim differs greatly from his own death scream .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 29]: Alec , powerless to move Stampoff , who believed , rightly , as it transpired , that the ringleaders were foremost in the attack , turned to Beaumanoir .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 9]: `` Release that fellow , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 24]: `` If I am able to make my voice heard through the racket , I can put an end to this butchery . ''
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 18]: Beaumanoir let go the arm , and a body fell on the other side of the door .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 14]: `` You are too late , I hope , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 11]: `` My prisoner took the knock just before you spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 7]: I felt it run through him .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 9]: He shook like a pony under the spur .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 8]: And you 're wrong , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 8]: This gang must be cleared out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 7]: He peered through the broken panel .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 10]: `` It 's all over , '' he added .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 8]: `` No flowers , by request . ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 12]: Felix was peering up at them with his bright crafty eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 5]: `` Queer thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 3]: he growled .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 15]: `` In my first honest fight I have been on the side of tyranny .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 36]: If you young gentlemen will be good enough to remove the barricade and give orders to have the passage cleared , I can go back to the cup of coffee I left in the restaurant .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 10]: Meanwhile , Joan must be taken to her room .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 19]: She is going to faint , and the Lord only knows what has become of her maid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 13]: Alec was at Joan 's side before Felix had made an end .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 14]: `` You will not break down now , sweetheart , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 25]: `` All danger is over , and , with God 's help , you will never witness such a scene in Delgratz again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 9]: `` I feel tired , '' she sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 11]: `` I know quite well I am safe , Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 12]: Somehow , I hardly thought you and I should die to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 23]: We have things to do in the world , you and I ; but those horrid men frightened me by their shrieks .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 14]: It must be awful to pass into the unknown -- like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 4]: She sighed again .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 20]: To her strained vision Alec suddenly assumed the aspect of Henri Quatre 's gilded statue on the Pont Neuf .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 25]: It did not seem to be in the least remarkable that the statue should leap from his horse and take her in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 7]: She was absolutely happy and content .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 10]: She felt she could rest there awhile in safety .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 36]: So , when the door was opened , the King experienced no difficulty in carrying Joan through a scene of bloodshed that would certainly never have been blotted from her mind had she remained conscious .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 37]: Stampoff 's commands had been obeyed , and the place reeked of the shambles ; but the girl was happily as heedless of its nightmare horrors as the thirty-one men who lay there dead or dying .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 8]: Alec bore her out into the street .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 59]: The sight of him was greeted by a sustained cheer from the troops and the loyal citizens who were now threatening a riot of curiosity and alarm , since the news had gone round that the King was being done to death by a rebellious soldiery in the Fürst Michaelstrasse , and Delgratz was hurrying to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 25]: Joan , revived a little by the fresh air and bewildered by the shouting throng that pressed around the King , opened her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 6]: `` Where am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 26]: she whispered , delightfully ignorant of the fact that she was nestling in Alec 's arms under the gaze of many hundreds of his subjects .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 15]: `` I am sending you to my mother , dear , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 23]: `` Felix and your maid will be here in a moment , and they will take you to her in a carriage .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 22]: You can not remain at the hotel , and you will be well cared for in Monsieur Nesimir 's house . ''
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 8]: `` Are you coming , Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 11]: she asked , scanning his face like a timid child .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 7]: `` Soon , quite soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 20]: `` Then I am content , '' she said , and the cloud descended again for a brief space .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 15]: Pauline , unfortunately , happened to be in the kitchen when the fray began .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 31]: She was nearly incoherent with fright ; but Felix managed to reassure her , and piloted her skilfully out of the hotel by an exit that concealed the gruesome staircase .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 45]: The glittering escort of soldiers surrounding the carriage pressed into the King 's service served to complete the illusion insisted on by Poluski , and Pauline rejoined her mistress , firm in the conviction that the tumult was an outlandish Serbian method of merrymaking .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 19]: Alec , having seen the carriage started on its short journey , approached Stampoff and wrung his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 13]: `` It was a near thing , General , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 14]: `` Five minutes later and we should have been in another world . ''
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 10]: He spoke in French , and Beaumanoir heard him .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 11]: `` Not a bit of it , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 14]: `` That anarchist johnny carries about with him the finest assortment of bombs .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 11]: -- By the way , where is the bally thing ?
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 19]: I 'll swear I put it in my pocket when I grabbed that joker through the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 22]: His hurried search was not rewarded , and Alec , scarcely understanding him , asked Stampoff who had given the alarm .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 6]: `` Bosko , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 12]: He came tearing up to the War Office like a madman .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 16]: Had any other brought the same message I really should not have believed it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 18]: `` Then you heard nothing of a waiter from this hotel , a waiter named Sobieski ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 6]: `` Nothing , your Majesty .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 24]: Bosko was undoubtedly the first to arrive with the news , and all was quiet at the President 's as I rode past .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 5]: I noted that especially .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 17]: By the way , Prince Michael is here ; came this morning , I am told .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 5]: The Princess accompanied him .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 10]: Does your Majesty intend going to them at once ?
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 12]: I have already sent an orderly to announce your safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 6]: Alec looked at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 10]: `` Five minutes past four , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 12]: `` No , General , I am due at the university .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 13]: I like to be punctual ; but this slight delay was unavoidable .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 26]: I shall see you at dinner to-night , and I suppose you will clear the city of these idiots of the Seventh Regiment before sunset .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 10]: By the way , a word before we part .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 17]: You saw the lady whom I brought from the hotel and placed in the carriage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 7]: `` Saw her , your Majesty ?
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 2]: Judas !
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 13]: Thirty years ago I should have striven to rescue her myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 17]: `` It was she who rescued me , General , she and the little humpbacked man .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 21]: Exactly how they managed it I do not know as yet ; but to-night you shall hear the whole story .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 17]: At present , it is enough that you should be told the one really important fact .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 7]: She is my promised wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 25]: With a smile and a farewell hand-wave , Alec mounted a troop horse and rode away with Beaumanoir in the direction of the university .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 15]: Stampoff looked after him with an expression of utmost dismay on his weatherbeaten face .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 4]: `` Gods ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 18]: `` A wife , and a pretty foreigner too , that is a bird of another color !
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 12]: What will Prince and Princess Delgrado say now , I wonder ?
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 20]: What will Kosnovia say , when it is in every man 's mind that you should marry a Serb ?
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 11]: And what mad prank of fortune sent her here to-day ?
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 3]: By thunder !
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 23]: I thought things were quieting down in Delgratz ; but I was wrong -- they are just beginning to wake up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 22]: CHAPTER IX MUTTERINGS OF STORM Before Joan 's carriage had traveled a hundred yards it was halted by a loud command .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 34]: An officer , galloping at the head of a detachment of cavalry , sought news of the King , and an escorted vehicle coming from the upper end of Fürst Michaelstrasse promised developments .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 11]: Joan was startled back into consciousness by the sudden stoppage .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 50]: The excited babble going on without was incomprehensible and therefore alarming , nor did the polite assurances of the officer , as he bent in the saddle and peered in at the window while he aired his best French , serve to still this fresh tumult in her veins .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 7]: `` What is he saying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 20]: she asked Felix , turning her frightened eyes from the urbane personage on horseback to Poluski 's intent face .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 14]: `` He was sent to rescue the King , '' was the explanation .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 14]: `` He says the bodyguard received warning less than two minutes ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 10]: `` Tell him the King is safe now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 8]: `` Oh , he knows that already .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 30]: What puzzled him is the fact that the troops at the War Ministry , which lies beyond the President 's house , should have reached there before him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 12]: `` What does it matter , since help came in time ?
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 7]: Please bid the coachman go on .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 24]: I -- I would like to be the first to let Princess Delgrado know that her son has escaped from those horrid men .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 4]: Who were they ?
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 9]: Why should they want to kill Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 8]: Felix did not obey her bequest instantly .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 29]: He exchanged some hasty words with the strange officer , who chanced to be Drakovitch , and answered Joan 's questions only when the cab resumed its journey .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 19]: `` Have you forgotten the part played by the Seventh Regiment in the recent history of Delgratz ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 7]: `` I remember something about them .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 4]: Alec disbanded them .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 17]: Oh -- they were the soldiers who revolted and murdered the late King and Queen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 3]: `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 11]: Do women ever read the newspapers intelligently , I wonder ?
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 28]: You state a most remarkable fact , considering that this is Delgratz and your future capital , as coolly as if it had happened in Kamchatka . ''
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 14]: `` But still I do not understand why they should turn against Alec .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 24]: I have at least sufficient intelligence to recall the avowed object of their crime , -- the restoration of the Delgrado line . ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 3]: Felix smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 16]: If Joan was able to defend herself , she was certainly making a rapid recovery .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 11]: `` That is a mere hazy recollection of their afterthought .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 22]: Of all despotisms , save me from a military one , and soldiers who slay Kings are the worst of despots .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 14]: If there were no Kings , there would be few soldiers , Joan .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 15]: Put that valuable truism away among the other wise saws that govern your life .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 21]: You will appreciate its truth , and the even greater truth of its converse , when you are a Queen .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 28]: But soldiers are stupid creatures , obviously so , since killing is no argument , or the word philosopher would mean a man armed with a bludgeon .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 20]: If they do away with a tyrant and elect his successor , they are apt to acquire the habit .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 21]: Soldiers are meant to obey , not to rule , and these Kosnovian Kingmakers were not patriots but cutthroats . ''
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 8]: Joan buried her face in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 27]: The thought came unbidden that in some inexplicable way she shared with the infamous Seventh Regiment a large measure of responsibility for Alec 's dangerous kingship .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 5]: `` Mademoiselle is ill .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 9]: Why trouble her with your silly chatter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 4]: demanded Pauline angrily .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 7]: `` Eh , what the deuce ?
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 10]: My name is n't Balaam , '' retorted Felix .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 9]: `` Nor am I a donkey , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 23]: If it was n't for you , miladi would now be happy in her little apartment in the Place de la Sorbonne .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 9]: I keep my ears open , me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 15]: `` I said nothing about your ears , Madame Pauline , '' tittered Felix .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 25]: The Frenchwoman 's homely features reddened , and a vitriolic reply was only half averted by the lurching of the carriage through a gateway .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 10]: Joan looked out , and her eyes were moist .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 33]: `` I possess two good friends in Delgratz , and I hope they will not quarrel on my account , '' she said , with a piteous smile that silenced the woman .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 5]: Poluski 's mouth twisted .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 13]: `` We are not quarreling , my belle , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 18]: `` Pauline thinks I brought you here , whereas your presence is clearly an act of Providence .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 10]: Being a modest person , I naturally protested . ''
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 59]: If Joan was not utterly bewildered by the whirligig of events , and more than ever unnerved now at the near prospect of meeting Prince and Princess Delgrado in the perhaps unwelcome guise of their son 's affianced wife , she would certainly have discovered that Felix was saying the first thing that came uppermost in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 58]: The outcome must have been a quick mental review of the day 's incidents in order to hit upon the special item he was trying to conceal , though it is probable that no girl of Joan 's candid nature would ever guess the suspicion rapidly maturing to a settled belief in the Pole 's acute brain .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 49]: For Captain Drakovitch , the officer who led the bodyguard in their belated ride to the King 's aid , had told him that a waiter , John Sobieski by name , had arrived breathless at the President 's house many minutes before the actual alarm was given .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 45]: Sobieski had sobbed out some incoherent words about the King , and the Seventh Regiment ; but Prince Michael , who was in the courtyard , snapped up the man immediately , bidding him hold his tongue , and hurrying him inside the building .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 10]: Once there , Sobieski became more confused than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 13]: Prince Michael obviously regarded him as a crazy rumor-monger until Nesimir appeared .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 37]: The latter , by reason of his local knowledge , instantly appreciated the true significance of an attack on the King in a crowded thoroughfare by a gang whom Sobieski was sure he had identified correctly .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 14]: Nevertheless , precious time had been consumed by the elder Delgrado 's interference .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 12]: The President acted with promptitude ; but the outcome was clear .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 14]: If it had not been for Bosko , the King must have fallen .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 4]: `` Gods ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 31]: vowed Drakovitch in his emphatic story to Felix , `` there were we lounging about smoking cigarettes while his Majesty was in a fair way to be cut in pieces !
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 6]: A nice state of affairs !
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 16]: If some one had not warned Stampoff , we might have been too late ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 14]: `` Better not mention it in public , '' was Poluski 's advice .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 15]: `` The mere notion of the resultant disaster would make Prince Michael seriously ill .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 20]: Moreover , such things grow in the telling , and the story will be traced back to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 38]: The other had agreed , and Felix followed his own counsel by withholding from Joan all knowledge of the unpleasant mischance that had nearly cost the lives of the King and his companions in the besieged hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 50]: But his thoughts were busy , and , when he found Sobieski detained in the entrance hall , he consigned Joan and her maid to the care of a servant , briefly explaining that they were to be taken to Princess Delgrado , and forthwith questioned his fellow countryman .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 6]: Sobieski was quaking with fear .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 31]: The scornful disbelief expressed by Prince Michael had discomfited him at the beginning , and now he was practically under arrest until his connection with the outrage was investigated officially .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 30]: One of Stampoff 's messengers had already announced the King 's safety , or by this time Sobieski must have become the lunatic Prince Michael took him to be .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 18]: `` What then , my friend , they did not credit your tale , I hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 22]: said Felix genially , and the sound of his voice drove some of the misery from the waiter 's pallid cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 8]: `` It was my fault , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 18]: I ran so fast that I lost my breath and the gentleman could not understand me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 7]: `` Ah , is that it ?
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 6]: Did you speak Polish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 7]: `` No , no , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 7]: I always speak Serbian here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 8]: `` And what did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 30]: `` Just what you told me to say , -- that the King was in danger and that the President was to send troops instantly to the Fürst Michaelstrasse .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 26]: Then the old gentleman , he whom they call Prince Michael , came up and said he did not believe a word of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 4]: `` Mon Dieu !
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 8]: He understood you , it appears ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 6]: `` Perhaps not , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 18]: I made a hash of it , especially when I told him Monsieur Poluski sent me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 7]: `` Sure you mentioned that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 6]: `` Quite sure , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 10]: It was then he ordered me inside the house .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 10]: The mention of your name seemed to annoy him .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 14]: For a little while he could say nothing but ` Poluski , Poluski !
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 6]: Is he in it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 46]: I swore you had nothing to do with the plot , monsieur , but had acted throughout as the King 's friend ; then he stormed at me again , and called me a blockhead for coming to the palace with such a mad story .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 48]: He asked me what I thought would have been the consequence if the Princess heard me , and I said I knew nothing about any Princess ; I was only quite sure the King would be slain if some one did not hasten to his rescue . ''
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 13]: `` But some one had more sense , some one listened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 4]: said Felix dryly .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 5]: `` Ah , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 28]: When the President came down the stairs , Prince Michael went to meet him , laughing all the time at my romancing , as he called it .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 16]: But I shouted out , being quite desperate then , and Monsieur Nesimir heard me .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 18]: Of course , by that time , I was in such a state that my knees shook .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 52]: I was certain the King would be found dead , and perhaps you , monsieur , and then would there be no one to prove that I was not mixed up in the affair , so people would think I ran to the palace in order to save my own skin .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 33]: I nearly dropped with fear , feeling that so many minutes were being lost , and that made me more nervous than ever when I was answering Monsieur Nesimir 's questions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 22]: Poluski 's worn face exhibited no more emotion than if he was a graven image , but his voice was sympathetic .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 17]: `` At any rate , everything has ended happily , friend John , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 22]: `` The King is alive , you did your duty , and you will find him not unmindful of your services .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 9]: By whose order are you detained here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 7]: The excited waiter began to snivel .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 8]: `` I do n't know , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 27]: Pray intercede for me and have me set at liberty , or I shall lose my situation if it gets about that I have been arrested .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 10]: My patron will have nothing to do with politics .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 22]: He says his business is to sell beer and coffee , and all parties are equally fond of his goods . ''
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 32]: Felix , who was already being eyed askance by the presidential hangers-on in the entrance lobby , returned to the courtyard and appealed to the officer in charge of the escort .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 17]: A brief conversation with an official elicited the fact that Sobieski awaited Prince Michael 's commands .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 11]: `` Then bring Prince Michael here , '' said Poluski .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 4]: `` Monsieur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 18]: An astounded flunky could say no more ; but this impudent hunchback was in no wise abashed .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 14]: `` Exactly , Monsieur Felix Poluski wishes to see his Excellency at once .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 10]: Tell him that , and it will suffice . ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 27]: The lackey was forced to yield , and , much to his surprise , Prince Michael did not hesitate an instant in obeying that imperative summons .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 27]: An expression of annoyance flitted across his florid features when he found Poluski standing near the trembling waiter ; but he tackled the situation with nonchalance .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 10]: `` Have you been here long , Felix ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 9]: `` No one told me you had arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 22]: Your young lady friend has been taken to the Princess -- at her own request , I am given to understand .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 14]: Dreadful business , this unforeseen attack on my son , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 23]: I must confess that I did n't credit a word of it when this poor fellow rushed in with his broken tale .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 20]: Ah , by the way , I gave some orders in my alarm that may have been misinterpreted . ''
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 14]: He dug a hand into a pocket ; but withdrew it , empty .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 19]: `` His Majesty will see to it that you are suitably rewarded , '' he said to Sobieski .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 24]: `` Meanwhile , you have my hearty thanks , and I regret that any hasty words of mine should have caused you inconvenience .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 10]: You can go at once , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 19]: Sobieski made off , well pleased that his stormy career in the whirlpool of state affairs was ended .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 17]: But Felix shook hands with him and said quietly : `` I will not forget . ''
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 14]: Prince Michael seized Poluski 's arm with a fine assumption of dignified cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 17]: `` So it was really you who sent that stammering youth with such an astounding message ?
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 4]: Come , then .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 6]: Tell me all about it .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 7]: Was Alec actually in peril ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 20]: He drew Felix up the stairs , out of earshot of the servants and orderlies in the wide hall .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 3]: Felix sniffed .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 8]: `` Odd thing , '' he grinned .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 25]: `` You are a Prince and I am an anarchist , yet both of us need a nip of brandy when we are disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 15]: But I have the better of you in one respect , my dear Michael .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 6]: My hand does n't shake .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 29]: Now , yours -- '' The clasp on his arm loosened , lost some of its friendliness , and Prince Delgrado stood for an instant on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 31]: `` I tried to show a calm front before the others ; but the predicament my son was in found the weak place in my armor , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 9]: `` My case exactly , '' said Felix .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 12]: `` Joan diagnosed the symptoms , and dosed me with cognac .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 11]: You , I imagine , were your own physician . ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 14]: `` Ah , since you mention the lady , who is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 3]: `` Joan ?
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 16]: A female divinity , one of the few charming women left in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 3]: `` Admirable !
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 29]: One can associate those qualities with residence in Paris ; but in Delgratz , Felix , one finds them unusual -- shall I say out of place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 20]: `` If I were you , Monseigneur , I would learn to regard her in a totally different light .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 18]: Joan ought to be at home here , because she is your prospective daughter in law . ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 21]: Michael Delgrado could govern his nervous system with some measure of success when words were the only weapons that threatened .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 20]: He did not flinch now ; but threw open the door of the nearest room on the upper floor .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 37]: It chanced to be the apartment in which President Nesimir had received Alec and Stampoff on that memorable morning , barely a month ago , when the young King came to Delgratz to claim his patrimony .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 34]: Neither man was aware of the coincidence that led Michael to slam the door , place his back against it , and gurgle a question : `` Are you jesting , Felix ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 33]: `` Quarter of an hour ago I was on the point of being introduced to a grim personage who would have squeezed the last joke out of me , '' said Poluski .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 49]: `` His name was Death , Pallida Mors , who steps with even stride from the huts of the poor to the palace of the King , and he gave me such a fright that I shall be in no mood all day for any display of humor .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 27]: Why , man , do n't you realize that I have been under this roof fully five minutes without experiencing the slightest desire to sing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 12]: `` But , Felix , do be in earnest for once .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 7]: What is this you tell me ?
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 5]: How can Alexis III .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 8]: marry this woman , this adventuress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 49]: Poluski 's big gray eyes narrowed into slits , and the hump on his shoulders became more pronounced as his head drooped forward a little ; but his smooth tones did not falter , and his uneasy hearer thought he found a note of friendly commiseration in them .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 11]: `` A hard word , Michael , hard and unjust .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 9]: Joan is no adventuress , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 72]: `` We old birds are too ready to condemn a young and pretty woman who falls in love with a King ; but in the present instance criticism is disarmed , since Joan was in love with Alec when he had no more worldly wealth than the endowment of your princely name , and when his chance of becoming King of Kosnovia was as remote as -- what shall I say ?
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 8]: -- well , as your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 14]: Michael came away from the door and stood looking out at the window .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 17]: It afforded a partial view of the courtyard and the fairly wide street beyond the gate .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 66]: `` I know , of course , that your ideas and mine on these subjects differ very greatly , '' he said after a pause , and with a perceptible return to his grandiose manner ; `` but as you say rightly , both of us are old enough to realize that a reigning King can marry none but a Princess of some royal house .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 11]: Again , the King of Kosnovia must marry a Serb .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 64]: There you have two fixed principles , so to speak , each of which renders it impossible for a lady who rejoices apparently in no other name than Joan -- '' `` Joan Vernon , '' put in Felix , producing a cigarcase , an exact replica of that containing the bombs , and selecting one of the long thin cigars he favored .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 5]: `` Ah , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 14]: The Princess spoke to her in Vienna , and ascertained her name then .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 20]: Well , Miss Joan Vernon can not , by the very nature of things , become Queen of Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 18]: It is not that I disapprove of the notion , Felix ; it is simply impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 10]: Poluski struck a match and began to smoke furiously .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 60]: Delgrado probably expected him to say something ; but he waited in vain , since Felix seemed to be far more perturbed by the suspected existence of a hole in the outer wrapping of the cigar , and futile efforts to close it with the tip of a finger , than by the princely hinting at a morganatic marriage .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 8]: Perforce , Prince Michael resumed the discussion .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 15]: `` I am stating the facts calmly and without prejudice , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 24]: `` I assume that you are not misleading me or that some sort of lovers ' vows exists between these young people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 4]: He paused again .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 4]: Poluski was triumphant .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 23]: He had found the hole , applied the surgical method of a tourniquet by pressure , and the cigar was drawing perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 28]: `` Having said so much , Felix , you might be sufficiently communicative in other respects , '' growled Delgrado , turning angrily from the window . ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 3]: _ Parbleu !
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 11]: _ I left you to do the talking , Monseigneur .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 22]: This devil of a cigar has been bored by a weevil , and was broken winded till I stopped the leak .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 5]: You were saying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 16]: `` That Alec Delgrado might have married your young friend ; but King Alexis III .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 4]: can not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 11]: `` He will , '' said Felix , grinning complacently .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 13]: `` If he does , it will cost him his throne . ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 3]: `` Poof !
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 17]: For a man of the world , Michael , you utter opinions that are singularly inept .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 15]: I think you were driving just now at the accepted theory of royal alliances ?
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 14]: If it holds good for Alec , it affects you , his father .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 35]: You did n't marry a Princess , but happily secured a good , honest American lady , sufficiently endowed with good , honest American dollars to keep you in luxury throughout your useless life .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 27]: If there is some law which says that Alec can not make Joan a Queen , the same law would prevent him from being a King .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 5]: But it does n't .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 39]: King he is , and King he will remain as long as it pleases God to keep him in good health and save him from the miserable rascals who tried to assassinate him to-day -- and their like .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 17]: What you want , Michael , is a friend who is not afraid to warn you .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 15]: Now , for the hour , kindly regard me as filling that useful capacity .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 20]: After twenty-five years of extravagance you have managed , I suppose , to exhaust your excellent wife 's fortune .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 19]: You came to Delgratz this morning for the express purpose of drawing fresh supplies from the Kosnovian treasury .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 39]: Well , you have n't met your son yet ; but when you suggest that he should begin to impoverish his people to maintain you in idle pomp in Paris , I fancy you will find him adamant .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 8]: That is not his theory of governing .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 34]: If it was , he would neither marry Joan nor be alive at this moment , since Heaven saw fit to intrust me with the control of both his bride and his life .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 24]: `` One thing more I have to say , Michael , and then I have finished , unless you press me too hardly .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 11]: Let us suppose Alec had fallen in to-day 's attempt .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 8]: Whom do you think would succeed him ?
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 7]: Michael V. Not for five minutes !
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 31]: You know now , and I have known all along , that the real instigator of the May outbreak was Julius Marulitch and his Greek bear leader , Constantine Beliani .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 17]: You were inspired , Michael , when you resigned your claims in favor of your son .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 36]: Those two meant to put you forward as their puppet and shove you to the wall as soon as the Delgrado line was restored and they were able to pull the strings here in safety .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 32]: They never dreamed that Alec , the careless , happy-go-lucky boy , the polo player and haunter of studios , would prove a stumbling block in the path of royal progress .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 8]: You were a mere pawn , Michael .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 21]: They counted on pushing you out of the way as easily as if you were a baby in a perambulator .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 11]: What was true a month ago is more true now .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 32]: Go down on your knees and thank Heaven that it saw fit to preserve your son 's life this afternoon ; for his life alone stands between you and the abyss !
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 17]: `` Now , I have spoken , and -- name of a good little gray man !
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 10]: -- you do n't seem to like the hearing .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 11]: But do not forget what I have said , Michael .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 10]: I have poured forth a stream of golden words .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 56]: It will be well for you if you are never called on to apply other test to their value than your own judgment ; for as sure as the day dawns that you dream of reigning in Delgratz , so surely will you dig your own grave with a shovel lent by the devil . ''
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 9]: Poluski ceased , and apparently expected no answer .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 22]: He , too , went to a window and gazed out at the sunlit vista of graveled courtyard and yellow buildings .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 14]: Already there were long patches of shade ; for the day was closing .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 30]: A foot regiment marched past the palace gates , and Prince Michael might have remembered that in Delgratz a sentry with a loaded rifle guards each street after sunset .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 37]: But his bloated face was curiously haggard , and his prominent eyes looked at the soldiers with the unconscious aspect of a man whose castle in Spain had suddenly proved itself the most deceptive of mirages .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 62]: Perhaps , for a brief space , he saw himself as Felix saw him , and a species of horror may have fallen on him at the mere conceit that another man was able to peep into his heart and surprise there the foul notion that had seized him when John Sobieski brought the tidings of his son 's desperate plight .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 31]: Be that as it may , Prince Michael Delgrado offered no reply to the decrepit , poverty stricken artist who had dared to unmask him in such exceedingly plain terms .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 10]: Not a word passed between them during many minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 43]: The shuffling tramp and dust of the regiment died away , and the thoroughfare beyond the gates had resumed its normal condition when a new animation was given to the courtyard by a loud order and the hurried assembly of the guard .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 4]: said Felix contentedly .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 6]: `` Here comes the King !
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 12]: Your Excellency will now receive confirmation of some of my statements .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 29]: As for the rest , if I am proved right in some respects , it will be a first rate idea to accept the remainder without proof . ''
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 14]: Delgrado shot a baleful glance at the hunchback ; but ignored his comment .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 33]: `` If it is not indiscreet of a parent to betray some interest in a son 's prospective happiness , may I venture again to inquire who Miss Joan Vernon is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 8]: `` I think I answered you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 5]: `` In general terms .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 36]: Feminine divinity and charm should be the characteristics of all brides ; but these delectable beings do not enter the world fully formed , like Venus Aphrodite newly risen from the sea of Cyprus . ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 15]: `` Oh , to me it suffices that she exists , and is Joan .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 18]: I have known her a whole year , during her student life in Paris , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 8]: Your simile was well chosen , Monseigneur .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 12]: Aphrodite came with the spring , and so came Joan . ''
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 6]: `` And before Paris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 11]: `` The New England section of America , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 20]: Her mother died when Joan was a child ; her father was in the navy and was drowned . ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 8]: `` An artist , you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 8]: `` Artistic would be the better description .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 10]: She is too rich ever to paint well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 4]: `` Rich ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 5]: `` As artists go .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 12]: She has an income of two hundred pounds a year . ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 6]: `` Ah , bah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 11]: `` Do n't be so contemptuous of five thousand francs .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 9]: They go a long way -- with care .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 23]: I believe that my dear Joan spends all her money on dress , and keeps soup in the pot by copying pictures .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 8]: But she will make a lovely Queen .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 3]: _ Saperlotte !
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 11]: _ I must paint her in purple and ermine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 26]: Yielding to the spell of the vision thus conjured up , Felix forgot his racked nerves and sang lustily a stanza from `` Masaniello . ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 21]: Prince Michael flung out of the room to meet his son ; but the strains followed him down the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 47]: Yet Poluski was thinking while he sang , and the burden of his thought was that this anxious father had asked him no word as to the scene in that bullet swept room , nor the means whereby Alec and his friends were snatched from death .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 11]: Very different was the meeting between Joan and Princess Delgrado .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 56]: The panic stricken mother , scarce crediting the assurance given her by the President 's family that there were no grounds for the disquieting rumors that arose from Sobieski 's appeal for help , was in an agony of dread when the first undoubted version of the true occurrence was brought by Stampoff 's courier .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 40]: The arrival of Joan , of one who had actually been in her son 's company until the danger was passed , though helping to dispel her terror , aroused a consuming desire to learn exactly what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 26]: Joan , of course , could only describe the siege and their state of suspense until the soldiers cleared the street of the would-be assassins .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 54]: As to the motive of the outrage or the manner in which it reached its sudden crisis , she had no more knowledge than the Princess , and a quite natural question occurred to the older woman when Joan told how Felix Poluski had startled the King and herself by his warning cry .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 12]: `` My son had gone to visit you , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 46]: she said , not without a shadow of resentment at the fact that he had discovered this girl 's whereabouts readily enough , though seemingly there was none to tell him that his father and mother were in the city and longing to see him .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 12]: Joan flushed at the words ; but her answer carried conviction .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 57]: `` I do not yet understand just how or when Felix discovered that the King 's life was threatened , '' she said ; `` but there can be no doubt it was a ruse on his part to distract the attention of the mob when he told his Majesty that I was in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 34]: -- I chanced to be looking out -- and I was very angry with Felix when I saw that he had stopped the King and was evidently informing him of my presence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 13]: `` Then my son did not know you were in Delgratz ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 13]: `` He had no notion I was any nearer than Paris . ''
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 55]: `` What an amazing chapter of accidents that you should be in Delgratz to-day , and , under Providence , become the means of saving Alec 's life ; for it is quite clear to me now that had he gone a few yards farther he would have been shot down without mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 6]: Joan colored even more deeply .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 31]: Her pride demanded that she should no longer sail under a false flag , yet it was a seeming breach of maidenly reserve that she should announce her own betrothal .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 31]: It would have come easier if she could claim more consideration from this kind faced , pleasant voiced woman than was warranted by the casual acquaintance of a railway journey .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 35]: But Alec had sent her to his mother , and Joan 's nature would not permit her to carry on the deception , though it might be capable of the most plausible explanation afterward .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 27]: `` I feel I ought to tell you , '' she said , and the blood suddenly ebbed away from her face to her throbbing heart .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 9]: `` Alec and I were friends in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 33]: We were fond of each other ; but gave not much heed to it , since I was poor and he told me he had his way to make in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 15]: He wrote to me a few days ago , asking me to marry him .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 25]: I did not know what to say , when chance threw in my way a commission to copy a picture in this very city .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 56]: Put in such words , it all sounds very mad and unconvincing ; but it is true , and it is equally true that I should never have acknowledged to-day that I returned his love if -- if I did not think -- for a few awful minutes -- that we should both be killed .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 13]: And -- and -- I wanted to die in his arms ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 21]: Joan began to cry , and Princess Delgrado cried too , and it was in tears that King Alexis III .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 33]: found them when he had returned Prince Michael 's stately greeting and was told that the young American lady who had come from the shattered hotel was in his mother 's room .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 45]: CHAPTER X WHEREIN THE SHADOWS DEEPEN Joan was standing on the first floor veranda of the President 's house early next morning , when her errant thoughts were brought back to earth from wonderland by a stir and clatter of hoofs in the courtyard .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 46]: She knew , because Alec had told her the previous evening , that he was bound for an experimental farm certain local magnates had established in the rich alluvial plain that forms the right bank of the Danube some few miles from the capital city .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 16]: `` At present our country exports pigs and little else , '' he had said .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 8]: `` I mean to change all that .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 39]: Austria shuts and bolts her doors by hostile tariffs ; but Turkey is open to trade with all the world , and who so favorably situated as we , once the barriers of race prejudice are broken down ?
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 15]: So , behold in me a patron of agriculture and its allied arts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 29]: `` The Turk is our hereditary enemy , '' snarled Prince Michael , who was much annoyed by the poor quality of the wine at the royal repast .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 10]: `` Fancy me drinking Carlowitz at my age ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 20]: he had growled to Stampoff when he discovered that champagne was not supplied , by the King 's order .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 25]: `` My dear Dad , I am trying hard to erase that word ` hereditary ' from the Serbian language , '' laughed Alec .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 35]: `` It opposes me at every turn ; it mocks at my best efforts ; it swathes me like the bandages of a mummy , -- and I am growing weary of its restraint .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 10]: This is a question of self interest , too .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 40]: Perhaps , if I can persuade our good Kosnovians to adopt some more up-to-date fetish , they may drop the hereditary habit of carving their chosen rulers into mincemeat whenever a change of Government seems good to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 35]: `` The King of Kosnovia should never forget that the time may come when he will be crowned Emperor at Constantinople , '' said Prince Michael with a regal flourish of his plump hand .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 3]: `` Precisely .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 11]: The ceremony should provide a picturesque spectacle for the cinematograph .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 24]: Meanwhile , I want to enter the enemy 's territory , and at present my skirmishers are pigs which are difficult to drive .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 21]: We need stronger forces , such as hardware , agricultural implements , horses , cereals , even textile manufactures . ''
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 40]: `` In sending your pigs , I hope you also get rid of your bores , Alec , '' put in Felix , and Nesimir , who knew no English , wondered why so many of his guests laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 45]: As for the elder Delgrado , he sulked until the President produced a bottle of imperial tokay , a luxury which the stout Sergius explained away by the statement that his house had never before been honored by so distinguished and brilliant a company .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 15]: So Joan was prepared for her lover 's departure from Delgratz soon after daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 28]: The heat of the noon hours was so excessive that early rising became more of a necessity than a virtue ; hence her appearance on the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 31]: Alec had definitely promised his mother before retiring to rest that he would not dispense with an escort until the city was thoroughly quieted down after the day 's excitement .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 17]: The troopers paraded at six o'clock , and he did not keep them waiting a minute .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 29]: Joan , delighting in the military display , watched him mount and ride off with that half-maternal solicitude which is the true expression of a woman 's love .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 41]: She hoped he would look up ere he quitted the courtyard -- and she must have telegraphed her wish ; for Alec at once turned in the saddle , almost as though some one had told him she was there .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 49]: He waved a hand in gay greeting , and it would appear that a whim seized him at the sight of her , since he gave some instructions to an aid de camp , who came clanking back to the porch , dismounted , and entered the building .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 9]: Soon the officer was bowing low to Joan .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 35]: `` The King presents his compliments , Excellency , '' he said in careful French , `` and wishes to know if you will accompany him for an hour 's ride before sunset . ''
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 35]: -LSB- Illustration : Joan laughed at Alec 's masterful methods Page 199 -RSB- `` Please convey my regrets to his Majesty ; but I do not possess a riding habit , '' said Joan .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 28]: `` The King told me to say that if your Excellency offers no objection , a habit will be brought to the palace at four o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 16]: Joan laughed whole heartedly ; for Alec 's masterful methods came as a distinct surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 13]: Yet , despite her independent spirit , she rejoiced in his dominance .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 44]: `` Tell his Majesty that I have the utmost confidence in his judgment , '' she said , and her face was still rippling with merriment at the hidden meaning Alec would surely extract from her message when Lord Adalbert Beaumanoir joined her .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 14]: `` Ah , that is better , Miss Vernon , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 28]: `` Glad to find you in good spirits , -- ` Hail , smiling morn , ' and that sort of thing , eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 13]: `` Why are you deserting Alec -- the King -- to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 8]: `` I thought you two were inseparable .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 18]: And please enlighten me , Lord Adalbert , as to the correct way of alluding to royalty .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 24]: Alec is every inch a King , of course ; but I find my tongue tripping every time I use his title . ''
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 7]: Beaumanoir seemed to weigh the point .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 26]: `` You are experiencing the same difficulty as the sailor who acted as billiard marker in the naval mess at Portsmouth , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 44]: `` One evening the Prince of Wales came in to play pool , and Jack whispered to the mess president , ` Beg pardon , sir , but am I to call ` im Yer R'yal ` Ighness or Spot Yaller ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 17]: Joan shrieked at that , and the sound of her mirth brought Princess Delgrado to them .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 13]: `` You are cheerful this morning , Joan , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 50]: Her ready use of the girl 's Christian name would have told Felix , if he had been present , that Alec 's mother did not by any means share her husband 's views as to the impossibility of a marriage between her son and this bright faced American .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 38]: At any rate , Joan 's cheeks glowed , and there was more than convention in the kiss the two women exchanged , each moved , as it were , by a spontaneous liking for the other .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 19]: `` It is impossible to be other than cheerful in Lord Adalbert 's company , '' said Joan .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 24]: `` Even yesterday , when bullets were showering in through the windows of that wretched hotel , he made game of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 19]: `` So I did , -- shouted ` Mark cock ' when the first low one flew across .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 3]: By gad !
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 14]: that 's rather clever of you , Miss Vernon , '' he grinned .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 27]: `` I do n't know how either of you can find it in your heart to jest about that dreadful adventure , '' said the Princess .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 30]: `` I lay awake for hours last night thinking of what might have happened if that man Bosko had not managed to get away and warn General Stampoff . ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 18]: `` By the way , what became of the waiter Felix sent here from the hotel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 4]: mused Joan aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 7]: `` I forgot to ask him .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 11]: Surely the man came and spoke to some one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 13]: `` Oh , yes , Prince Michael met him and questioned him .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 43]: Then Monsieur Nesimir took him in hand ; but long before either of them could make up their minds that he was speaking the truth Bosko was clear of the mob and Stampoff was bringing his hussars from the War Ministry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 20]: The Princess spoke hurriedly , and the younger people were quick to perceive a slight restraint in her words .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 5]: It was quite natural .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 45]: A mother , weighing the actions of others in a matter touching the safety of her son , would hardly make allowance for the incredulity such a messenger as Sobieski would inspire , and Beaumanoir tactfully led the talk to a less serious topic .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 32]: `` You charged me , a little while ago , Miss Vernon , with deserting our sovereign lord the King , whereas the exact opposite is true , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 7]: `` I am here on duty .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 25]: ` Berty , ' said my liege , ` stop at home to-day and amuse my mother and Joan , ' his very words .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 5]: Am I amusing you ?
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 22]: Then I must go and find that funny little Pole and beseech him to tell us his best before breakfast story .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 2]: Gad !
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 9]: He has some rippin ' after dinner ones .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 38]: He had us all roaring last night , and the funniest thing was to hear him spinning the same yarn in the local lingo , so that Nesimir and the other Serbs could share in the festivities .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 17]: Prince Michael and Alec had the pull of me there , because they could laugh twice .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 20]: By the way , Princess , Monsieur Poluski was well acquainted with your husband a good many years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 10]: They first met in New York , it seems .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 28]: Poluski coolly informed us that he was obliged to leave Warsaw about that time because he had invented a new explosive specially adapted for removing crowned heads .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 16]: Fancy him saying that when a real live King was sitting next to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 12]: `` Alec is very fond of Felix , '' said Joan .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 21]: `` He knows quite well that our friend talks about things he has never done and never means to do .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 11]: Why , Felix is the most tender hearted man living .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 24]: His generosity is proverbial , and he would give away the last franc in his pocket if a starving woman begged of him .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 7]: His anarchist notions are all nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 34]: He has cared little about political affairs during the last ten years , and his only real happiness now is to paint the portrait of a pretty woman and sing at his work .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 32]: If it was not for the belief that he is mixed up with dynamitards and other weird creatures , he would be one of the best known artists in Paris . ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 33]: Beaumanoir called to mind the quiet confidence in Poluski 's voice when describing the potency of that curious cigar-shaped bomb which so narrowly escaped being hurled at the mutineers during the fight .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 25]: `` There is a lot more in Poluski 's make-up than one would give him credit for at a glance , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 17]: `` I understand he was really a firebrand in his youth , '' remarked the Princess .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 19]: `` My husband and he disagreed so strongly at one period that their acquaintance ceased during many years .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 13]: Indeed , I met him yesterday practically for the first time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 3]: She sighed .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 27]: Joan realized that Princess Delgrado was perplexed to find her son with so many new interests in life , interests of which she had no cognizance .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 42]: He might have dwelt in some city a thousand miles removed from Paris , for all she knew of his associates or habits , and this one fact was eloquent of the gulf that yawned between his home and his pursuits .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 12]: After breakfast , Joan insisted on beginning work in the Cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 29]: Felix and Beaumanoir accompanied her there in a closed carriage , and the cool interior of the heavy , ugly structure was not ungrateful in the midday heat .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 34]: At four o'clock Joan was ready to don a riding-habit that fitted marvelously well considering that the maker had never set eyes on the wearer till he brought the costume to the palace .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 18]: At five she and Alec and Beaumanoir went for a ride on the outskirts of the town .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 18]: The men took her to a very fine turfed avenue that wound through three miles of woodland .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 36]: At the close of a glorious canter a turn in the path revealed a rather pretty chateau situated on a gentle slope of lawns and gardens rising from the northern shore of a large lake .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 7]: `` Do you like it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 3]: asked Alec .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 13]: `` It is a perfectly charming place , '' she said enthusiastically .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 12]: `` I am glad you think so , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 18]: `` It is called the New Konak , in contradistinction to the old one , the Schwarzburg .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 7]: It will be our summer residence .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 14]: I propose to occupy it as soon as it is properly furnished . ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 15]: He spoke lightly ; but a quiet glance conveyed far more than the words .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 25]: This , then , was their destined nest , their very own house , and for their first ramble he had brought her there .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 18]: Its seclusion gave a sense of secure peace that was absent from the President 's gloomy palace .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 18]: The lovely park and its belt of forest shut out the noise and glare of the streets .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 13]: Joan sat on her horse and surveyed the scene with glistening eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 13]: Her future home lay there , and the belief thrilled her strangely .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 60]: If she could have peered into the future , how much more deeply would she have been stirred ; for if ever she was fated to be happy in the companionship of the gallant youth by her side , assuredly that happiness was not so near or so easily attained as it seemed to be in that sylvan hour .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 12]: Beaumanoir broke in on her reverie in his usual happy-go-lucky style .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 14]: `` Not a bad looking crib , is it , Miss Joan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 22]: `` I have promised Alec to remain in Delgratz until you are all settled down in it , nice and comfy .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 10]: Then I wend my lonely way back to Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 3]: By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 19]: I shall be something of a hero there -- shine with reflected glory -- eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 18]: `` I ca n't spare you for many a day yet , Berty , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 17]: `` You can hardly realize how good he has been , Joan , '' he continued .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 12]: `` I had a fearfully hard time during the first week .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 32]: More than once I wanted to cut and run ; but he kept me to it , chaffing me out of the dumps when everything seemed to be going wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 6]: Beaumanoir winked brazenly at her .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 11]: `` He talks that way now , '' he grinned .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 10]: `` It 's the kingly habit , I understand .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 10]: Alec has got it down to a fine point .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 18]: Make every fellow believe that he is It , and there you are , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 11]: There was some substratum of sense in Beaumanoir 's chaffing .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 24]: Alec was taking his kingship very seriously , and Joan was hard pressed to bridge the gulf that lay between Paris and Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 21]: At first she found it almost impossible to realize that Alec had been in harness little more than a month .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 20]: His talk was replete with local knowledge ; he seemed to understand the people and their ways so thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 38]: He was versed even in the peculiarities of their methods of tillage , was able to explain distinctions of costume and racial appearance , and might have spent his life in studying all their customs and folklore .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 14]: Fortunately , Joan herself was gifted with quick perception and a retentive memory .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 60]: After a few days ' residence in the White City she began to assimilate the rills of information that trickled in upon her from so many sources , and the feeling of bewildered surprise with which she regarded her lover 's attainments during the first hours of real intimacy was soon replaced by an active sympathy and fuller understanding .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 27]: She was helped in this by the King 's mother , since there could be no doubt that Princess Delgrado took her absolutely to her heart .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 42]: Prince Michael , who was completely eclipsed not only by his son 's extraordinary versatility in all public affairs but by lack of that opulent setting for his peculiar qualities which Paris alone could supply , seemed to accept the inevitable .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 27]: He tolerated Joan , openly praised her beauty , and became resigned in a more or less patronizing way to the minor distractions of local life .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 10]: Felix and Joan gave up their mornings to art .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 24]: The Pole discovered some quaint old frescoes in the cathedral which attracted him by their remarkable freedom of design and simplicity of color .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 81]: He valiantly essayed their reproduction ; but Joan suspected in her deepest heart that Poluski 's sudden conversion to Byzantine ideals was due far more to the fact that the lofty dome of the building produced musical effects of the most gratifying nature than to any real appreciation of the quaint contours and glaring tints of a series of wall pictures that set forth some long forgotten Bulgar artist 's conception of the life and history of John the Baptist .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 28]: There was naturally a good deal of inquiry and speculation as to the identity of the unknown connoisseur who had commissioned Joan to copy the Saint Peter .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 13]: Felix resolutely declined to satisfy any one 's questioning on that topic .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 50]: He had given his word , he said , not to betray the confidence reposed in him ; but he allayed Alec 's professed jealousy by declaring that to the best of his knowledge the man who had sent Joan on this mysterious quest had never even seen her .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 34]: Still , it was impossible to avoid a certain amount of interested speculation among members of the small circle which was aware of the reason that lay behind Joan 's visit to Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 32]: Both Alec and Joan believed that Count Julius Marulitch was in some way responsible , and their chief difficulty was to analyze the motive of such unlooked-for generosity on his part .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 23]: The slight mystery underlying the incident was not cleared up until Beliani reached the capital two or three days after Julius himself .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 35]: The latter cleared the air by expressing his unbounded amazement at finding his cousin engaged to a young American woman of whose existence he had not even heard before he was introduced to her .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 25]: Under the conditions it seemed to savor of the ridiculous to ask if he was the hidden agent in the matter of the picture .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 18]: But Beliani was candor itself ; not for a moment did he endeavor to conceal his responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 46]: When Alec welcomed him on the evening of his arrival , he drew the King aside and said , with all the friendliness of one apparently devoted to the Kosnovian cause : `` I am glad to see that my little scheme has worked well .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 15]: Of course you guessed who it was that despatched Miss Vernon from Paris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 42]: `` No , '' said Alec , scanning the Greek 's smiling yet subtle face with those frank eyes of his that had so quickly learned the secret of looking beneath the veneer of men 's words to discover their motives .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 12]: `` No , I never associated you with her appearance here .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 6]: What inspired you to it ?
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 39]: I may say at once that I regard it as the most friendly act you could possibly have performed so far as I am concerned ; but I know you well enough to be a little dubious . ''
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 15]: Beliani smiled and spread wide his hands with the deprecatory gesture of the Levantine .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 21]: Long years of residence in the capitals of Europe had not wholly effaced the servile mannerisms of the Eastern money-lender .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 18]: `` That is because you know I am a Greek , your Majesty , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 18]: `` It is the misfortune of my countrymen that we are seldom given credit for disinterested motives .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 31]: Well , I will be honest , quite frank in this , for the excellent reason that if I was to endeavor to hoodwink you I think I should fail .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 69]: I make it my business to know everything -- I repeat , everything -- about Kosnovian affairs , and when the rumor reached Paris that you were to marry a Montenegrin Princess -- '' Alec laughed so cheerily that Prince Michael , who happened to be in the room , turned and looked at the two , wondering what Beliani could have said that so amused his son .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 20]: `` My dear fellow , '' he broke in , `` I have never set eyes on the lady .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 19]: My time has been far too occupied in learning my business to permit of visits to neighboring States .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 21]: Moreover , as it happened , I had chosen my wife some days before I hit upon a career . ''
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 6]: `` Exactly , your Majesty .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 6]: I knew that also . ''
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 8]: `` But how could you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 9]: `` I mean that I learned it afterward .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 50]: An art student of the type of Miss Vernon , and a young gentleman so popular in Parisian society as Alexis Delgrado , could not meet day after day in the Louvre to conduct a class composed solely of two members without exciting a certain amount of comment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 22]: `` But that does n't explain why you should have decided upon the extraordinary step of sending her to Delgratz . ''
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 15]: `` No , it shows only how readily I availed myself of existing circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 42]: You see , sitting there in Paris and reading of your phenomenal progress , I pictured to myself the isolation , the lack of sympathetic companionship , that you must be suffering here despite all the brave fireworks of your achievements .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 66]: We Greeks are poets and philosophers as well as financiers , and I gratified those higher instincts of my race by rendering possible a visit to Delgratz of the lady whom you had chosen as a bride , while at the same time I hope to do myself a good turn in winning your favor ; for I have money at stake on your success .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 9]: Please do not forget that , your Majesty .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 26]: I supported the Delgrado cause when it was at the lowest ebb of failure , and I naturally look forward now to recoup myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 18]: `` All this is new to me , '' said Alec , `` new and somewhat puzzling .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 18]: In what way are you bound up with the fortunes of my house , Monsieur Beliani ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 7]: The Greek shrugged his shoulders expressively .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 22]: `` There are so many ways in which interest in a fallen monarchy can be kept alive , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 27]: `` Monseigneur your father is well acquainted with the turns and twists of events ever since he was driven forth from Kosnovia as a young man .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 55]: For many years I remained here , working steadily and hopefully in his behalf , and you yourself are aware that when you were a boy of fourteen , Stampoff and I escaped death only by the skin of our teeth because of an abortive attempt to place your father on the throne . ''
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 40]: `` Of course , '' said Alec thoughtfully , `` you must be repaid with interest the sums you have expended in our behalf ; but I warn you that a new era of economy has been established here .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 13]: My father and I have already agreed to differ on that point .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 34]: He seemed to think that the chief business of a King was to exploit his subjects , whereas my theory is that the King should set an example of quiet living and industry .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 34]: Do n't forget that I have seen some of my brother potentates stranded in Paris , mostly because they were so ready to gratify their own appetites at the expense of their people .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 16]: I need hardly tell you , Beliani , that Kosnovia is a poverty stricken State .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 13]: We have suffered from three generations of self seeking and rapacious rulers .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 5]: That is all ended .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 10]: I mean to render my people happy and contented .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 60]: It shall be the one care of my life to make them so , and if it is the will of Providence that a Delgrado should reign in the next generation , my legacy to him will be , not millions of pounds invested in foreign securities , but a nation strong , self contained , and prosperous . ''
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 7]: Beliani listened with a rapt attention .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 32]: `` I agree most fully with every word that has fallen from your lips , '' he said ; `` but your Majesty can not achieve these splendid aims single handed .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 18]: You must be surrounded by able men ; you need officials of ripe experience in every department .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 43]: Now , the first consideration of a small State like this , hemmed in as it is by powerful Kingdoms which the least change in the political barometer may convert into active enemies , is a strong and progressive system of finance .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 17]: I am vain enough to think that you may find my services useful in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 43]: There is no man in Delgratz who has had my training , and so assured am I of the success that will attend your Majesty 's reign that I purposely delayed my arrival here so that I might not come empty handed .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 17]: I passed a week in Vienna , working and thinking twenty hours out of each twenty-four .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 12]: I felt my way cautiously with the leading financial houses there .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 52]: Of course , I could not say much , because I was unauthorized ; but I have obtained guarantees that will command the certain issue of a loan sufficient to give a start to some , at least , of the many projects you have already foreshadowed in your public speeches .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 33]: Without a shadow of doubt I declare that as soon as I am able to open negotiations with your approval , a loan of several millions will be at your service . ''
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 23]: Though the Greek was putting forward an obvious bait , it was evident that the King was astonished by his outspoken declaration .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 17]: `` Do I understand that you are applying for the post of Minister of Finance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 7]: he said in his straightforward way .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 10]: `` Yes , your Majesty , '' replied Beliani .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 20]: `` You appreciate , of course , that I occupy a somewhat peculiar position here , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 18]: `` I am a constitutional monarch backed by a constitution that is little more than a name .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 21]: This country really demands an autocracy , whereas I have sworn to govern only by the will of the people .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 21]: In those circumstances I do not feel myself at liberty to appoint or dismiss Ministers at my own sweet will .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 43]: I assure you that I am grateful for the offer of help you bring ; but I can not give you the appointment you seek until , in the first place , I have consulted my council and obtained its sanction . ''
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 3]: Beliani bowed .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 62]: `` I will leave the matter entirely in your Majesty 's hands , '' he said , and by no sign did his well governed face betray his satisfaction ; for , with the King on his side , the astute Greek well knew that he could pull the strings of the puppets in the Assembly to suit his own ends .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 26]: `` May I venture to suggest to your Majesty , '' he went on , `` that there is one thing that demands immediate attention ?
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 20]: Your position can not be regarded as assured until you have received the recognition of the chief European States .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 9]: Has Austria made any move in that direction ?
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 7]: Have you been approached by Russia ?
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 16]: One of those two will take the initiative , and the others will follow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 34]: `` So far , '' said Alec , smiling , `` I have been favored with a telegram from the German Emperor , which his chargé d'affaires tried to explain away next day .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 55]: It was followed by a protest from Turkey on account of an alleged disrespectful remark of mine about her position in the cosmogony of Europe , and I have drawn a polite refusal from Austria to modify passport regulations , which , by the way , I suggested should be altogether done away with .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 11]: Other Kings and Principalities have left me severely alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 19]: `` But it would be a grave error to drop the passport system , '' said Beliani earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 38]: `` It is most important that your Majesty 's police should be acquainted with the identity of all strangers ; otherwise you would never know what secret agents of your enemies you might be harboring here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 23]: `` I trouble my head very little about the secret agents of enemies that do not exist , '' said Alec lightly .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 37]: `` You are probably thinking of the revolt of the Seventh Regiment ; but that is a domestic quarrel , a local phase of the war waged by all criminals against representatives of law and order .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 23]: To be sure , I shall devote every effort to keeping Kosnovia free of external troubles ; yet passports are useless there .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 22]: I find that a stupid dream of a Slav Empire has drugged the best intellects of Kosnovia for half a century .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 12]: That sort of political hashish must cease to control our actions .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 25]: It has served only to cripple our commercial expansion , and I have declined resolutely to countenance its continuance either in public or private .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 9]: Let us first develop the land we own .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 56]: Believe me , Monsieur Beliani , if our people are worthy of extending their sway , no power on earth can stop them ; but they must first learn to till the field with implements other than swords or bayonets , which are quite out of date , either as plows or as reaping-hooks . ''
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 25]: Prince Michael , watching them furtively , and wondering much what topic was engaging them so deeply , could no longer restrain his impatience .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 22]: He joined them , saying with his jaunty , self confident air : `` What new surprise are you two plotting ?
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 48]: You ought to make a rare combination , -- Alec with his democratic pose of taking the wide world into his confidence , and you , Beliani , burrowing underground like a mole whose existence is suspected only when one sees the outcome of his labors . ''
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 26]: `` Just what I was suggesting to his Majesty , '' laughed Beliani , cursing Prince Michael under his breath for interfering at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 42]: `` I will say , though , from what I have managed to glean of his projects , that the humble rôle you have been good enough to assign to me will be utterly out of place in his nobler schemes .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 10]: Nevertheless , I hope to make myself useful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 11]: `` Something to do with money , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 4]: guffawed the Prince .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 16]: `` It is the only commodity I really understand , '' was the suave answer .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 19]: `` That is why you refused me a loan a fortnight ago in Paris , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 5]: `` A loan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 3]: interposed Alec .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 9]: `` Were you hard up , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 22]: `` I have been telling you so without avail ever since I arrived in Delgratz , '' said the Prince bruskly .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 46]: `` Ah , you have been asking me to impose on an empty exchequer an annual payment that Kosnovia certainly can not afford ; but I certainly was not under the impression that you had found it necessary to apply to Monsieur Beliani for help .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 8]: Why should such a step be necessary ?
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 43]: I have always understood -- '' `` Oh , we need not discuss the thing now , '' said Prince Michael offhandedly ; for he dreaded a too close inquiry into his wife 's financial resources in the presence of the Greek .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 42]: Princess Delgrado was reputedly a rich woman , and her husband had explained his shortness of cash during recent years by the convenient theory of monetary tightness in America , whence , it was well understood , her income was derived .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 9]: `` Have you seen your mother recently ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 11]: he went on , striving to appear at his ease .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 11]: `` I was looking for her half an hour ago .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 29]: Some letters that reached me from Paris to-day ought to be answered by to-night 's post , and I wish to consult her before dealing with them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 62]: `` Joan will know where she is , I expect , '' said Alec ; but , seeing that Prince Michael did not avail himself of Joan 's presence to seek the desired information , he strolled over to the corner of the room where Joan was chatting with Beaumanoir and one of the Serbian officers attached to the royal suite .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 10]: `` Do you know where my mother is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 13]: `` General Stampoff took her for a drive nearly an hour ago .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 20]: I offered to go with them ; but the General explained that his victoria would hold only two . ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 8]: `` Stampoff driving with my mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 13]: cried Alec with a laugh , `` I must look into this .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 10]: Stampoff is no lady 's man as a rule .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 17]: Now , what in the world does he want my mother to do for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 17]: Certainly there must have been some quality in the air of Delgratz that produced strange happenings .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 28]: Stampoff could scarcely speak civilly to a woman , ever since a faithless member of the fair sex brought about his downfall in Delgratz a decade earlier .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 19]: Small wonder , then , that Alec should express surprise at such display of gallantry on his part !
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 53]: And , indeed , the unprecedented action of the gruff old Serbian General in taking Princess Delgrado for a drive that evening was destined to have consequences not to be foreseen by any person , least of all the young couple whose contemplated marriage was then in the mouths of all men .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 12]: It was the first step in the new march of events .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 73]: Stampoff meant to prove to the King 's mother that her son would be ruined in the eyes of his people if he married a foreigner , ruined instantly and irretrievably , no matter how gracious and pleasing Joan might seem to be in their eyes , and , true to his military caste , he wasted no time in making the Princess aware of his motive in seeking this tête-à-tête conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 54]: `` I think I am right in assuming that you approve of the young American lady as your son 's wife , '' said he when the carriage was clear of the paved streets and bowling smoothly along the south bank of the Danube on the only good driving road outside the city .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 27]: `` The notion startled me at first , '' confessed the Princess ; `` but the more I see of Joan the more I like her .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 35]: Alec and she are devoted to each other , and I am sure she will be popular , for she is the type of woman who will take her position as Queen seriously . ''
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 33]: `` She is admirable in every respect , '' interrupted Stampoff ; `` but she suffers from one defect that outweighs all her virtues , -- she is not a Serb . ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 27]: `` Nor am I , '' said the Princess quickly ; `` yet no one seems to find fault with the King on that ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 24]: `` One can not judge the conditions that hold good to-day by those which existed twenty-five years ago , '' said Stampoff gravely .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 40]: `` When Prince Michael married you , madame , he was an exile ; but Alexis is the reigning King , and he will offend his people mortally if he brings in a foreigner to share his throne . ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 9]: Princess Delgrado was bewildered by this sudden attack .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 14]: She turned and scanned the old man 's impressive features with feverish anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 4]: she asked quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 18]: `` Are you trying to enlist my aid in a campaign against my son 's chosen wife ?
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 9]: If so , you will fail , General .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 16]: I am weary to death of political intrigues and the never ceasing tactics of wirepullers .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 37]: I have been surrounded by them all my life , and I thanked Providence in my heart when I saw that my son began his reign by sweeping aside the whole network of lies and artifice .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 9]: He has not imposed himself on his people .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 36]: He is here by their own free will , and if they are ready to accept him so thoroughly they will surely not think of interfering in such a personal matter as his marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 13]: `` But they are thinking of it , '' said Stampoff doggedly .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 11]: `` That is why you are here now with me .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 12]: I felt that I must warn you of the trouble ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 29]: Alec , I admit , would be an ideal King in an ideal State ; but he has failed absolutely to appreciate the racial prejudices that exist here .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 26]: They are the growth of centuries ; they can not be uprooted merely because a King is in love with an eminently desirable young woman .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 49]: Among the ten millions of our people , Princess , there are hardly ten thousand who have any settled notions of government , whether good or bad , and those ten thousand think they have a prior right to control the destinies of the remainder of the nation .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 32]: With the exception of a few of the younger officers , there is not a man among the governing class who does n't harbor more or less resentment against your son .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 26]: He is putting down with a ruthless hand the petty corruption on which they thrived , and at the same time reducing their recognized salaries .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 37]: In season and out of season he preaches the duties of good citizenship , but these men have too long been considering self to yield without a struggle the positions attained under a less scrupulous régime .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 31]: `` I speak of what I know when I tell you that , placid and contented as Delgratz looks , it is really a seething volcano of hate and discontent .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 59]: Repressed for the hour , kept in check , perhaps , by the undoubted loyalty of the masses , it is ready to spout devastating fire and ashes at the least provocation , and that will be found in a marriage which seems to shut out all hope of realizing the long looked-for joining of Montenegro and Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 32]: I have a bitter acquaintance with our history , madame , and am persuaded that if Alec is to remain King he must abandon forever this notion of marrying an alien .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 22]: The Greek church would oppose it tooth and nail , and the people would soon follow the lead of their Popes .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 15]: This young lady 's appearance in Delgratz has come at a singularly inopportune moment .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 12]: She was brought here by some one hostile to your son .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 18]: If she came in obedience to Alec 's wishes , he is his own worst enemy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 16]: The distressed Princess could hardly falter a question in response to Stampoff 's vehement outburst .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 10]: `` Why do you tell me these things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 4]: she said brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 23]: `` I -- I dare not interfere , even though I approved of what you say , which I do not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 19]: `` Some one must act , and speedily too , or the resultant mischief can not be undone .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 22]: I appeal to you because you are a woman , and we men are prone to bungle in these matters . ''
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 10]: `` But what do you want of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 5]: wailed the tortured Princess .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 23]: `` Michael protested against the marriage -- '' `` I am thinking of Alec 's welfare now , '' said Stampoff gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 14]: `` You are his mother , and you and I can save him .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 17]: In a word , that girl must go , to-night if possible , to-morrow without fail .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 20]: The talk of marriage must be dropped , and revived only when a Serb is the prospective bride . ''
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 7]: `` You say she must go .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 5]: What does that imply ?
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 17]: It is not in my power to send her away , even if I would . ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 12]: `` It is , Princess , '' was the grim answer .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 14]: `` If she loves Alec , she will save him by leaving him .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 9]: I am told women do these things occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 10]: Perhaps she is one of the self sacrificing sort .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 15]: At any rate , she must be given the chance , and by you .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 19]: She must go away , and , in going , tell the King she will never marry him .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 4]: It is hard .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 27]: Both will suffer ; but , in the long run Alec will come to see that by no other means can he retain his Kingdom . ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 24]: CHAPTER XI JOAN DECIDES An odd element of fatality seemed to attach itself to the Byzantine Saint Peter in the cathedral of Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 87]: Joan nearly lost her life within a few hours of the time when first she saw that remarkable work of art , and it was ordained that one of the last clear memories of the checkered life in Kosnovia should be its round staring eyes , its stiffly modeled right hand , uplifted , it might be , in reproof or exhortation , the ornate pastoral staff , and the emblem of the crossed keys that labeled the artist 's intent to portray the chief apostle .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 13]: Poor Joan had already conceived a violent dislike of the reputed Giotto .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 30]: It was no longing to complete her work that drove her , at the end , to the solemn cathedral , but the compelling need of confiding in Felix .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 17]: For it had come to this : she must fly from Delgratz at once and forever .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 11]: It chanced that morning that Alec had taken a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 46]: He appeared unexpectedly at breakfast and sat by Joan 's side , and his lover 's eyes had detected a pallor , a certain strained and wistful tension of the lips , signs of mental storm and stress that she hoped would not be noticeable .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 16]: `` Sweetheart , '' he whispered in quick alarm , `` you are not well .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 7]: You are feeling this wretched climate .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 20]: I am minded to throw sentiment aside and send my mother and you to the New Konak to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 22]: `` I am quite well , '' she said , with a forced composure that she felt did not deceive him .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 22]: It was necessary to invent some explanation , and she continued hurriedly , `` I did not sleep soundly last night .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 23]: Some wandering night bird flew in through my open window and startled me with its frantic efforts to escape from the room .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 4]: That is all .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 11]: After a little rest I shall be myself again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 44]: `` That gloomy old cathedral is not a healthy place , I am inclined to think , '' he said , scanning her face again with the anxious gaze of one who could not endure even a momentary eclipse of its bright vivacity .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 30]: `` You go there too often , and now that we know from whom your commission was received it is straining a point of etiquette to continue your work .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 36]: It will relieve any scruples you may have on that head if I tell you that I paid Monsieur Beliani yesterday every farthing of the money advanced to you by his agent in Paris . ''
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 12]: `` I am glad of that , '' she said simply .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 13]: `` I did not like the idea of being indebted to him .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 20]: Though he is a very clever man , I regard him as a good deal of a rogue . ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 21]: Alec was not to be switched off personal issues because Joan expressed her opinions in this matter of fact manner .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 20]: `` I am quite sure you are ill , or at any rate run down , '' he persisted .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 10]: `` What you need is a change of air .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 17]: I think I can allow myself a few hours ' respite from affairs of state to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 27]: What say you if the two of us drive to our country house this morning and find out for ourselves the progress made by the workmen ?
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 24]: I seem to remember that the contractor named a date , not far distant now , when the place would be habitable . ''
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 17]: `` There is nothing in the world that I should like better , '' said Joan .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 40]: Again Alec detected a strange undercurrent of emotion in her voice ; but he attributed it to the lack of sleep she had complained of , and with his customary tact forbore from pressing her for any further explanation .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 15]: They took their drive , and to all outward semblance Joan enjoyed it thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 16]: Her drooping spirits revived long before the last straggling houses of Delgratz were left behind .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 11]: She exhibited the keenest interest in the house and gardens .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 32]: Although their inspection did not end until the sun was high in the heavens , she insisted upon entering every room and traversing many of the paths in the spacious grounds .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 43]: She talked , too , with a fluency that in any other woman would have aroused a suspicion of effort ; but Alec was too glad that the marked depression of the morning had passed to give heed to her half-hysterical mood .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 42]: He entered with zest into her eager scrutiny of their future home , sought her advice on every little detail , and grew enthusiastic himself at the prospect of a speedy removal from the barnlike presidential palace to that leafy paradise .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 32]: He remembered afterward how Joan 's eyes dwelt longingly on an Italian garden that had always attracted her ; but it was impossible that he should read the farewell in them .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 26]: They returned to the city in time for luncheon ; then the King had to hurry away to try and overtake the day 's engagements .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 36]: His parting words were an injunction to Joan that she should not go out again during the hot hours , but endeavor to obtain the rest of which she had been deprived during the night .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 9]: `` Good-by , dear , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 31]: `` You may feel quite certain that when next we meet I shall be a different person altogether to the pallid creature whom you met at breakfast this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 12]: Alec was still conscious of some strange detachment in her words .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 44]: His earlier feeling that she was acting a part came back with renewed force ; but he again attributed it to the reaction that comes to highly strung natures after a surfeit of excitement in the midst of a new and difficult environment .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 16]: He kissed her tenderly , and Joan seemed to be on the verge of tears .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 13]: He was puzzled ; but thought it best to refrain from comment .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 5]: `` Poor girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 26]: `` She feels it hard to be surrounded by people who are all strangers , and mostly shut off by the barrier of language . ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 8]: But he was in no sense alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 27]: He left the palace convinced that a few hours of repose would bring back the color to her cheeks and the natural buoyancy to her manner .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 35]: Then he meant to chaff her about her distracted air ; for Joan was no neurotic subject , and she herself would be the first to laugh at the nervous fit of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 47]: Poluski , hard at work at his frescoes since an early hour , and grudgingly snatching a hasty meal at midday , was surprised when Joan came to him after the King 's departure and told him that she meant to finish her picture that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 37]: He made no comment , however , indeed he was glad of her company , and the two drove away together in the capacious closed carriage that brought them to and fro between cathedral and palace .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 16]: During their working hours , they refused to be hampered by the presence of servants .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 50]: An old Greek , who acted as caretaker , took charge of canvases , easels , paintboxes , and other utensils of the painter 's craft , and he came out gleefully from his lodge as soon as their vehicle rumbled under the deep arch of the outer porch .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 48]: Usually , Joan had a word and a smile for him , though the extent of her Greek conversation was a phrase or two learned from Felix ; but to-day she hardly seemed to see him , and lost not a moment in settling down to work .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 69]: She had not much to do ; in fact , so far as Felix took note of her action , after adjusting the canvas and mixing some colors on the palette , she sat idle for a long time , and even then occupied herself with an unnecessary deepening of tints in the picture , which already displayed an amazing resemblance to its stilted and highly colored prototype .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 28]: At last she spoke , and Felix , perched on a platform above her head , was almost startled by the sorrow laden cadence of her voice .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 15]: `` I did not really come here to-day to paint , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 13]: `` The picture is finished ; my work in Delgratz is ended .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 36]: You and Pauline are the only two people in the world whom I can trust , and I have brought you here , Felix , to tell you that I am leaving Delgratz to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 24]: The hunchback slid down from the little scaffolding he had constructed to enable him to survey the large area covered by the frescoes .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 14]: `` I suppose I have understood what you said , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 56]: `` It is impossible to focus one 's thoughts properly on the spoken word when a huge dome adds vibrations of its own , and I admit that I am invariably irritated myself when I state a remarkable fact with the utmost plainness and people pretend to be either deaf or dull of comprehension . ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 6]: That was Poluski 's way .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 16]: He never would take one seriously ; but Joan merely sighed and bent her head .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 9]: `` You say you are leaving Delgratz to-night !
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 6]: May one ask why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 11]: he went on , dropping his bantering manner at once .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 7]: `` No , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 10]: Felix bassooned a few deep notes between his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 15]: `` You have some good reason for telling me that , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 14]: he muttered , uttering the first words that occurred to his perplexed brain .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 16]: `` Yes , the very best of reasons , or at least the most convincing .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 29]: I can not remain here unless I marry Alec , and as I have absolutely determined not to marry him , it follows that I must go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 19]: `` Ah , you are willing to give some sort of reason , then , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 7]: `` At present I am muddled .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 17]: One grasps that unless you marry Alec you must go ; but why not marry Alec ?
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 14]: It sounds like a proposition of Euclid with the main clauses omitted . ''
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 15]: `` I am sorry , Felix , but I can not explain myself further .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 15]: You came to Delgratz with me ; will you return with me to Paris ?
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 25]: If not , will you at least promise to help me to get away and keep secret the fact that I am going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 15]: Felix grew round eyed with amazement ; but he managed to control his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 14]: `` You are asking a good deal , dear , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 9]: `` Do you know what you are doing ?
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 11]: Do you realize what your action will mean to Alec ?
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 4]: What has happened ?
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 5]: Some lover 's tiff .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 7]: That is unlike you , Joan .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 22]: If you run off in this fashion , you will be trying most deliberately to break poor Alec 's heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 28]: Joan uttered a queer little choking sob , yet recovered her self control with a rapidity that disconcerted Felix far more than she imagined at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 50]: `` He will suffer , I know , '' she murmured , `` and it does not console me to feel that in the end I shall suffer far more ; but I am going , Felix , whatsoever the cost , no matter whose heart may be broken .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 4]: Heaven help me !
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 12]: I must go , and I look to you for assistance .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 8]: Oh , my friend , my friend !
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 9]: I have only you in all the world .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 9]: Do not desert me in my need ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 39]: She had never before seen Felix really angry ; but even in the extremity of her distress she could not fail to note a strange glitter in the gray eyes now fixed on her in a fiery underlook .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 24]: The little man was deeply moved ; for once in his life he did not care how much he showed his resentment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 3]: _ Saperlotte !
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 5]: _ '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 7]: `` What has come to you ?
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 10]: Is it you who speak , or the devil ?
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 21]: You are possessed of a fiend , Joan , a fiend that is tempting you to do this wrong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 8]: Joan rose , pale faced and resolute .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 60]: Despite the flood of rage and despair that surged in Poluski 's quivering frame , she reminded him of a glimpse he caught of her in that last desperate moment when the door of the hotel was battered open by the insurgents and her mind was already fixed on death as a blessed relief from the horror of life .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 22]: `` I only ask you to believe in my unalterable purpose , '' she said with a calmness that stupefied him .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 30]: `` If no other means presents itself , I should wander out of the palace in the darkness and endeavor to reach Austria by the ferry across the Danube .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 34]: I believe there are difficulties for the stranger if one goes that way ; but again I throw myself on your mercy , Felix , and appeal to you for guidance and help .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 6]: This is my worst hour .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 13]: If you fail me now , I shall indeed be wretched . ''
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 17]: Felix leaned against an upright of the scaffolding and passed a trembling hand over his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 13]: `` Forgive me , Joan , if I have spoken harshly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 17]: he muttered in the dubious voice of a man who hardly knows what he is saying .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 7]: `` There is nothing to forgive .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 20]: It is I , rather , who should seek forgiveness from you for imposing this cruel test of friendship .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 8]: But what can I do , Felix ?
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 23]: I am a woman and alone , and , when I think of what lies before me , I am afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 8]: With a great effort he steadied himself .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 28]: Placing both hands on the girl 's shoulders , he turned her face to the light that fell from a small rose window in a side aisle .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 21]: In silence he looked at her , seeking to wring the secret of this madness from her steadfast eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 23]: _ Ma belle _ , '' he cried suddenly , `` I am beginning to believe that you are in earnest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 33]: `` No matter how many years it may please God to leave me on earth , I shall never be more resolved on anything than on my departure from Delgratz to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 20]: `` You place trust in me , you say in one breath , yet you deny it in another .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 20]: Tell me then , Joan , what is the obstacle that has arisen to prevent you from marrying Alec ?
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 6]: It all hinges on that .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 8]: Who has been lying to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 10]: She could not continue to meet his accusing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 15]: It seemed to her that if he urged her more her heart would burst .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 30]: Yielding to the impulse of the hunted animal , she wrenched herself free and turned to run somewhere , anywhere , so that she might avoid his merciless inquisition .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 24]: A harsh laugh fell on her ears , and nothing more effective to put a stop to her flight could have been devised .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 7]: `` Name of a name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 11]: he roared , `` shall we not take our pictures ?
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 20]: If we are false to all else , let us at least be true to our harmless daubs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 17]: The taunt was undeserved and glanced unheeded from the shield of the girl 's utter misery .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 16]: Perhaps because that was so , the Pole 's next words were tender and soothing .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 28]: `` Come , then , my Joan , '' he growled , `` never shall it be said against me that I deserted a comrade in distress .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 8]: I hoped to see you happily wedded .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 27]: It was my fantasy that Alec and you would inaugurate a new line of monarchs and thus bring about the social revolution from an unexpected quarter .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 5]: But I was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 3]: Holy blue !
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 20]: never was man so led astray since Eve strolled into the wrong orchard and brought Adam with her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 8]: By this time he had caught her .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 26]: He held her arm , and began to stroke one of her hands softly as if she had shown symptoms of falling in a faint .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 31]: `` We will go , _ mignonne _ , '' he soothed her , `` you and I , and none here shall know till we have crossed the frontier .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 27]: Not even then will they guess what has become of us , unless you find it in your heart to leave some little word for Alec .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 5]: You will do that ?
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 23]: You will save him from despair , from the torture of doubt -- '' `` Oh , Felix , spare me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 4]: she sobbed convulsively .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 14]: `` But one must look squarely at the facts , _ mignonne _ .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 23]: If you run away and give no sign , it can only be supposed that you have met with some evil fate .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 50]: There are others than Alec who will think that disaster has befallen you , and they will have uneasy souls , and Alec will look into their guilty faces with the eyes of a wrathful lover , which at such times can be superhuman , terrible , heart piercing .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 35]: There is no knowing whose blood will stain his hands then ; for he will accept from no one but yourself the assurance that you have left him of your own free will . ''
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 14]: `` That , at least , is true , '' she said wearily .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 19]: `` I shall write a letter which must be given to him when I am gone . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 4]: _ Grand Dieu !
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 10]: _ what a resolute will is yours , Joan !
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 6]: Have you counted the cost ?
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 54]: Leave Alec out of it ; but do you think his hog of a father , his easily swayed mother , Stampoff , the short sighted and patriotic , or that scheming Greek and his puppet Marulitch , will gain the ends for which , between them , they have contrived your flight ?
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 20]: Do you know Alec so little as to believe that he will leave the field clear to that crew ?
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 15]: Why , dear heart , he will sweep them aside like an angry god !
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 25]: They have bewitched your brain with some tale of the evil that will accrue to the King if he weds the woman he loves .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 16]: If that is all , it is a fiction fit only to frighten a child .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 5]: Hear me , Joan !
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 32]: You are not helping Alec by tearing yourself away from Delgratz ; but condemning to the deepest hell not him alone but some millions of people who have done no wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 22]: They gave their honest affections to this boy , because he strikes their imagination as a King sent straight from Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 15]: It is a vile plot , dear heart , to drive Alec from Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 14]: How can you , of all women , lend yourself to it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 32]: Felix could not guess how his words lacerated the unhappy girl 's soul ; but she did not falter in her purpose , and again endeavored to rush from the church .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 9]: Poluski uttered a queer click with his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 11]: It testified that he had done his uttermost and failed .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 8]: `` Be it so , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 9]: `` Help me to pack up these masterpieces .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 22]: I can plan and scheme with any man living ; but I can not cope with heavy parcels of holiness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 14]: Joan , distraught though she was , felt that he had given way .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 16]: Without another word she assisted in packing the carriage with their canvases and other belongings .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 24]: The old Greek caretaker hobbled after them when he saw that they were going without depositing their paraphernalia in the lodge as usual .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 27]: `` You will come back some day and copy another picture , I hope , Excellency , '' he cried , doffing his cap to Joan .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 17]: She opened her purse , since she did not understand what the old man was saying .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 11]: `` No , no , Excellency , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 15]: `` The King himself told me you were not to be pestered by beggars .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 35]: I have threatened to crack the skulls of one or two who persisted in annoying you , and it would ill become me to take a reward for doing what the King ordered . ''
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 11]: `` He will not accept anything , '' said Felix .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 22]: `` I may not tell you what else he said , since he only put my arguments in simpler words . ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 39]: He shot a quick look at her , hoping to find some slight sign of weakening ; but her marble face wore the expression of one who has suffered so greatly that the capacity for suffering is exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 9]: From that instant Felix urged her no more .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 42]: He obeyed her without question or protest , contriving matters so that when she quitted the palace , deeply veiled , to walk to the station , the soldiers on guard imagined she was a serving maid going into the town .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 46]: Pauline , though prepared to be faithful at any hazard , wept when she was told that she must stay in Delgratz and face the storm that would rage when she delivered into the King 's own hand the letter Joan intrusted to her care .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 29]: But even Pauline herself realized that if her mistress was to escape from Delgratz unnoticed , she , the maid , must remain there till the following day .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 54]: By that time there would be no reason why Joan 's maid should not leave openly for the west , and the Frenchwoman was only too thankful at the prospect of a speedy exit from `` this city of brigands '' to protest too strenuously against the rôle thrust upon her by Felix .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 15]: As events unrolled themselves , the two travelers encountered no difficulty in leaving Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 24]: It will be remembered that Beliani 's foresight had provided them with return tickets to Paris , and this circumstance aided them greatly .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 44]: In those closely guarded lands where keen eyed scrutineers keep watch and ward over a frontier , the production of the return half of a ticket issued in the same city as a passport at once lulls any doubt that might arise otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 42]: Moreover , Joan and Felix occupied separate carriages , and the Belgrade officials , concerned only with the examination of tickets , gave no heed to them , though one man seemed to recognize Felix and grinned in a friendly way .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 21]: Passport formalities did not trouble them till the train had crossed the Tave River and was already in Austrian territory .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 9]: The frontier officers could not possibly know them .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 13]: Their papers were in order , and received only a passing glance .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 28]: Even Joan , adrift in a sea of trouble , saw that it was a far easier matter to leave the Balkan area than to enter it .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 19]: They arranged to meet in the dining saloon , when all necessity for further precaution would have disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 11]: Felix was astounded at the self possession Joan now displayed .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 7]: She was pale but quite calm .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 11]: Her eyes were clear and showed no traces of grief .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 27]: Even her very manner was reverting to that good humored tone of frank camaraderie that the unavoidable ceremoniousness of the last fortnight had kept in subjection .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 63]: Felix was secretly amazed at these things ; but in the depths of his own complex nature were hidden away , wholly unknown to the little hunchback himself , certain feminine characteristics which enabled him dimly to understand that the woman who suffers most is she who has the strength and the courage to carry her head most proudly before the storm .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 48]: `` Well , '' said he when the mail train had left Semlin far behind and they were speeding northward through the night to Budapest , -- `` well , Joan , now that the severance is complete , do you still refuse me your confidence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 11]: Her luminous eyes dwelt on his with a sad smile .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 20]: She had closed the gates of her paradise , and there was to be no faint hearted looking backward .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 14]: `` No , '' she said , `` I have attained my end .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 26]: It is due to you , my friend , that I should tell you why I have abandoned the only man I shall ever love .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 28]: It lay with me to choose between his success or failure ; perhaps there rested on my frail shoulders the more dreadful issues of life and death .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 20]: If I had married Alec , I should have pulled him down to ruin , even to the grave .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 20]: What else would you have me do but save him , no matter what the cost to myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 12]: He propped his chin on his hands and surveyed her quizzically .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 26]: Felix , despite his protests , was not enamoured of Delgratz , and his mercurial temperament rejoiced in the near approach of his beloved Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 13]: `` All this sounds heroic and therefore unconvincing , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 53]: `` I do not want to condemn your motives before I know them , Joan ; but I hope you will allow me to criticize false sentiment , '' he added , seeing the expression of pain that for an instant mastered her stoicism and threw its dull shadow across her face .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 13]: `` Say what pleases you , Felix , '' she replied gently .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 12]: `` I shall not suffer more than I have already endured .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 19]: I think I am benumbed now ; but at least I am sure that I have acted right .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 15]: There were influences at work in Delgratz of which even you had no cognizance .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 17]: Popular as Alec seemed to be , every prejudice of the Serb was arrayed against him .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 27]: He appealed to the imagination of the people as a brave and gallant figure ; but he is and will ever remain a foreigner among them .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 32]: They are a race apart , and Alec is not of them , and it would have been a fatal error to give them as a Queen another foreigner like himself .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 9]: `` Alone , he will win his way .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 36]: In the course of years he can not fail to identify himself more and more with their interests ; he will -- some day -- marry a Princess of the blood to which he belongs .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 31]: That will help Kosnovia to forget that he was neither born nor bred in the country , and the presence of a Serbian consort will tend to consolidate his reign .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 17]: It would have been quite different if he and I were married within a few weeks .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 41]: Those who are opposed to him -- and they are far more numerous than you may guess at this moment -- would have been given a most powerful argument by the refusal of the Greek archimandrite to perform the ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 43]: You see , Alec himself is not a member of the national church , nor am I , and a drawback that may be overlooked when a Slav Princess becomes Queen of Kosnovia would have been a fatal thing for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 17]: Poluski could not but admire Joan 's splendid detachment in speaking of Alec 's hypothetical wife .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 9]: His thin lips creased in a satirical grin .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 15]: `` Is that it , '' said he , `` the everlasting religious difficulty ?
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 27]: No , my belle , tell that to the marines , or , at any rate , to some guileless person not versed in Kosnovian history !
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 40]: There never yet was bloodstained conqueror or evil living Prince in that unhappy city of Delgratz who failed to obtain the sanction of orthodoxy for his worst deeds , whether in beheading a rival or divorcing a wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 3]: Joan hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 36]: She was obviously choosing her words ; but the burden laid upon her was too great for the hour to prevent her from adopting a subterfuge that would surely be detected by her shrewd companion .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 24]: `` I do not wish to lay too much stress upon that particular phase of the matter , '' she said at last .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 8]: `` It was only one of many .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 59]: In itself it might have been surmounted ; but when the church , a large section of the army , and nearly all the higher officials of the State are ready to combine against Alec 's uncompromising sincerity of purpose , it was asking too much of me knowingly to provide the special excuse for his downfall . ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 27]: There was silence for a little while , and Poluski 's keen gray eyes still dwelt searchingly on the girl 's sorrow laden though resigned features .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 21]: She did not flinch from the scrutiny , and there was a certain sadness in the Pole 's next comment .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 44]: `` What you say , _ ma petite _ , sounds very like the dry-as-dust utterances of some podgy Minister of State ; they are far from being the words of a woman who loves , and so they are not yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 13]: `` Perhaps you are right , Felix , '' she said wearily .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 27]: `` Perhaps , had I told Alec these things , he might have silenced my doubts and persuaded me to dare everything for his sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 11]: `` Yet , knowing this , you are here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 19]: he cried , his conscience stinging him at the memory of that forsaken King mourning his lost bride .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 13]: `` Yes , and no consideration would induce me to return . ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 16]: `` Ah , then there is something that you have not yet told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 12]: `` Yes , and it can never be told , Felix .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 10]: Be content , my friend , with that assurance .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 15]: There is nothing that can happen which has the power to change my decision .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 11]: Heaven help me , I can never marry Alec ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 10]: `` The true cause must remain a secret ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 7]: `` A woman 's secret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 7]: `` Yes , my secret . ''
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 4]: His eyes sparkled .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 33]: He bent nearer and sank his voice to a deep whisper , for there were others in the carriage , and that which he had to say must reach her ears only .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 6]: `` Not yours , Joan .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 4]: Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 3]: Not yours .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 4]: Another woman 's .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 10]: Blind that I was -- now I have it !
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 9]: So that is why you are running away .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 13]: They threatened to drag Alec headlong from the throne unless you agreed .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 11]: My poor girl , you might have told me sooner .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 25]: The knowledge has been here , lurking in the back of my head for years ; but I never gave a thought to it .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 4]: Why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 9]: Who would have dreamed of such a tragicomedy ?
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 34]: Joan , to-day in the cathedral I could have bound you with ropes if that would have served to keep you in Delgratz ; but now I kiss the hem of your dress .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 15]: My poor girl , my own dear Joan , how you must have suffered !
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 12]: Yet I envy you -- I do , on my soul !
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 9]: Life becomes ennobled by actions such as yours .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 12]: And Alec must never know what you have done for him .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 11]: That is both the grandeur and the pathos of it .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 38]: Joan , my precious , your namesake was burnt on the pyre for a King 's cause , yet her deed would rank no higher than yours if the world might be allowed to judge between you .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 10]: But do not dream that your romance is ended .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 3]: _ Saperlotte !
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 11]: _ Old Dame Nature is a better dramatist than that .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 23]: If she has contrived so much for you in a little month , what can she not accomplish in a year ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 26]: And , in a perfect frenzy of excitement , he threw himself back in his chair and amazed another group of cosmopolitan diners by singing .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 12]: But this time Joan did not care who stared or whispered .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 35]: She sat there , a beautiful statue , sorely stricken , and not daring to believe that the hour of blessedness promised in Poluski 's song would be vouchsafed after many years of pain .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 19]: CHAPTER XII THE STORM BREAKS The King reached his temporary residence hot and tired after an exhausting day .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 33]: It chanced that at a meeting of the Ministry , which he attended late in the afternoon , the question of Beliani 's appointment as Minister of Finance came up for settlement .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 26]: It was not determined without some bickering , and an undercurrent of dislike if not of positive hatred of the man quickly made itself apparent .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 10]: The Serb and the Greek differ in most essentials .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 86]: The one is by habit and training a good soldier , a proverbial idler , an easygoing optimist endowed with genial temper and a happy-go-lucky nature , capable indeed of extremes , yet mostly inclined to the tolerant indifference that leaves things as they are ; the other , whose martial qualities have vanished in the melting pot of time , has developed the defensive traits that come to the aid of all races who can no longer maintain their cause in the tented field .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 9]: The Greek is the usurer of the East .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 48]: He wins his way by using his subtle wits , and the less adroit people on whom he preys soon learn to regard him with distrust that often culminates in personal violence in those half-civilized communities where law and order are not maintained with a heavy hand .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 28]: The Kosnovian Ministry , of course , consisted of men of a much higher type than the rude peasantry that made up the bulk of the nation .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 27]: But at heart they were anti-Greek , and some among them retained lively memories of Beliani 's methods when he was in power a decade earlier .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 20]: No one disputed his ability , yet none , save the King , had a good word for him .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 28]: It was recognized , however , that under the new dominion his opportunities for peculation at the expense of the public would be few and far between .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 3]: Alexis III .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 12]: had already made his influence felt in each department of State .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 30]: He was ready to listen to every man 's grievances , and to adjust them if possible ; he held the scales evenly between the bureaucracy and the people .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 64]: The official element knew full well that it had nothing to fear from the King 's anger if a disputed action could be justified , while those traders and others who had occasion to deal with any of the great departments were beginning to understand that they need not dread the vengeance of an executive against whose exactions they had cause to complain .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 16]: After some discussion , therefore , a guarded sanction was given to Beliani 's appointment .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 49]: It was probable that each man in the Council had already been approached in the Greek 's behalf , and that the protests uttered were rather by way of safety valves in view of possible criticism in the future than intended to exclude this dreaded candidate from office .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 38]: The matter might have ended there for the moment had not the President of the Assembly given a somewhat maladroit twist to the discussion when the King mentioned Beliani 's efforts with regard to an Austrian loan .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 16]: `` That , at least , we should oppose most bitterly , '' said Nesimir .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 15]: `` We of the Balkans should never accept favors from the hand of Austria .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 20]: Our true ally is Russia , and any outside aid received by Kosnovia should come from Russia alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 14]: Alec had learned the value of patience with mediocrities such as Sergius Nesimir .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 6]: He never argued with them .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 34]: He contented himself with pointing out the facts , and left the rest to time ; for he had soon discovered that the weak man talks himself into agreement with the strong one .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 23]: `` I would remind you that in this matter we are merely entering into an ordinary business arrangement , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 12]: `` I have heard of no concessions attached to the loan .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 33]: We are merely going into the money market like any other borrower , and will undertake to pay such reasonable interest as the lenders deem compatible with the security we offer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 20]: `` I think your Majesty will find that Austria will impose her own terms , '' persisted the President .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 12]: `` Why do you harp on Austria in this connection ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 4]: asked the King .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 8]: `` Monsieur Beliani spoke of Viennese bankers .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 5]: They are not Austria .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 16]: This loan is not so much a matter of State as of sound finance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 58]: `` I hope your Majesty is right in that assumption , '' was the stubborn answer ; `` but I have reason to believe that , under certain contingencies , not only would Russia assist us in this respect , but she would at once take steps toward recognizing your Majesty 's accession to the throne . ''
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 4]: `` Contingencies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 12]: cried Alec , forced for the nonce to maintain the discussion .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 5]: `` What are they ?
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 15]: What is the difference between your suspected Austrian terms and your Russian contingencies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 35]: `` In the first place , your Majesty , Russia is anxious to consolidate the good feeling that exists among the Slav nations by following a settled policy in the matter of railway communication .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 31]: Your Majesty 's own projects favor the Russian proposals , whereas Austria will surely stipulate that any money of hers expended on railways shall be devoted to her rival plans .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 21]: In the second -- '' The President paused and looked round among his colleagues as though to seek their encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 17]: He knew he was about to utter words of daring significance , and his nerve failed .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 8]: An appreciative murmur ran through the room .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 12]: It seemed to give the stout President a degree of confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 22]: said the King , who noted the glance and the hum of approval , and wondered what lay behind it all .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 30]: `` The really vital question before us to-day is your Majesty 's marriage , '' exclaimed the other , paling somewhat , now that the fateful topic was broached .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 12]: `` I agree with you , '' said Alec , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 32]: `` Its importance to myself is self evident ; but I fail utterly to see how the appearance of a Queen in Delgratz will affect our political relations with our neighbors .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 19]: I do not propose to borrow money from Austria to pay for my wife 's wedding presents . ''
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 6]: Nesimir was long in answering .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 39]: He seemed to be waiting for some other member of the Council to take part in the discussion ; but each man sat silent and embarrassed , and it was incumbent on their leader to declare himself anew .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 60]: `` It is far from my thoughts to wish to give any offense to your Majesty ; but I am constrained to tell you , '' he said , `` that there is a growing sentiment among all classes of your subjects that when you look for a consort you should seek her among our kith and kin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 25]: `` Am I to understand , then , that the lady whom I am about to marry has not found favor among you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 25]: Alec spoke quietly ; but there was a ring of steel in his voice that might have warned a bolder man than the President .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 18]: His stern glance traveled round the Council table ; but he saw only downcast and somber faces .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 14]: One thing was abundantly clear , -- this attack on Joan was premeditated .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 7]: He wondered who had contrived it .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 35]: `` It is not that the lady does not command our favor , '' declared the spokesman , very pale now and drumming nervously with his fingers on the edge of a blotting pad .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 40]: `` Those of us who have met her are charmed with her manners and appearance , and our only regret is that Providence did not ordain that her birthplace should be on the right side of the Danube . ''
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 28]: `` Oddly enough , I was born in New York , '' interrupted Alec , with a touch of sarcasm that was not lost on his hearers .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 57]: `` Your Majesty was born a Delgrado , '' said the President , `` and if Miss Joan Vernon could claim even the remotest family connection with one of the leading houses of Kosnovia , Montenegro , or even Bulgaria , every man here would hail your Majesty 's choice in a chorus of approval . ''
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 19]: `` Since when has the supposed drawback of my intended wife 's nationality come into such prominence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 5]: demanded the King sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 30]: `` Since it became known that your Majesty meant to marry a lady whose avowed object in coming to Delgratz was to follow her occupation as an artist . ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 25]: Stampoff 's harsh accents broke in roughly on a discussion which had hitherto been marked by polite deference on the part of its originator .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 9]: are you too against me , General ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 24]: cried Alec , wheeling round and meeting the fierce eyes of the old patriot who sat glaring at him across the Council table .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 13]: `` Yes , in that matter , '' was the uncompromising answer .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 44]: `` We feel that our King must be one of ourselves , and he can never be that if his wife differs from us in race , in language , in religion , in everything that knits a ruler to his subjects . ''
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 8]: Alec arose with a good natured laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 32]: `` Monsieur Nesimir spoke of contingencies , '' he said , `` and the word seems to imply that counter proposals to those of Monsieur Beliani have already been put forward .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 23]: Has the Russian Ambassador been conducting negotiations with my Ministers without my knowledge -- behind my back , as it were ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 13]: `` There is no taint of Muscovite intrigue about my attitude ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 13]: exclaimed Stampoff with a vehemence that showed how deeply he was moved .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 29]: `` I have given the best years of my life to my country , and I am too old now to be forced to act against my principles .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 20]: Every man in this room is a Slav , and we Slavs must pull together or we are lost .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 42]: I , at any rate , am not afraid to register an emphatic protest against my King 's marriage with a lady , no matter how estimable personally , whose presence in Delgratz as our Queen would be a national calamity .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 16]: If I speak strongly , it is because I feel so strongly in this matter .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 16]: The rulers of States such as ours can not afford to be swayed by sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 17]: When your Majesty weds , you ought to choose your wife among the Princesses of Montenegro .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 24]: Had I the slightest inkling of any other design on your part , I should have stipulated this before we left Paris . ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 26]: `` Ah , '' said Alec thoughtfully , `` it is too late now , General , to talk of stipulations that were not made .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 16]: And , indeed , one might reasonably ask who empowered you to make them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 5]: `` God 's bones !
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 10]: who should speak for Kosnovia if not I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 47]: `` Your patriotism has never been questioned , General , '' said Alec with a friendly smile ; but Stampoff was not to be placated , being of the fiery type of reformer who refuses to listen to any opinion that runs counter to his own .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 8]: He too rose and faced the Council .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 8]: `` What has palsied your tongues ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 15]: `` You were all ready enough to declare your convictions before the King arrived .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 5]: He is here now .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 18]: Tell him , then , do you approve of his proposed marriage -- yes or no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 4]: Heads were shaken .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 7]: A few cried `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 17]: Alec saw clearly that he could not count on the support of one among those present .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 7]: He did not shirk the issue .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 13]: He determined that it should be dealt with at once if possible .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 14]: If not , he had already decided on his own line of action .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 93]: `` I am sorry that in such a matter , affecting , as it does , the whole of my future life , '' he said , `` I should be so completely at variance with what is evidently the common view of my trusted friends in this Council ; but I can not forget that , for good or ill , I am King of Kosnovia , while you may rest assured , gentlemen , that no consideration you can urge will prevent me from marrying the lady of my choice .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 15]: Of course , it is conceivable that my kingship and my marriage may clash .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 25]: In that event I shall take the consequences of my action ; I must even justify myself to the Assembly , if need be .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 22]: It is well that the President should have made me acquainted with the views you all hold with such apparent unanimity .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 13]: It is also well that you should be aware of my decision .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 22]: Very often , when men think they have reached absolute disagreement , a way opens itself unexpectedly whereby the difficulties vanish .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 28]: In this instance , certainly , it is hard to see how any solution of our dispute can be attained that shall satisfy both you and me .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 12]: `` I shall marry Miss Vernon , probably within a fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 29]: I shall marry her , gentlemen , even though it costs me my throne ; but I would remind you that we in this room are not Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 10]: Let us keep our heads and guard our tempers .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 21]: If an appeal is to be made to the nation , let it be by votes rather than by swords .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 39]: I have never deviated from my fixed principle that I would sooner pass the remainder of my life poor and unknown than obtain an hour 's extension of my rule by spilling the blood of an unoffending people .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 16]: But I ask from you the same concession that I am willing to make myself .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 11]: Until deposed , I retain the privilege of a King .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 13]: Is this matter to be regarded as a test of ministerial confidence ?
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 9]: Do all you gentlemen resign your portfolios ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 12]: The President , agitated and stuttering , sprang to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 20]: `` For my part , '' he declared , `` I expressed my views in an informal manner . ''
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 10]: `` Yes , yes , '' agreed several voices .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 17]: The turn given to the discussion by Alec was quite unforeseen and far from their liking .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 25]: `` It has ever been your Majesty 's wish that we should state our opinions fully and freely , '' continued the agitated Nesimir .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 24]: `` I , for one , was only anxious to make known to you the sentiments that obtain currency in my own circle .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 5]: I may be wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 10]: Delgratz is not Kosnovia -- '' `` Rubbish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 11]: shouted Stampoff , hammering the table with a clenched fist .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 20]: `` That which has been said here to-day will be heard openly in the streets of the capital to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 24]: To-morrow it will be preached far and wide throughout the confines of the country by every man who has its welfare at heart .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 10]: This marriage must not take place , I say !
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 22]: I came here from exile with the King and was prepared to give my life to establish him on the throne .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 30]: I am prepared now to offer the same poor sacrifice if it will save my beloved land from a catastrophe -- and this proposed mesalliance is nothing less ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 7]: A curious thrill convulsed the Council .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 39]: Every Serb there was stirred by the General 's bold avowal ; but Alec stilled the rising storm by a calm announcement : `` I suggest that we defer this discussion till to-morrow morning , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 39]: `` It has found me unprepared , and , if I am not very much mistaken , many of the gentlemen here did not anticipate that the question would be raised to-day in its present acute form . ''
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 38]: It was evident that the majority of ministers favored the adoption of the King 's proposal ; but Stampoff scowled at them angrily and drowned their timorous agreement by his resentful cry : `` God 's bones !
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 6]: Why wait till to-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 10]: Then , indeed , Alec was stung beyond endurance .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 29]: `` Perhaps , in the circumstances , General , '' he said , `` it would be advisable that you should absent yourself from to-morrow 's Council . ''
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 10]: `` Not while I am Minister for War ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 5]: came the fiery response .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 13]: `` That is for you to decide , '' said the King .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 6]: `` Then I decide now !
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 4]: I resign ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 3]: `` Excellent !
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 30]: By that means you salve your conscience ; whereas I hope still to retain the friendship of Kosnovia 's most faithful son by refusing to accept your resignation . ''
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 22]: A shout of applause drowned Stampoff 's vehement protest , and Alec seized the opportunity to hurry from the Council chamber .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 44]: He did not try to conceal from himself the serious nature of this unexpected crisis , though he was far from acknowledging that the people at large attached such significance to his wife 's nationality as Stampoff and the others professed to believe .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 21]: Puzzle his wits as he might , and did , he failed utterly to account for Stampoff 's uncompromising tone .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 11]: The old Serb and he were the best of friends .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 21]: He had taken no single step without first consulting the man who had been his political tutor since his boyhood .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 34]: Even when he ran counter to Stampoff 's advice , he had always listened to it eagerly , and he invariably took the utmost pains to show why he had adopted another course .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 15]: Till that day there had never been the shadow of a breach between them .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 15]: How , then , was the War Minister 's irreconcilable attitude to be explained ?
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 11]: Was Cousin Julius pulling the strings in some unrecognized manner ?
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 8]: Was Beliani a party to the scheme ?
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 9]: These questions must be answered , and speedily .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 25]: Meanwhile , by hook or by crook , he must keep all knowledge of the dispute from Joan 's ears until after the wedding .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 20]: In the palace courtyard a man standing near the gates tried to pass the sentries when the King arrived .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 5]: He was instantly collared .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 30]: Undersized , poorly clad , and poverty stricken in appearance , he was hustled unmercifully by a stalwart Albanian policeman until Alec 's attention was drawn to the scuffle .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 23]: A white despairing face became visible for a moment , and a choking voice cried , `` Save me , your Majesty !
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 6]: I am John Sobieski ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 4]: `` Sobieski ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 12]: thought Alec , ordering his carriage to stop and alighting quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 18]: `` That is the Polish hotel waiter of whom Felix spoke to me some few days ago .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 34]: He said the man had done his best to bring assistance ; but his efforts were frustrated by some stupid blunder here , and he thought something ought to be done for him .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 15]: I promised to attend to it ; but the thing slipped my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 25]: By this time he had reached the policeman , who , assisted by a soldier , was dragging the protesting waiter to the guardroom .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 6]: `` Release that man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 16]: The man saluted , and the trembling Sobieski fell on his knees on the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 23]: `` Oh , get up , '' said the King , who felt a special aversion to such a display of abasement .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 15]: `` Recover your wits , man , and tell me what you want ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 14]: `` I ask protection , your Majesty , '' murmured the desperate Sobieski .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 7]: `` My life is in danger .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 18]: I came here to see Monsieur Poluski ; but they told me he was not at home .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 16]: I have been turned out of my situation ; so I have nowhere to go .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 16]: If I am found wandering in the streets to-night , I shall be killed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 20]: `` At any rate , you seem to be thoroughly frightened , '' cried Alec with a reassuring smile .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 26]: `` Take charge of him , '' he said to the pandur , `` and have him sent to my bureau in five minutes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 36]: The bureau in question was that apartment on the first floor overlooking the courtyard , in which Alec had preferred his claim to the throne of Kosnovia to the perplexed President of the embryo Republic .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 47]: It was there , too , that Felix Poluski had spoken those plain words to Prince Michael Delgrado , and its situation was so convenient for the King 's daily comings and goings that he had utilized it temporarily as an office and private audience chamber .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 20]: At the top of the stairs he happened to catch sight of Pauline , Joan 's staid looking maid .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 45]: Though he obtained only a casual glimpse of her , he fancied that she was distressed about something , and it occurred to him after he was in the room and the door was closed that perhaps she wished to give him a message .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 33]: Bosko , the taciturn Albanian whom he had now definitely appointed as his confidential attendant , was standing near the table with a bundle of documents that demanded the King 's signature .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 53]: Realizing that the Frenchwoman would meet Bosko in a minute or two when he went out with the signed papers , and could then make known her wish to speak to the King if such was her intention , Alec bent over the table and began to peruse several departmental decrees hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 37]: He made it a rule never to append his name to any State paper without mastering its contents , and one of the palace guards brought in Sobieski before Alec had concluded his self imposed task .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 44]: As it happened , the various items were mere formalities , and when he wrote `` Alexis R. '' for the last time , Bosko and the soldier left the room , and the frightened little Pole found himself alone with the King .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 22]: `` Now , '' said Alec kindly , `` tell me what you want and why you are so afraid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 9]: Sobieski at once plunged into a rambling statement .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 26]: He spoke the Kosnovian language with the fluent inaccuracy of his class ; but Alec 's alert ears had no difficulty in following his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 64]: His story was that several customers of the café had denounced him to the proprietor as a spy in the King 's service , while some of them went so far as to charge him with responsibility for the deaths of those thirty-one heroes of the Seventh Regiment whose bodies had been found on the stairs and first floor landing of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 27]: His master had no option but to discharge him , and Sobieski felt that he had good reason to fear that his life was in danger .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 19]: Alec pooh-poohed the notion ; but the timid little waiter was so woebegone that the King pitied him .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 18]: `` Tell me exactly what you did on the day of the revolt , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 8]: `` You came here , I understand .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 11]: How was it that no one listened to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 13]: `` Oh , they did , your Majesty , '' protested Sobieski .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 19]: `` Your Majesty 's own father brought me into the hall and kept me there nearly five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 25]: He did not believe a word I said , and was very angry with me for bringing such an alarming story to the palace .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 34]: At last , by good fortune , Monsieur Nesimir appeared ; but even then I should have been taken away in custody if Monsieur Poluski had not caused me to be released . ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 15]: Despite its sinister significance , Alec could not choose but credit this amazing statement .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 41]: He wondered why Felix had not told him the facts in detail afterward ; but he knew that the hunchback 's mind worked in strange grooves , and it was probable that his silence was dictated by some powerful motive .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 54]: In any event , the incident was an unpleasant reminder of certain nebulous doubts that he had striven to crush , and it was better that this scared rabbit of a man should not remain in Delgratz and become the victim of some vendetta which might bring the whole odd story into prominence .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 13]: `` You want to leave the city , I take it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 20]: said he after a thoughtful pause , in which he took a slow turn up and down the room .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 12]: `` I dare not remain here any longer , your Majesty .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 22]: I came to-night to ask Monsieur Poluski to be good enough to give me money to take me to Warsaw . ''
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 27]: `` I think , '' said Alec , smiling , `` he promised you , in my name , the wherewithal to buy a café . ''
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 18]: `` I fear I did not earn my reward , your Majesty , '' stuttered the other .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 8]: `` Are cafés dear in Warsaw ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 18]: said the King , unlocking a drawer and producing roubles to the equivalent of five hundred dollars .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 14]: `` Here , this sum should give you a fresh start in life .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 22]: All I ask in return is that you shall keep a still tongue about your recent share in local events . ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 55]: Poor Sobieski 's gratitude grew incoherent , especially when the King handed him over to the care of the attendant who had brought him to the bureau , with instructions that he was to be taken to the railway station and safeguarded there till the departure of the next train that crossed the frontier .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 10]: By that time the dinner hour was long past .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 44]: Alec was disinclined for a heavy meal ; so he went to his private suite , where he changed his clothes , contenting himself with some sandwiches , which he ate in a hurry and washed down with a glass of red wine .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 13]: Coming down stairs about an hour later , he passed the smoking-room .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 16]: The door was open , and he saw that the men had already ended dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 61]: He was about to enter the music salon , to which his mother and Joan usually retired with the President 's wife and daughter , when he met Pauline for the second time , and the Frenchwoman now approached him with the same marked nervousness in her demeanor that he had noticed when he saw her standing in the lobby .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 13]: `` May I have a word with your Majesty in private ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 17]: He was surprised ; but again he believed she was probably bringing a message from Joan .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 9]: He threw open the door of his office .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 9]: `` Come in here , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 14]: She held out a letter , and he saw that her hand shook .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 16]: `` Mademoiselle asked me to give you this , your Majesty , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 16]: `` I was to take care that you were alone when you received it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 12]: `` Something important then , '' he said with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 70]: Crossing the room to the table on which stood the lamp by whose light he had scribbled `` Alexis R. '' on the papers intrusted to Bosko , he opened the envelop , which bore in Joan 's handwriting the simple superscription , `` Alec , '' and began to read : MY DEAR ONE : -- When Pauline gives you this , I shall have left you forever .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 14]: I am going from Delgratz , and I shall never see you again .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 23]: I can not marry you -- but oh , my dear , my dear , I shall love you all my life !
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 5]: Try and forget me .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 7]: I am acting for the best .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 11]: Do not write to Paris or endeavor to find me .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 13]: If it is God 's will , we shall never meet again .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 12]: I can scarcely see what I am writing for my tears .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 6]: So good-by , my Alec !
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 3]: Be brave !
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 21]: Forgive me , and , in the years to come , try to forget our few days of happiness together .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 5]: Yours ever , JOAN .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 25]: He stood there stricken , almost paralyzed with the suddenness of the blow , wondering dumbly why Joan 's hand should have inflicted it .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 9]: The frightened Frenchwoman dared not speak or move .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 27]: She watched him with that impersonal fear so readily aroused in one of her class by the terrifying spectacle of a strong man in his agony .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 18]: At last he moved listlessly , as though his limbs had just been released from the rack .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 19]: He held the letter under the lamp again and read it a second time , word for word .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 12]: He seemed to be forcing himself to accept it as truth .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 30]: This young King , so valiant , so resourceful , so prompt in action and judgment , could devise no plan , no means of rescue from the abyss .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 25]: After an interval that neither the man nor the woman could measure , he turned his strained , staring eyes on the shrinking Pauline .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 10]: `` Have I ever done you any harm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 10]: he said in the low voice of utmost despair .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 6]: `` Me , monsieur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 5]: `` You harm me ?
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 22]: No , indeed , I was only too proud to think my dear mistress should have won such a husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 32]: `` Then you will answer my questions truly , '' he went on , his eyes devouring the woman 's homely features as though he would fain seek some comfort therein .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 8]: `` Oh yes , indeed , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 4]: Ask me anything .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 10]: It is not that I have much to tell .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 12]: Mademoiselle said , ` Give this letter to the King himself .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 8]: Let it touch no other hand . '
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 6]: That is all , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 8]: She was weeping when she wrote it .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 13]: Monsieur Poluski told me what to do to-morrow about my own journey .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 8]: See , here are my tickets . ''
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 4]: `` Poluski ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 9]: said Alec , and the words came dully .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 8]: `` Has he too betrayed me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 12]: `` He has gone with my mistress , '' sobbed Pauline .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 32]: `` It is not that they have betrayed you , monsieur ; for mademoiselle looked like to die , and I have never seen any one more disturbed than Monsieur Poluski .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 16]: He raved like a maniac when I asked him for one word of explanation . ''
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 9]: `` But what does it mean , woman ?
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 7]: Do you understand what has happened ?
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 33]: My promised wife has fled , bidding me not to dream of seeing her again , and with her has gone one of the few men alive in whom I had confidence .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 7]: What is that but betrayal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 34]: `` I do not profess to understand the ways of courts , monsieur , '' said Pauline , gathering a little courage , since the King appealed to her as a fellow mortal .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 15]: `` But in your case I do not think I should blame Mademoiselle Joan .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 14]: She did not go because she had ceased to love you , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 24]: Sometimes a woman can love a man so well that she will leave him if she thinks it is for his good . ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 8]: A light broke in on the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 21]: Was Joan the victim of some deadly intrigue such as had sullied too often the records of the Kosnovian monarchy ?
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 27]: How strange it was that he should come from that eventful meeting of the Cabinet and receive within the hour Joan 's pathetic message of farewell !
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 31]: He stood and thought deeply again for many minutes , striving to conquer his laboring heart and throbbing brain , exerting manfully all his splendid resources of mind and body .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 25]: Then he turned to the trembling Frenchwoman and said with almost uncanny gentleness : `` You have done what your mistress asked , Pauline .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 18]: Come to me to-morrow before you go , and I will reward you for your faithful service .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 11]: Leave me now ; but tell none what has happened .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 32]: I must have time to think , and it would help me if no other person in this house but you shares with me the knowledge of mademoiselle 's departure . ''
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 14]: Pauline went out , glad of her dismissal , yet sobbing with sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 13]: Alec began to pace the length of the long dimly lighted room .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 20]: Back and forth he went , thinking , knitting his brows in fierce effort to subdue his stunned faculties .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 25]: By degrees the sad significance of Joan 's words and actions during their visit that morning to the New Konak began to establish itself .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 23]: He saw now that she was bidding farewell to her dream of happiness , deliberately torturing herself with a burden of memories .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 45]: Even their parting kiss must have given her a twinge of direst agony ; for the one thing he would never believe of Joan was that she had sacrificed him to some feminine whim , made him the sport of a woman 's caprice .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 7]: She had been driven from him !
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 3]: By whom ?
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 29]: He must discover that , and he gloated with almost insensate rage at the thought of strangling with his hands the wretch who had done this callous deed .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 31]: Physical passion mastered him again , and it was not until he realized the folly of merely dreaming of vengeance that he forced himself anew into a semblance of calm .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 20]: He knew that a man blinded with rage could not deal sanely with this problem of love and statecraft .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 24]: At first he thought of questioning individually each person who , by the remotest chance , might be responsible for Joan 's flight .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 43]: But not only did his impatient heart spurn that slower method of inquisition ; but he realized that he was more likely to discover the truth by gathering instantly in one room all those persons whose self interest pointed to his undoing .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 17]: Somehow , Sobieski 's disjointed narrative aroused a dreadful suspicion that was not to be quelled .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 5]: He summoned an attendant .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 14]: `` Ask Prince and Princess Delgrado to come here , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 16]: `` Send to General Stampoff and tell him that the King urgently desires his presence .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 17]: I believe that Monsieur Beliani and Count Julius Marulitch are in the smoking-room with Monsieur Nesimir .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 10]: Ask those three gentlemen also to join me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 6]: The attendant saluted and withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 15]: Alec examined the door to make sure that the key was in the lock .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 14]: Hardly conscious of his own purpose , he looked about for a weapon .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 23]: In the place of honor , above the fireplace , hung the sword given him by his father in the Rue Boissière .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 26]: It evoked bitter memories , and he swung on his heel with a curse , going to the window and staring out into the night .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 14]: His brain seethed with strange imaginings , and his breast was on fire .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 32]: The sight of that ridiculous sword lying in its sheath of velvet and gold seemed to reveal the hollowness of life , its mock tragedies , its real agony of tears .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 14]: All at once the impulse seized him to look at the bright steel .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 16]: With a savage laugh he sprang back across the room and took down the sword .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 16]: The blade leaped forth at his clutch , and he kissed it in a frenzy .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 11]: `` You weep , my Joan , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 20]: `` I know that you weep ; but your tempter 's lying heart shall shed drop for drop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 18]: CHAPTER XIII WHEREIN A REASON IS GIVEN FOR JOAN 'S FLIGHT A knock sounded on the door .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 28]: `` Their Excellencies the Prince and Princess Delgrado , '' announced Bosko , whose jaws underwent strange contortions at being compelled to utter so many syllables consecutively .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 8]: Alec thrust the sword into its scabbard .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 28]: He did not put the weapon in its accustomed place ; but hid it behind a fold of one of the heavy curtains that shrouded the windows .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 25]: `` On the arrival of the others whom I have summoned you can usher them in without warning , '' he said to Bosko .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 25]: `` As soon as General Stampoff comes let no other person enter , and remain near the door until I call you . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 10]: _ Oui , monsieur _ , '' said Bosko .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 15]: King or no King , he was faithful to his scanty stock of French .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 25]: Prince Michael had dined well , having induced his host to depart from the King 's injunctions as to the wine supplied at meals .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 6]: His puffed face shone redly .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 32]: It looked so gross and fat , perched on such a slender frame , that he resembled one of those diminutive yet monstrous caricatures of humanity seen on the pantomime stage .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 10]: `` What is the trouble now , Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 12]: he asked , glancing quickly round the spacious ill lighted apartment .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 9]: `` Your man came to me most mysteriously .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 10]: His manner suggested treasons , spoils , and stratagems .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 8]: I met your mother on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 11]: She too , it seems , is in demand . ''
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 26]: Alec looked at the strange little creature whom he called father , and from the Prince 's gargoyle head his gaze dwelt on his mother .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 6]: She had uttered no word .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 12]: Her eyes met his furtively for a second and then dropped .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 27]: She was disturbed , obviously alarmed , and , with a curiously detached feeling of surprise , he guessed that she knew of Joan 's departure .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 14]: Well , he would bide his time until all possible conspirators were present .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 16]: Then , by fair means or foul , he would wring the truth from them .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 26]: `` I want to consult my mother and you as to a certain matter , '' he said , answering Prince Michael with apparent nonchalance .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 9]: `` I shall not detain you very long .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 34]: Beliani , Julius , and Monsieur Nesimir are in the building , and then we only await Stampoff -- with whom , by the way , I almost succeeded in quarreling to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 7]: `` A quarrel with Stampoff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 33]: exclaimed the elder Delgrado , preening his chest and sticking out his chin in the exaggerated manner that warned those who knew him best of the imminent expression of a weighty opinion .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 6]: `` That will never do .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 8]: Stampoff is the backbone of your administration .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 26]: Were it not for our dear Paul , nothing would have been heard of a Delgrado in Kosnovia during the last quarter of a century .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 11]: My dear boy , he has kept us alive politically .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 12]: On no account can you afford to quarrel with Stampoff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 14]: Michael 's big head wagged wisely ; for champagne invariably made him talkative .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 12]: Nesimir entered ; with him came Count Julius and the Greek .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 11]: `` Nice thing his Majesty has just told me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 8]: cried Prince Michael , with owl-like gravity .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 10]: `` He says that Stampoff and he have disagreed .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 5]: What has gone wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 13]: Have you heard of this most unfortunate estrangement , Monsieur Nesimir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 22]: The President , of course , assumed that some allusion had been made already to the scene in the Council chamber .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 13]: `` A serious position has undoubtedly arisen , '' he said blandly .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 54]: `` His Majesty did not see his way clear to adopt certain recommendations put forward by his Ministers to-day , -- by myself , I may say , acting on behalf of my colleagues , '' and he coughed deferentially , -- `` and General Stampoff took an active part in the debate .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 20]: He set forth his views with -- er -- what I considered to be -- er -- unnecessary vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 28]: But there , '' and a flourish of his hand indicated the nebulous nature of the dispute , `` nothing was said that can not be mended .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 34]: His Majesty himself had the tact to adjourn the discussion till to-morrow , and I have little doubt that we shall all be prepared to consider the matter then like reasonable men . ''
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 8]: `` But what was it about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 6]: broke in the Prince testily .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 9]: `` Was it with reference to Monsieur Beliani ?
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 16]: I understood that his appointment to the Ministry of Finance was agreed to unanimously . ''
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 17]: Beliani coughed , with the modesty of a man who might not discuss his own merits .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 10]: The President hesitated before he answered this direct question .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 26]: He cast a doubtful glance on the King , who had turned to the window again and seemed to give little heed to the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 5]: But Alec wheeled round .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 28]: He had heard every word , and , oddly enough in his own estimation , was already drawing conclusions that were not wholly unfavorable to Prince Michael .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 47]: `` I have sent for Stampoff , '' he said , exercising amazing self control in concealing his fierce desire to have done with subterfuge , `` and my message was couched in such terms that he will hardly refuse to honor us with his presence .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 30]: Meanwhile , let me rescue you , Monsieur Nesimir , from the embarrassment of explaining away the difficulty you yourself brought about at to-day 's meeting of the Cabinet .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 15]: Monsieur Beliani had no rival ; no one doubted his ability as a financier .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 11]: `` The dispute arose in connection with my forthcoming marriage .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 20]: It was suggested that I should contract an alliance with a Princess of some reigning house in the Balkans .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 25]: The obvious corollary of that view was that Miss Joan Vernon could not be regarded as a suitable bride for the King of Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 53]: I declined to accept the recommendation put forward by Monsieur Nesimir , -- to whom , by the way , I attribute the utmost good faith , -- and Stampoff , whose patriotic ardor halts at nothing , practically threatened me with the loss of my Kingdom as the penalty of disobedience .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 19]: I said that I was quite willing to leave the whole matter to the arbitrament of the people .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 24]: If they decide against my choice of a wife , it follows that there will be a vacancy in the Delgrado succession . ''
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 11]: Princess Delgrado uttered a sigh that was almost a groan .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 36]: She sank into the chair that her son had offered her when she entered the room , but rose to her feet again in manifest anxiety when her husband thrust himself in front of Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 32]: `` Are we to credit , '' he broke in furiously , `` that you have actually placed your marriage with this girl before every tie of family and patrimony ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 46]: `` That is hardly a fair statement of the facts , '' said Alec coldly , though it cost him a violent effort to sustain this unnatural calm when he was aflame with desire to ascertain Joan 's motive ; `` but it will serve .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 15]: At any rate , we can defer discussion of that point for the present .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 33]: We are gathered here to deal with quite another phase of the dispute , and , with your permission , I shall leave any further explanation until General Stampoff has arrived . ''
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 31]: Although his utterance was measured and seemingly devoid of any excess of feeling , three , at least , of those in the room were not deceived by his attitude .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 29]: Princess Delgrado seemed to be profoundly disquieted , while Beliani and Marulitch strove , not altogether with success , to carry themselves with the indifference that cloaks uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 10]: Alec turned again to the window and looked out .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 24]: A carriage drove into the courtyard and , though its occupant was invisible , he guessed rightly that Stampoff had not failed him .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 42]: Some low conversation went on behind his back , and , although he was now marshaling his forces for the impending struggle , he became aware that the President was giving in greater detail an account of the afternoon 's proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 11]: But he listened only for the opening of the door .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 25]: From that instant war should be declared , ruthless war on each and every person present who had reft him of his promised bride .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 3]: Stampoff entered .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 56]: His keen old eyes instantly took in the significance of the gathering ; but he saluted the King in silence , bowed to Princess Delgrado , and stood stockstill , not a yard from the door , in the attitude of one who awaits an order , or , it might be , a denunciation .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 33]: Alec approached , and the others , including Stampoff himself , thought that he meant to make some private communication to the newcomer before beginning a debate in which all might share .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 18]: But he walked past Stampoff , locked the door , and put the key in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 33]: -LSB- Illustration : Stampoff saluted the King in silence Page 268 -RSB- `` Now , '' he said , `` I am free to explain why we seven are gathered here to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 27]: Joan Vernon , who was to have become my wife within a few days , left Delgratz two hours ago by the mail train for Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 31]: She was accompanied by Felix Poluski , and the only reason for this clandestine journey is contained in a few lines of farewell addressed to me by the lady herself .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 18]: In that letter she speaks of a barrier that renders impossible a marriage between her and me .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 40]: I want to know what that barrier is and who erected it , and I shall discover both those things here and now , if I have to tear the knowledge from the heart of each man present ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 50]: `` A strange threat , Alec , '' panted Prince Michael , whose prominent eyes were bulging in semi-intoxication , though indeed he seemed suddenly to have realized the tremendous import of the King 's statement , -- `` a strange threat to be uttered before your mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 12]: `` My mother loved Joan , '' came the impassioned cry .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 23]: `` She took her to her heart from the first hour , and she will bear with me now in my agony .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 12]: Yet it may be that even my mother has deceived me .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 5]: I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 35]: Some of you here know , perhaps all ; but I vow to Heaven I shall not flinch from my resolve to extract the truth , no matter with whom the responsibility rests ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 23]: Princess Delgrado , trembling and ghastly pale , tottered to the chair again and gripped its back to prevent herself from falling .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 62]: Under less strained conditions , it must have seemed bizarre in a company of men for whom polite attentions to the opposite sex were a fixed convention , that she should seek such support when her husband was standing by her side ; but in that startled gathering small heed was given to aught else than the King 's thrilling statement .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 34]: Though aware of his mother 's distress , Alec did not move from the position he had taken up , facing all of them , and with that hidden sword within easy reach .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 33]: Ever a dutiful and devoted son , he continued now to glower at the half-fainting woman as though she alone held the key of the mystery that resulted in Joan 's disappearance .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 30]: His impassioned eyes sought to peer into her very soul , and his nostrils quivered with the frenzied eagerness of one who awaited an answer to the implied question .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 42]: In some indefinable way he had already begun to suspect the truth ; for when the poor woman made no reply , though more than once her terror laden eyes met his in mute appeal , he whirled round on Marulitch .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 22]: `` Perhaps this is an occasion when it is a woman 's privilege to remain silent , '' he said bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 9]: `` So I begin with you , Julius .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 23]: Save myself , you are the youngest here , and it would be fitting that you and I should determine this business .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 10]: I warn you there will be no half measures !
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 22]: My life , at least , goes into the scale , and I care not who else adjusts the balance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 15]: The pink and white tints had long fled from the Parisian dandy 's complexion .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 17]: In the dim light he looked livid , and his forehead bore bright beads of perspiration .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 27]: But even Alec 's fiery eyes discerned that he was not only afraid , but bewildered , and his voice cracked with excitement when he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 18]: `` I declare by everything I hold sacred that I had no hand in this affair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 4]: he said shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 40]: `` It is natural perhaps that you should suspect me , since I seem to have most to gain by any ill that befalls you ; but , even in your anger , Alec , you should be just .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 36]: No matter how fierce your emotions , you ought to realize that Miss Vernon 's departure from Delgratz retards rather than helps any possible scheming on my part to succeed you on the throne . ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 7]: `` Now you , Beliani ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 18]: said Alec , striving to penetrate the mask that covered the one impassive face in the room .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 16]: `` It was you who contrived that my promised wife should come here from Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 7]: I can see your purpose now .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 34]: At to-day 's meeting of the Cabinet , while I was urging your advancement to power and dignity in the State , your hand was revealed in the opposition manifested to my marriage .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 22]: Your cunning brain conceived the notion that I would not abandon the woman I loved for the sake of fifty Kingdoms .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 49]: You read my mind aright ; but , if it was you who brought about her flight , for what devilish reason did you depart from the subtle plot that might well have achieved your ends by means which you , at least , would consider fair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 13]: The Greek spread wide his hands in that characteristic gesture of his .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 16]: As it happened , for once in his life he could afford to be sincere .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 40]: `` I can only assure your Majesty in the plainest possible terms , '' he said , `` that until I heard the news from your own lips , I had no knowledge whatsoever of Miss Vernon 's journey .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 44]: Were I asked outside that locked door to state to the best of my belief where she might be found , I should have said that the slight illness of which she complained this morning had probably confined her to her room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 38]: For an instant Alec scowled at the President ; but Sergius Nesimir 's vacuous features so obviously revealed his condition of speechless surprise and distress that there remained only Stampoff , Prince Michael -- and his mother .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 38]: Adhering rigidly to his scheme of narrowing the field of inquiry by putting the same straight question to each individual in turn , Alec next appealed to the man who had helped him to gain a throne .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 29]: `` Paul , '' he said , `` you who were my friend and have become my enemy , you , at least , will speak the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 12]: Tell me , then , who has done this thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 4]: Stampoff strode forward .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 26]: He feared no one , this determined advocate of his country 's cause , and he alone knew the real menace of the impending tornado .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 15]: `` Your mother ought not to be here , Alec , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 11]: `` A little more of this and she will faint .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 4]: Look at her !
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 8]: Have you no pity in your heart ?
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 8]: This is no place for a woman .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 11]: Unlock the door and let her be taken away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 9]: Alec moistened his dry lips with his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 18]: He felt that he was finally touching sure ground in the morass through which he was floundering .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 10]: `` She and all of you must remain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 5]: was his grim reply .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 5]: `` Answer my question !
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 10]: Was it you who drove Joan from Delgratz ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 30]: `` I counseled it , '' said Stampoff , folding his arms defiantly , and apparently careless whether or not the King sprang at his throat the next instant .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 3]: At last !
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 19]: Thank God for one man who is honest , though he seems to have acted like a fiend !
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 7]: To whom did you counsel it ?
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 5]: To Joan herself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 10]: `` Tell me , then , to whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 5]: `` I refuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 19]: `` Stampoff , I shall draw a confession from you even though you die under my hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 41]: `` I have faced death many times for the King of Kosnovia , '' said the harsh Serbian voice , `` and I shall not shrink from it now , whether at the hands of the King or his foes .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 19]: Send your mother away ; then , perhaps , I may tell you what you want to know .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 18]: The thing is done , and I , for one , shall not shirk the consequences . ''
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 5]: `` My mother again !
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 12]: Must she be spared though you have sacrificed her son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 38]: With a quick movement that sent tremors through Julius and the Greek , since he was compelled to pass close to both , he strode to the quaking Princess and caught her almost roughly by the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 12]: `` I feared this from the outset , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 12]: `` Did Stampoff make you the agent of his hellish work ?
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 5]: Joan would trust you .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 6]: Speak to me , mother !
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 9]: Was it you who wrought this evil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 16]: Her head was bent low , and she gasped something that sounded like an excuse .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 8]: Alec recoiled from her in sudden horror .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 21]: His hands were pressed feverishly to his forehead , and a hoarse cry of anguish came from his panting breast .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 9]: `` I think I shall go mad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 4]: he almost sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 11]: `` My own mother enter into this league against me !
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 10]: My mother -- Oh , it can not be !
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 20]: Stampoff , you , I know , would not scruple to sacrifice my dearest hopes to further your designs .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 12]: Could you find none but my mother to aid you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 26]: He reeled as under a blow from an unseen hand , and at that unfortunate moment Prince Michael Delgrado thought fit to assert his authority .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 13]: `` This ridiculous scene has gone far enough , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 36]: `` I was not aware that your pretty artist had quitted Delgratz ; but it is quite evident that her departure is the best thing that could possibly happen for the good of the Kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 38]: If Stampoff advised it , and your mother saw fit to point out to the girl the danger she was bringing to you and the monarchy , such action on their part has my complete approval . ''
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 9]: Alec gazed blankly at the pompous little man .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 22]: It needed but Prince Michael 's outburst to stamp the whole episode with the seal of ineffable meanness and double dealing .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 51]: He recalled the cowardice displayed by the Prince when Stampoff urged him to seize the vacant throne , and his gorge rose at the thought that Joan had been driven from his arms in order that this pygmy might secure the annual pittance that would supply his lusts in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 10]: At that moment Alec was Berserk with impotent rage .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 20]: His mother 's complicity in the banishing of Joan denied him a victim on whom to wreak his wrath .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 29]: But there still remained a vengeance , dire and far reaching , which would teach a bitter lesson to those who had entered into so unworthy a conspiracy .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 20]: Leaping to the curtain which concealed the sword , he snatched it up and smashed it across his knee .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 22]: `` See , then , how I treat the symbol of my monarchy , '' he cried with a terrible laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 19]: `` I shall soon demonstrate to you what a pricked balloon is this Kingship of which you prate .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 56]: I believe that you , my own father , are ready to supplant me , I know that Julius , my cousin , is straining every nerve to procure my downfall ; but you shall learn how a man who despises the pinchbeck honors of a throne can defeat your petty malice and miserable scheming .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 12]: Monsieur Nesimir , I proclaim Kosnovia a Republic from this hour !
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 6]: Here and now I abdicate !
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 46]: Summon a meeting of the Assembly to-morrow , and I shall give its members the best of reasons why the State will prosper more under the people 's rule than under that of either of the men who are so anxious to succeed me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 3]: `` Abdicate !
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 2]: Republic !
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 5]: What monstrous folly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 15]: cried Prince Michael , his plethoric face convulsed with anger at this unexpected counterstroke .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 17]: `` I am saying that which , with God 's help , I shall perform ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 24]: cried Alec , despair falling from him like a discarded garment as he realized what his project would mean to Joan and himself .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 31]: `` You may abdicate , of course , if you choose , '' came the scornful retort ; `` but you have no power to break the Delgrado line . ''
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 15]: `` My power will be put to the test to-morrow , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 24]: `` I am not afraid to measure my strength against the pitiful cowards who struck at me through a woman 's love . ''
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 11]: `` Pay no heed to him , Monsieur Nesimir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 12]: piped Prince Michael , whose voice rose to a thin falsetto .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 6]: `` He is beside himself .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 14]: If he chooses to vacate the throne , it reverts to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 7]: `` A Republic in Kosnovia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 3]: snarled Stampoff .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 17]: `` That , indeed , will mark the beginning of the end for the Slav race .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 10]: A single year would wipe us out of existence .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 11]: What say you , Beliani , and you , Marulitch ?
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 5]: Why are you dumb ?
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 13]: Was it for this that we have striven through so many years ?
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 25]: Shall our country be wrecked now because a hot headed youth puts his vows to a woman before every consideration of national welfare ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 7]: `` The notion is preposterous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 17]: growled Julius , gaining courage from Stampoff 's bold denunciation ; but Beliani tried to temporize .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 18]: `` We are far too excited to deal with this vexed affair to-night , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 30]: `` The King is naturally aggrieved by a trying experience , and is hardly in a fit state of mind to consider the grave issues raised by his words .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 9]: Let us forget what we have just heard .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 10]: To-morrow we shall all be calmer and saner . ''
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 29]: `` Monsieur Nesimir , '' said Alec sternly , fixing the hapless President with his masterful eye , `` while I remain King you must obey my orders .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 26]: See to it that notices are despatched to-night to the members of the National Assembly summoning a special meeting for an early hour to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 11]: `` Monsieur Nesimir will do nothing of the kind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 6]: shrieked the infuriated Prince Michael .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 6]: `` I forbid it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 10]: `` And I command it , '' cried Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 18]: `` If he refuses , I shall take other steps to insure my wishes being fulfilled . ''
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 13]: `` Then I will tell you why your Joan has gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 4]: bellowed the Prince .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 12]: `` No , Marie , I will not be restrained ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 18]: he shouted to his wife , who had rushed to him in a very frenzy of alarm .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 13]: She clutched at his shoulder ; but he shook himself free brutally .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 21]: `` It is full time you knew what I have done for you , '' he hissed venomously at Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 31]: `` Stampoff and your mother and I , alone of those in this room , are aware of the fraud that has been perpetrated on the people of this country .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 7]: You are not King of Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 6]: You are not my son .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 26]: Your father was a Colorado gold miner to whom your mother was married before I met her , and who died before you were born .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 37]: For the sake of his widow 's money I gave her my name , and was fool enough to fall in with her whim of pride that you should be brought up as a Prince Delgrado .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 101]: I suppose Stampoff urged your mother to reveal the facts to that chit of a girl who has addled your brain , and she , fortunately , had sense enough to see that you can not continue to occupy the throne five seconds after it becomes known that you are a mere alien , that your name is Alexander Talbot , and that I , Michael Delgrado , who married a foreigner in order that I might live , and permitted an American child to be reared as a lawful Prince of my house , am the lawful King . ''
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 25]: The little man strutted up and down the room in a fume of indignation , and evidently felt fully justified in his own esteem .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 40]: Ever selfish and vain , he fancied that he had been the victim of a cruel fate , and he read the sheer bewilderment in Alec 's face as a tribute to the master stroke he had just delivered .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 25]: But his self conceit wilted under the contemptuous scorn of his wife 's gaze , which he chanced to meet when his posturing ceased .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 20]: Alec looked to his mother for some confirmation or denial of the astounding statement blurted forth by her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 10]: But she had no eyes for her son then .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 17]: The wrongs and sufferings of a lifetime were welling up from her heart to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 23]: The agonized suspense of the last few minutes had given way to the frenzy of a woman outraged in her deepest sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 24]: She relinquished the chair to which she had been clinging , and faced the diminutive Prince with a quiet dignity that overawed him .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 13]: `` So that is how you keep your oath , Michael ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 72]: `` When I forgave your infidelities , when I pandered to your extravagance , when I allowed you to fritter away the wealth bequeathed to me by a man whose fine nature was so far removed from yours that I have often wondered why God created two such opposite types of humanity , time and again you vowed that the idle folly of my youth would never be revealed by you .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 17]: Twice you swore it on your knees when I was stung beyond endurance by your baseness .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 58]: No , Michael , '' and her voice rose almost to a scream when her husband tried to silence her with a curse , `` you shall hear the truth now , if I have to ask my son as a last favor to his unhappy mother to still that foul tongue of yours by force ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 12]: For an instant , she made a wild appeal to Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 12]: `` Your father was an honorable man , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 28]: `` For his sake , if not for mine , since I have forfeited all claim to your love , compel this man to be silent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 22]: The belief was slowly establishing itself in her son 's mind that the incredible thing he was hearing was actually true .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 28]: Nevertheless , he was temporarily bereft of the poise and balance of judgment that might have enabled him to adjust the warring elements in his bewildered brain .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 30]: It was a new and horrible experience to be asked by his mother to use physical violence against the man he had been taught to regard as his father .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 56]: He had never respected Michael Delgrado , -- he could acknowledge that now without the twinge of conscience that had always accompanied the unpleasing thought in the past , -- yet , despite the gulf already yawning wide between them , his soul revolted against the notion of laying a hand on him in anger .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 22]: But he did stoop over the spluttering little Prince and said sternly , `` You must not interrupt my mother again !
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 9]: You must not , I tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 44]: Such was the chilling emphasis of his words that Delgrado 's loud objurgations died away in his throat , and the distraught Princess , with one last look of unutterable contempt at her royal spouse , faced the other occupants of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 15]: `` I did harm to none by my innocent deception , '' she pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 21]: `` I was very young when I married Alec 's father , who was nearly twenty years older than I .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 31]: We were not rich , and we were compelled to live in a rude mining camp , where my husband owned some claims that seemed to be of little value .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 30]: But from the day of our wedding our fortunes began to improve , and , in the year before my son was born , money poured in on us .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 13]: That small collection of wooden shanties has now become a great city .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 29]: The land my husband owned is worth ten thousand times its original value ; but , unfortunately , when wealth came , I grew dissatisfied with my surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 30]: I wanted to travel , to mix in society , to become one of the fashionable throng that flocks to Paris and London and the Riviera in their seasons .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 15]: My husband refused to desert the State in which his interests were bound up .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 45]: `` We quarreled -- it was all my fault -- and then one day he was killed in a mine accident , and I , scarce knowing what I was doing , fled to New York for distraction from my grief and self condemnation .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 22]: My son was born there , and in that same year I met Prince Michael Delgrado in a friend 's house .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 12]: To me in those days a Prince was a wonderful creature .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 21]: He quickly saw that I was a prize worth capturing , and not many months elapsed before we were married .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 70]: I had all the foolish vanity of a young woman , unused to the world , who was entitled to call herself a Princess , and it seemed to my flighty mind that the fact of my son bearing a different name to my own would always advertise my plebeian origin ; for I was quite a woman of the people , the daughter of a storekeeper in Pueblo .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 42]: I cast aside my old and tried acquaintances , placed my affairs in trustworthy hands , and , when we set up an establishment in Paris , my infant son came to be known as a Prince of the Delgrado family .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 43]: `` Once such a blunder is made it is not easily rectified ; but during many a sad hour have I regretted it , for Michael Delgrado did not scruple to use it as a threat whenever I resented his ill conduct .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 16]: At first a trivial thing , in time it became a millstone round my neck .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 31]: As Alec grew up , it became more and more difficult to announce that he was not Prince Alexis Delgrado , but a simple commoner , Alexander Talbot by name .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 13]: `` There , then , you have the measure of my transgression .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 45]: It was the knowledge of the truth that drove that dear girl , Joan Vernon , from Delgratz this evening , because General Stampoff would not scruple to reveal the imposture if he failed to secure the King 's adherence to his projects . ''
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 6]: `` God 's bones ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 4]: broke in Stampoff .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 24]: `` I made him King , though I was aware from the day of your wedding that he was not Michael 's son .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 17]: King he is , and King he will remain if he agrees to my terms . ''
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 14]: `` Go on with your story , mother , '' said Alec softly .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 11]: `` I think I am beginning to understand now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 8]: `` What more need I say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 10]: wailed the Princess in a sudden access of grief .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 46]: `` I have squandered your love , Alec , I have ruined my own life , I have devoted all these wretched years to a man who is the worst sort of blackmailer , -- a husband who trades on his wife 's weakness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 10]: She turned on Prince Michael with a last cry .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 10]: `` I am done with you now forever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 29]: `` I have borne with you for my son 's sake ; but now you and I must dwell apart , for my very soul loathes you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 17]: She sank into a chair in a passion of tears , and Alec bent over her .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 31]: He spoke no word to her ; but his hand rested gently around her neck while his eyes traveled from Michael 's gray-green face to Julius Marulitch 's white one .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 42]: `` I think we have all heard sufficient of the Delgrado history to render unnecessary any further comment on my decision to relinquish an honor that , it would appear , I had no right to accept , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 13]: `` I have gained my end , though by a strange path .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 10]: Will you please leave me with my mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 36]: The one man present who felt completely out of his depth in this sea of discord took it upon himself to cry pathetically : `` The door is locked , your -- your Majesty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 18]: `` Ah , forgive me , Monsieur Nesimir , '' said Alec , with a friendly smile .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 6]: `` I had forgotten that .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 31]: And , now that I come to think of it , I still have something to say ; but we need not detain my mother to hear an uninteresting conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 12]: Pardon me one moment , while I attend to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 10]: CHAPTER XIV THE BROKEN TREATY Alec unlocked the door .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 44]: The laconic Bosko returned his all sufficing '' _ Oui , monsieur _ , '' to the request that he would bring Mademoiselle Joan 's French maid to Princess Delgrado , since it was in Alec 's mind that Pauline might be discreet .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 18]: Prince Michael , Beliani , Marulitch , and Nesimir had already formed themselves into a whispering group .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 9]: Stampoff was seated apart , morose and thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 19]: The old man 's elbows rested on his knees and his chin was propped between his bony fists .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 10]: Princess Delgrado had flung herself forward on the table .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 9]: Her face was hidden by her outstretched arms .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 23]: This attitude of abandonment , the clenched hands , the convulsive heaving of her shoulders , were eloquent of tempest tossed emotions .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 34]: She looked so forlorn that her son was tempted to return to her side without delay ; but instead he walked quietly toward the four men clustered in the center of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 8]: They started apart and faced him nervously .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 23]: It seemed that even yet they feared lest some uncontrolled gust of anger might lead Alec to fling himself blindly upon them .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 17]: Had they but known it , he despised them too greatly to think of mauling them .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 16]: `` Gentlemen , '' he said , `` I have one small request to make .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 47]: Give me your word of honor -- I will take it for what it is worth -- that to-night 's happenings shall remain unknown to the outer world , and that there will be no interference with my mother or myself before we leave Delgratz . ''
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 45]: Prince Michael , who had recovered some of his jauntiness , looked at Alec with the crafty eye of a cowed hyena ; but he said coolly , `` There is nothing to be gained by publishing our blunders to all the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 7]: `` Have I your promise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 3]: insisted Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 5]: `` And yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 5]: he said to Marulitch .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 12]: `` Of course I agree , '' came the ready answer .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 20]: `` I , like Prince Michael , feel that it would be folly -- '' `` Prince Michael ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 5]: snarled the royal Delgrado .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 11]: `` You must learn to school your tongue , Julius !
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 9]: From this moment I am King of Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 11]: Let there be no manner of doubt about that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 8]: Alec might not have heard the blusterer .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 7]: His calm glance fell on Beliani .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 7]: `` And what say you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 31]: `` I agree most fully and unreservedly , '' murmured the Greek , conveying , with a deep bow , his respectful regret that such an assurance should be necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 16]: The greatly perturbed President had already quitted the room ; so Alec turned to Stampoff .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 6]: His manner was quite friendly .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 17]: Well he knew that this fiery soul was not to be judged by the Delgrado standard .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 35]: `` I will not inflict on you , my trusty comrade , '' he said , `` the indignity of a demand that I felt was imperative in the case of some others present .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 43]: Let us shake hands and think rather of what we have gone through together when I was King and you were my most loyal supporter , than of the poor climax to my brief reign that reveals me as an impostor . ''
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 10]: Those keen eyes were raised in a half-formed resolution .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 9]: `` Is it too late , Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 4]: he growled sullenly .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 5]: `` For what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 18]: Alec 's smile of surprise was the only bit of affectation he had indulged in that night .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 21]: The fantasy flitting through Stampoff 's brain was not hidden from him ; but he wanted to dismiss it lightly .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 5]: `` God 's bones !
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 4]: Need you ask ?
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 18]: Say but the word , and you will be more firmly established on the throne than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 12]: Trust me to find means to still those babbling tongues ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 35]: and Stampoff flung out an arm in the direction of the uncle and nephew , each manifestly anxious to hurry away , yet each so distrustful of the other that he dared not go .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 11]: `` Paul , you are incorrigible , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 18]: `` You ought to have been a marshal under Napoleon , who would have had no scruples .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 27]: No , you will not see civil war in the streets of Delgratz as to whether a Delgrado or an American adventurer shall reign in Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 9]: Yet , I thank you for the thought .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 39]: It shows that you , at least , do not rate me poorly , and it is not in my heart to be vexed with you , though I owe this night 's amazement to your striving . ''
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 7]: `` Be just , Alec ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 5]: whispered the Serb hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 11]: `` Condemn me if you will ; but be just !
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 13]: While Michael Delgrado lived , your reign would never have been secure .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 6]: I knew that all along .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 77]: You will go away now and marry the girl of your choice , and soon the memories of this downtrodden country will be dim in your soul ; but think what would have happened to you , to your wife , and perhaps to your children , if Michael one day blurted out the truth in some fit of drunken rage , or if Beliani and that other white faced hound obtained evidence of your birth .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 19]: That is why I was resolved to force you , if possible , to wed a Serbian Princess .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 15]: Your marriage to a woman of our own race would have borne down opposition .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 6]: And now what will happen ?
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 5]: The future is black .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 28]: Michael is unworthy to be a King ; Marulitch , at the best , is a poor-spirited wretch ; and after them there is no Delgrado . ''
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 17]: `` Well , I am sorry , too , in a way , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 21]: `` I was beginning to love these Kosnovian folk , and I think I could have made something of them .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 4]: Good-by , Paul .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 14]: If we never meet again , at least we part good friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 9]: Stampoff rose and silently wrung Alec 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 15]: He walked straight out of the room with bent head and slow uncertain steps .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 9]: For the hour his fierce spirit was chastened .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 19]: He had done that which he thought would make for good , and it had turned out ill .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 8]: His single minded scheming had gone awry .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 62]: Another man in his position might have sought to curry favor with the new régime , whether of Michael or Julius ; but Stampoff was not of that mettle ; he wanted Alec to be King , because he believed in him , and now the edifice for which he had labored so ardently had tumbled in pieces about his ears .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 10]: Pauline came , and Alec went to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 8]: He took her tenderly in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 6]: `` Come , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 12]: `` Joan 's maid will help you to reach your room .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 24]: Our train leaves at midnight , and Bosko and Pauline will give your maid any help she needs in collecting your belongings . ''
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 27]: The Princess raised her grief stricken face to his , and it wrung his heart anew to see how that night of misery had aged her .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 10]: `` Oh , my son , my son ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 3]: she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 8]: `` Will you ever forgive me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 10]: He kissed her with a hearty and reassuring hug .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 7]: `` Forgive you , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 17]: `` It is not I , but you , who have suffered through all these years .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 7]: Have no fear for the future !
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 9]: Joan and I will make you happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 6]: `` But she , Alec !
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 15]: What will she say when she learns the wrong I have done you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 5]: Afraid of Joan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 4]: cried he cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 19]: `` Why , you dear old mother , Joan is taking all the blame on her own shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 16]: You will find she agrees with me that you are the one to be pitied .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 26]: You made a mistake for which you have paid very dearly ; but in no possible way can it affect the remainder of our lives .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 12]: There now , cheer up and prepare for your journey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 25]: The Princess left the room leaning on Pauline 's arm , nor , in passing , did she bestow a glance on her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 23]: Prince Michael indulged in an ostentatious shrug , and might have said something had not Alec 's gaze dwelt on him steadily .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 19]: It is to be presumed that , not for the first time , discretion conquered Michael 's valor .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 31]: `` A word with you , Beliani , '' said Alec , going to the table and unlocking the drawer from which he had taken the money given to Sobieski .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 15]: `` You are now in charge of the State 's finances , I presume .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 14]: I have here a sum , roughly speaking , of one thousand pounds .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 32]: To some extent , it is my own money ; but the greater part consists of instalments of the salary of five thousand dollars a year I allowed myself as King .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 9]: Do you think I have earned it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 11]: The Greek could only mutter a surprised , `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 12]: Who would deny your right to a far larger amount ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 16]: `` Having your sanction , then , I take it , '' said Alec coolly .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 21]: `` Here too is my passport , issued in Paris , for which I believe I am indebted to you .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 7]: It will now come in handy .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 16]: May I ask in whose charge I leave the books and papers on this table ?
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 12]: Some of them may be of use to the State . ''
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 28]: `` I am afraid I can not answer that question , '' muttered the Greek , with a stealthy glance in the direction of the rival candidates .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 13]: `` Well , settle it among yourselves , '' said Alec dryly .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 8]: `` Now I must be off . ''
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 17]: Without another word he passed from the room that had witnessed his triumph and his fall .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 20]: Yet his face was remarkably cheerful when he asked an attendant if Lord Adalbert Beaumanoir 's whereabouts was known .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 26]: The quiet elation in his manner led the man to believe that some specially pleasing news had transpired during the conclave in the royal bureau .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 23]: It appeared that his Excellency , the English milord , had gone to the music hall in the Königstrasse with a friend .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 19]: `` Then send some one to say that he is wanted here at once , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 7]: `` Yes , your Majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 5]: `` Your Majesty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 12]: How incongruous the two words sounded now in Alec 's ears !
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 39]: By a trick of memory his thoughts flew back to the Montmartre review wherein the stage prototypes of the Parisian band of exiled monarchs addressed each other by high sounding titles and incidentally sought to borrow five-franc pieces .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 37]: `` If I possessed some literary skill , I could write a review that would set the world talking , '' he mused , smiling to himself as he ascended the stairs to his own suite .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 10]: `` What is the matter , old chap ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 15]: demanded Beaumanoir , strolling into his friend 's dressing room a few minutes later .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 10]: Lord Adalbert never hurried unless he was on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 20]: He was in evening dress , and an opera hat was set rakishly on the back of his head .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 41]: He was smoking , his hands were thrust into his pockets , and the mere sight of him served again to remind Alec of the larger world in whose daily round Kosnovia and its troubles filled so insignificant a part .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 29]: In an oddly jubilant mood , Alec took a pencil and wrote in large characters on Beaumanoir 's immaculate shirt front , `` Paris -- with care . ''
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 4]: His chum read .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 6]: `` The answer is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 9]: `` We are leaving Delgratz to-night , Berty .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 5]: That is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 7]: `` You do n't say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 7]: He glanced down at the label .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 7]: `` Is this the address ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 12]: Beaumanoir screwed his cigar firmly into the corner of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 21]: `` I am pretty rapid myself , Alec , '' he grinned ; `` but you are too sudden altogether .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 14]: Tell me just what you mean , there 's a dear fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 27]: `` I take it you do n't want to remain here without me , Berty , '' said Alec cheerily , `` and I am off .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 10]: I chucked up my job half an hour ago .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 15]: Joan and Felix started by the mail train that left here at half-past five .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 5]: We follow at midnight .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 6]: My mother goes with us .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 20]: As Bosko is giving her maid a hand in the packing , I must look after my own traps .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 15]: Nesimir 's servants would talk , which is just what I want to avoid .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 18]: The two days in the train will give you plenty of time to learn the harrowing details .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 13]: I have a pretty story for you ; but it must wait .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 25]: I am not cracked , nor sprung , nor trying to be funny ; so you need not look at me in that way .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 32]: I am out of business as a King , for good and all , and the sooner I cross the frontier , the better it will be for my health . ''
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 7]: `` Honor bright , Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 4]: `` Every syllable .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 8]: Now , get a hustle on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 19]: There was a tap at the door , and a servant entered with a note for the King .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 11]: It was from Constantine Beliani , and written in French .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 42]: Prince Michael and Count Julius Marulitch have decided that , in the interests of the State , you ought to make a formal abdication of the throne , appointing the former as your successor , with special remainder to Count Julius .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 38]: I agree with them that this offers the best way out of an unfortunate situation , and I would respectfully point out the urgency that is attached to the proposal if you still contemplate leaving Delgratz to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 26]: Alec bent his brows over this curt missive , which was not couched precisely in the suave words that might be expected from the Greek .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 10]: Read between the lines , its meaning was significant .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 16]: Michael and his nephew , hungering for the spoils , had patched up a truce .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 22]: They were already contemplating another military pronunciamento , and Beliani , having made his own terms , was lending his influence .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 23]: If their demands were refused , Alec might find himself a prisoner , and the country would be plunged into a revolution .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 18]: Under different conditions , he would gladly have measured his wits and his popularity against the triumvirate .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 24]: A call to arms would win him the support of the great majority of the troops and of nearly all the younger officers .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 39]: But a fight for a throne to which he had no claim was not to be thought of ; yet he was adamant in his resolve not to advance the schemes of these rogues by any written statement .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 11]: He handed the note to Beaumanoir with a quiet laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 14]: `` There you have the story in a nutshell , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 17]: `` A few minutes ago I became aware that I am not Prince Michael 's son .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 14]: Although I strove to act fairly , my worthy stepfather is not content .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 21]: He thinks to force my hand , because he fears the republican idea ; but I may best him yet .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 7]: `` Where is Monsieur Nesimir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 16]: he said to the servant , to whom the English conversation was a sealed book .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 12]: `` In his apartments , I believe , your Majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 14]: `` Have instructions been given for mounted orderlies to be in readiness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 23]: `` I heard his Excellency Prince Michael say something of the sort to the officer of the guard , your Majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 6]: The random shot had told .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 11]: Alec felt that he was spinning a coin with fortune .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 10]: `` That is right , '' he said coolly .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 29]: `` Give my compliments to Monsieur Beliani , and ask him to oblige me by coming here for a moment ; Prince Michael and Count Marulitch , too .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 22]: Tell all three that I am ready to attend at once to the matter mentioned in Monsieur Beliani 's note . ''
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 4]: The servant disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 38]: Beaumanoir , who , of course , did not understand the instructions given to the man , was fumigating Beliani 's letter with rapid puffs of smoke , and incidentally scratching the back of his right ear .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 8]: `` Rum go this , Alec ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 3]: he began .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 6]: `` Not a word now .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 11]: You 'll stand by me , Berty , I know .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 14]: Go to my mother 's suite and tell Bosko I want him instantly .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 15]: Bid him bring a brace of revolvers , and see that they are loaded .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 41]: Come here yourself with some ropes , leather straps , anything that will serve to truss a man securely , as soon as you are sure that Michael , Julius , and the Greek are safely in the room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 5]: Beaumanoir scented a row .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 12]: Lest any words of his might stop it , he vanished .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 26]: He must have hurried , too , since Bosko had joined his master before Beliani 's messenger reached the anxious conspirators with Alec 's answer .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 14]: There was no need to ask if the Albanian had brought the weapons .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 8]: They were tucked ostentatiously in his belt .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 8]: Alec looked him squarely in the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 16]: `` I think I can depend on you , Bosko , '' said he . ''
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 5]: _ Oui , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 16]: _ '' `` Understand , then , that I am no longer King of Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 8]: I am not Prince Michael 's son .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 28]: I mean to leave Delgratz to-night , and there is a plot on foot to prevent my departure except on terms to which I shall not agree .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 10]: Will you help me to defeat it ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 5]: _ Oui , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 13]: _ '' `` Within the next minute I shall probably have visitors .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 36]: They may show fight , though I doubt it , I want you to place those two pistols among the clothes in that portmanteau , and be busy , apparently , in arranging its contents .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 17]: When I close the door , you must spring up and cover them with both revolvers .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 22]: Do not shoot without my command ; but make it clear by your manner that their lives are at your mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 7]: Will you do this ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 10]: _ Oui , monsieur _ , '' said Bosko .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 7]: `` Here they are , then .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 4]: Be ready ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 12]: The door was ajar , and footsteps sounded on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 4]: Some one knocked .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 9]: `` Come in , '' said Alec cordially .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 7]: Beliani was the first to enter .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 18]: He pushed the door wide open to assure himself that he was not walking into a trap .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 26]: He saw Bosko on his knees , rummaging in a trunk , and Alec standing in the middle of the room , lighting a cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 9]: `` Come in , '' said Alec again .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 20]: `` My departure is rather hurried , as you know , and I have not a minute to spare .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 8]: Have you brought the necessary documents ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 15]: `` It is a simple matter , '' said the Greek , advancing confidently .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 18]: `` Half a sheet of notepaper with your signature and our indorsement as witnesses will suffice . ''
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 51]: Prince Michael and Julius , reassured by Alec 's manner , and thanking the propitious stars that had rendered unnecessary the dangerous step they were contemplating , entered the room with as businesslike an air as they could assume at a crisis so fraught with import to their own future .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 20]: `` We ought to be alone , '' said Beliani in English , with a wary glance at Bosko .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 13]: `` Oh , for goodness ' sake do n't disturb my man !
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 11]: I have so little time and so much to do !
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 23]: Tell me exactly what you want me to sign , '' and he strode to the door and closed it behind Marulitch .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 16]: The eyes of the three were on him and not on the harmless looking attendant .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 9]: During those few seconds they were completely deceived .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 13]: Prince Michael , finding the path so easy , took the lead .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 13]: `` Just a formal renunciation of the crown , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 30]: `` Give as your reason , if you choose , your inability to fall in with the expressed desire of the Cabinet that you should marry a Serbian lady .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 21]: It is essential that you should name me -- '' The door opened and Lord Adalbert Beaumanoir came in leisurely .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 14]: He carried an assortment of straps , rifled from leather trunks and hatboxes .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 16]: He saw the three men facing Alec , and behind them Bosko 's leveled revolvers .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 25]: `` Not a bally rope to be had , dear boy ; but here 's leather enough to go round , '' he grinned .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 4]: `` By gad !
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 4]: what a tableau !
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 20]: I suppose you mean to gag 'em and then tie 'em back to back , eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 6]: Alec picked up a chair .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 9]: `` Begin with his Excellency Prince Michael . ''
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 16]: Julius Marulitch 's right hand sought the pocket of the dinner jacket he was wearing .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 21]: `` No , Julius , '' said Alec pleasantly , `` move an inch and you are a dead man .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 11]: Bosko has my orders , and he will obey them .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 12]: You may look at him if you doubt my word . ''
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 26]: Marulitch 's well poised head had never before turned so quickly ; but he shrank from a wicked looking muzzle pointed straight between his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 33]: In such circumstances , the caliber of a revolver seems to become magnified to absurdly large proportions , and behind the fearsome weapon Bosko 's immovable face was that of an automaton .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 16]: Beliani 's olive complexion assumed a sickly green tint for the second time that evening .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 17]: `` I was right , '' he muttered ; `` but you would not listen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 22]: `` It is a common delusion of the thief that an honest man has no brains , '' said Alec coolly .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 8]: `` Now , Beaumanoir , get busy .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 16]: Time is flying , and we have little more than an hour to spare . ''
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 54]: Prince Michael , never noted for his courage , began to whimper some words of expostulation ; but Beaumanoir 's strong hands soon silenced him with an improvised gag , for the effeminate little rascal realized that his jaw might be broken if he resisted the stuffing of a towel into his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 40]: In a few minutes the three were seated on the floor , securely bound , and unable to utter more than a gurgling cry , which would certainly not be heard by any one passing along the outer corridor .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 13]: Alec 's cheerful explanation of his action must have been particularly galling .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 24]: `` You will remain here until such time as Stampoff decides that you may safely be set at liberty , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 18]: `` Not you , but he , must provide for the future good government in Kosnovia . ''
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 26]: `` Thanks , Beaumanoir , '' he added , turning from the discomfited trio with a carelessness that showed they gave him no further concern .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 9]: `` Better be off now and get ready .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 8]: Bosko , mount guard outside the door !
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 11]: Allow no one to enter on any pretext whatsoever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 28]: -LSB- Illustration : In a few minutes the three were securely bound Page 298 -RSB- Then he busied himself about the room , followed by vengeful eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 13]: He had brought little into Kosnovia , and he took little away .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 16]: The extraordinary simplicity of his life had rendered unnecessary the usual trappings of a King .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 13]: He had worn no uniform save the plainest of field service garments .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 6]: He possessed no State attire .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 37]: His clothes were mostly those which came from Paris , and it amused him now to change rapidly into the very suit in which he had entered Delgratz , an unknown claimant of the Kosnovian throne .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 41]: Bundling his trunks out into the corridor , he closed and locked the door , and the click of the moving bolt must have sent a tremor through the stiff limbs of the three worthies who lay huddled together inside .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 14]: Bidding Bosko hurry over his own preparations , he descended to the courtyard .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 19]: A number of troopers , standing by their horses ' heads , sprang to attention when he appeared .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 16]: `` You can dismiss your men , '' he said to the officer in charge .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 9]: `` They will not be needed to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 15]: Then he told an attendant to order a couple of carriages for half-past eleven .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 47]: In the reception room he wrote a hasty note to Stampoff : MY DEAR PAUL : -- The legitimate King of Kosnovia and his heir apparent , not contented with the arrangement entered into in your presence , planned with Beliani a _ coup d'état _ .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 4]: I defeated it .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 16]: You will find all three in my bedroom , the key of which I inclose .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 18]: They are alive and well , and will stop there until it pleases you to release them .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 27]: Perhaps you would like to consult with Sergius Nesimir , who by the time you receive this may have recovered the composure so rudely disturbed to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 11]: At any rate , the next move rests with you .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 5]: Farewell and good luck .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 4]: Yours , ALEC .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 23]: Outside his mother 's apartments he came upon Prince Michael 's valet in whispered consultation with Pauline and Princess Delgrado 's maid .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 16]: In the rush of events he had forgotten the two domestics from the Rue Boissière .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 46]: `` His Excellency will not need your services to-night , '' he said to the man , `` and it will meet his wishes in every respect if nothing is said to the other servants as to the departure of the Princess for Paris . ''
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 11]: `` Precisely , your Majesty , '' smirked the Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 22]: `` You , of course , '' he went on , addressing the maid , `` will accompany your mistress . ''
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 20]: `` Yes , your Majesty , '' she said , quite reassured by Alec 's matter of fact manner .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 22]: A glance at Pauline 's honest face showed that nothing had been said of the curious scene witnessed in the bureau .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 24]: To a certain extent , Joan 's humble friend shared his confidence , and it was evident that she had not betrayed it .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 36]: The departure of such a large party probably created some speculation among the palace servants ; but Nesimir did not put in an appearance , and no one dared to question the King 's movements .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 14]: Alec had purposely allowed the barest time for the drive to the station .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 31]: The midnight train , not being an important express , carried few passengers , mostly traders returning to neighboring towns in Austria after conducting the day 's business in Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 29]: The King and his companions , of course , were recognized ; but again it was not to be expected that any official would trouble them with inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 47]: Having secured a compartment for his mother and Beaumanoir , Alec made for the station master 's office , meaning to obtain a messenger who might be trusted to deliver Stampoff 's letter , and he happened to notice a policeman standing near a carriage door .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 9]: A white face peered out through the window .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 4]: It was Sobieski .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 13]: The King and the waiter were quitting Delgratz by the same train !
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 8]: Alec laughed , and the policeman saluted .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 24]: `` When the train has gone , '' said Alec , `` I want you to deliver this letter to General Stampoff . ''
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 11]: `` Yes , your Majesty , '' replied the man .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 7]: `` It is important , remember .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 19]: Here are ten rubles , and ask General Stampoff , with my compliments , for the like amount .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 7]: Take no denial from his servants .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 11]: If he is in bed , he must be awaked .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 14]: Say that I sent you , and there should be no difficulty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 7]: Precisely at midnight the train started .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 25]: Quickly gathering speed , it ran through the tumbledown suburbs of the city and rumbled across the iron bridge that spans the Tave River .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 15]: In twenty minutes it was at Semlin , and Austrian officials were examining passports .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 26]: It was almost ludicrous to find that they gave Alec and his mother a perfunctory glance ; but Lord Adalbert Beaumanoir excited their lively suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 23]: One man , in particular , mounted guard outside the carriage , and did not budge till the train moved on again .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 10]: `` That chap remembers me , '' said Beaumanoir .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 8]: `` Did you notice how he glared ?
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 11]: He was the johnny I slung through the window . ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 27]: At an early hour in the morning Joan was peering disconsolately through the window of a railway carriage at the life and bustle of Budapest station .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 42]: Felix had gone to purchase some newspapers , and the girl was absorbed in gray thought when an official thrust head and shoulders into the compartment and asked if the Fräulein Vernon , passenger from Delgratz to Paris , was within .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 21]: `` Yes , '' gasped Joan , all the slight color flying from her cheeks and leaving her wan indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 46]: `` Here is a telegram for you , fräulein , '' said the man politely , and his civil tone , at least , assured her that she was not to be dragged from the train and subjected to some mysterious inquisition by Austrian police .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 22]: `` Sent care of the station master , '' he explained , `` and we were urgently requested to find you .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 6]: Kindly sign this receipt . ''
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 21]: She scribbled her name on a form , and the man carefully compared it with the superscription on the telegram .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 27]: `` Yes , that is right , '' he said , and at last the agitated girl was free to open this message from the skies .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 33]: It was written in German , probably to insure accurate transmission , and it read : My mother and I , together with Beaumanoir , left Delgratz seven hours later than you .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 4]: Pauline accompanies us .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 13]: We are returning to Paris after having settled affairs satisfactorily in Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 27]: Please await our arrival in Budapest , and accept the statement without any qualification that there is no reason whatever why you should not do this .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 2]: ALEC .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 17]: The amazing words were still dancing before her eyes when Felix came running along the platform .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 18]: He too had been identified by an official , and in his hand was another telegraphic slip .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 18]: `` We need have no secrets between us now , my belle , '' he cried excitedly .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 8]: `` You guess what has happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 15]: `` Alec has left Delgratz -- he and his mother -- Oh , Felix !
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 15]: if he really sent this telegram , why did he not explain things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 21]: `` The explanation would be rather ticklish , when you come to think of it , '' said Felix dryly .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 13]: `` The Austrian Government might take too keen an interest in it .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 7]: Do n't you understand , girl ?
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 9]: He has wrung the truth from some one .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 13]: He is no longer a King , but a very devoted lover .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 11]: Come , we can pass the day pleasantly in Budapest .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 8]: There is nothing else to be done .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 13]: No sense in running away merely for the fun of the thing .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 18]: If Alec is not a King , there is no immediate probability of your becoming a Queen .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 9]: You will be plain Mrs. Somebody or other .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 12]: Now I wonder what in the world his new name is .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 12]: The son of an American father would hardly be called Alexis .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 3]: Horrible thought !
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 20]: You may have to learn to love him all over again as Chauncey , or Hiram , or Phineas .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 17]: Tell me , mignonne , could you take him back to your heart as Phineas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 9]: Joan rose and stepped out on the platform .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 25]: Poluski 's chaffing outburst failed in its intent , though , to his great relief , she did not break down as he feared .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 21]: `` Perhaps he will not want me now , Felix , '' she said , and her eyes were shining .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 6]: `` Oh , fiddlesticks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 4]: cried the hunchback .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 14]: `` Why did he telegraph from the first wayside station after leaving Semlin ?
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 5]: Alec not want you !
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 31]: At this moment he is more proud that he is a free born American than if a miracle almost beyond the powers of Heaven had made him a Delgrado . ''
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 43]: Felix , cynic that he was , was secretly delighted when Joan discovered after breakfast that a blouse which caught her eye in one of the Budapest shops was much more suitable for traveling than that which she happened to be wearing .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 26]: It was also significant that the dust which had gathered in her hair during the long journey from Delgratz required a visit to a coiffeur .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 11]: These straws showed how the wind blew , he fancied .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 20]: And it was good to see the way Joan 's face kindled when Alec clasped her in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 5]: They said little then .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 29]: The why and the wherefore of events they left to another hour ; but when Joan extricated herself from her lover 's embrace she turned to Princess Delgrado .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 19]: The two women exchanged an affectionate kiss ; each looked at the other through a mist of tears .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 5]: Words were not needed .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 7]: They understood , and that sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 11]: In a calmer moment Alec told Joan what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 29]: He laid special stress on the fact that his mother was quite determined to renounce her title and revert to the name she bore during her first marriage .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 32]: `` I never realized the tenth part of her suffering in Paris , '' he said , `` though I knew far more about Prince Michael 's conduct than he guessed .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 18]: We must make it our business , Joan , to bring some brightness into her declining years .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 12]: I have been planning our future all day in the train .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 10]: Shall I become the fortune teller this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 22]: `` Yes , '' she murmured , `` and perhaps I may forget that I have cost you a Kingdom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 37]: He laughed gayly , just as he used to laugh on those bright May mornings when he waited on the Pont Neuf in the hope that he might be permitted to escort her to the Louvre .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 19]: `` Never dream that I shall bring that up against you , dear heart , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 13]: `` Delgratz ought to advertise itself as a sure cure for ambition .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 22]: I liked the people ; but I hated the job , and Kosnovia is already becoming a myth in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 11]: I am rejoicing in my new name , Alexander Talbot .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 6]: I hope you like it .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 17]: My mother tells me that my father was one of the strong men of the West .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 27]: I am called after him , it seems , and although my own name sounds strange to me I like the purposeful ring in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 4]: Joan laughed merrily .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 21]: `` Felix was teasing me this morning by suggesting that you might have been christened Phineas , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 4]: `` The wretch !
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 7]: And what if I was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 9]: She looked at him with a delightful shyness .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 19]: `` No matter what name you bore , you would always be my Alec , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 25]: They were leaning over the balcony of an open air restaurant at the moment ; so Alec perforce contented himself with clasping her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 14]: `` And now for my scheme , little girl , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 12]: `` We will get married at once , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 16]: She made no reply ; but he felt the thrill that ran through her veins .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 54]: `` Then , '' he went on , so gravely that she raised her eyes to his , seeking to catch his slightest shade of meaning ; for her heart was still troubled by the fear that she had wrought him evil , `` I will take you to America , my home .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 10]: There is surely a nest for us out there .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 22]: I have never understood it before ; but often , as a boy , I felt the call of the West .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 7]: It was natural , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 54]: We had many American friends in Paris , and my blood tingled when they spoke of the great rivers , the prairies , the ocean lakes , the giant mountain ranges , and the far flung plains of that wondrous continent which they describe with a reverent humor as God 's own country .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 30]: I feel that I shall win a place for myself in the land of my birth , and my poor mother is aching to go back there again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 33]: He paused , and perhaps he hardly realized why Joan sighed with happiness ; for she could believe , at last , that he had never a pang for his lost kingship .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 29]: -LSB- Illustration : He felt the thrill that ran through her veins Page 306 -RSB- `` It is my home , too , Alec , '' she cooed .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 7]: `` I was born in Vermont .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 7]: We are going home together . ''
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 9]: `` Yes , dear , no more partings .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 8]: We shall not be wealthy , Joan .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 27]: It seems that the miserable little humbug whom I have regarded as my father has wasted the whole of my mother 's fortune by his extravagance .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 34]: The only scrap left is a small farm near Denver , and even that would have been sold had not the crisis in Delgratz offered a wider scope for Michael 's plundering instincts .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 52]: It is a strange thing , sweetheart , but on the day we parted in Paris -- the day the news came of the murder of Theodore and his wife -- Prince Michael quarreled with my mother because she refused to sanction the sale of that last shred of her inheritance .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 35]: In order to vent his spite , he had actually decided to tell me the secret of my birth in the very hour that Julius Marulitch announced the disappearance of the Obrenovitch dynasty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 16]: `` And the goddess sent you east instead of west , '' she said softly .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 28]: `` Yes , my trial has been short and sharp ; but she must have found me worthy , since she has given me -- you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 22]: They reached Paris next evening ; but by that time the newspapers were hot on the scent of the missing King .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 27]: So far as could be judged from the reports telegraphed by French correspondents in Delgratz , Stampoff had remained true to his dream of a monarchy .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 10]: For lack of a better , Michael was King .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 17]: Some one , Beliani probably , had issued a statement that the infatuation of Alexis III .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 49]: for a pretty Parisian artist had led him to abdicate , and as soon as it was discovered that the Delgrado flat in the Rue Boissière was again occupied by Alec and his mother , they were besieged by reporters anxious to glean details of a royal romance .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 28]: They decided , therefore , to leave Paris for London , where , under the name of Talbot , they might hope to escape such unwelcome attentions .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 50]: It was no easy matter to shake off the horde of eager pressmen ; but they succeeded at last , and when Alec and Joan were quietly married in a West End church , no one , except the officiating minister , had the least knowledge of their identity .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 28]: After a brief honeymoon in Devon they rejoined Mrs. Talbot , and the three sailed from Southampton , whither came Felix and Beaumanoir to bid them farewell .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 9]: Bosko and Pauline were on the same ship .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 54]: The taciturn Serb had positively refused to leave his master , though Alec pointed out that his fallen fortunes hardly warranted him in retaining a valet , while Pauline , whom recent circumstances had thrown a good deal in Bosko 's company , declared that Paris no longer had any attractions for her .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 21]: Without consulting any one the two got married , and astounded Mrs. Talbot one fine morning by announcing the fact .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 22]: At the last moment Joan almost persuaded Felix to go with her and her husband ; but he tore himself away .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 32]: `` I peeped into the Grande Galerie the other morning , '' he said , with a real sob in his voice , `` and my poor Madonna looked so lonely !
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 19]: There was no one with her ; just a few painted angels and a couple of gaping tourists .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 5]: I must go back .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 28]: Some day you will come to the Louvre , and you will find me there , _ le pauvre _ Bourdon , still singing and painting . ''
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 6]: He began to hum furiously .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 30]: When the gangway was lowered , and the great ship sidled slowly but relentlessly away from the quay , he struck the tremendous opening note of `` Ernani . ''
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 7]: Beaumanoir grabbed him by the collar .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 8]: `` Shut up , you idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 13]: he said , not smiling at all , for he loved Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 5]: `` This is England .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 12]: If you sing here , a bobby will run you in .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 8]: An ' , anyhow , blank it !
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 7]: why do you want to sing ?
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 7]: This is n't a smoking concert .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 9]: It 's more like a bally funeral ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 28]: CHAPTER XV THE ENVOY In the autumn of the following year , Joan was seated one day in the garden of her pretty suburban house at Denver .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 47]: Not far away glittered a silvery lake ; beyond a densely wooded plain rose the blue amphitheater of the Rocky Mountains ; the distant clang of a gong told of street cars and the busy life of one of America 's most thriving and picturesque cities .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 73]: She was somewhat more fragile than when she crossed the Pont Neuf on that fine morning in May eighteen months ago ; but she looked and felt supremely happy , for Alec would soon be home from his office , where already he was proving that the qualities which made him a good King were now in a fair way toward establishing his position as a leading citizen of his native State .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 52]: By her side in a dainty cot reposed another Alec , whose age might not yet be measured by many weeks , but whose size and lustiness proclaimed him -- in his own special circle , at any rate -- the most remarkable baby that ever `` occurred '' in Colorado .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 25]: Mrs. Talbot , Senior , tired of reading , was now dozing peacefully in an easy chair on the other side of the cot .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 71]: The day had been warm ; but the evening air brought with it the crisp touch of autumn , and Joan was about to summon Pauline , who -- with honorable mention of the unchanging Bosko -- had solved for the young couple the most perplexing problem of American life , -- when the click of the garden gate caught her ear and she heard her husband 's firm step .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 6]: He stooped and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 19]: `` I hope you have passed the whole day in the garden , sweetheart , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' she replied , `` I was just going to send baby indoors .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 19]: Will you tell Pauline it is time he was in bed ; but do not disturb your mother .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 5]: She 's asleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 11]: `` Baby can wait one minute , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 9]: `` He looks quite contented where he is .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 14]: There is news from Delgratz , '' he added in a lower voice .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 7]: `` King Michael is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 12]: An expression of real sympathy swept across Joan 's beautiful face .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 12]: `` I am sorry to hear that , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 48]: Then , with the innate desire of every high-minded woman to find good where there seems to be naught but evil , she added , `` Perhaps , when he reached the throne , he may have mended his ways and striven to be a better man .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 6]: Did he die suddenly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 23]: `` Yes , '' and a curious inflection in Alec 's voice caused his wife to glance anxiously toward the sleeping woman .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 7]: `` Was there a tragedy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 6]: `` Something of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 20]: The details are hardly known yet , and the telegrams published in our Denver newspapers are not quite explicit .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 27]: There is an allusion to a disturbance in a local theater , during which the heir apparent , Count Julius Marulitch , was fatally stabbed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 3]: gasped Joan .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 24]: `` It would seem that this incident took place several days ago , but escaped notice in the American press at the time .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 35]: Attention is drawn to it now by the fact that King Michael was found dead in his apartments at an early hour yesterday morning , and it is rumored that he was poisoned . ''
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 5]: `` How dreadful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 14]: `` It will shock your mother terribly when she hears of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 29]: `` It is an odd feature of the affair , '' went on Alec , `` that the telegram describes the King as residing in the New Konak .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 17]: I suppose he passed the summer months there , and had not yet returned to Delgratz .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 18]: Delightful as the place was , I am glad now we never lived there , Joan . ''
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 9]: She rose and caught him by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 22]: `` Alec , '' she murmured , `` Heaven was very good to us in sending us away from that Inferno !
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 9]: You never regret those days , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 26]: You never think , deep down in your heart , that if it had not been for me you would still be a King ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 18]: He laughed so cheerfully that the sound of his mirth woke both his mother and the baby .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 24]: asked Mrs. Talbot , scanning the faces of her son and his wife with a whole world of affection in her kindly eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 41]: `` Well , nothing to laugh about , mother , '' said he , `` since I was just telling Joan that the end has come for some one in Kosnovia ; but -- '' `` Is Michael dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 8]: interrupted his mother , paling a little .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 9]: `` Yes , mother , he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 24]: She bent her head in brief reverie , and when she looked up again she seemed to be gazing at the smiling landscape .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 5]: But they knew better .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 10]: Her thoughts had flown many a mile from Colorado .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 15]: `` May Heaven be more merciful to him than he was to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 22]: she said at last , and that was her requiem for the man to whom she had given her best days .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 18]: She forgave him ; but she could not find it in her heart to regret his loss .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 42]: When the New York papers reached Denver , the small household -- whose interest in the affairs of far off Kosnovia was little dreamed of by their neighbors -- gleaned fuller details of the tragedy that had again overwhelmed the Delgrados .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 22]: Many times did the conversation turn to the tiny Kingdom with which their own lives had been so intimately bound up .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 41]: So far as the American press was concerned , the topic was soon forgotten ; but Alec , having obtained a Budapest journal , found that Stampoff , Beliani , and Sergius Nesimir were taking steps to form a Republic .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 21]: `` Sometimes , '' said Alec during their talk that evening , `` it is the expected that happens . ''
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 39]: `` I suppose , '' said Joan musingly , `` that the unlucky little Principality ought to prosper under a popular Government -- unless -- '' She paused , and her husband was quick to interpret her thought .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 14]: `` Unless they obtain the right sort of King , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 17]: `` Perhaps that is impossible since you are here , dear , '' she said softly .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 11]: `` Is that bee still buzzing in your bonnet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 3]: he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 19]: `` I agree with you , Joan ; it was a pity I let go so promptly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 8]: She lifted her startled eyes to his .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 6]: `` Oh , Alec ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 11]: she cried , `` you do n't mean it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 17]: `` I do , sweetheart , '' he said with a marked seriousness that puzzled her .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 11]: `` It was sheer selfishness that drove me from Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 27]: I honestly believe I should have cracked up under the weight of empire ; but just fancy what a wonderful Queen you would have made ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 12]: `` Oh , do n't be stupid , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 7]: `` You almost frightened me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 9]: Alec 's mother put in a gentle word .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 34]: `` If ever either of you is tempted to regret the loss of a throne , you ought to devote half an hour to reading the history of Kosnovia , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 18]: `` You are happy , and that is what you would never have been in the Balkans .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 8]: A curse rests on that unlucky land .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 14]: Never a Delgrado or Obrenovitch has reigned a decade in peace and security .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 36]: It was a red letter day for Alec when you brought him away from Delgratz , my dear , '' she continued , with a fond pressure of her hand on Joan 's brown hair .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 47]: `` None of us knew it at the time ; but there are events in life that , like certain short and sharp diseases , leave us all the better when they have passed , though their severity may try us cruelly at the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 23]: The Indian summer day was drawing to a close , and Bosko entered to close the windows and pull down the blinds .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 22]: The sight of him moved Alec to speak in that sonorous Serbian tongue which was already foreign to his own ears .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 9]: `` Do you like America , Bosko ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 22]: The imperturbable one almost started ; for it was long since he had heard any words in his own language . ''
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 10]: _ Oui , monsieur _ , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 16]: `` And would you go back to Delgratz if you had the opportunity ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 5]: _ Non , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 12]: _ '' For a wonder , he broke into an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 24]: `` I can go out here without expecting to be fired at from some hedge or ditch around the next corner , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 11]: You did not know those rascals as I knew them .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 30]: They nearly got you once ; but they tried a dozen times , and would have succeeded too , if Stampoff had not been too sharp for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 7]: `` Good gracious , Bosko ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 4]: said his master .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 7]: `` This is news , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 7]: Why was I not told ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 8]: `` There was no need , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 23]: Each time we discovered a plot we put every man in jail who might be suspected of the least connection with it .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 14]: Moreover , had you heard of these things you would have interfered . ''
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 25]: `` Then , in the name of goodness , why did n't my protectors find out about the attack made by the Seventh Regiment ?
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 15]: Surely there were enough concerned in that to supply at least one spy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 3]: Bosko hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 8]: He glanced surreptitiously at Alec 's mother .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 13]: `` Things went wrong that day , monsieur , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 13]: `` Information that ought to have reached the General was withheld . ''
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 43]: And Alec left it at that ; for the man who might reasonably be suspected of offsetting Stampoff 's vigilance was dead , and no good purpose could be served by adding one more to his mother 's host of bitter memories .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 12]: A bell sounded , and Bosko went to the front door .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 18]: He returned , his stolid features exhibiting the closest approach to excitement that they were capable of .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 38]: Evidently he meant to announce a visitor ; but before he could open his mouth a high and singularly musical voice came from the entrance hall in the exquisite opening bars of the `` Salve Dimora . ''
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 9]: With one amazed cry of `` Felix ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 8]: Joan and Alec rushed to the door .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 26]: Yes , there stood Felix , thinner , more wizened , more shrunken , than when last they saw him on the quay at Southampton .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 13]: Joan , impulsive as ever , welcomed him with a hearty kiss .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 6]: `` You dear creature ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 13]: `` Why did you not tell us you were in America ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 13]: `` An envoy always delivers his message in person , my belle .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 8]: I am here on affairs of state .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 16]: The telegraph is but a crude herald , and I was forbidden to write . ''
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 7]: Alec dragged him into the room .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 10]: `` Business first , Felix , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 9]: `` That is the motto of strenuous America .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 7]: Now , what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 26]: `` Beliani came to me in Paris , '' said the hunchback , affecting the weighty delivery of one charged with matters of imperial import .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 16]: `` He brought with him letters from Stampoff and Nesimir , which I shall deliver .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 22]: He also intrusted me with a copy of a unanimous resolution of the Kosnovian Assembly , passed in secret session . ''
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 29]: Joan 's face suddenly paled , Mrs. Talbot 's hands clenched the arms of the chair in which she was sitting , and the two women exchanged glances .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 11]: None of this escaped Alec , who was seemingly unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 17]: `` Behold in me , then , '' continued Poluski , `` the Ambassador of Kosnovia .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 42]: Delgratz wants again to see its Alexis , who is invited to reoccupy the throne on his own terms , -- wife , infant , mother , Bosko , Pauline , even myself and the domestic cat , all are welcome .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 5]: There are no restrictions .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 14]: At a word from the King even the Assembly itself will dissolve . ''
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 51]: Somehow , Poluski 's manner conveyed that this was no elaborate jest , and Joan 's lips trembled pitifully when , after one look at the youthful Alec , who was lying on a cushion and saying `` Coo-coo '' to a rattle , she awaited her husband 's reply .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 18]: He too looked at her in silence , and even Joan became dematerialized for one fateful moment .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 17]: In his mind 's eye he saw the sunlit domes and minarets of the White City .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 12]: The blue Danube sparkled as of yore beneath its ancient walls .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 33]: Through the peaceful air of that quiet Denver suburb he caught the sound of cheering crowds , the crashing of bells , the booming of cannon , that would welcome his return .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 41]: But he thought , too , of the fret and fume of Kingship , of the brave men and gracious women who had occupied an unstable throne and were now crumbling to dust in the vaults of that gloomy cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 16]: He smiled tenderly at his wife , and his hand stole out to meet hers .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 7]: `` I refuse , Felix ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 4]: he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 13]: Poluski 's piercing gray eyes peered at him under the shaggy eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 6]: `` Is that final ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 5]: `` Absolutely final ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 7]: Felix broke into a hearty laugh .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 9]: `` I warned Beliani , '' he chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 27]: `` No one could have written to me as Joan has done and yet want to return to that whited sepulcher down there in the Balkans .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 19]: Well , here are my credentials , '' and he threw a bundle of papers on the table .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 42]: `` I have done what I was asked to do , and thus earned my passage money ; and now , when I have kissed the baby and shaken hands all round , I will bring in my wedding present . ''
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 18]: A minute later he danced out into the hall and returned with a huge roll of canvas .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 35]: `` I unpacked it at the station , '' he said ; `` so it is ready for inspection , '' and he spread out on the table a replica of the famous Murillo .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 28]: `` There , '' he cried , `` since Joan would not come to the Louvre , I am bringing the Louvre 's chief treasure to her .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 15]: As it is the last , so is it the best of my copies .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 38]: My hand was losing its cunning , I felt myself growing old , so I prayed to that sweet Madonna to give me one last flicker of the immortal fire ere it left me a dry cinder .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 8]: Well , she listened , I think .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 4]: _ Ave Maria !
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 15]: _ the great Spaniard himself would rub his eyes if he could see this .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 18]: Now , I shall go back contented , and dream of the days that are gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 4]: His voice broke .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 15]: He was gazing at Joan , at the glory of maternity in her face .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 13]: `` You are not going back , Felix , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 12]: `` Kosnovia has now lost both its King and its Ambassador .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 11]: You are here , and here you shall stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 17]: `` Yes , dear Felix , '' whispered Joan , `` we have found our Kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 16]: Our court is small ; but there is always room in it for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 52]: So Denver heard wild snatches of song , and listened , and marveled , and a baby cultivated a strange taste in lullabies , and Pallas Athene forgot that one of her chosen sons dwelt in Colorado , or , if she remembered , her heart was softened and she forbore .
