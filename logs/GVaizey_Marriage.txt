Parsing [sent. 1 len. 12]: A QUESTION OF MARRIAGE , BY MRS GEORGE DE HORNE VAIZEY .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 3]: CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 3]: THE BAN .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 37]: The grey London sunlight shone on the face of the patient as she sat facing the long window of the consulting-room , on the finely cut features , sensitive lips , and clear , dilated eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 22]: The doctor sat in the shadow , leaning back in his chair , tapping softly with his fingers upon the desk .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 21]: `` And you must not be afraid , '' he said , following a vigorous cross-questioning with his skilled advice .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 13]: `` That is the most important lesson which you have to learn .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 3]: Banish fear .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 11]: Live it down ; if necessary , crowd it out .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 11]: Do n't allow yourself time to think and grow morbid .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 42]: I tell you frankly that the chances are quite good that you may entirely _ escape _ this curse of your family , but you must understand that the power is in your own hands to increase or diminish those chances .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 13]: Anxiety , depression , loneliness -- these will be your worst enemies .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 15]: You say that you have sufficient means ; that makes things easier all round .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 6]: Cultivate interests ; cultivate friends .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 14]: Search for congenial occupation , and when you have found it -- work !
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 29]: Work hard ; hard enough to make rest grateful when the day is over , and sleep sound -- _ not _ hard enough to feel worn out .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 9]: Avoid fatigue as carefully as you would idleness .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 16]: Take a good holiday twice a year , and as many little breaks as possible .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 21]: Be a hard task-mistress of your mind , but of your body a careful , even an indulgent , guardian .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 10]: The two continually act and react on each other .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 19]: A diseased mind imagines illness where there is none ; a diseased body taints and demoralises the mind .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 4]: Look after both .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 12]: You must allow yourself to be somewhat self-indulgent as regards health .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 31]: There will be other matters which will demand all your courage and self-denial ... '' The girl did not speak , but her eyelashes flickered nervously over her dilated eyes .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 12]: The doctor looked down at the tips of those tapping fingers .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 15]: `` Marriage , '' he said slowly -- `` Marriage is not for you .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 12]: It is better that you should face that fact at once .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 20]: Such a family history as the one you have just related is a standing evidence of selfishness and cruelty .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 23]: Your parents , your grandparents , outraged a great moral law , and you and others are here to pay the price .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 7]: You must not follow their example .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 11]: This handing on of disease must come to an end .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 30]: You may think that in the case of your possible marriage there might not be children ; I will not discuss that point to-day -- it is not needful .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 22]: You are my patient , and you yourself would run a more serious risk of developing the malady as a wife .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 27]: Even the happiest of married lives has responsibilities , anxieties , physical and mental strains , which might easily prove too much for your mental balance .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 16]: It would not be fair to a man to bring that dread into his life .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 11]: Marriage for you would be a cruel and cowardly act .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 22]: For the man 's sake , for your own sake , you must put the idea out of your life . ''
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 26]: There was a moment 's silence in the room , then the girl spoke in a low , faint voice : `` Thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 4]: she said softly .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 34]: With a hand that moved in mechanical fashion she took a little paper packet from her muff , laid it down on the corner of the desk , and rose to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 5]: `` One moment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 5]: cried the doctor hastily .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 34]: In that room , seated in that chair , it had been his lot to speak many sentences of death , but he had not yet hardened himself to maim a life unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 30]: Having dealt his blow , he was anxious to speak a word of comfort to the girl who had said `` Thank you , '' in that quiet voice .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 20]: His keen , hawk-like face wrinkled into a network of lines as he looked at her across the room .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 4]: `` One moment !
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 46]: What I have said may appear hard ; but before you allow yourself to grieve at a possible sorrow , look around at the women whom you know -- married and unmarried -- compare their lives , make what you can out of the contrast .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 43]: There is a large , an increasing number of unmarried women who consider that their own is the fuller and easier lot ; they refuse to give up their liberty to become what is called the ` slave of a household . '
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 23]: There are some unlovely features connected with their cult ; but remember there is always a modicum of truth behind such axioms .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 21]: A married woman , if she is worth her salt , lives not for herself , but for her household .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 17]: If she has wider possibilities of joy , she has also infinitely greater possibilities of pain .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 32]: Even putting the husband apart -- and he as a rule comes first of all -- if she has ten children , she must needs suffer with each of the ten .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 33]: Give her every ease and luxury in the world , and if one of the brood is in trouble , the poor soul must go down to the depths by his side .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 23]: To be a wife and mother is the hardest profession in the world ; some people also consider it the worst repaid .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 14]: Do n't allow yourself to be blinded by sentiment concerning the married life .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 10]: Remember its drawbacks ; exaggerate them if you will .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 21]: Your best medicine is content ; to secure that , cultivate , if needs be , a little intentional blindness .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 13]: Never allow yourself to believe that your happiness is necessarily sacrificed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 11]: `` Thank you , '' repeated the girl once more .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 29]: It was the great man 's duty to exhort , and preach cheerfulness and resignation , but to-day his trained physiological eye gave the lie to his words .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 13]: This was not a woman whom nature had framed to live alone .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 46]: Hers was a tender and appealing grace ; long sweeping lashes lent a veiled softness to her eyes ; her lips were red and curved ; her figure , though slim , was gracefully rounded ; an atmosphere of feminine charm enveloped her whole personality .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 20]: Men would love her , children would love her ; but she must turn from them and live alone .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 16]: The doctor 's thoughts over-leapt professional bounds , and took an intimate , personal tone .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 16]: `` You say you are a comparative stranger in town , '' he said abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 11]: `` You ought to have friends -- plenty of friends .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 9]: My wife is at home every Sunday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 21]: Will you come to see us sometimes , and let us do what we can to help your life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 13]: `` Thank you , '' said the girl for the third time .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 15]: After a moment 's hesitation she added quickly , `` You are very good .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 7]: I should like to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 5]: `` That 's well .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 3]: Come soon .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 12]: We shall expect you next Sunday , or the one following .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 4]: Good afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 21]: The door opened and shut , and the girl found herself once more in the big , grim entrance hall .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 45]: A table of carved oak strewed with cards and letters occupied the centre position ; plaster busts of well-known scientific men stood on brackets to right and left , a glass case containing stuffed birds and fish testified to the doctor 's holiday recreation .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 25]: At the girl 's approach the butler rose from a bench near the door , his expression unconsciously sobering , to match her own .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 40]: All day long he ushered patients into that dull back room , and escorted them to the door after the all-important interview ; he had grown skilful in divining the nature of the verdict which each one had received .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 24]: Occasionally a friend or a relation of the patient came out from that room in tears , but the patient himself rarely wept .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 23]: He walked with mechanical steps ; he stared before him with blank , unseeing eyes , as this young lady stared to-day .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 29]: She was young , too , good-looking , nicely dressed ; the butler was moved to a sigh of regret as he flung open the heavy oak door .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 23]: The girl who was never to marry walked out into the glare of the streets , and turned mechanically towards the west .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 4]: FACING THE MUSIC .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 89]: Jean Goring sat in her boudoir , awaiting the return of her friend and guest , Sunblinds were drawn over the windows , the chairs and sofas were covered with linen , the cushions with dainty muslins ; the carpet was a stretch of dull , moss-like green ; the only bright notes of colour in the room were to be found in the masses of freshly cut roses which adorned the various tables , and in that most radiant flower of all , Jean Goring 's face .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 48]: The laces of the white peignoir , the muslin of the frilled cushion showed out in almost startling beauty the dark mist of hair ; the exquisitely flushed cheeks , dark brows , and curling lashes gave a deepened shade to the violet blue of the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 51]: The rich brunette colouring had a somewhat un-English aspect , yet there was not a drop of foreign blood in the girl 's veins -- she was Irish `` all through , except my mother , who was Scotch , '' as she herself was accustomed to describe her lineage .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 18]: The contour of her face was oval , the profile showed the delicate fineness of a cameo .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 3]: Happy Jean !
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 26]: her beauty was no light gift to pass away with her loss of youth ; beautiful she was now , beautiful she must always remain .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 24]: Age , sorrow , suffering might do their worst ; those who looked on would ever find her the perfection of her type .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 22]: If she lived to be eighty she would be as essentially an artist 's model as she was now at twenty-two .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 5]: The clock struck four .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 22]: Jean put down her book and raised her head from the cushion to listen to the sound of an approaching footstep .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 15]: The door opened , and she beheld Vanna Strangeways ' white , strained face .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 9]: The horrid doctor had given a depressing verdict .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 25]: So much was evident at a glance ; but Jean had too much tact to allow her knowledge to betray itself at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 9]: `` Well , my dearie , back again !
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 6]: I was longing for you .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 17]: Sit down in that nice low chair , and let me be lady 's - maid .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 18]: The streets must be a grill this afternoon , but you 'll soon cool down up here .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 10]: There ; you 'll feel better without that hat .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 9]: Your hair looks charming -- do n't worry .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 9]: It could n't look untidy if it tried .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 4]: Now your gloves .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 7]: I shall peel them right off .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 14]: It will be occupation for an idle hour to turn out the fingers .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 16]: If I were a queen I 'd never , never wear gloves a second time .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 6]: Now those dusty little shoes .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 7]: Your slippers are here all ready .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 3]: Sit still .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 9]: I 'm _ going _ to undo them .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 7]: I love to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 29]: Her white , ringed fingers untied the laces , and pulled off one shoe after another so deftly and daintily that they hardly seemed to touch the surface .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 61]: Then , bending still lower , she gave a deft little pull to the tip of each stocking , thereby altering its position , and giving a wonderful sense of comfort to the tired feet , Vanna Strangeways had sat silent and unresponsive till that moment , but something in the simple thoughtfulness of that last action melted the ice .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 26]: She laid her hands on her friend 's shoulders and spoke in a quivering voice : `` Jean , I 've had a blow . ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 10]: `` Yes , dear , '' said Jean softly .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 15]: She knelt by Vanna 's side , caressing her face with her lovely eyes .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 4]: `` I saw .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 13]: Would you rather tell me now , or wait till later on ?
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 16]: You are tired , you know , and after a rest , and some tea .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 19]: Later on -- '' `` Jean , it 's not what you expected -- what I expected myself .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 13]: I 'm not going to die ; I 'm going to live .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 14]: He thinks there is a good chance that I shall escape the curse .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 16]: He wants me to lead a full , active life -- the fuller the better .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 8]: But -- there is one thing forbidden .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 6]: I may never marry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 12]: Jean 's lips quivered , but she said never a word .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 10]: It seemed to her there was nothing to say .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 30]: Few girls of the early seventies knew any desire for independent careers ; and to Jean to love and to be loved seemed the stun and substance of life .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 12]: She would marry , and her dear Vanna would marry also .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 3]: Of course !
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 48]: They would be loved and won , whispering happy confidences into the other 's ear ; they would bring up their children side by side , with motherly comparisons , consultations , planning for the future ; they would grow old , and boast concerning their grandchildren .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 17]: To be told that one could never marry seemed to Jean the crash of all things .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 7]: She had no consolation to offer .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 9]: Vanna laughed feebly ; a dreary-sounding little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 16]: `` I do n't understand why I feel so quelled , '' she said musingly .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 10]: `` Marriage has never entered definitely into my calculations .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 42]: I have been content with the present , and have felt no need of it ; but I suppose it lay all the time in the background of my mind , firmly settled , as a thing that was to be .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 59]: I took for granted that I should enjoy my youth ; fly about here and there as the mood took me , enjoying my liberty to the full , and then , when I 'd had my fling , about twenty-six or seven , perhaps , marry some dear man and settle down to real , serious living .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 18]: Now I ca n't , and something has gone out of me and left a big gap .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 12]: I feel like a surgeon who has lost his right arm .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 13]: It 's my profession that has gone -- my work in life .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 8]: I shall have to begin again . ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 15]: Jean trembled , and drew nearer , leaning caressingly against her friend 's knee .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 9]: `` Is he _ sure _ , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 5]: Why is he sure ?
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 6]: Is there no chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 7]: He was not thinking of children .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 9]: For my own sake it would be dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 7]: I should have a worse chance .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 18]: He said it would be a sin to put such a dread into a man 's life .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 9]: That finishes it , you see , Jean !
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 12]: The more one loved the less it would be possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' breathed Jean softly .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 33]: Her woman 's heart realised at once the finality of that argument ; she saw the shutters descend over her friend 's life , and knew too deep a sorrow for words .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 21]: The pressure of her hands , the quiver of her lips , were the most eloquent signs of fellow feeling .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 59]: Vanna went on speaking in quiet , level tones : `` I was in the house only half an hour , but when I came out the whole world seemed changed ... The people who passed me in the streets , the ordinary little groups that one sees every day , all launched a dart as they passed .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 26]: A husband and wife strolling along together -- not young and romantic at all , just prosaic and middle-aged , and -- _ content _ .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 21]: They were not any happier than I , perhaps , but they had had their time -- they had lived .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 16]: They had not that restless , craving expression which one sees on so many faces .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 22]: They were content ... It hurt to see them , and a big schoolboy , too , walking with his mother .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 15]: I 'm not fond of boys , and Etons are the ugliest of clothes .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 16]: He was a lanky , freckled , graceless thing ; but -- I wanted him !
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 38]: I wanted to be able to say , ` _ my son _ ' ... One always loves the tots in the Park -- little white bundles with curly heads ; but to-day I envied the nursemaids .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 10]: I wanted to be tired , wheeling my bundle .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 9]: I tried not to look at the people .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 13]: I stared into the shop windows instead ; but they hurt too .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 7]: You know my craze for furniture ?
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 14]: I 've whiled away many hours mentally furnishing my home of the future .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 15]: I had decided the colour for each room , and the scheme of decoration .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 31]: When anything worried me in another house , I consoled myself that it would be different in mine ; when I admired a thing , I made a mental note .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 10]: Jean , I shall have _ no _ home !
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 57]: A boarding-house , an apartment , perhaps a solitary cottage in the wilds , never , never a real warm home with some one to love , and to love me back ... How should you feel if it were you ; if any one had put a blank wall before _ your _ life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 24]: `` As you do , dear -- dazed and broken ; worse , perhaps , for I should not take it so calmly .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 7]: I should storm and rage . ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 6]: You are _ revoltee _ .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 15]: It does n't help , Jean , or I would shriek with the best .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 17]: There is only one thing which rouses my wrath -- I ought to have known before .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 13]: Aunt Mary thought it was kind to bring me up in ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 14]: When I asked questions about my relations she put me off with generalities .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 30]: I thought it was strange that so many of them had been invalids ... I never could understand why I had not seen father for years before his death .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 27]: When I was a child I took for granted that he had been abroad ; later , I scented a mystery and was afraid to ask .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 21]: I suffered tortures , Jean , puzzling over it at nights , trying to piece together scattered bits of information .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 9]: I had terrible thoughts -- the blackest thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 15]: I had visions of him as a forger , shut up in a cell .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 44]: When the bell rang late at night I used to tremble , wondering if it were he escaped from prison , coming to us for shelter ... Then at the end , as so often happens , it came out just by chance .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 34]: Some people were sitting behind a screen at a reception , and they spoke of me -- just a few words , and before I could move I had heard the great secret .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 4]: ` Interesting-looking girl !
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 13]: It is to be hoped she wo n't go mad , too .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 16]: So many of that family -- ' It was like a flashlight over the past .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 7]: I looked back , and understood .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 11]: All the bits fitted , and the mystery was solved .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 26]: I was not the daughter of a criminal -- only of a maniac , who had been shut up for five years before his death .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 42]: That was my grandmother 's mysterious illness , and Aunt Bertha 's too -- pretty Aunt Bertha , who disappeared for a year at a time , for a ` cure , ' and came back looking so worn and sad .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 25]: That was the explanation of my boy cousin 's violent temper , and of the misery of his father and mother after each explosion .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 44]: And I , arrogant young schoolgirl , used to criticise their weakness , and expatiate on the firmness with which I should bring up my own children , and Aunt Mary would look at me so wistfully over the top of her spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 2]: Heigho !
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 16]: Well , then I _ knew _ , and after that I could not rest .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 26]: I grew nervous about myself ; I got into the habit of watching myself , as it were -- waiting for danger-signals , for symptoms .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 85]: I had sense enough left to know that that was the best way to develop all that I dreaded , and this last year I have been waiting for a chance to consult a specialist and thrash out the question , I could not leave Aunt Mary while she was so ill ; after her death there was so much to be arranged ; now at last I 've had my interview , and this is the result , Jean , is it strange ?
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 8]: I never once thought of this verdict .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 24]: It seemed the right and the wise thing to take skilled advice , but what I expected was to be soothed and reassured .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 17]: Aunt Mary always laid such emphasis on the fact that I was my mother 's child .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 16]: It delighted her so , poor soul , to see my quiet , level-headed ways .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 18]: Whenever I had been particularly controlled and sensible , she would repeat , ` Yes , yes !
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 17]: You are a thorough Neale ; there is not one scrap of Strangeways in you . '
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 36]: I expected Dr Greatman to realise as much , and assure me that I had nothing to fear ; that I was not the type ; that some fortunate members of the family always escaped .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 16]: I thought he would perhaps lay down certain rules , restrictions , cautions against over-excitement .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 12]: Never , never for one moment did I expect this . ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 4]: Jean was silent .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 4]: She had feared .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 18]: Ever since receiving her friend 's confidence , her thoughts had hovered round this one absorbing question .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 7]: Would Vanna be justified in marrying ?
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 20]: Now the greatest living authority had answered strongly in the negative , and there was no escaping his decree .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 54]: She looked ahead , seeing her friend throughout the years , a charming girl , a more charming woman ; later on losing her freshness and grace , and becoming faded and tired ; later again , becoming old and infirm , the senses failing -- and always alone , for ever alone .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 20]: The slow tears welled to her eyes , a drop brimmed over and fell on her friend 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 18]: Vanna brushed it away with impatient fingers , straightened her back , and flung back her head .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 15]: `` Oh , do n't cry -- do n't cry over me , Jean .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 21]: We are poor things , we women , if we ca n't face the prospect of making our own lives .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 7]: Put a man into my place .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 4]: Would he pine ?
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 12]: You know very well he would do nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 22]: A man never wants to marry until he meets the right woman , and even then he struggles before he succumbs .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 45]: When he once loves it is different -- he is all fire and impatience , but until that hour arrives he enjoys his liberty , pities the poor fellows who are handicapped with a wife and family , and privately determines to keep clear .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 15]: Here am I -- twenty-three , comfortably off , strong , intelligent , fancy-free .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 17]: Why ca n't I take a leaf out of his book and be content and happy ?
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 55]: Why need I consider myself a martyr because I must live alone , rather than as the wife of some man unknown , who perhaps in even the ordinary course of events might have persistently evaded my path , or had the bad taste to prefer another woman when he _ was _ found ?
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 12]: It is not as if I were already in love . ''
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 9]: Jean drew her brows together in wistful inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 20]: The doubt in her mind was so transparently expressed that Vanna referred to it as to a spoken question .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 8]: `` I know what you are thinking .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 3]: Edward Verney !
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 8]: You think my regrets hover round him .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 12]: It 's not true , Jean , it 's not true .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 12]: I had forgotten his very existence until I saw your face .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 17]: If I had cared , surely my thoughts would have flown to him first of all .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 8]: He is only a ` might-have-been . '
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 52]: I had reached the length of noticing the way his hair grows on his forehead , and his nice , close ears -- that was a danger-signal , I suppose ; and I acknowledge that I have dressed with an eye to his taste , but it has gone no deeper .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 18]: I shall be sorry , but it wo n't _ hurt _ to end our friendship . ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 11]: `` Then why need you -- '' `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 4]: Vanna laughed lightly .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 10]: `` I think he admires my -- ears also !
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 24]: If we saw more of each other we should grow nearer ; I realise that , therefore we must separate with all speed .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 13]: As things are , he wo n't suffer any more than I .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 28]: He is just a dear , simple , unimaginative Englishman , who needs to have things pushed very conspicuously before his eyes before he can see them .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 20]: He knows that I have gone away for a long change after the strain of Aunt Mary 's illness .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 30]: It will be some months before it dawns upon him that my holiday is exceeding its limit ; and by that time my image will have lost its freshness .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 13]: He will be sorry , but he wo n't attempt to follow .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 16]: He 'll say to his friends , ` pity Miss Strangeways has left the place .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 7]: She was a jolly girl . '
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 22]: But if all had been well , I might have been his wife -- '' There was silence for several minutes .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 37]: Each girl was thinking deeply of the future ; pondering over the difficulty of mapping out a life which seemed to have no settled direction , Vanna had many gifts , but no one outstanding talent .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 33]: Until this moment she had never dreamt of taking up any work outside the domestic circle ; but it would be impossible to fritter away life in the care of self alone .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 5]: What could she do ?
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 12]: She herself had announced her decision of leaving her native town .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 5]: Where could she live ?
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 17]: After puzzling the problem in a circle for several minutes , Jean ventured another timid question .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 17]: `` Have you thought , dear ; have you any idea what you will do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 5]: `` I have thought .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 17]: I know I must leave Coverley , but that is as far as I can get .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 15]: I must wait until I have calmed down and can think it out quietly .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 11]: But I should like to be near you , Jean .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 25]: You are the person I care for most on earth , and failing a personal romance I must take you for my lifelong love .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 7]: You wo n't want me always .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 20]: When you are happy you will be independent of my services ; but you ca n't always be happy .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 22]: There must come times when you are ill , or anxious , or miserable , when I shall have my chance .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 7]: You will need a woman then .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 61]: When the babies are teething ; when the boiler bursts on Christmas Eve , and the cook leaves at an hour 's notice ; when you want to make jam , or re-cover the furniture , or to leave everything behind , and go off honeymooning with your husband , ` send for Vanna ' must be a household word .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 19]: I shall be your ` Affliction Female , ' always ready to be called in in an emergency .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 11]: Fancy _ me _ an ` Affliction Female . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 6]: `` A Consolation Female ! ''
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 14]: corrected Jean softly , and Vanna looked at her with a lightening eye .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 5]: `` That 's better .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 5]: Thank you , Jean .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 19]: Well , that will be one object in life -- to help you , when you need help .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 7]: You will marry , of course .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 30]: It is impossible to think that any man could refuse to love you if you wished it , and the time will come when you _ will _ wish .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 18]: It will be a tremendous interest to know your home , and your husband , and children .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 28]: Dr Greatman told me that I was to compare my life as a spinster with the life of married women ... I 'll compare it with yours .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 18]: There will be moments when I shall be gnawed with envy , but perhaps , who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 12]: there may be times when you may envy me in return .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 40]: At any rate , you 'll be sweet to me , dear -- I know that ; and you must let me help you to entertain the dull bores , and keep the charming eligibles out of my way .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 14]: I do n't want to be driven away by a second Edward Verney .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 20]: It 's a mercy I am only ` interesting , ' and not a beauty , like you . ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 14]: `` Yes , it is , '' sighed Jean , in unthinking agreement .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 26]: Vanna 's lips twitched , her eyes flashed a humorous glance at her own reflection in the glass at the opposite end of the room .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 4]: THE ROSE WAITS .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 34]: The evening after her interview with the doctor , Vanna Strangeways accompanied her friend to a ball , and had her first experience of society under the altered mental conditions of her life .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 76]: Her first impulse had been to excuse herself and stay at home , but she was an unusually reasoning creature for her twenty-three years , and a short mental cross-examination was sufficient to reject the idea , `` Can I go to her and say , ` Jean , I am sorry ; it is impossible that I can marry any of the men at the ball , so I would rather not go ' ?
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 10]: What nonsense , what folly , what degradation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 44]: She put on her prettiest frock , spent an extra ten minutes over her hair ; and even beside the radiant beauty of Jean in her pale pink tarlatan , attracted notice as one of the most interesting and distinguished of the dancers .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 18]: The floor was good , the music inspiriting , her programme was filled from beginning to end .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 23]: She tried bravely to enjoy the evening in her old , unthinking fashion , and was furious with herself because she failed .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 39]: There was no use denying the fact : something had disappeared which had been there before , the absence of which strangely transformed the scene -- an interest , a zest , a sense of mystery and uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 25]: They had lain so far in the background that she had not realised their presence , but they had been present all the same .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 52]: Each strange man to whom she had been introduced held within his black-coated form a dazzling possibility ; her young eyes searched his face even as his searched hers -- alert , critical , inquiring ; for the moment each represented to the other the mystery , the fascination of sex .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 52]: After the dance , as they sat talking lightly in some cool shade the inner voice in each brain was holding a council of its own : `` Who , and what are you , inside that smiling form ; what sort of a man , what sort of a woman ?
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 18]: Do you , can you , by any possible chance , belong to _ me _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 26]: The modern young man and maiden may indignantly deny that such a feeling , conscious or unconscious , has any bearing on their social joys .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 26]: Vanna belonged to an age far more frankly sentimental than to-day , but she also protested , and felt humiliated when convicted against her will .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 15]: Yet what shame can there be in the acknowledgment of a natural magnetic force ?
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 48]: Empty a ballroom of all except relations within the prescribed calendar , set a man to dance with his sisters and aunts , a girl with her brothers and uncles -- would any one of the number dare to maintain that enjoyment continued in the same ratio ?
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 32]: Vanna was fond of dancing , but not to the same extent as Jean , who often declared that she would waltz with a clothes-prop sooner than not waltz at all .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 21]: With Vanna the enjoyment of movement was always subservient to the mental pleasure of meeting and talking to new partners .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 61]: She preferred a good conversationalist to a good waltzer , but this evening the ordinary topics of the ballroom seemed painfully lacking in savour ; she could feel in them no interest , no merriment , no curiosity ; her partner 's words seemed to float past , a dull , wearisome echo that had no meaning in her ears .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 25]: She was as one who had returned home after long wandering in a foreign land , to find herself helplessly out of her element .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 13]: She looked at the gay stream of dancers as across a gulf .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 55]: Two days ago she had been one of themselves , as carelessly happy , as confidently gay ; now , after the passage of a few short hours , she stood apart , conscious through all her nature that she had outgrown a stage ; had passed on , and left her friends behind .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 26]: Vanna 's partners were at a loss to understand her dullness and lack of response , for she had the reputation of wit and charm .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 37]: Failing in their efforts to excite her interest , they shortened the time of waiting between the dances , by leading her back to the ballroom , and hastening off in search of a livelier companion .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 14]: She saw through their devices , and smiled to herself with dreary amusement .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 11]: `` This is no place for you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 7]: You must give up these frivolities .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 11]: You have to fill a gap and discover a solace .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 10]: You 'll never find it in a ballroom . ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 16]: At twelve o'clock supper was in full swing in the big dining-room of the house .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 24]: In the seventies , hosts had not acquired the present-day convenient , if less hospitable habit of entertaining their friends in a hotel .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 21]: They contentedly suffered days of discomfort , and turned out every room in the house to gain the desired effect .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 56]: In the present case the floors of the two great drawing-rooms , which ran the entire length of the house , were covered with a white waxed cloth , while the walls , with their treasures of water-colours , miniatures in cases , and old brass sconces , made a picturesque background to the scene .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 46]: Leading out of the second drawing-room was a spacious conservatory , in which seats were placed , on which the guests could rest in comparative coolness and quiet between the dances , while the conservatory itself gave access to a balcony hung with coloured lanterns .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 32]: Vanna sat beside the door of the first dancing-room , and saw with a sigh of relief that the hands of a clock near at hand pointed to half-past twelve o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 43]: Only half an hour more and the evening would be over , for Jean , with her usual tact , had suggested an early return , and at one o'clock the two friends had agreed to meet and make their adieux together .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 5]: Thank Heaven for that !
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 60]: But the half-hour that remained promised to be unusually long , for , mindful of her early departure , Vanna had refused to fill her programme beyond a certain point , and now supper arrangements had upset the sequence of dances , substituting for the printed items a number of extras , for which she had made no engagements .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 50]: She had all a normal girl 's hatred of the part of wallflower , and was contemplating a retreat upstairs , when the daughter of the house suddenly approached and addressed her by name : `` Miss Strangeways , is it possible that you have a dance to spare ?
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 25]: I have a truant here who has just made his appearance , and expects me to find partners at this hour of the night .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 23]: He does n't deserve any mercy , but if you could take pity upon him , it would be very noble . ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 43]: Vanna looked past the speaker and beheld a tall , spare man , with a sunburnt face , out of which a pair of brown eyes smiled at her with the frankness of a lifelong friend , rather than a complete stranger .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 46]: It was impossible not to smile back , and it was with a reviving thrill of interest that she held out her programme , saying laughingly : `` My partners for the regular dances are busy eating boned turkey , while I am left lamenting .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 9]: I am not engaged for the extras . ''
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 4]: that is fortunate !
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 11]: Let me introduce you , then , in due form .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 21]: Mr Gloucester -- Miss Strangeways ... You are a lucky man , Rob , to find Miss Strangeways disengaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 20]: She rustled away , and the tall man seated himself by Vanna 's side with a sigh of content .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 21]: He did not ask for dances , however , and it was she who made the first move towards conversation .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 16]: `` Have you really just arrived , or is that merely a figure of speech ?
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 9]: You have not been dancing at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 5]: He shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 11]: `` I have not been in the room five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 18]: I am an even worse offender than you suppose , for I am staying in the house .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 10]: I did not intend to come down at all .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 41]: I was going to bed , but there was such a confounded noise going on that there seemed no chance of sleep -- '' For the first time that evening Vanna found herself surprised into a bright , natural laugh .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 29]: The man 's utter unconsciousness redeemed his remark from any hint of rudeness ; and she felt nothing but pure refreshment in so unusual a point of view .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 28]: She leant back in her chair , looking at him over the top of a waving fan , with a scrutiny as frankly unembarrassed as his own .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 35]: The deep tan of his skin spoke of a sojourn under eastern skies , as did also the lines round the eyes -- the result of constant puckerings to avoid the sun 's glare .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 56]: His hair was brushed in a straight line across his forehead , the chin itself was slightly square , but the line of the jaw was finely , even delicately rounded ; he was clean shaven , and his mouth was good to look at , the lips well shaped , and fitting closely together .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 22]: His age might have been anything from thirty to thirty-five , but there was something inherently boyish in manner and expression .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 10]: `` You evidently do n't care for dancing . ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 6]: I 'm out of practice .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 27]: I have been abroad for the last ten years , in out-of-the-way places for the most part , where balls do n't come into the programme .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 33]: I 'm afraid I 'm not much of a partner , but if you will be good enough to try -- '' `` But I am not anxious to dance any more .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 6]: I am tired and hot .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 13]: If you are contented to talk -- '' `` You mean it ?
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 2]: Really ?
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 7]: That _ is _ jolly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 4]: he cried eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 15]: `` Then , what do you say -- shall we go to the balcony ?
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 14]: It 's quieter there , and we may get a breath of air .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 17]: There are some comfortable chairs , I know , for I helped to arrange them . ''
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 6]: Vanna rose , nothing loath .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 36]: The evening was closing more pleasantly than she had anticipated , for this Mr Gloucester was a distinct change from the ordinary habitue of the ballroom , and his conversation promised to afford some interest .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 23]: She seated herself in a corner of the balcony and put a leading question : `` You say you have lived abroad .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 5]: Where does that mean ?
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 3]: India ? ''
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 15]: `` India mostly ; but I have done a lot of wandering about . ''
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 10]: `` Are you by any chance a soldier ? ''
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 7]: `` Thank Heaven , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 25]: She was both startled and amused by the vehemence of his denial , and looked at him curiously with her wide , grey eyes .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 5]: `` Why this fervour ?
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 14]: Most men would consider it a compliment to be asked such a question .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 8]: Do you despise soldiers so heartily ? ''
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 7]: `` No , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 46]: As the times go , they are a necessary evil , and there are fine fellows among them -- splendid fellows , one ought to be grateful to them for their self-sacrifice ; but for my own part I 'm unspeakably thankful to have escaped .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 29]: Think of spending all one 's life preparing for , playing at , a need which may never arise -- which one _ hopes _ may never arise .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 6]: I could n't endure it .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 15]: Give me active service the whole time -- the more active the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 6]: `` Service in what capacity ?
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 12]: As a -- '' `` Oh , I have no profession .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 22]: I am just an ordinary business man -- buying and selling , and watching the markets , like the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 9]: Vanna pursed her lips with a militant air .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 19]: `` I think a very good case might be made for the soldier _ versus _ the merchant .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 13]: He works , or waits , for the good of his country .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 17]: There is precious little to be made out of it from a personal point of view .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 8]: A merchant 's aim is entirely selfish .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 11]: He is absorbed in piling up his own fortune . ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 4]: Mr Gloucester laughed .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 15]: `` Oh , you are too down on the poor merchants , Miss Strangeways .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 25]: They have their own share in helping on the country , and it 's not every man who can get a fortune to pile .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 7]: I ca n't , for one .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 14]: The faculty of gaining money is as inherent as the writing of poetry .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 11]: Some fellows like myself can never attain to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 14]: He held out his right hand , pointing smilingly at the hollow palm .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 5]: `` Look at that .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 16]: Palmists would tell you that with that hand I shall never ` hold money . '
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 22]: The day may come when I should be thankful to exchange my fortune for the soldier 's shilling a day . ''
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 5]: Vanna did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 13]: She was looking at that hollowed palm with puckered , thoughtful glance .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 4]: `` Palmist ! ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 7]: she repeated slowly , `` fortune-telling !
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 21]: It 's not often one hears a man quoting such an authority ; but you have lived in the East .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 10]: I suppose that unconsciously alters the point of view .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 12]: India is the land of -- what should one call it ?
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 8]: -- superstition , mysticism , the occult .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 9]: It is a subject which fascinates me intensely .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 26]: I know very little about it ; I 'm not at all sure that it is good to know more ; but -- it beckons .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 13]: Tell me , have you seen anything , had any extraordinary experiences ?
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 17]: Are the stories true , for instance , that one hears of these native jugglers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 16]: `` Snake-charming , you mean , the boy in the basket , the mango trick ?
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 4]: Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 21]: I 've seen them often , on the deck of a ship , as well as on the open plain .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 29]: People say it is hypnotism , that the fellow does n't really do it , only makes you _ think _ he does ; but that 's rubbish .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 16]: It 's sleight-of-hand , uncommonly clever , of course , but pure and simple conjuring .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 44]: The mango is chosen because he can get dried-up specimens , several specimens , of different sizes , to which he attaches false roots , and it is a plant which will quickly expand beneath the water with which he deluges the ground .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 57]: All that sort of tricks can be explained , but there are other things more mysterious : the transmission of news from station to station , so that it is known in the bazaars before the post can bring the letters , the power of reading others ' minds , of seeing into the future . ''
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 18]: `` But you do n't believe , you ca n't seriously believe that that is possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 23]: Robert Gloucester bent forward , his elbows crossed on his knees , his brown , extraordinarily clear eyes fixed on her face .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 17]: How shall one dare to put a limit to what is possible even in material things ?
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 9]: Look at this new electricity , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 16]: One can not imagine all that it may mean in improved facilities for the world .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 7]: Its power seems immense -- illimitable .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 24]: If we live to grow old , Miss Strangeways , we shall see things as everyday occurrences which would seem fairy-tale impossibilities to-day .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 32]: The most conservative man would hardly deny that ; then why should he be presumptuous enough to suppose that in the spiritual plane we have reached the limits of our powers ?
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 4]: It is unthinkable .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 41]: There are forces -- binding forces , electric forces -- hidden away in the most commonplace human soul , only awaiting development , powers which may revolutionise our lives , even as this new electricity will revolutionise the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 12]: Vanna stared out into the night with rapt , unseeing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 24]: Life , which a few minutes ago had seemed so dreary in the flat barrenness of outlook , became suddenly illumined with interest .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 20]: She felt the stirrings within of new life , new powers , and reached out eagerly to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 22]: `` You have had experiences yourself -- _ personal _ experiences -- which prove to you the existence of such powers .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 7]: Can you tell me about them ?
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 25]: I do n't ask out of curiosity alone ; but if it is too sacred , too private , I shall quite understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 11]: He smiled at her with an utter absence of embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 8]: `` Oh , there is nothing private .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 26]: My convictions are not founded on any definite occurrence ; but as it happens , I _ have _ had one experience which defies explanation .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 31]: Not in India , but by all that is _ mal a propos _ and out of place , in the most modern and material of cities -- New York .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 9]: I 'll tell it to you with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 21]: It 's an uncommonly good tale , and it has the merit of being first-hand , and capable of proof .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 6]: It came about like this .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 25]: A man asked me to dine in a private room at a hotel with two or three other men , bachelors -- mutual friends .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 23]: While we were sitting over dessert , he said , ` I 've got a little excitement for you fellows this evening .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 20]: I 've engaged a conjurer -- thought-reading sort of fellow , to come in and give you an exhibition .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 16]: He 's quite the most uncanny thing in that line that I 've ever met .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 13]: I never believed in second-sight before , but it makes one think .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 15]: He 'll give you a new sensation ; I can promise you that . '
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 12]: `` Well , he came about half an hour after that .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 45]: An ordinary-looking fellow -- a white man ; nothing in the least unusual about him except his eyes -- light , colourless-looking eyes , extraordinarily wide and clear -- eyes that gave one an uncanny sort of thrill when they were fixed upon you .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 19]: You felt that those eyes could see a lot more than would ever fall to your own vision .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 42]: Well , he told us to sit against the wall at the far end of the room , and each to write something as personal as possible on slips of paper , which were afterwards to be shuffled and handed round .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 10]: While we were writing he would leave the room .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 16]: When we had finished , we were to ring a bell and he would return .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 8]: We ranged our chairs as he said .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 14]: There were no windows on that side , only the bare papered wall .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 8]: I could n't think what to write .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 15]: It puzzles one when one is suddenly told to do a thing like that .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 24]: Eventually I put my mother 's maiden name , ` Mary Winifred Fielding , ' and the date of her marriage , 1822 .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 21]: The fellow next me showed me his slip , ` I do n't believe in any of this trickery . '
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 8]: We chuckled together while I read it .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 20]: We folded up the papers , put them in a bowl , and drew out the first that came .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 12]: Then we rang the bell , and the fellow came back .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 11]: He first shut the door and leant back against it .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 20]: There were a good eight or ten yards between him and the end of the room where we sat .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 13]: He looked across at me , and we all laughed together . ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 15]: ` The words written on the paper in your hand are : `` Burmah !
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 10]: To the memory of a good old time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 32]: You did not write it yourself -- you have never been in Burmah ; it was the gentleman to your left who wrote it -- the gentleman with the grey hair .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 9]: Am I not right , sir ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 11]: ` You are , ' said my friend , gasping .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 7]: We did not laugh any more .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 15]: He pointed to another fellow , and read out what I had written . ''
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 12]: ` That was written by the gentleman with the brown eyes .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 20]: It is his mother 's name , ' he said ; and I felt cold all down my spine .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 22]: The man who had showed me his paper had drawn his own slip when they were shuffled together in the bowl .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 6]: The conjurer knew that too .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 23]: He pointed at him and said : ` You have written your own opinion of me in the paper you hold . ''
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 14]: _ I do n't believe in any of this trickery _ . '' '
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 24]: He paused for a moment , and then said quietly : ` You are prejudiced , sir ; but you will learn wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 11]: A year from to-day you will understand my secrets . '
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 29]: He drew himself up , and his eyes flashed ; he turned to us , each in turn , and said a few , short , prophetic words .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 29]: There was a poor barrister among us , a clever fellow , but he had no luck ; he was in a very tight place at that time .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 32]: He said to him : ` on the 2nd of February , 1862 , you will put your foot on the first step of the ladder which leads to fortune . '
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 7]: That was five years later on .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 18]: The poor fellow smiled and said : ` ca n't you hurry it on a bit ? '
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 9]: The man who was dining us came next .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 7]: He did n't like his share .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 16]: It sounded cryptic enough to the rest of us , but _ he _ understood .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 8]: You could see that by his face .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 29]: My own message -- '' He stopped short , laughing softly , but with an utter absence of embarrassment , and Vanna 's eager glance bespoke her curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 16]: `` My own message was equally cryptic , but I did _ not _ understand .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 7]: I do n't understand it now .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 19]: I have not been too fortunate in money matters , and it refers to that , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 14]: He said : ` you will seek fortune , and find it not .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 16]: Where the rose blooms beneath the palm , there awaits your treasure . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 11]: ` Where the rose blooms beneath the palm ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 9]: Vanna repeated the words in a breathless whisper .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 8]: `` But how thrilling -- how exciting !
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 5]: What could he mean ?
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 10]: Are n't you anxious ; are n't you curious ?
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 14]: Do n't you go about daily waiting to see what will happen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 7]: Mr Gloucester laughed with boyish abandon .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 4]: `` Rather not !
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 37]: It is a good eight years ago , and it has less chance of being fulfilled at this moment than it has ever had before , for I have said goodbye to the land of palms .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 38]: I should never think of it again but for the fact , '' -- his face sobered swiftly -- `` that two out of those five prophecies did , as a matter of fact , come true .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 17]: Three out of the six men who were there that evening I have never seen again .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 28]: I ca n't tell you what happened in their cases , but by the most absolute chance I ran up against the barrister fellow two years ago .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 22]: We talked about our last meeting , and he said : '' ` You remember what that fellow said to me ?
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 8]: It came true to the very hour .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 12]: I had to speak in my first good brief that morning .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 25]: I made a hit , carried the case , got a heap of kudos , and have never looked back from that hour . '
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 17]: The second man was the one who had said he did not believe in such trickery .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 7]: He -- '' `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 4]: `` He died .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 8]: Within a year from our meeting . ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 13]: Vanna shivered , and drew her scarf more closely round her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 21]: There was silence for several minutes , while the beating of invisible wings seemed to throb in the air around .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 29]: Her thoughts strayed away on a long , rambling excursion , from which a sudden crash of music from the band awoke her with a shock of remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 6]: `` You look quite scared .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 11]: I hope I have n't depressed you with my reminiscences .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 14]: It was an uncanny experience , but you said you were interested . ''
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 5]: `` And I am .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 2]: Immensely .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 8]: Thank you so much for telling me .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 20]: I only hope your fulfilment , when it comes , may be as satisfactory as your barrister friend 's .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 11]: Are you sorry to leave India and settle at home ?
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 16]: Most men seem to find it difficult to get back into the old ways . ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 5]: Mr Gloucester shrugged carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 8]: `` Oh , I do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 6]: It does n't trouble me .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 13]: One does one 's work ; one is tired ; one rests .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 11]: What does it matter what country one does it in ?
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 6]: They both have their points .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 8]: I can be happy in either . ''
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 12]: A glance at his face proved the truth of his words .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 33]: His was one of the unexacting , sweet-tempered natures , which was content to take life as it was ; enjoying each good which came , and troubling nothing for sorrows ahead .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 13]: `` If he were in my place he would not be sad !
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 19]: His life has not gone too smoothly ; he has not found success , but he is content .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 12]: I must learn his lesson , '' Vanna told herself mentally .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 6]: `` Go on talking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 4]: she said dreamily .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 5]: `` Do you mind ?
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 8]: Tell me about things that have happened .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 20]: I have lived all my life in a little English hamlet , and it 's so good to hear .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 7]: I could listen for hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 29]: He gave her a bright , pleased look , and without question or protest went on talking easily and pleasantly about Indian customs , peculiarities , and rites .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 56]: He had lived in the great cities and in the wilds ; had worked and played , hunted elephants and climbed Himalayan peaks ; had come through hair-breadth dangers , had drunk Bass 's beer on a steaming plain , and , as he himself expressed it , `` come out smiling every time . ''
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 13]: `` I 'm as strong as a horse , '' he added .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 19]: `` A fellow has no right to grumble when he does n't know the meaning of pain . ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 15]: `` I should not think you ever grumbled , '' replied Vanna , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 17]: The next moment she started as the chime of a distant clock struck on her ear .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 6]: `` What time was that ?
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 10]: The half-hour , was n't it -- half-past one ?
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 8]: Have we been here nearly an hour ?
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 4]: It seems impossible .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 36]: It is a great compliment to your powers of conversation , Mr Gloucester , for before we met I was feeling terribly tired and bored ; but I am afraid I must run away now .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 17]: I arranged to leave at one o'clock , and I must be already in disgrace . ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 15]: `` I 'm awfully grateful to you for having listened to me so kindly .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 12]: I hope we shall meet again , and continue the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 11]: I am staying with these people for a few weeks .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 6]: They are old family friends .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 13]: It 's the nearest approach to a home I have left . ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 6]: I hope we may meet .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 19]: I am only a guest in town like yourself , but I am making a longish stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 26]: Vanna led the way through the conservatory , walking with somewhat rapid footsteps , her eyes looking forward through the door leading into the ballroom .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 35]: She had reached the centre of the floor when she was arrested by the sound of a laugh , and a light , flute-like voice breaking across the crash and clatter of the band .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 4]: cried the voice .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 7]: `` Have you come at last ?
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 6]: I am waiting for you .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 7]: How long must I wait ? ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 4]: Vanna wheeled round .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 32]: Beneath the shade of a great palm tree , whose leaves swept the glass roof , stood Jean in her rose draperies , a wreath of roses crowning her dark head .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 6]: `` I am waiting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 20]: she said once more , and her eyes , passing by Vanna , rested on Robert Gloucester 's face .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 18]: Vanna looking at him , saw his teeth clench , and his cheeks pale beneath their tan .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 3]: RIVAL INTERESTS .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 23]: That night Vanna lay awake long after lying down , living over again the dramatic happening of the last few days . ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 23]: ` It 's a mad world , my masters , ' '' she said to herself between a smile and a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 61]: `` No sooner do I receive a sentence of celibacy for life than I am promptly introduced to a new and interesting personality , a nice man , a superlatively nice man , a man , moreover , who shows every sign of returning the compliment and thinking me a superlatively nice girl into the bargain -- when , presto !
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 12]: he discovers himself in the light of Jean 's future husband .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 9]: I know it , and she does n't .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 6]: The drollness of the situation !
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 21]: At this moment she is sleeping in placid innocence , while I am a-thrill at the dawning of her romance .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 9]: She will marry him -- oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 17]: She will marry him ; as certainly as she stood under that palm tree waiting to-night .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 18]: What a lovely rose she made , and how his eyes glowed as he looked at her !
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 30]: Superstition or no superstition , that big , simple heart has accepted her as his wife as unquestionably as if a trumpet blast from heaven had proclaimed her name .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 27]: It 's such an easy thing to tumble into love with Jean ; the trouble is for any masculine thing to keep steady on his feet .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 20]: He will worship her , and she must love him in return , as the perfect complement of herself .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 31]: He so calm , and trustful , and serene ; she , airy , impulsive , rebellious ; but even in her naughtiest moods so lovable and feminine a thing .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 28]: as I am never to have a romance of my own , I must needs find double interest in Jean 's and enjoy myself vicariously through her .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 6]: It will be quick work .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 18]: That dramatic meeting carried him in a flash past all the initial stage of wonder and uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 23]: It 's rather a pity , I should have loved to watch it grow ; but it has sprung into life full-grown .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 17]: Oh , Jean , Jean , how little you know -- how little you guess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 34]: Then Vanna 's thoughts flew back to the moment when , on the way through the ballroom , she had found herself alone with Robert Gloucester after the dramatic encounter in the conservatory .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 20]: Their eyes had met , and she had spoken a few words on the flood of an overwhelming impulse .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 7]: `` I wo n't tell her .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 7]: I promise not to tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 10]: `` Thank you , '' he had replied warmly .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 6]: `` It will be better .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 43]: I would rather -- '' He paused at that , but there was about him a transparency of candour which made it easy to divine what he had been about to say , `` I 'll would rather tell her myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 16]: Vanna 's heart knew a little cramp of envy at all which that sentence implied .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 25]: Next morning , over a late and leisurely breakfast , Jean had much to say on the subject of her last night 's experiences .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 24]: `` I danced a hole in my slippers -- a little one , and quite a big one in Captain Gregson 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 10]: He is , like all sailors , absurdly susceptible .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 9]: I made only my second-best eyes at him .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 3]: Like this !
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 36]: In my best effort I look up helplessly , appealingly , and then , down , quite a long time down , because curling dark eyelashes look so well when one 's cheeks are flushed .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 26]: I just opened them rather widely at the Captain once or twice as we sat out after a dance , and he fell down flat .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 17]: Dear , big , stupid thing , he ca n't take care of himself one bit .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 15]: He asked if he might call , but I sha n't be at home .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 35]: I always stop short of the danger-point , as you know quite well , so do n't make faces at me , my dear , and , above all things , do n't preach .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 17]: If you preached , I might be capable of seeing him , and showing my eyelashes .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 9]: Opposition always drives me hard the other way .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 6]: You looked tired , dear .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 4]: Were you bored ?
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 9]: Three separate men asked me who you were .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 26]: I dissembled , and said you were ` a Miss Strangeways , ' and listened with all my ears to what they would say next .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 15]: One said , ` she is not exactly pretty , but one notices her .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 6]: She has an air . '
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 14]: Another said , ` I do like to see a girl well groomed .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 10]: It 's refreshing to look at her head . '
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 12]: The third said , ` that girl would be worth knowing .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 8]: It 's a fine face . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 9]: Vanna 's smile was a somewhat laboured effort .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 10]: `` You must n't repeat masculine compliments , Jean .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 5]: They are forbidden sweets .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 21]: I shall never settle down into a steady-going ` Affliction Female ' if you dangle worldly gauds before my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 9]: I 'm not going to any more balls .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 24]: My capacity for frivol has died a violent death , and I feel all ` out of the picture ' in a ballroom .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 11]: I must find more serious occupations for my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 6]: `` Vanna , what rubbish !
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 13]: You are only twenty-three ; you have your whole long life ahead .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 21]: If it 's going to be dull , that 's all the more reason why you should enjoy yourself now .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 15]: I thought you would live in town , and we should do everything together .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 36]: Ca n't you forget the future , dear , and enjoy the hour -- buying pretty things and wearing them , and music , and flowers , and dancing , and talking things over afterwards ?
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 25]: That has always been one of the best bits -- comparing notes after the fray ; making fun of other people , and ourselves !
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 18]: _ Do n't _ fall out , Vanna , and leave me to go on alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 8]: `` You wo n't be alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 15]: The words were spoken instinctively , but Vanna drew herself up with instant compunction .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 20]: `` You have so many other friends , Jean , and I shall fall out for the festivities only .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 13]: In all other respects we shall be as much together as before .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 32]: Perhaps in time to come I may be festive once more , but for the moment I 'm knocked out of time , and must hide my head like the ostrich .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 17]: I made myself go to the ball last night , but it was not a success .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 8]: I sha n't try it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 21]: Jean lifted her chin , with the slightly obstinate expression in which she took refuge when her will was questioned .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 3]: `` Oh-h !
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 15]: Well , you know best -- or at least , you imagine you do .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 30]: I should have thought , however , being of a simple and credulous nature , that you were enjoying yourself excessively when you walked through that conservatory last night .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 25]: If you wished to hide your head at that moment you were a remarkably modest ostrich , for it looked most animated and attractive .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 9]: Who was your partner , by the way ?
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 6]: He looked quite nice . ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 5]: `` Quite nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 10]: Vanna lifted her coffee-cup to hide a twitching lip .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 16]: Behold the historic moment , and the heroine 's romantic impression of her future spouse .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 30]: `` I must remember this , '' was the mental resolve , as she answered tranquilly : `` He was more than nice , he was a delightful man .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 23]: I was not introduced to him until after twelve o'clock , but our talk together was the best part of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 6]: His name is Gloucester . ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 11]: Jean dropped her fork with a little clatter of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 3]: `` Gloucester ?
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 4]: Not Robert Gloucester ?
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 3]: Surely not !
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 9]: He could not possibly have been there . ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 6]: `` He was , though .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 12]: Very much there , for he is staying in the house .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 38]: He naively observed that he had intended to go to bed , but as the ` confounded noise ' had kept him awake , he came downstairs in desperation , and Miss Morton introduced him to me .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 12]: You did not look as if you recognised each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 5]: `` We did n't !
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 21]: I have never seen him before , but I have heard -- oh , my dear , libraries about him !
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 7]: He is the Mortons ' theme .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 18]: We all have themes , on which we fall back on every possible pause of the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 48]: My theme , poor butterfly , is fun and clothes ; yours , my angel , has been the same , plus a tinge of duty and maiden aunt ; the Mortons ' is Robert Gloucester , his words , deeds , thoughts , looks , ideas .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 23]: He 's been abroad for years and years , chiefly occupied in losing his money , so far as I can understand .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 26]: He seems to have a specialty for losing money , but their infatuation is such that it is counted to him as an added charm .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 25]: The boring times I have had listening to prosy accounts of his trials and adventures , when I have wanted to discuss a hat !
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 64]: And then at last he was coming home , the ball was arranged so that he should be there , I expected him to dance half the night with me : it was the least he could do , considering how I had suffered for him ; and behold he hides upstairs , and creeps down to sit on balconies with another girl !
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 2]: Wretch !
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 18]: Why on earth could they not have introduced him to me , instead of to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 21]: `` You were not sitting by your lone , a dejected wallflower , while your partners gorged in the supper-room .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 3]: I was .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 16]: We took pity on one another , and determined to talk , not dance . ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 11]: `` And pray , what did you talk about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 11]: Again Vanna 's lip gave a quick , involuntary twitch .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 4]: `` Different things .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 31]: He told me that he had just returned to England , and spoke of foreign countries -- his adventures -- '' `` Oh , but this must be stopped ! ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 8]: Jean shook her head with would-be solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 24]: `` The Mortons have advertised him sufficiently in advance ; he really can not be allowed to be egotistical on his own account .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 7]: I shall take him in hand .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 23]: I shall say to him gently but firmly , ` My excellent youth , your biography has already run through many editions .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 4]: Let it rest .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 10]: Variety is refreshing for mind as well as body .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 16]: Allow your thoughts to stray for a moment to some one besides your wonderful self .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 12]: Think , for example , of _ Me _ ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 25]: She waved her hand in dramatic fashion as she spoke , flashing a mischievous glance at her friend , her face a-sparkle with mischief .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 41]: Jean 's vivid young beauty seemed ever to be asserting itself in fresh phases , so that even those who lived in the same house and looked upon her every day of their lives were continually evoked to fresh admiration .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 17]: As in watching the movements of an exquisite child , moments of satiety seemed impossibly remote .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 15]: Vanna thought with a leaping pulse : `` How he will love her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 9]: and smiled back tenderly into the glowing face .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 14]: How soon , and in what fashion would the dramatic meeting take place ?
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 17]: She was possessed with an immense curiosity to forecast the events of the next few days .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 36]: Robert Gloucester would not , she was convinced , be content to wait upon chance , but having been vouchsafed a glimpse of his treasure , would not rest until he had furthered the acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 57]: In a light , unsuspicious manner it was evident that Jean 's expectation had also been aroused , for as the visiting hour of the afternoon drew near she displayed an unwillingness to leave the house , donned her prettiest dress , and seated herself in the drawing-room , in what was evidently a waiting mood .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 10]: `` Put a rose in your belt , Jean .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 44]: You ought always to wear a rose , '' Vanna said , holding out a bowl of fragrant blooms for approval , and Jean obeyed , casting the while a smilingly defiant glance at the angular woman who sat knitting near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 33]: If ever the word spinster was written large over a human creature , it was written over Mrs Goring , wife of the genial Philip , and stepmother to his daughter Jean .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 30]: Yet she was not only a wife , but a mother , and her husband and the two growing schoolboys regarded her with a sincere if somewhat prosaic affection .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 14]: Jean 's mental position with regard to her stepmother was somewhat more complicated .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 57]: `` I love her with my head , with my judgment , with my conscience ; on Sundays , when the sermon is extra good ; when she has asthma , and gasps for breath ; when the boys are ill , and she looks white and trembly ; at other times -- _ no _ !
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 8]: with my heart -- _ never _ !
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 16]: We are miles apart , and no bridge is long enough to bring us together .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 53]: I am her husband 's daughter , so it is her duty to feel an affection for me ; she never shirks a duty , so she tries hard morning and evening to love me as she should , and asks forgiveness every night because she ca n't manage to do it .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 22]: I do n't try -- because I 'm bad , you 'll say ; really , because I 'm too wise .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 30]: It 's no use _ trying _ to love ; but I 'm far more obedient and docile than I should be if she were my own dear mother .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 56]: I should have teased her , and argued , and been cross and perverse -- every naughty thing in turn , as the mood took me ; and then I should have been sorry , and cried , and she would have forgiven me , and we 'd have loved each other harder than ever .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 8]: But the mater and I never quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 13]: That ought to score a great big mark to our credit . ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 70]: On the present occasion Mrs Goring justified her character for keeping her temper , for , trying as it was to her practical nature to behold her stepdaughter decking herself with flowers in the afternoon , and idling over a piece of useless crewel work , she made no spoken protest , but contented herself with pursing her thin lips , and clicked her knitting-needles together as she worked .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 35]: Presently a visitor was announced , and then another ; tea was served , and it was after five o'clock when at last the announcement came for which both girls had been impatiently waiting .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 8]: `` Miss Morton , Mr Gloucester . ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 12]: The girl swept in with the assurance of an intimate friend .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 18]: Robert Gloucester followed slowly , his spare figure towering above hers , his face set and strained .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 32]: Vanna saw at a glance that he was consumed with nervousness , and during the first ten minutes of his stay he hardly allowed himself a glance in Jean 's direction .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 37]: When she handed tea he took it with eyes fixed on the cup , and promptly sought the corner by Vanna 's side to mumble platitudes about the weather , and listen absently to her replies .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 12]: How long would Jean allow so unsatisfactory a state of affairs ?
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 57]: `` I 'll give her five minutes , '' was Vanna 's verdict ; but before that time had elapsed Jean had so cleverly manipulated the conversation that Vanna was being questioned across the length of the drawing-room , so that it seemed the most natural thing in the world to suggest a change of seats .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 16]: `` Come over here , Vanna , dear , and tell them all about it !
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 8]: I 'll talk to Mr Gloucester ! ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 21]: Jean floated across the room in her white dress , and laid a caressing hand on her friend 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 28]: It was a pure impulse of coquetry which made her take the rose from her belt as she seated herself in the discarded corner of the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 26]: One could make such pretty by-play with a flower , twirling it to and fro , stroking the petals , daintily drinking in its fragrance .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 27]: To the woman that rose gave an added consciousness of power ; from the man the sight of it took away what little composure he retained .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 23]: His hand shook until the teaspoon rattled against the cup ; and he placed it unemptied on the table by his side .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 9]: He stammered ; he was unhinged , tongue-tied .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 17]: Jean , who had been prepared to rebuke self-confidence , adopted an instant change of tactics .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 31]: Her little airs and graces died a rapid death ; the tilt of the head was replaced by a gentle droop , her complacent smile changed to an artless appeal .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 9]: The poor , dear man must be encouraged .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 35]: He had been buried in the wilds , with lions and elephants for companions ; he was all unnerved to find himself in an English drawing-room , face to face with a pretty girl .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 17]: `` I 've waited such a long time to see you , '' said Jean softly .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 17]: `` Edith and I are great friends and she has told me so much about you .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 18]: I could stand quite a stiff examination on your doings and goings of the last few years .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 9]: Some day you shall cross-question me and see .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 15]: When I 've been particularly good I 've even heard extracts from your letters .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 11]: I ca n't possibly treat you as a stranger ! ''
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 8]: `` I -- I ought to apologise .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 9]: I hope you have not been bored . ''
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 39]: He looked up as he spoke , and for the first time met the full gaze of Jean 's eyes -- those eyes which were a revelation of beauty even to dull elderly members of her own sex .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 35]: Gloucester 's gaze lingered with an intensity which held her bound in return ; but mingling with his eagerness was an expression of humility , almost of awe , which Jean found strangely disconcerting .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 32]: She lowered her lids at his glance , forgetful for once of the effect of fringed ladies , and made her reply with a little tremble of nervousness in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 10]: `` Not at all bored , but very interested .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 21]: Are you glad to be back in England ; and how does it look to you after your long absence ?
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 9]: Are you going to stay at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 8]: `` I 'm glad -- immensely glad !
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 16]: Yes , I shall stay , '' he said with abrupt , almost violent emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 13]: Then more quietly , `` The country looks -- _ neat _ !
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 10]: Such neat little fields on either side the line .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 12]: I should grow impatient in the country , but London enthrals .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 21]: I love the dull old roar , and the smoke , and the misty light of this weak little sun .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 22]: A man who has lived long abroad seldom cares for rural England , but he never loses his love of London .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 21]: It is the best of its kind -- there 's something in that ; but the country is tame . ''
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 9]: Jean mused , a smile twitching her lips .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 50]: `` I have always said that if I could choose an exact site for my home of the future I 'd have the front windows facing west over a range of mountains , the bigger the better -- the Himalayas for choice -- and the back windows over Piccadilly !
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 25]: Our tastes agree , it appears ; but for pity 's sake do n't let our sun hear you speaking in such disrespectful tones .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 30]: It is so touchy and difficile that it is capable of sulking and hiding for weeks together , and we have been paying it such compliments these last days .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 4]: ` Blazing ! '
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 14]: We preferred to stay indoors this afternoon because it was ` blazing . '
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 21]: Soon we shall declare that it is impossible to stay in town , and shall fly away to the country .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 21]: In a couple of weeks London will be emptied of every one who is not chained to a desk . ''
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 7]: `` Where shall you go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 4]: he asked directly .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 33]: Jean glanced at him , and discovered to her surprise that the question was no idle inquiry put to help in a lagging conversation , but a request for information seriously desired .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 14]: She was not offended , but a feminine impulse prompted her to prevaricate .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 10]: `` Oh , to the sea , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 14]: I possess two small brothers who insist upon the sea for their holidays .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 12]: I suppose you will be going to Hampshire with the Mortons .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 14]: The Moat will seem a haven of rest and green after the East .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 8]: The gardens are more entrancing than ever .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 4]: Such flowers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 30]: She lifted the rose to her face as if reminded of its presence , stroked her cheek with its velvety petals , and let it drop into her lap .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 36]: A heightened voice sounded from the end of the room , and the quick movement of interest with which she turned to see what was happening sent the rose spray rolling softly to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 43]: She bent forward to regain it , but Gloucester was quicker than she ; he held it firmly in his big brown hand , not offering a return , but looking down at it with an expression which Jean found strangely eloquent .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 13]: `` It is a long time since you have seen English flowers .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 11]: To an Englishman nothing can ever be quite so beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 14]: You must be glad you came home in the time of roses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 19]: The intentionally soft tone of the girl 's voice threw into greater contrast the man 's hoarse accents .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 8]: `` Will you give it to me ?
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 6]: May I keep it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 11]: Jean stared , her delicate brows arched in dignified surprise .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 29]: Certainly she would not give a flower which she had been wearing to a perfect stranger , and that in the presence of three pairs of watching eyes .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 41]: This Robert Gloucester was disconcertingly direct , and must be kept in his place -- gently , however , for he had other points in his favour , such as being young and handsome , and transparently impressed by herself .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 8]: `` Not this one , I think .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 7]: It is too faded and tired .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 10]: I am cruel to flowers when I wear them .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 7]: I ca n't leave them alone .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 10]: Please take your choice from any in that bowl .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 7]: They are all quite fresh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 16]: She held out her hand , gently imperious , and Gloucester mutely returned the rose .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 28]: He could do no less ; but his air was so discouraged , so out of all proportion abashed , that the girl felt a swift remorse .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 17]: It was like disappointing an eager child , and watching the shadowing of the happy face .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 24]: Now it was not her own wish , but simply the presence of onlookers which prevented the refusal from being changed into consent .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 30]: She laid the recovered flower on the table beside the fragrant bowl of roses , almost disliking it for having been the cause of this check in the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 31]: Her eyes softened , she smiled into Gloucester 's troubled face with her sweetest , most childlike expression , and prattled dainty nonsense , unchecked by his lack of response .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 53]: Presently he began to smile ; it was impossible to resist Jean when she set herself to charm , but once and again the murmured answers missed the point , and she was conscious that , though his thoughts were absorbed in herself , he was paying scant heed to her words .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 56]: The mysterious nervousness which had affected her at his first gaze returned to Jean once more in the process of this one-sided conversation ; she turned her head to where the three ladies were sitting , and met Edith Morton 's eyes fixed upon herself with an intensity of scrutiny which aroused a quick suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 24]: Edith did not care to see her guest monopolised ; she was not content to be banished to the end of the room .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 24]: Jean smiled and raised her voice , addressing her directly by name , so as to show her desire for a general conversation .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 34]: `` I have been telling Mr Gloucester , Edith , that when I was very good you used to read me extracts from his letters , and thrill me by repeating his adventures .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 10]: They were such nice , full , detaily letters .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 16]: I think you would get a prize in a foreign correspondence competition , Mr Gloucester .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 8]: Most men write such scrappy notes . ''
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 24]: `` Ah , I should have been ungrateful if I had done that , for Edith sent me such splendid letters from home .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 21]: No one knows how a fellow appreciates letters when he is abroad -- a blank mail is a blighting experience .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 18]: Edith has been a brick to me in that way ; as good as any sister . ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 16]: He smiled at the girl as he spoke , and Edith Morton smiled bravely back .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 21]: Gloucester saw nothing strained or unnatural in that smile , but the three women divined its secret with lightning intuition .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 41]: Poor Edith who had watched and waited all these years , counting each day as it passed , enduring a grey present in the hope of a golden future which would surely begin when the Prince returned to his own .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 29]: And now her long wish was fulfilled -- her hero was restored to her side , not unconscious of her care , but full of gratitude and affection .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 29]: He smiled at her with kindly eyes , he paid her public thanks , he compared her to a sister , and Edith 's heart cramped with despair .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 20]: She was a tall , slight girl , with dark hair , a dull complexion , and pretty eyes .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 18]: She dressed tastefully , though without style , and spoke with a delightfully clear , musical intonation .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 29]: When addressed she had a trick of drooping her head , which gave her a somewhat timid and shrinking air , and her hands were small and white .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 21]: Women admired and loved her , and constantly asked of each other , `` Why is she not married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 11]: Men passed her by as if unconscious of her presence .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 24]: The mysterious quality which attracts masculine approval was lacking in her case , and until the present she had not regretted its absence .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 22]: The while Gloucester continued an easy flow of conversation , the same thought passed through the mind of each feminine hearer .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 27]: If Edith wished to appropriate this man for herself , why had she so hastened to bring him into the temptation of Jean Goring 's presence ?
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 30]: Jean , with her characteristic impulsiveness made a dozen impossible resolutions to keep out of Robert 's path ; to be cold to him , to refuse to speak .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 20]: Vanna sighed over the hardness of fate which ever advances to its festivals over the corpses of the slain .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 22]: Mrs Goring , with tightened lips , sneered at the blindness of men whose vision was blinded by a pretty face .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 37]: Edith , with a sad pride , told herself that above all things sincerity was the most precious , and that if Gloucester were to be hers , it must be of his own unbiased will .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 22]: If he loved her -- if he were even beginning to love her -- Jean 's beauty would leave him untouched .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 23]: Every day one beheld ordinary-looking women wooed by men who had passed by others infinitely more favoured , to seek them out .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 10]: Beauty meant much , but it was not all .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 13]: The mystic tie of affinity in no way depended on its presence .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 30]: Robert and Jean were bound to meet during the next few weeks ; her own influence should be used to make those meetings more frequent , rather than less .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 21]: She would condescend to no scheming to attain what was worth having only if it came as a free-will gift .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 18]: When she spoke again it was to invite Jean and her friend to dinner the next evening .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 21]: `` We are expecting some of Robert 's old friends , and we need you two girls to balance numbers .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 5]: You must come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 3]: Jean hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 28]: She had just decided to refuse all invitations ; but this was put in the light of a favour , which it would seem discourteous to refuse .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 10]: Besides , Vanna had seemed interested in Robert Gloucester .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 8]: She must consider poor , dear Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 8]: `` You are sure you want us ?
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 2]: Really ?
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 8]: It seems so soon to come again .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 15]: If any of the men drop out , be sure to let us know .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 30]: We shall quite understand , '' she replied , assuaging her conscience with this loophole of escape , and Edith rose to say good-bye , smiling another difficult smile .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 83]: It was Jean 's usual custom to accompany her friend downstairs at the end of each visit , linking arms , and standing long in the hall as one item of news after another presented itself for discussion ; but to-day she rang the bell for a maid , and made her adieux at the drawing-room door ; the most careless and perfunctory of adieux to the man , to the girl a kiss , and an eloquent grip of the hand .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 27]: Edith was her friend , a friend of years ' standing ; and Jean , for all her flirtatious nature , was loyal to her sex .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 17]: The last thing she would wish to do would be to annex another girl 's lover .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 18]: Nevertheless it was with a sigh and an unusual sense of depression that she re-entered the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 18]: Vanna was standing by the sofa in the corner , looking down on the carved oak table .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 16]: Jean 's eyes followed hers , and her heart gave a sudden , startling leap .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 19]: The bowl of roses was untouched , but the table was bare , the faded bud had disappeared !
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 4]: JEAN RUNS AWAY .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 17]: The next day Jean displayed an inexplicable unwillingness to accept Edith Morton 's invitation to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 15]: All morning she affected to expect a letter announcing a cancelling of the plan .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 17]: When afternoon came and no letter arrived , she fell back upon the usual feminine subterfuge .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 21]: `` I think , '' she announced thoughtfully , `` I 'm almost sure , I have a headache ! ''
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 26]: The two girls were seated alone in the upstairs boudoir , and anything less suffering than Jean 's appearance would have been difficult to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 15]: Vanna smiled , and put an incredulous question : `` Poor , puzzled darling .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 6]: It is trying for you .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 11]: How do you manage to decide these knotty points ? ''
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 16]: For answer Jean ducked her head , and shook it violently from side to side .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 28]: This singular process over , she raised a flushed , sparkling face , and pronounced slowly : `` Yes , it does ; I can feel it .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 10]: I can always tell when I do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 8]: Vanna 's clear laugh rang out mockingly .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 40]: To one who knew what it was to suffer from prostrating headache , which made it impossible to move , to speak , almost to breathe , the sight of Jean 's ducked , shaking head was irresistibly comic .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 7]: She brushed aside the frail pretence .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 9]: `` My dear , it 's no use .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 5]: I see through you .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 5]: Better confess at once .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 7]: You do n't want to go .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 7]: Jean looked at her in silence .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 12]: Her eyes dilated , the colour paled on the rounded cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 11]: It was pretence no longer , but real unaffected earnest .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 11]: `` Vanna , he frightens me -- that Robert Gloucester !
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 15]: He behaved like , like they do , you know -- at the end .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 10]: It 's absurd , at the very first meeting .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 9]: He could n't possibly -- _ care _ !
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 10]: I do n't want to meet him again . ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 10]: `` You did n't like him , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , I did .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 2]: Dreadfully .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 9]: That 's just why -- '' `` Enigma !
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 6]: Will you graciously explain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 4]: `` Edith ! ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 12]: said Jean , in a low voice , almost a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 36]: It seemed treacherous to speak of Edith 's secret , but Vanna was as another self , to whom so far every thought had been confessed , and she was the most loyal of confidantes .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 18]: Besides , if Robert Gloucester were to be successfully avoided , Vanna 's co-operation would be needed .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 24]: `` I am sure Edith cares for him , and if she does , she has had such a long , long wait .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 29]: Imagine how it would feel , to love a man with those eyes , and wait alone at the other end of the world for six long years !
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 38]: It would make me wretched to spoil Edith 's happiness ; but if he came often , and looked at me like that , I -- I should look back , Vanna , I know I should .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 16]: I might make all the resolutions in the world , but they would n't last .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 6]: I 'm a born flirt .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 24]: It 's shocking , but it 's true ; therefore you perceive there 's only one thing for it -- to avoid temptation .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 14]: You must go alone to-night , and say that I 'm ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 15]: `` Which would bring Edith round post-haste to-morrow morning , accompanied by her guest .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 25]: You must think of a better excuse than that if you really wish to avoid him , my dear , '' replied Vanna derisively .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 26]: There was no contradicting this statement , for Jean was one of those rare and blessed mortals who did not know the meaning of illness .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 56]: As a child she had romped gaily through the list of juvenile ailments , thereafter for a dozen years she had bloomed in radiant flower-like health , without a single day 's illness , or a nearer approach to pain than a headache whose reality had to be diagnosed in the novel manner already described .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 16]: To announce herself too unwell to keep a social engagement would indeed arouse alarmed attention .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 14]: She mused in silence for several moments then said slowly : `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 3]: quite true !
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 15]: I should have to stay in bed , and that would be too boring .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 12]: I could n't immolate myself to that extent even for Edith .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 18]: Vanna , what do you say to running off to the country to-morrow -- you and I ?
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 10]: Miggles is there already , getting ready the house .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 20]: Theoretically she would chaperone us , practically we would bully her , and make her do whatever we liked .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 17]: You are not keen on festivities just now , and the season will soon be over .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 12]: I should n't mind giving up the few things that remain .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 32]: We 'd have lovely times together , and lead the simple life , and drink milk , and go to bed early , and give our poor tired hair a rest .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 11]: It would be fun , would n't it , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 8]: Say you would like it too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 8]: Vanna looked thoughtfully at the lovely face .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 34]: Jean was in earnest ; and to one of her warmhearted , impulsive nature to be in earnest meant to be content with no half measures , but to insist upon wholesale surrender .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 17]: It would be useless to protest , and indeed she had no wish to do so .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 67]: Jean 's flight would not avail ; the fates had decreed that she and Robert Gloucester should meet , and would not be coerced from their plan -- of that she was quietly convinced ; at the same time , she felt a keen sympathy with the shattering of Edith 's romance , and was content that Jean should put herself beyond the reach of blame .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 15]: `` Oh , yes , I 'd love to go , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 21]: `` It will be delightful to have you all to myself , and I 'm in no mood for functions .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 11]: But are you quite sure you wo n't be bored ?
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 9]: You wo n't find it too lonely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 6]: `` Oh , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 5]: replied Jean , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 8]: `` Incidentally , there is Piers Rendall !
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 14]: He went down last week to fish , and to cheer his mother .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 7]: He shall cheer us , too .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 9]: Well , then , it 's all settled .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 20]: You 'll go alone to-night , and to-morrow morning bright and early we 'll set off for the sea .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 64]: I wish I had not bought that white dress ... '' So it was arranged , and at eight o'clock that evening , Vanna entered Mrs Morton 's drawing-room alone , and saw a shadow fall over Robert Gloucester 's face , while Edith listened to the offered explanations with a surprise from which she loyally strove to banish any trace of relief .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 47]: A shy girl of sixteen was summoned from the schoolroom to fill the vacant place at the table , and , putting aside his own disappointment , Gloucester insisted upon claiming her as his own partner , and kept her happy and amused throughout the meal .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 43]: In the drawing-room his laugh was as cheery and content as if he had never known a care , and Vanna noticed that in a tactful , unobtrusive fashion he performed many of the duties overlooked by the host of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 97]: It was he who observed that the draught from an open window was too strong for a delicate guest ; he who turned aside from a laughing group to speak to the solitary occupant of a sofa ; he who started an interesting topic of conversation , when the old showed signs of wearing thin ; and the Mortons , old and young , regarded him with glowing eyes and punctuated their sentences with `` Robert says , '' `` Robert thinks , '' as though his opinion was sufficient to settle the most knotty point .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 23]: It was towards the end of the evening , when Vanna had her first quiet word with the hero of the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 7]: `` What does it mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 5]: he asked at once .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 6]: `` Is it serious ? ''
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 11]: And when she queried blankly , `` Her headache ? ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 22]: he replied , with such a transparency of distress , that she was ashamed to confess the unreality of the excuse .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 7]: `` Oh , no -- no .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 3]: Nothing serious .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 6]: A very passing thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 11]: `` Then why is she leaving town so suddenly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 21]: Vanna looked at him , and the impulse came to speak the unvarnished truth , unconventional though it might be .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 5]: `` To avoid you !
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 7]: You should not be so precipitate .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 24]: It is disconcerting , to put it mildly , to have a man make violent love to one at a first meeting . ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 8]: `` I did not make love . ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 10]: `` Not in so many words , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 17]: Gloucester blushed , remembering the rosebud at that moment pressed between the leaves of his pocket-book .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 35]: For a few moments he was silent , gazing before him in puzzled fashion , then suddenly the shadow passed , he turned towards her with a smile , his eyes clear and untroubled .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 20]: `` And so she is going to run away , a make-believe little journey of two or three hours ?
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 11]: Does she imagine that she can hide herself so easily ?
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 19]: There is no corner of the earth where I would not follow to find her at the end .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 5]: She belongs to me .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 10]: Do you imagine I shall give her up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 4]: Vanna was silent .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 46]: In her heart of hearts she had no doubt on the point , and believed Jean 's fate already settled ; but she saw Edith 's eyes fixed upon her from across the room , and felt a keen sympathy with the disappointment in store .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 34]: Edith was no longer young ; Edith had waited ; for Edith the chances of life might be few and far between , while Jean held the open sesame of charm and beauty .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 9]: `` May I give you some advice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 4]: she said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 22]: `` You will probably refuse to take it , but it 's on my mind to give it all the same .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 7]: Do n't be in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 11]: Let Jean go ; do n't try to see her .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 8]: Stay behind , and think things over .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 10]: She is beautiful , and your meeting was dramatic .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 6]: Even I felt carried away .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 3]: But marriage !
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 6]: -- that is terribly serious .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 7]: One ought to be so sure .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 13]: You have her happiness to remember , as well as your own .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 6]: Jean is impetuous and romantic .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 22]: If she knew what we know , she would feel that all was settled , and that she had no choice .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 6]: You do n't want that .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 22]: If she is to be your wife , it ought to be because she chooses you of her own deliberate will .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 10]: Wait quietly for a few weeks and -- drift !
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 24]: You may find in a few weeks ' time that the impression fades -- that there are other possibilities , other attractions . ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 16]: Gloucester looked her in the face , and laughed , a full-throated , derisive laugh .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 12]: `` You do n't believe one word that you are saying .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 11]: You are talking because you think you _ ought _ .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 3]: Do n't !
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 13]: What is the use of keeping up pretences -- you and I ?
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 7]: We have seen behind the scenes .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 9]: Ca n't we stick to the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 9]: `` You wo n't take my advice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 8]: `` No , I wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 18]: `` You refuse to be prudent in regard to the most important happening of your life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 4]: `` I do .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 8]: It 's not a matter for prudence .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 6]: It belongs to another sphere .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 4]: I am thirty-five .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 6]: I have waited long enough .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 11]: Why should I squander more weeks to satisfy a convention ?
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 12]: She sha n't be hurried -- she shall feel no obligation .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 30]: I will not breathe a word about that old prophecy unless , _ until _ she consents of her own will ; but she must know what I want .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 12]: I would tell her to-day if I had the chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 12]: `` Which you shall not , if I can prevent it .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 10]: It 's not fair ; it 's not kind .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 6]: What is Jean to think ?
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 13]: That you are attracted by her face , and her face alone ?
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 6]: That 's a poor compliment .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 17]: If she is worth winning she is worth knowing ; and she has plenty of character .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 15]: So far as I can judge , her nature and yours are quite unlike .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 11]: Are you quite sure that you can make her happy ?
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 22]: In fairness to her , you ought to give her a chance of knowing you before she takes the plunge . ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 7]: `` I can make her happy .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 9]: I have no shadow of doubt about that .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 24]: I 'll tell you something more , if you like , Miss Strangeways -- I am the only man who _ can _ !
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 28]: She belongs to me , and I am not going to stand aside for any man -- or woman -- on the face of the earth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 11]: Vanna shrugged her shoulders , half laughing , half annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 13]: `` Very well , then , now we know where we are .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 12]: For the moment please understand that I have joined the opposition .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 37]: I shall run off with Jean and hide her , and instil principles of prudence and caution into her ear , coupled with a due suspicion of men who make up their minds in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 9]: Do n't count upon my good offices . ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 15]: `` I sha n't need them , thank you , '' he returned calmly .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 16]: Vanna reflected that it would be as easy to attempt to depress an india-rubber ball .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 3]: ENTER MIGGLES .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 25]: Three days later the two girls were ensconced in their country quarters , and Jean was beginning to suffer from the effects of reaction .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 33]: Her impressionable nature was capable of generous impulses , which found vent in such actions of self-abnegation as the present flight from town , but long-continued effort was too heavy a trial .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 57]: Once settled down in the quiet house by the sea , and past the excitement of the first arrival , she began to droop and to fret , and to demand of herself and every one with whom she came in contact why she had been so foolish as to abandon her last weeks in town .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 8]: `` To-night is the Listers ' ball .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 9]: I was going to wear the new white .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 13]: At this very moment I should have been preening before the glass .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 25]: I feel a horrid conviction that it would have suited me to distraction , that I should have had the night of my life .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 22]: I ca n't think what you were dreaming about , Vanna , to let me rush off in that undignified way .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 15]: I 'm impulsive ; but a word from you would have kept me straight .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 6]: And you never spoke it .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 10]: I do n't think I can ever forgive you .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 16]: If you had n't any consideration for me , you might have thought of Edith .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 21]: For _ her _ sake I should have stayed in town and been as nice as possible to Robert Gloucester .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 21]: If a man ca n't run the gauntlet of other women , he would make a poor sort of husband .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 44]: When I fall in love , I shall make a point of introducing the man to the most charming women of my acquaintance , and if he shows any sign of being attracted by a special one , I 'll throw them together .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 3]: I will !
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 7]: You see if I do n't !
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 26]: If he did n't like me better than them all put together , I should be glad , thankful , delighted to let him go .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 9]: Any girl would , who had a spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 15]: I feel that I have behaved very meanly and unkindly to poor dear Edith .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 6]: Why do n't you speak ?
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 11]: What 's the good of sitting there like a mummy ?
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 6]: Ca n't you hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 6]: `` Perfectly , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 9]: I am listening with great interest and attention .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 52]: Being of a generous nature , I refrain from repeating the remarks which you made when I _ did _ venture to expostulate , but if you will cast back your thoughts -- '' `` Oh , well , '' interrupted Jean naughtily , `` I shall just flirt with Piers .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 24]: I deserve some distraction after being such a monument of virtue , and I 'll have it , or know the reason why .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 30]: I wrote to tell him we were here , so he 'll come over this afternoon , and we 'll go for a walk by the sad sea waves .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 36]: You might twist your ankle on the pebbles , a little innocent twist , you know , just enough to make it wise to sit down and rest while we have our _ tete-a-tete _ .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 18]: Since you 've brought me here against my will , it 's the least you can do .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 10]: Piers shall have tea with us before we start .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 5]: Miggles adores Piers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 52]: `` Miggles , '' formally known as Miss Miggs , was a well-known character in the Goring _ menage _ , having been in succession , governess to Jean , housekeeper during the period of Mr Goring 's widowerhood , and afterwards governess to the two sons of the second marriage .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 42]: After so many years of faithful service it seemed impossible to dispense with Miggles 's services , and in truth no one wished to do so , for she was one of the cheery souls who carry sunshine as an atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 46]: According to ordinary ideas , Miggles might have grumbled with the best , and demanded a universal toll of sympathy , for she was the most solitary of units -- a woman who could not claim relationship with a angle soul in her own hemisphere .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 54]: She had passed her sixtieth birthday , and despite rigid economies , possessed only a few hundred pounds between herself and want ; her health , never strong , showed signs of growing more precarious , and an affection of the eyes shut her off from her loved pastimes of reading and needlework .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 28]: Nevertheless , Miggles was so far from being depressed by such circumstances , that it had not even occurred to her that she deserved to be pitied .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 31]: This blessed state of mind had been achieved by no conflict and struggle of the soul -- no noble effort of will ; religion itself had contributed little towards it .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 22]: Miggles 's disposition was a birthright for which she was seemingly as little responsible as for the colour of her hair .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 67]: As a child , when circumstances had offered a choice between smiles and tears , she had instinctively elected to smile ; as a girl , the mere facts of life and movement had seemed sufficient to ensure complete happiness ; while later on she had been so much occupied with being thankful for silver linings that the clouds themselves flitted by attracting but scanty attention .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 19]: In cheery , non-consequent fashion , _ she _ would discourse of her blessings by the hour together .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 35]: `` Now , would you believe it , my dear , not a soul belonging to me nearer than Australia -- my nephew Henry , dear boy , but rash -- such a pity !
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 7]: always was , from a child .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 12]: Thomas now -- the elder brother -- he would always save .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 12]: My mother was so particular about bringing us up to save .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 14]: ` _ Instil _ good principles from the beginning ' she would say .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 9]: But however -- what was I talking about ?
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 4]: Ah , yes !
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 18]: not a soul nearer than Australia , and _ three _ letters by this morning 's post .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 5]: Is n't it wonderful ?
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 5]: People are so kind .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 31]: Really , except Monday , when there was a fashion-book from a shop -- I do like seeing the fashions -- there 's been something on my plate every morning .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 9]: That 's so cheering to begin the day .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 20]: You know some one has been thinking of you , and caring enough to sit down and write . ''
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 11]: Jean cast a twinkling glance across the table at Vanna .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 10]: `` What did they want this time , Miggles ?
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 35]: I bet anything you like , that every second letter was to beg for something that you have no business to give , and that you were weak enough to say yes all round .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 6]: Can you deny it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 8]: `` Why should I , dear child ?
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 4]: Such a privilege .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 11]: Most kind of them to have given me the opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 3]: Old clothes !
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 23]: I do n't suppose you ever _ have _ old clothes , Miss Vanna -- they always look so fresh and new .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 10]: I like to see a girl in pretty clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 10]: When I was young , shallis were in fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 20]: I do n't suppose you ever saw shallis -- very stiff , not nearly so graceful as your delaines .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 13]: A dear lady gave me a brown shalli , trimmed with pipings .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 16]: Brown was never my colour , but it wore for years -- so very kind .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 11]: Nowadays I have to wear wool for my poor bones .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 7]: Wool always did irritate my skin .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 12]: It took me weeks to get accustomed to sleep in blankets .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 47]: I used to lie awake at nights tossing from side to side , and thinking of all the poor creatures who had no warm coverings -- and mine the very best Whitney , the ones from the spare room , Jean , with the blue stripes .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 9]: Mrs Goring said I was to have them .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 21]: I 'm sure if I 'd been the Queen -- '' `` Oh , it 's wonderful to think of .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 15]: Real Whitney blankets with blue stripes , on which to toss about and groan !
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 23]: What luck you have , Miggles , and how thankful you ought to be that you have bones to _ ache _ .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 21]: If you had n't had that bad feverish attack , you might have been left stranded with your own bedding .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 8]: It is piteous to think of . ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 11]: Miggles shook her large , ugly head with elephantine playfulness .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 4]: `` Naughty child !
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 3]: naughty child !
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 10]: You are laughing at me , I can see .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 21]: It is very painful , especially during the night , and I used to be so proud of my hands .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 17]: I 've had to give up wearing my turquoise ring , the knuckles are so enlarged .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 33]: That really was a trial ; but when you think what other people have to bear ... There 's that poor man at Oxford Circus , who wheels about on a board .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 26]: I always wonder if there are any legs inside his trousers , they lie so very flat ; but of course one could n't ask .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 19]: How monotonous it would be , my dear , to sit on a board from morning till night .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 37]: When I thought of that , it seemed so foolish to fret about a ring ... Your dear mother gave it to me one Christmas , because I had such a desire to possess a ring .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 10]: It was the only one I ever had . ''
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 19]: `` Dear Miggles , '' cried Jean fondly , `` I wonder you did n't have a dozen .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 14]: I wonder that every man you met did n't press one upon you .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 16]: They would have done so , if they had known what was good for them .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 9]: You would have made the dearest wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 4]: Miggles smiled appreciatively .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 16]: `` Well , dear , I _ should _ , though I say it myself .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 8]: I should have made him very comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 32]: I have such a sympathy with men , poor dears , working all day long , and banks failing , and upsetting their plans , and all the bills to pay .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 9]: They do deserve a little comfort at home .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 21]: My nephew 's wife -- Henry 's -- I ca n't help feeling she 's been a little to blame .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 27]: Of course there 's no denying that Henry _ is _ rash , but he could have been _ guided _ , and Florence is hasty .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 9]: A nice girl , too -- very nice .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 24]: I would n't say a word against her , but you ca n't help thinking sometimes , and I 'm sorry for Henry .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 11]: I 've always regretted that I never had an offer .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 17]: I was never pretty , like you , my dears ; but personable , quite personable .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 42]: A gentleman once passed the remark that if he had been young he would have wished nothing better than that nice , wholesome-looking girl ; but he was quite old -- a colonel , home from India , with a liver .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 11]: When they are like that they admire a fresh complexion .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 9]: And of course he had a wife already .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 22]: It would have been pleasant to look back and remember that some one had wished to make me his wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 18]: Miggles gazed at the coffeepot with an air of placid regret , which quickly melted into smiles .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 13]: `` But , however -- he might n't have turned out well .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 24]: One never knows , and I read a sweet little poem in a magazine which might have been written to meet my case .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 55]: She said -LRB- a lady wrote it ; I should think she had had a disappointment -RRB- , ` If I never have a child of my own , with its little hands , and pattering feet , still all the children of the world are mine , to love and to mother . '
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 10]: Such a beautiful thought , was it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 9]: `` Beautiful , indeed , and so original .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 9]: She was a great poet , my Miggles .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 11]: Talking of suitors , Piers Rendall is coming to tea .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 8]: We 'll have it here , please .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 25]: Piers likes a nursery tea set out on the table , with plenty of apricot jam , and thick sensible bread-and-butter ; no shavings .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 20]: Plum-cake ; not plain -- he detests caraway seeds , and two lumps of sugar in his tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 4]: `` I know .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 25]: I 've poured out tea for him since he was so high , '' cried Miggles , waving her hand indefinitely in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 13]: `` He had it with me here two days before you came .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 28]: It 's not many young men who would care to walk three miles to see an old woman , but I ca n't say he looks well .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 4]: Thin -- worried !
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 13]: A man ought to be full of life at that age . ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 7]: `` Fretting for me , dear !
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 8]: He 'll be all right this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 10]: You 'll see , '' announced Miss Jean confidently .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 28]: She would have said the same of any other young man of her acquaintance , nevertheless Vanna waited with some anxiety for the events of the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 39]: Strive as she might , she could not divest her mind of a feeling of responsibility towards Robert Gloucester ; of the conviction that Jean was his by right , and that separation could end only in disaster .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 21]: At three o'clock that afternoon Piers Rendall walked up the garden path , and Jean rushed out to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 17]: Vanna , from her seat in the hall , could hear the merry exchange of greetings .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 6]: `` Halloa , Princess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 5]: `` Halloa , Slave !
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 6]: How are you feeling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 5]: `` Hugging my chains !
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 13]: This is a piece of luck , your coming down so soon .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 16]: What brought you away from the gay capital before the end of the season ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 6]: `` The train , sir !
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 11]: People who ask personal questions must expect to be snubbed .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 8]: I ran away , but not alone .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 10]: I 've a friend with me -- Miss Strangeways .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 6]: Come and be introduced . ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 24]: They had entered the hall while Jean was speaking , and Vanna caught the quick frown of annoyance on the man 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 15]: He had a strong , well-knit figure , and a thin , nervous face .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 24]: His hair was dark , his features were sharply aquiline , the whole effect was handsome and distinguished , but not altogether agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 21]: The dark blue eyes had a somewhat irritable expression , and the features were subject to an occasional nervous twitching .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 23]: They twitched at sight of Vanna seated in the deep cane chair facing the door , and his lips straightened themselves eloquently .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 24]: Vanna knew that he was mentally wishing her at Jericho , and seeing his hoped-for _ tete-a-tete _ turned into a dull trio .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 18]: But the revelation was but momentary , and nothing could have been more courteous than his greeting .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 9]: `` How do you do , Miss Strangeways ?
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 21]: I have heard so constantly about you from Jean that it is a double pleasure to find you here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 10]: Vanna murmured a conventional acknowledgment and felt mentally antagonistic .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 35]: To feel oneself _ de trop _ is never an agreeable experience , and unreasonable though it might be , she resented both Mr Rendall 's attitude and his courteous disguise of the same .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 25]: During the meal which followed she remained stiff and silent , while her three companions chatted and laughed with the ease of old friendship .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 41]: Jean sparkled , her depression dispersed by the presence of a companion of the opposite sex , Miggles beamed from behind the tea-tray , and indulged in reminiscent anecdotes , to which the young man lent the most flattering attention .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 27]: His bright eyes softened in genuine kindliness as he looked into her large , good-natured face , and he waited upon her with the utmost solicitude .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 18]: Evidently there was a real bond of affection between the homely old woman and the handsome man .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 8]: Towards Jean his attitude was more complex .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 35]: Vanna , watching with jealous , anxious eyes -- jealous on behalf of that other suitor whose claims she had denied -- could not decide how much or how little his feelings were involved .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 14]: He admired her , of course -- what man would not admire Jean ?
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 59]: They bandied words together , joked , teased , protested , without a suspicion of self-consciousness ; at times they smiled at each other with undisguised affection ; at other times some light word uttered by the girl seemed to strike a false note , and the irritable expression in the man 's eyes flamed into sudden anger .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 13]: `` He has a passionate nature ; he could feel very deeply .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 8]: I think he is not happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 24]: Such was Vanna 's diagnosis of Piers Rendall 's character as she drank her tea and ate her plum-cake in almost uninterrupted silence .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 11]: Her companions had endeavoured to draw her into the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 16]: Jean had grimaced eloquently across the table , but Vanna made only a feeble response .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 36]: It seemed as though Jean 's depression had been suddenly shifted on to her own shoulders ; the peaceful content of the last few days had disappeared ; she felt solitary , wounded , jarred .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 20]: When the meal was over and the three young people started out on their walk , these feelings deepened .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 27]: Had she not already received her instructions -- that she was to feign an accident as an excuse for obliterating herself for the others ' benefit ?
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 16]: Vanna set her lips with an obstinate little resolve to do nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 24]: She would not obtrude her society where it was not desired , but she would stoop to no pretence by way of excuse .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 20]: When they had walked about a mile along the sea-front , she quietly announced her intention of sitting down .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 11]: `` I do n't think I shall go any farther .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 6]: I 've brought a book .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 19]: I shall sit here and rest , and you can pick me up as you come back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 5]: `` Oh , Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 6]: Are you tired , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 6]: Are n't you well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 4]: demanded naughty Jean .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 29]: `` Perfectly well , thank you , '' replied Vanna coldly , and had the satisfaction of seeing that Piers Rendall thought her exceedingly disagreeable for her pains .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 22]: The two figures crossed the belt of pebbly stones , and walked over the sunny sands to the water 's side .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 36]: Hitherto they had kept to the levelled promenade , and to Vanna 's irritated senses it appeared an added offence that , once released from her presence , they should at once hasten into solitude .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 11]: She turned her eyes away and stared drearily into space .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 6]: Revolt surged in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 5]: It was not fair .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 20]: Jean had everything -- home , parents , beauty , strength , the right to be wooed and won .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 7]: The world was cruel -- unjust .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 6]: Why should such differences exist ?
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 7]: Her own lot was too hard .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 6]: She had not deserved it .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 6]: She had done her best .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 39]: Circumstances had not been too easy -- always there had hung a shadow ; life in the little country hamlet with Aunt Mary , delicate and sad , had been by no means ideal for a young girl .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 14]: Without conceit she knew herself to have been dutiful , affectionate , kind .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 21]: She had put her own wishes in the background , content to minister to an old woman 's declining years .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 6]: Her own turn would come .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 26]: Life lay ahead , crowded with golden possibilities ; when they came they would be all the sweeter for the consciousness of duty well done .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 3]: And now ?
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 47]: Ah , well , in converse with one 's nearest friend one might affect to be brave and independent , but in the solitude of one 's own woman 's heart it seemed as if those possibilities had been wiped away , and left nothing behind .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 27]: In times of trouble and upheaval the sufferer is constantly exhorted by sympathetic friends to turn resolutely away from the sad past , and look ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 2]: Onward !
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 7]: they are told -- press onward !
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 12]: Life lies not in the past , but in the future .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 10]: Despair comes of looking back , courage with expectation .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 10]: Poor Vanna recalled these axioms with a weary heart .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 9]: That was just what she dared not do .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 8]: What could the future hold for her ?
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 19]: She sat very still , her hands clasped on her lap , her eyes shut against the glare .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 26]: The sun seemed cruel to-day ; the dance of golden light across the sands , the sight of those two light-stepping figures in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 13]: She would help Jean , help others , who were in need .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 17]: There was no lack of work in the world for hands which were willing and free .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 15]: She could make other people happy ; could live a noble , selfless life .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 20]: Even so , and at the thought , the lips of three-and-twenty quivered , and the salt tears flowed .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 12]: She wanted to be happy herself -- longed to be happy .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 15]: The selfless life sounded barren and cold ; it roused no flicker of joy .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 8]: `` How shall I bear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 5]: asked Vanna of herself .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 17]: `` How can I live , looking on , always looking on , having no part ?
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 25]: Even to-day with Jean -- my darling Jean -- and that strange man , I felt sore and angry and -- _ bad _ !
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 9]: He thought me a cross , ungracious girl .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 27]: His opinion does not matter , but other people will think so too if I behave in the same way ; and that would be terrible .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 12]: I could not exist if people did not care for me .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 6]: In self-defence I must overcome .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 7]: But how to do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 14]: Vanna leant her head on her hands and sent up a wordless prayer .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 19]: In her own fashion she was deeply religious , but it was not the fashion of her day .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 45]: Her aunt had been shocked and distressed by her heterodox sentiments , and had spent many hours in prayer for her niece 's conversion , while Vanna , in her turn , had been fully as shocked at the old woman 's conventional ideas .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 12]: Aunt Mary had been the most tender and forgiving of mortals .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 22]: Her memory , tenacious till death of the smallest kindness shown towards her , was absolutely incapable of retaining an injury .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 27]: If any one offended , her own anxiety was to find for them a means of reform ; to her charity there seemed literally no end .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 36]: When a trusted servant repaid endless kindnesses by a flagrant theft , Aunt Mary was bowed down with penitence for occasional carelessness on her own part which might possibly have led the sinner into temptation .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 38]: `` I remember distinctly one Sunday night when I left my purse in the dining-room , and was too lazy to go downstairs to fetch it , and at other times I have left change lying about .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 9]: It was wrong of me -- terribly wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 27]: One never knows what need there may be -- what _ pressing _ need -- and to see the money lying there before her eyes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 52]: To the scandal of the neighbourhood , instead of giving the offender in charge , or at least dismissing her in shame and ignominy , Aunt Mary tearfully apologised for her own share in the crime , and proposed a future partnership in which both should endeavour to amend their ways .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 20]: Jane was sullen and unresponsive , too much overcome by surprise perhaps to be able to express any gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 17]: That she felt it all the same was testified by her dog-like devotion to her mistress .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 24]: All went well until another year had passed , when in a sudden burst of emotion the maid confessed to a fresh peccadillo .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 52]: Now , indeed , any sane person would have realised the folly of keeping such a sinner in the house , and , hurling reproaches on her head , would have promptly ejected her from the threshold ; but Aunt Mary was once more content to play the part of comforter .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 32]: `` I have my own besetting sins , Jane , '' she said gently , `` and I fear I have given way to them many times during this past year .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 16]: You have kept straight until the last week , and you have confessed your fault .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 3]: Have courage !
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 7]: You have made a good start .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 15]: I shall treat you exactly as before , and trust you more fully ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 9]: That was the end of Jane 's offences .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 19]: Henceforth to the day of her mistress 's death she remained the most faithful and loyal of handmaids .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 42]: Such was Aunt Mary , who devoutly worshipped a God whom she believed capable of torturing for eternity a sinner who had transgressed during a few short years of life , or a helpless infant who had chanced to die unbaptised !
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 27]: She was likewise convinced that the whole non-Protestant world was irrevocably damned , and harboured serious doubts with regard to Dissenters and the High Church party .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 48]: She accepted as final and irrefutable every doctrine which she had been taught as a child , and would have been as ready to believe that Jonah swallowed the whale as the accepted version of the story , if it had been so inscribed in the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 22]: To think for oneself on matters religious she considered profane ; to expect fuller light with fuller knowledge -- a blasphemy .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 29]: To her mind the whole duty of man was comprised in attending his parish church , supporting his vicar , and subscribing to the creeds -- Athanasian included .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 46]: Aunt and niece had had the nearest approach to a quarrel which they had ever known one day when the girl 's intolerance had broken forth into words : `` Aunt Mary , '' she had cried , `` your religion is _ wicked _ !
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 8]: You are good in spite of it .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 9]: You do n't _ really _ believe it .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 6]: You only think you do .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 49]: You subscribe ten and sixpence a year to the South American mission , and lie down in peace and sleep , believing the whole continent to be damned , while if one poor dog were suffering outside your gate you could not rest until you had rescued it .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 12]: Can ten and sixpence buy peace , while a continent perishes ?
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 8]: Your creed is unworthy of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 8]: `` My dear , you forget yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 5]: You shock me deeply .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 13]: Such words from a young girl 's lips are terrible to hear .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 2]: Profane !
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 2]: Rebellious !
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 6]: The poor , dear vicar !
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 15]: I must ask you never again to allow yourself to speak in this way .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 17]: If the wicked thoughts arise , at least let them not find vent in words . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 36]: After this Vanna was careful to avoid religious discussions with her aunt , but she noted with amusement that next year the good lady 's South American subscription had been increased by half a crown .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 23]: Now Aunt Mary had been moved up to a higher class , and the scales of ignorance had fallen from her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 26]: The puzzles of life were solved for her , but her niece was still struggling with her tasks , and they were hard to learn .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 24]: She sat with her hands clasped round her knees , the sea breeze blowing back the hair from the set , white face .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 25]: Aunt Mary would have said that this trouble was God 's will -- His direct dispensation ; but Vanna could not accept this explanation .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 23]: It was surely _ not _ God 's will that in past generations two people had put their own happiness before duty .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 27]: Aunt Mary would have said again that as regards herself this punishment for the sins of others was `` permitted , '' and intended to be .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 28]: -- one had only to look around the world , at everyday happenings , to realise that the Almighty did _ not _ interfere with natural laws .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 29]: Thrust an arm into the fire , and that arm burns ; infect your child with disease , and that child suffers , despite your prayers and entreaties .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 53]: It is inevitable ; but the sufferings were surely of men 's causing , `` The thing of all others which , according to my light , must most ` grieve ' the Spirit of God is the way in which His own children misjudge Him , '' Vanna told herself slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 62]: `` Dear , sweet Aunt Mary , who believed Him capable of things to which she herself would never condescend -- all the good people who look out upon a sky full of worlds , and believe that their own particular tiny sect hold the monopoly of truth , and that every one who differs from them must inevitably be lost .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 5]: Perhaps -- who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 21]: it is misjudging Him just as cruelly to believe that the ghastly happenings of our life are of His choice .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 36]: He has given us free-will ; we make mistakes and suffer for them , and make others suffer too ; but that 's our own doing , and -- reverently speaking -- outside His power .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 25]: He is sorry for us -- infinitely sorry , waiting and longing to send help , when our eyes are open to receive it .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 25]: Perhaps I 'm wrong , I ca n't tell ; but it 's the belief that helps me most , and removes the sting .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 43]: I have such a big trouble for a woman to face -- a lonely life ; such a big effort to make -- to look at happiness through the eyes of others , and keep sweet , and generous , and ungrudging .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 20]: I need so much help ... '' The minutes passed , while Vanna sat motionless , buried in thought .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 37]: Passers-by cast curious glances at the still figure seated upon the pebbly beach above the fringed line of seaweed -- her scarlet cloak gathered round her shoulders , her dark hair blown back from her face .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 34]: It was not a beautiful nor even a pretty face in the usual acceptance of the words : the features were neither good enough to be noticeable , nor bad enough to jar .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 45]: The only beauties were found in the dark , finely arched eyebrows , the oval shape of the face , and the stag-like setting of the small head , to which characteristics Vanna owed that air of distinction which redeemed her from the commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 64]: Piers Rendall had paid little attention to the quiet girl who had sat beside him at the tea-table , and afterwards made an unwelcome third in the walk along the sea-front ; but as he and Jean retraced their steps across the sands an hour later , his eyes turning towards the waiting figure fastened on the pale face , and lingered there .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 15]: We all own a mental picture-gallery which we carry about with us till death .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 38]: Some of the pictures are ours by deliberate choice , printed on memory by loving intent ; others , pain has stamped in undying lines ; a few have gained their place as it were by accident .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 33]: We had no intention of yielding them a place , no interest in the purchase ; quietly and all uninvited they ranged themselves against the walls , and refused to be dislodged .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 59]: Piers Rendall 's glance had been turned in indifference , almost dislike ; but to the end of his life the picture of Vanna remained with him , as she sat on the grey stones , above the belt of seaweed , with the scarlet cloak round her shoulders , and the hair blown back from her face .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 22]: Jean 's merry banter fell on deaf ears ; he was not listening ; had for the moment forgotten her existence .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 19]: Her eye followed his , divining the explanation ; she smiled expectantly , waiting until he should speak .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 10]: `` What is the matter with that girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 7]: `` Tiredness , I should say .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 2]: Bored !
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 6]: Sick of waiting so long .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 7]: It was _ your _ fault .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 6]: You would go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 3]: `` Nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 6]: It 's more than that .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 7]: What has happened to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 8]: `` Nothing ; I told you so .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 6]: She has serious bouts sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 5]: She has one now .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 22]: So would you have , if you sat in this wind , getting chilled through for an hour on end . ''
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 8]: `` I am sorry to hear that .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 14]: If it has not already happened , it must be still before her .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 8]: It is written in her face . ''
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 6]: `` Piers , how tiresome !
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 5]: Leave my Vanna alone .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 9]: _ What _ is in her face ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 4]: `` Tragedy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 4]: said Piers Rendall .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 6]: `` THE HAPPY LAND . ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 23]: The next event was the receipt of a letter from Mr Rendall 's _ mere _ , containing an invitation for lunch .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 22]: Jean read it aloud to Vanna as they sat together on the tiny lawn where the postman had been intercepted . ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 9]: ... Please excuse the formality of a call .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 13]: I am getting old , and these hilly roads try my nerves .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 16]: We hope you will all come over to lunch on Wednesday , at one o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 20]: I shall be pleased to meet Miss Miggs again , and to make the acquaintance of your young friend .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 7]: The carriage shall call at twelve-thirty .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 17]: Believe me , my dear Jean , Your attached friend -- '' `` Good for her !
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 9]: We accept with pleasure , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 6]: `` I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 3]: `` Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 9]: How disagreeable you can be when you try .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 11]: Why were you so bleak and crusty to Piers yesterday ?
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 8]: I wanted you to be nice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 16]: `` You told me to keep out of the way , and I did it .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 13]: I did n't take to him , nor he to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 3]: `` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 19]: I do n't know , '' Jean considered , her chin resting upon the cup of her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 28]: `` He was a trifle quelled to find you here -- that was natural , for he thought I would be alone ; but he was impressed .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 29]: When we came back from our walk you were staring out to sea with such big , sad eyes , and he looked at you , and wondered .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 7]: You impressed him , Vanna . ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 8]: `` You are not to tell him !
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 10]: I forbid you to tell him about me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 10]: Vanna spoke with a headlong impetuosity which surprised herself .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 35]: She did not understand why she shrank from the idea of Piers Rendall listening to an account of her family history ; but the prospect stung , and she could not control her impatience .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 8]: Jean looked at her with quiet reproach .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 10]: `` I should not dream of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 18]: I shall _ never _ speak of it , never -- except at your express request . ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 7]: `` I 'm sorry , dear .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 7]: I 'm very irritable these days .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 13]: Write your acceptance , and I 'll do my utmost to behave .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 8]: What is she like -- this mamma ?
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 5]: A female Piers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 5]: `` Not one bit .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 19]: A little shrinking creature , very proper , very dull -- in a gentle fashion , appallingly obstinate .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 11]: She and Miggles together are as good as a play .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 4]: You 'll hear .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 21]: They 'll get entangled in a dual conversation , and all I ask is -- do n't look at me !
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 10]: Mrs Rendall would never forgive me if I laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 19]: She 's a trying little person , and Piers is sweet to her ; never loses his patience .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 8]: He deserves a halo for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 5]: Vanna raised protesting eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 45]: `` Well , I hardly knew my parents , but I have realised the want of them so badly all my life that I ca n't screw myself up to an access of admiration for a son who is decently polite to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 48]: Suppose she does try his patience at times -- that 's inevitable , I should say , between a young man and an old woman -- how many times has she borne and forborne with him ; what mountains of patience has she expended on his training ?
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 20]: It 's not a virtue , it 's mere common decency that he should be kind to her now .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 9]: He would be despicable if he failed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 8]: `` Quite true , every word true .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 15]: You are theorising , dear , and there 's not an argument against you .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 12]: But leave theories alone for a moment and look at facts .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 20]: How many parents and children -- grown-up children -- do you find who live together in sympathy and understanding ?
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 3]: Precious few .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 43]: Sometimes there 's an open feud ; that 's rare , and ca n't go on in the nature of things ; sometimes there 's an armed truce ; sometimes there are successions of jars ; almost always there 's a gulf .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 22]: They see with different eyes , and hear with different ears , and each side thinks the other blind and deaf .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 9]: One side lacks sympathy , the other imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 19]: It seems the most difficult thing in the world to ` put yourself in his place . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 20]: If I 'd had my own mother , it seems to me we would have been _ friends _ .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 58]: It would n't have needed a great exercise of sympathy to realise that she was old and tired , tired with looking after _ me _ ; and if I had made a friend of her and talked to her , and -- _ told _ her things , she would have sympathised with me in return .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 7]: I _ know _ she would .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 5]: I feel it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 13]: `` Did you , ` tell things ' to Aunt Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 7]: `` No , of course not .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 5]: That was different . ''
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 12]: `` Ah , you think so ; but it is not .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 25]: It 's the generation that 's the bar , not the person , '' cried Jean with one of her quick flashes of intuition .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 42]: `` Youth wants youth and looks for it , and finds it easier to confide in a girl after a week 's acquaintance than in her very own mother , I 've seen it not once , but dozens of times .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 30]: It does n't mean that she loves her more , or a tenth part as much , but in a curious , inexplicable way she 's _ nearer _ .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 7]: It 's hard on the parents .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 52]: Every age has its own trials : love troubles when you are young ; weakness when you are old ; when you are middle-aged it must be just this , to yearn after your children , to long to help and comfort , and to see them prefer some one else !
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 14]: I 'm sorry for parents ; but why do they grow so old ?
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 14]: If I have a daughter , I shall keep young for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 12]: At least I shall remember that I _ was _ young .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 21]: I shall never say : ` the rain is coming down in sheets , the wind is in the east .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 64]: I ca n't think why you ca n't be content by your own fireside , instead of racing half over the town , ' I sha n't be overcome with surprise when she forgets to order the fish on the eve of a proposal , or expect her to look a fright in mackintosh and goloshes when she goes out with men friends .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 20]: I shall remember how I preferred to look nice , even if my feet _ were _ soaked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 22]: `` You may also remember that you suffered from rheumatism thereby , and wish her to profit from your experience . ''
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 7]: `` No use , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 20]: Her rheumatism 's her own , and if it comes she will bear it , but never my goloshes !
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 20]: A parent can be wise and prosy , and expound the law ; but he ca n't do more .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 10]: If he tries , he loses instead of gains .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 36]: I shall school myself to the fact that my little girl is bound to err , and that we are bound to suffer in consequence , she in deed , and I in looking on .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 9]: That 's the price of being a mother .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 23]: Then when she 's had her own way and been buffeted , she 'll come to me and I 'll help her .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 5]: Dear little girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 38]: The lovely face was aglow with tenderness : it was easy to see that the maternal instinct was strong in Jean 's heart , and that she would rise to her fullest height as wife and mother .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 22]: The next moment she raised herself , flashed an anxious look at Vanna 's face , and deftly turned the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 16]: `` Well , anyway you 'll see for yourself that Mrs Rendall 's a trial .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 19]: When she and Miggles get started , do n't interrupt -- let them have it out by themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 44]: Piers loves to listen , and so do I. '' The next day an old-fashioned barouche bore the three ladies over several miles of hilly roads to the square white mansion where the widowed Mrs Rendall lived in peaceful seclusion from the world .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 31]: After the style of old-fashioned houses , it was situated in a hollow , sheltered from the wind , but also cut off from a view of the surrounding country .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 30]: The entrance hall was bleak and uninteresting , the rooms , so many big square boxes , furnished with Early Victorian heaviness , and an astonishing absence of individuality .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 17]: Vanna counted eleven little tables in the drawing-room , each bearing a weight of senseless ornaments .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 45]: On the marble chimney-piece a pair of red glass `` lustres , '' a pair of Parian marble figures , male and female , were mathematically arranged on each side of a Bohemian glass centre-piece , bearing a medallion portrait of a simpering brunette .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 57]: A bannerette of crimson cross-stitch , on which was worked a cluster of steel-bead roses , hung pendant from a brass rod ; the water-colour paintings on the walls were encircled by large white mounts ; the drab carpet was garlanded with flowers ; in the air was the sweet , somewhat musty flavour of potpourri .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 33]: Mrs Rendall wore a large widow 's cap on the top of a small grey head , and was the sort of woman who is instinctively connected with a shoulder-shawl and mittens .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 32]: It was difficult to imagine her the mother of the handsome man with the bright , irritable-looking eyes , who stood by her side to welcome the guests on their arrival .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 26]: The dining-room was a distinct improvement on the drawing-room , as is invariably the case when the mistress of the house is devoid of taste .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 27]: The mahogany furniture was solid and purposeful , and the family portraits on the red flock walls added an air of richness to the prevailing comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 20]: The table itself was beautifully spread with the finest of napery and some treasured pieces of old family silver .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 30]: Six specimen glasses were set at equal distances , each bearing a head of geranium and a spray of maidenhair fern ; two white-capped maids stood stiffly at attention .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 20]: `` Piers , my dear , '' said Mrs Rendall primly , `` will you ask a blessing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 14]: During the progress of the first course the conversation was general and futile .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 55]: The party was too small to allow of separate conversations : the young people seemed inclined to allow their elders to lead the way , and as one old lady seemed determined to cling tenaciously to one subject , and the other to dash continually to pastures new , the result was something confusing .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 20]: Vanna felt the pressure of Jean 's foot on her own , and received a twinkling glance of amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 4]: `` Now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 10]: said the glance as plainly as words could speak .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 6]: `` The fun 's beginning .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 8]: Let them have it to themselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 12]: I never disturb my borders , '' announced Mrs Rendall firmly .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 6]: `` Neither bulbs nor perennials .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 13]: My gardener says -- '' `` But you remember the Totteridges ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 6]: Miggles interrupted , insistently smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 4]: `` Emily Mackintosh .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 16]: She married the son of the old man , Rev Totteridge , Vicar of Newley .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 6]: My sister Susan was bridesmaid .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 3]: Pink taffetas .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 4]: All the go .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 12]: He went out to India and was killed by a tiger .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 3]: Poor Emily !
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 5]: You know their garden .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 23]: That border by the church wall -- '' '' _ My _ gardener says -- '' `` Emily always divided the bulbs .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 8]: Some people leave them for three years .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 13]: Our old landlord over at Sutton -- did you know the Dixons ?
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 5]: _ Charming _ family !
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 15]: They used to come over and play croquet with us at my old home .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 11]: The second son was a dear fellow , but stuttered .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 7]: So sad when a man stutters .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 7]: What was I saying , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 6]: I _ do _ wander !
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 4]: Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 22]: Old Mr Dixon moved them every autumn -- '' `` My gardener says -- '' `` But they grew so matted .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 3]: You know !
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 4]: _ Matted _ !
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 2]: Jungles !
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 8]: I always say take a middle course .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 17]: When I was spending my holiday in Devonshire I had tea in a lovely old garden .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 3]: Clotted cream .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 8]: Did you ever try it with marmalade ?
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 2]: De-licious !
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 13]: All the lilies in one bed , and a stream running through .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 5]: ` Cool Siloam . '
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 17]: Could n't help thinking of it , you know , but not in an irreverent spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 8]: Would n't be irreverent for the world .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 20]: It 's the spirit that matters , is n't it , dear -- the spirit , not the letter ?
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 38]: The scent of those lilies -- '' `` My gardener says -- '' `` Yes , dear , and of course he _ has _ experience , but we must judge by results -- judge by results .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 15]: Stands to reason , as I say , and you had so few blooms .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 11]: What can you expect if they never get any attention ?
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 3]: Poor things .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 5]: We all like attention .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 7]: I do , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 12]: And if they 're matted , _ can _ they bloom ?
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 6]: Now try it one year !
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 4]: You 're mistress .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 8]: I do n't approve of being overruled .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 6]: Consideration , but not concession .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 24]: Hear all that other people have to say , and take your own way afterwards , as my dear mother used to say .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 6]: Jean , you are laughing !
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 3]: Naughty girl !
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 8]: What is so funny about bulbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 22]: `` My gardener says that well-established bulbs bloom better than those which are continually removed , '' said Mrs Rendall firmly .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 9]: `` I intend to follow his advice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 5]: `` Certainly , dear .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 8]: Why not , if you wish it ?
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 6]: The garden 's your own .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 6]: Hope he appreciates his place .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 15]: People always say gardeners are despotic ; my dear father would have no interference .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 47]: Discharged three men in succession for giving advice , and when the fourth came for orders the first morning -- I remember it so well ; I was a girl at the time , about fourteen -- ` d'ye see that row of gooseberry bushes ? '
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 15]: ` Dig 'em all up , and plant 'em back again head downward . '
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 11]: ` Very good , sir , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 10]: At lunch time there they were -- poor things !
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 31]: roots sticking up in the air -- you never saw such a sight -- obliged to laugh , you know , obliged to laugh , though dare n't show it .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 13]: ` You 're the man for me , ' said my father .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 15]: ` There 's a shilling for you ; go and get a drink . '
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 12]: My mother was an abstainer , but he would never join .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 18]: A pity , but men , my dear , men , ca n't be coerced -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 14]: `` Piers , '' said Mrs Rendall coldly , `` return thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 21]: In the face of such an interruption Miggles was perforce reduced to silence , and the luncheon party broke up .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 40]: Coffee was served in the drawing-room , and Vanna mentally resolved to plead fatigue as an excuse for spending the next two hours with the old ladies ; but she was not allowed to carry her plan into execution .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 27]: `` I want to take you the round of our little estate , Miss Strangeways , '' Piers announced when the coffee-cups had been put aside .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 19]: `` Jean knows it of old , but we always seize the opportunity of showing it to strangers .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 33]: I wo n't ask you to come with us , Miggles , for the paths are distinctly rough , and you will be more comfortable sitting quietly on the verandah with mother .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 13]: What sort of heels are you wearing this afternoon , Jean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 7]: `` Flat , ugly , English !
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 30]: I have too much sense of fitness to sport ` Louis quinze ' in country roads ; but why do English bootmakers set their faces so sternly against insteps ?
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 17]: I 'm never comfortable out of a French shoe , '' said Jean with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 45]: She slid her hand through Vanna 's arm with an affectionate pressure which was intended to show her agreement in Piers 's invitation , and the three young people walked across the lawn , leaving the old ladies seated in their low cane chairs .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 10]: `` Sleep sweetly -- and dream of bulbs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 10]: quoth Jean , peering at them over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 11]: `` Piers , I do n't want to grow old .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 35]: It does n't seem possible that a time can _ ever _ come when I shall be content to wear cashmere boots and sleep on a verandah while other people play in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 11]: Do you believe that I shall really grow old ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 35]: Piers Rendall looked at her and his lips twitched , but his eyes did not soften -- the hard brilliancy , which was their chief characteristic , became if anything a trifle more accentuated .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 20]: It was a curious look for a man to cast at a girl with whom he was in love .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 9]: _ Was _ he in love with Jean ?
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 17]: Vanna asked herself curiously for the hundredth time in the course of the last few days .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 26]: If she had but known it , Rendall was engaged in asking himself the same question , and finding it almost as difficult to answer .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 5]: At times , yes !
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 27]: He would have been less than a man if he had not been occasionally swept off his feet by the vivid beauty of that upturned face .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 14]: Jean present -- laughing , teasing , cajoling -- could hold him captive .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 30]: Ear and eye alike were busy in her presence , busy and charmed ; haunting , everyday cares were thrust into the background , and discontent transformed into joy .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 27]: For the hour it would seem as if the whole happiness of life were to laugh , and dance , and to rejoice in the sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 14]: So far so good , but -- Jean absent , the spell dissolved .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 29]: The thought of her had no power to hold him ; he could live tranquilly for months together , indifferent to , almost forgetful of , her existence .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 7]: Here there was surely something wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 13]: This could be no real passion , which was so lightly dispelled .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 24]: If he really loved as a man should love , the thought of her should be as chains drawing him to her side .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 4]: Piers Rendall sighed .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 20]: `` Perhaps , '' he told himself with weary self-depredation -- `` perhaps I am incapable of real passion .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 8]: It is the same story all round .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 6]: I never get far enough .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 17]: Nature made me in a mocking mood , cursing me with high aims and poor achievements .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 14]: What I long for is never accomplished , what I attain never satisfies .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 22]: If I am to find any happiness from life , I must adjust the balance and be satisfied with smaller things .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 6]: It 's time I married .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 13]: Most men can live alone , but I 'm sick of solitude .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 12]: Ten years of life in chambers is enough for any man .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 29]: Jean is a darling , a delight to the eyes ; she 's only a child , but she 's sweet all through , and she 'll grow .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 7]: She 'll be a dear woman .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 20]: I am always happy in her company -- it 's only when we are apart that I have doubts .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 12]: If she would have me , we should always be together .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 11]: _ Would _ she have me , I wonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 52]: He looked down at the girl as she walked by his side , critically , questioningly , with a certain wistfulness of expression , yet without a throb of the desperate , death-and-life tension which another man might have felt , which he himself understood enough to miss and to covet .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 9]: `` Shall I _ never _ feel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 13]: he asked himself , and his thin face twitched and twitched again .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 11]: `` You do n't speak , '' cried Jean lightly .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 4]: `` Poor Piers !
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 17]: he thinks it a silly question , but he is too kind to speak the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 8]: Does the girl expect to be immortal ?
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 24]: he is saying to himself , and trying to conjure up a picture -- the picture of Jean Goring , _ old _ !
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 36]: Ah , well , it will be only my husk that alters ; and even when it 's withered and dry there 'll be _ this _ comfort ; you 'll be withered , too !
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 30]: We shall all grow old together , and we 'll be friends still , and cling together , and sympathise , and think the young so -- crude ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 11]: She laughed , and pointed forward with an outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 23]: `` Here 's the tennis-lawn , and there 's the fernery , and here 's a prosaic gravel path dividing the two .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 11]: You 've seen fifty thousand other gardens like it before .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 20]: Now shut your eyes -- keep them shut , and let me guide you for the next two minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 7]: Then prepare for a surprise . ''
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 14]: Vanna shut her eyes obediently , and surrendered herself to the guiding hand .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 23]: For some yards the path stretched smooth and straight beneath her feet , then suddenly it curved and took a downward dope .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 18]: At the same time the well-rolled smoothness disappeared , and her feet tripped against an occasional stone .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 46]: The second time this happened a hand touched her shoulder with the lightest , most passing of pressures -- that was Piers Rendall , who had evidently crossed the path at the opposite side from Jean , to be a further security to her steps .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 32]: Vanna flushed , and trod with increased care , but the path was momentarily becoming more difficult , and despite all her precautions she slipped again , more heavily than before .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 31]: This time the hand grasped her arm without pretence , and at the same moment she stopped short , and cried quickly : `` Oh , it 's too rough .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 6]: I ca n't go on .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 9]: I 'm going to open my eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 4]: `` Open ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 22]: cried Jean 's voice dramatically , and with a hand placed on each elbow twisted her round to face the west .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 13]: Vanna gave a cry of delight , and stood transfixed with admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 41]: The commonplace white house with its tennis-lawn and beds of geraniums had disappeared ; she stood on a path looking across a narrow glen illuminated by sunshine , which streamed down through the delicate foliage of a grove of aspens .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 22]: The dappled light danced to and fro over carpets of softest moss , through which peeped patches of violets and harebells .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 29]: The trunks of the aspens shone silvery white ; here and there on the crest of the hills stood a grave Scotch fir , grey-blue against the green .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 34]: From below came the melodious splash of water ; the faint hum and drone of insect life rose from the ground ; from overhead floated down the sweet , shrill chorus of birds .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 20]: Vanna gazed , her face illumined with admiration , and her companions in their turn gazed at her face .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 22]: It also was good to look at at that moment , and eloquent as only a usually quiet face can be .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 3]: how wonderful !
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 14]: It 's a _ dell _ -- a glade -- a fairy glade !
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 5]: The unexpectedness of it !
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 10]: Only a few yards from those beds of geraniums !
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 40]: One feels as if anything like a house or bedding-out plants must be at the other end of the world ... And down there the little stream ... '' She lifted her head with a sudden glance of inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 19]: `` The stream grows wider surely -- there are stepping-stones -- at the end there 's a lake .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 12]: I am _ sure _ there is a lake -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 18]: Before Piers had time to reply , Jean had interrupted with a quick exclamation : `` Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 5]: How did you know ?
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 5]: How did you guess ?
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 8]: You have never been here before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 9]: `` Perhaps Miss Strangeways thinks that she has .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 21]: Have you visited our glen in another incarnation , Miss Strangeways , that you remember its details so distinctly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 5]: Vanna shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 10]: `` No ; I have never known that feeling .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 13]: One hears of it , but it does n't come to me .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 9]: It 's more like -- _ expectation _ .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 9]: I seemed for the moment to see ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 16]: It must really be a fairy glen , for there 's enchantment in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 9]: Something -- something is going to happen here .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 4]: I feel it !
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 5]: Something _ good _ !
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 8]: We are going to be happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 12]: Piers looked at her curiously , but Jean remained charmingly matter-of-fact .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 15]: `` Of course we are , and we are going to begin at once .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 7]: Let 's sit down and talk .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 14]: It 's cool tinder these trees , and I 'm sleepy after lunch .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 11]: So you do n't remember being here before , Vanna ?
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 5]: How stupid of you !
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 8]: You must have a very short memory .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 33]: We 've played here together scores of times , when there was no white house , and no smooth lawn , and the grandparents of these old trees were gay young saplings .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 30]: I was a wood-nymph , and danced about with the other nymphs all day long , and flirted with the elves -- elves are masculine , I 'm sure !
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 5]: and feasted on nuts .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 5]: -LRB- That habit lasts .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 6]: I adore them still . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 26]: When winter came , I curled up into a tight little ball in the hollow of an oak , and slept till spring came back .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 9]: Where is that old oak , I wonder ?
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 7]: I long to meet it again .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 25]: And all the long summer days we ate wild strawberries , and drank out of the stream , and played hide-and-seek among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 16]: And one day , Piers , _ you _ came along -- do you remember ?
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 14]: I peered out from behind the leaves , and saw you coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 20]: `` I was not an elf then -- one of the number who was honoured by your attentions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 8]: `` Oh , dear me , no !
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 4]: Nothing so frivolous .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 4]: You an elf !
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 37]: You were a woodcutter with a solemn face , and a long white beard , and a big strong axe , and you came trespassing into my glade with intent to kill my dear tree friends .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 5]: But I circumvented you .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 30]: When you took up your axe I swung on the branches till the sunshine danced on your eyes , and dazzled them so that you could not see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 6]: `` The same old trick !
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 13]: I seem to have no difficulty in remembering you in that guise .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 8]: It has a flavour of to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 4]: `` Poof ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 7]: Jean blew disdain from pursed-up lips .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 6]: `` So much for you .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 20]: If you are so clever at remembering , tell me something about Vanna as she was at that time .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 11]: She was there that day -- quite close to me .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 6]: What was she like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 31]: Piers looked across to where Vanna sat , and , for the first time in the short history of their acquaintance , their eyes met with smiling ease and friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 26]: Each felt a sense of relief to see the other in happier mood , and with it an increased appreciation of the other 's charm .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 14]: `` If he were always happy , how handsome he would be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 8]: `` She is charming when she smiles .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 6]: She should always smile ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 10]: `` So we are old friends , Miss Strangeways .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 14]: We have Jean 's word for it , so it must be true .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 7]: My memory is not very clear .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 4]: Let me think .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 10]: I was a woodcutter with a long grey beard .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 10]: I must have looked rather striking in a beard .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 17]: And I invaded Jean 's glade with intent to kill , and made your acquaintance there .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 6]: What can you have been ?
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 18]: Not a nymph , I think ; perhaps a flower -- '' Vanna lifted a protesting hand .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 17]: Whence came this sudden tide of happiness ; this swift rush of blood through the veins ?
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 68]: The last year 's burden of sorrow had weighed heavily upon her shoulders ; the Harley Street interview had seemed to put a definite end to youth and joy ; but now suddenly , unreasonably , the mist lifted , she knew a feeling not only of mental but of actual physical lightness ; hard-won composure gave place to the old gay impulse toward laughter and merriment .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 5]: `` No -- no .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 17]: I guess what you are going to say ; but spare me , I pray you !
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 14]: I was _ not _ ` a violet by a mossy dell . '
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 14]: It is the inevitable comparison , but it does _ not _ apply .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 19]: Whatever I was , I am sure I was never content to nestle in that mossy bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 15]: Piers Rendall looked at her reflectively , the smile still lingering round his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 8]: `` No-o , '' he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 12]: `` I should not think the violet was exactly your counterpart .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 20]: We must leave it to Jean -- '' `` She was a Scotch fir , '' said Jean firmly .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 79]: `` She stood up straight and stiff against the sky , and there were little sharp spikes on her boughs , and if you ran against her , she pricked ; but when the storms came , and the aspens bent and swayed , she stood firm , and the little needles fell on the ground , and made a soft , soft bed , and we lay there sheltered , and slept till the storm passed by .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 9]: You never knew how poetic I could be .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 12]: I 'm quite exhausted with the effort , and so sleepy !
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 7]: I positively must have a nap .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 6]: Run away , you two !
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 14]: Explore the glen for half an hour , and leave me in peace .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 17]: If there 's one thing in the world I adore , it 's sleeping out-of-doors . ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 29]: She curled up on the ground as she spoke , nestling her cheek in her hand , and yawning like a tired child , without disguise or apology .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 52]: Evidently there was no pretence about her statement , for already her eyelids had begun to droop , until dark lashes rested on the flushed cheeks ; she moved her head to and fro seeking for greater comfort ; peered upward , and exclaimed with added emphasis : `` Go away !
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 7]: I told you to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 16]: Jean was accustomed to issue queenly commands , and her friends were accustomed to obey .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 15]: Piers and Vanna strolled down the sloping path , leaving her to her dreams .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 39]: A day before Vanna would have felt unhappily that Piers was chafing at the change of companionship , and condoling with himself in advance on a half-hour 's boredom ; to-day she was troubled by no such doubts .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 14]: Self-confidence had returned , and with it the old stimulating consciousness of charm .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 9]: Piers Rendall deserved no pity at her hands .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 47]: The path grew steeper , strewn with pebbles , interspersed with crawling roots of trees ; the gentle trickle of water deepened in tone as it swirled in rapid flow round the mossy stones ; banks of old-fashioned purple rhododendron framed the margin of the lake .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 29]: A rustic bench stood at a corner , whence the most extensive view could be obtained ; the two seated themselves thereon , and slid easily into conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 10]: `` So you have pleasant anticipations concerning our glen ?
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 21]: We are used to admiration , but I think that it is quite the most charming compliment it has received .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 43]: If it had recalled a dim memory it would not have been half so interesting , for when the good things arrive we are bound to have a share in them , if only the pleasure of looking on while you enjoy .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 11]: What form does it take -- this presentiment of yours ?
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 15]: Have you any definite idea of what is to happen -- or when ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 5]: Vanna shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 3]: `` Nothing !
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 37]: I only know that the moment I opened my eyes and looked round I felt a throb of -- not surprise , something bigger than surprise , and a quite extraordinary rush of happiness and hope .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 18]: Things have not been cheery with me of late , so it is all the more striking .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 14]: I feel about ten years younger than when I left the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 22]: He looked at her searchingly , and Vanna entered it to his credit that he spared her the obvious flattering retort .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 26]: Instead , his own expression seemed to cloud ; he leant his arms on his knees and , bending forward , stared gloomily into space .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 8]: `` What sports of circumstances we are !
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 21]: I was looking round the table at lunch to-day and puzzling for the hundredth time over the question of temperament .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 7]: Does it interest you at all ?
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 7]: Do you find it a difficulty ?
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 41]: Why are some of us born into the world handicapped with temperaments which hold us in chains all our days , and others with some natural charm or quality of mind which acts as an open sesame wherever they go ?
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 4]: Look at Miggles !
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 11]: A plain , lonely old woman , without a sou .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 72]: If she had been born with a ` difficult ' temper , she might have worked , and slaved , and fought with evil passions , and gone to bed every night of her life wearied out with the stress of battle , and when the need of her was past , her employers would have heaved a sigh of relief , and packed her off with a year 's salary .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 7]: Ca n't you hear her requiem ?
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 16]: ` a good creature , most painstaking -- what a relief to be alone ! '
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 3]: But Miggles !
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 9]: No sane creature would willingly send her away .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 13]: You would as soon brick up windows to keep out the sun .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 20]: She radiates happiness and content , without -- this is the point -- without effort on her own part !
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 32]: The effort to her would be to grumble and be disagreeable , yet she receives all the credit and appreciation which she would have more truly deserved in the other case .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 3]: And Jean !
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 4]: Look at Jean !
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 21]: Honestly -- we are both her devoted slaves -- but honestly , is it by any virtue of her own ?
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 10]: Does she reign by merit or by chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 3]: Vanna smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 7]: `` I know what you mean .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 18]: Jean is charming , but it is easier for her to be charming than for most people .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 13]: Every glance in the glass must be as reviving as a tonic .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 38]: She has no difficulty in making friends , for people advance three quarters of the way to meet her ; and if by chance she is in a bad mood -- well , she is charming still .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 12]: Of course , if she were plain -- '' `` Exactly !
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 16]: She reigns in a kingdom of chance , and by no merit of her own .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 62]: Does n't that seem rather hard on the unfortunates who start with a handicap -- a restless , unsatisfied nature , for example -- a nature which longs for the affection and appreciation which it seems fated never to receive ; which suffers and struggles , and honestly sees no reason why life should be harder for it than for another ?
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 14]: Yet there it is -- the inequality , the handicap from the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 52]: Jean has beauty and charm , but even these do n't weigh so heavily in the balance as happiness ; the aura of happiness and content which radiates from Miggles and her kind -- the Mark Tapleys of the world , who triumph over every sort of physical and material difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 3]: You smile !
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 21]: Are you thinking of some one you know , some particular person who is included in this happy category ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 32]: `` Yes ; of a man I met only the other day -- a man over thirty , with eyes like a child ; clear , and unclouded , and happy .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 41]: Yet he had known many anxieties ; in a worldly sense I suppose he would be counted a failure , but , as you say , one _ felt _ it , the aura of radiant happiness and content . ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 4]: `` Lucky beggar !
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 50]: The world which counts him a failure would think me a success , because I have plenty of money , and was born to a decent position ; but looking back over my life I ca n't remember one single occasion when I have been really _ content _ .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 17]: There has always seemed something wanting , a final touch of completeness floating out of reach .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 29]: Yet I give you my word , if at this moment a wish would bring me anything I chose , I should not know what to ask ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 23]: Vanna looked at him searchingly , noting the lean cheeks , the hollow brow , the deep lines around eyes and mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 12]: `` Is n't that partly physical , do n't you think ?
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 6]: You do n't look strong .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 7]: The body affects the mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 26]: Her voice involuntarily took a softer tone , the feminine tribute to weakness in any form ; but Piers Rendall would not accept the excuse .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 14]: `` On the contrary , it 's my mind that affects my body .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 5]: I 'm strong enough .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 15]: My body was born free of microbes -- the poison was in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 11]: That seems a hard theory , but it 's true .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 28]: Have you never noticed how one child in a family seems to have inherited all the weaknesses and failings , while the others get off scot free ?
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 23]: He is plain , while they are handsome ; sullen , where they are genial ; underhand , while they are open .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 40]: I know such cases where one can only look on and marvel -- where there is no blame to be cast , where the parents have broken no law -- are healthy , no relation -- '' Vanna winced .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 16]: A shadow passed across her face , as if cast by a flickering bough . ''
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 13]: _ Do n't _ talk of it , '' she cried urgently .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 4]: `` Do n't !
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 10]: It is too pitiful , here in this glen .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 8]: I ca n't discuss such things here .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 12]: Another time , perhaps , but let me be happy here .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 5]: Talk of happy things .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 50]: There is so much sorrow ... '' Piers looked at her , and as he did so there arose in his mind the swift remembrance of her face as she had sat upon the pebbly beach a few days before -- the face on which he had read tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 4]: Remorse seized him .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 7]: He hastened to retrieve his mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 4]: `` Forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 11]: You are quite right -- the scene is not appropriate .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 14]: Miss Strangeways , by the laws of appreciation , this glen is yours .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 13]: I have a conviction that these trees recognise you as their queen .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 11]: Lay down a law , and we will keep it .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 19]: Come what may , when you and I enter this glen , we will leave our troubles behind .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 18]: It shall be a space apart , in which to be busy over nothing but being happy .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 21]: We will talk of happy things , happy memories , happy prospects ; best of all , the happy present .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 17]: It shall be a sin against the realm and its sovereign to mention one painful fact .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 5]: Is it agreed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 7]: Vanna looked around with wistful glance .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 5]: `` The Happy Land !
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 16]: That is a charming idea -- to keep one spot on earth sacred to happiness !
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 9]: Why has not one thought of that before ?
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 11]: Yes , indeed , Mr Rendall , I 'll agree .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 12]: The only pity is that I shall be here so seldom .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 12]: One ought to keep one 's happy land within reach . ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 12]: `` I hope you may come more often than you think .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 21]: Mr Goring is talking of buying the Cottage , and if that comes off you will be constantly with them .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 7]: My visits also are only occasional .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 11]: For nine months of the year I am in town .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 20]: It will be an extra attraction to come down to a place where I am bound to be happy .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 7]: Where is your settled home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 9]: `` I have no home at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 20]: Vanna vouchsafed no further explanation , and Piers did not ask for one , for which she was grateful .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 25]: More than once this tactful reservation of the obvious had arrested her attention , and been mentally noted as the man 's best point .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 23]: Vanna felt sorry for him , tender over him , as a woman will do over something that is suffering or weak .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 30]: The nervous , restless face looked far indeed from content , yet he had declared that if he had power to wish he would not know what to desire .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 30]: That might mean that he was dwelling in that unrecognised stage of love , that period of discomfort , doubt , and upheaval , which precedes the final illumination .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 13]: It would go hard with him if he loved and were disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 9]: She put the thought aside with resolute effort .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 9]: Was not the glen dedicated to happy thoughts ?
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 31]: The half-hour slipped quickly away , and presently Jean herself descended to seat herself on the bench by Vanna 's side , and take the conversation under her own control .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 26]: At four o'clock they returned to the house , mounting the steep path , and entering with a sigh the stiff precincts of the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 81]: On the verandah the two stout , black-robed figures of the old ladies could be seen reposing in their wickerwork chairs , but , behold , the distance between those chairs was largely increased , and between the two , the obvious centre of attraction , sat a third form -- a masculine form , clad in light grey clothes , towards whom both glances were directed , who gesticulated with his hands , and bent from side to side .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 20]: The face of this newcomer could not be distinguished ; his figure was half hidden by the encircling chairs .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 6]: `` Who the dickens ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 4]: ejaculated Piers blankly .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 12]: He stared beneath frowning brows , searching memory , without response .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 6]: `` None of the neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 5]: Some one from town .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 6]: How has he come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 7]: Vanna looked , but without interest .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 24]: In a short time the carriage would be at the door to carry the three ladies back to the cottage by the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 14]: The advent of a stranger could not affect them for good or ill .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 27]: She turned to exchange a casual remark with Jean , and behold , Jean 's cheeks were damask -- flaming , as if with a fever .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 5]: Now what was this ?
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 10]: The effect of that nap on the mossy ground ?
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 12]: But not a moment before Jean 's colour had been normal .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 9]: Had anything been said to arouse her wrath ?
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 12]: Was she by chance annoyed at this interruption to the visit ?
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 22]: And then , nearer already by a score of yards , Vanna turned once more towards the verandah , and understood .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 57]: There , sandwiched between the two old ladies , smiling , debonair , at ease , a stranger , yet apparently on terms of easy friendship , sat -- not the wraith of Robert Gloucester , as for a moment seemed the only possible explanation , but the man himself , in veritable flesh and blood .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 12]: Incredible , preposterous as it appeared , it was nevertheless true .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 36]: One could not doubt the evidence of one 's own senses , of the eyes which beheld him , the ears which listened to his words , as in characteristic simplicity he offered his explanation .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 6]: `` How do you do ?
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 8]: You are surprised to see me here .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 8]: I came down by the twelve train .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 12]: Mr Goring and I have arranged to have some fishing together .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 8]: I 'm putting up at the inn .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 11]: I called at the Cottage and found you were out .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 29]: The maid told me where you were to be found , and I thought I would walk over , and perhaps have the pleasure of escorting you home .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 9]: I have introduced myself as you see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 32]: So far he had addressed himself pointedly to Vanna , casting never a glance in the direction of Jean , but now he turned towards Piers with the frankest of smiles .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 6]: `` My name 's Gloucester .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 7]: I 'm just home from abroad .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 9]: I 'm going to fish with Mr Goring .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 8]: Hope you do n't mind my intruding .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 10]: I am at a loose end down here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 9]: `` Not at all -- not at all !
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 5]: Pleased to see you .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 3]: Sit down .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 7]: We 'll have some tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 18]: Piers spoke cordially ; what was more to the point , he looked cordial into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 58]: Of a shy , reserved nature , cherishing an active dislike of strangers , he yet appeared to find nothing extraordinary or offensive in the intrusion of this man `` just home from abroad , '' who had raided his mother 's privacy in the hope of gaining for himself the pleasure of meeting her invited guests .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 27]: Vanna looked past him to the faces of the two old ladies seated on the basket chairs , and beheld them benign , smiling , unperturbed .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 19]: They also had fallen beneath the spell of Gloucester 's personality , and had placidly accepted his explanations .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 27]: Jean walked to the farthest of the row of chairs , pushed it back out of the line of vision , and seated herself in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 25]: Piers strolled towards the house to hurry the arrival of tea , and Miggles declared genially : `` So nice for gentlemen to fish !
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 13]: Such an interest , especially getting on in years like Mr Goring .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 5]: Gout , you know !
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 4]: such a handicap .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 7]: I believe the inn is comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 7]: Quite clean ; but always mutton .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 10]: You will have to take meals with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 9]: `` I -- I 've lost my handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 10]: I 'll look upstairs , '' mumbled Vanna hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 39]: She dived through the open window , fled upstairs to the shelter of the bedroom where she had laid aside her wraps three hours before , and sinking down on the bed pressed both hands against her lips .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 19]: For the first time for many weeks , laughter overcame her in paroxysms which could not be repressed .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 18]: She laughed and laughed ; the tears poured down her cheeks ; she laughed again and again .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 4]: A NARROW ESCAPE .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 10]: Suddenly Jean wrapped herself in a mantle of reserve .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 30]: Not even to Vanna , her chosen confidante , did she express surprise at Gloucester 's sudden appearance , or make one single comment , favourable or the reverse .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 24]: Driving home in Mrs Rendall 's carriage , she maintained her fair share in the conversation , and betrayed no sign of embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 41]: That she was embarrassed Vanna knew by the tone of her voice , which was wont to take a higher , shriller note on such occasions ; but neither Gloucester nor Miggles was likely to recognise so subtle a betrayal .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 24]: The old lady was evidently greatly taken with the new acquaintance , and invited him to dinner at the end of the drive .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 28]: `` We are only three women , very dull for a young man , but as you are alone in the inn -- so unhomelike , inn-parlours !
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 21]: -- if you _ would _ care to dine at seven o'clock , pot luck , just a simple meal !
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 27]: Do n't dress ; it 's a picnic life down here , and the girls like to run about as long as it keeps light . ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 39]: Miggles had reigned as mistress of Mr Goring 's home for so many years that , failing the second wife 's presence , she still managed the household , without any attempt at interference from her old pupil .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 41]: Jean had no ambition for domestic responsibilities ; looking after a house was dull , stodgy work , Miggles liked it , then for goodness ' sake let her do it ; she had no wish to exercise her prerogative .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 39]: It was Miggles , therefore , who gave the newcomer his first invitation to the Cottage , but when Robert 's eyes turned to the girl with an involuntary question , Jean was ready with a gracious support .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 11]: `` We are very quiet , as Miss Miggs says .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 28]: Next week father brings down the family , and it will be livelier ; but if you care to risk it , we shall be pleased . ''
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 4]: `` Seven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 4]: Thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 4]: said Robert simply .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 16]: He took his leave for the time being , and the ladies entered the Cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 23]: `` We had better get our letters written , as we shall not have time later on , '' said Jean calmly .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 20]: Even when seated with Vanna at the same writing-table she made no reference to the event of the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 44]: It might have been the most natural thing in the world for Robert Gloucester to leave his old friends in less than a week after his return from India , in order to have the privilege of fishing with a strange elderly gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 79]: When the letters were finished , she talked on indifferent subjects , gaily , lovingly , intimately as ever , yet with a certain carriage of the head , a set of the lips which seemed to send forth an unspoken warning , `` Until now my heart has lain bare before you , but to-day there has entered into it something so intimate , so sacred , that it can not be revealed to any human gaze .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 7]: _ Touch me not _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 8]: And Vanna understood , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 26]: Robert Gloucester came back to dinner and sat at the head of the table opposite Miggles , the two girls seated one on either side .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 35]: A bowl of roses stood in the centre of the table ; roses twined round the framework of the opened window ; tiny sprays of roses wandered over the muslin of Jean 's gown .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 20]: They talked of books , of pictures , of foreign lands , of things extraordinary , and things prosaic .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 40]: When Robert recounted experiences abroad , the two girls questioned him as to scenery and environment , and Miggles wished to know what he had had to eat , and if there was any means of drying his clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 27]: Gloucester also entered into details about his business life , and the failure of his investments , explaining his present monetary position with an incredible frankness .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 19]: `` It seemed an awfully good thing , perfectly sound , but it came a jolly big crash .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 14]: I was fortunate to get out of it as well as I did .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 9]: I have n't been fortunate in my speculations .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 10]: Between them I 've dropped almost all my capital .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 32]: I have a share or two in a bank paying rattling good interest , and the firm pay me a fair salary , and that 's all that is left . ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 18]: `` Oh , we know you do n't mean _ that _ , '' laughed Miggles easily .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 26]: `` It will all go on quite nicely , I am sure , and you will be settling down and marrying , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 9]: `` Of course , '' said Robert Gloucester .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 23]: There was something so exquisitely unusual about his frank avowal of poverty that Vanna had hard work to keep a straight face .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 36]: What to another man would have been a secret between himself and his banker weighed so heavily on Robert Gloucester 's candid soul that he must needs blurt it out on the first possible occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 23]: Vanna knew intuitively the exact workings of his mind : he had come down to Seacliff to woo Jean for his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 34]: Jean must know from the beginning exactly what he had to offer ; not for a single evening could she be allowed to think of him in a setting which did not exist .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 11]: `` He had not been lucky in his speculations . ''
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 3]: Unnecessary explanation !
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 15]: It was from guileless natures such as his that the fraudulent made their hoards .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 16]: The national savings bank would be the only safe resting-place for Robert Gloucester 's money .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 23]: When the simple meal was over the two girls accompanied their guest into the garden and sat beside him while he smoked .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 19]: He neither offered cigarettes to them , nor did they dream of providing them on their own account .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 18]: In the seventies it was still a rare and petrifying experience to see a young girl smoke .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 23]: The heroine of to-day is depicted to us as making dainty play with her cigarette , or blowing smoke-rings with unequalled grace .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 29]: If the tips of her fingers are also stained yellow with nicotine , and her clothes diffuse an atmosphere of a smoking-carriage , these details are mercifully concealed .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 13]: Jean and Vanna at least had no hankerings after this masculine amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 25]: Once and again as the time passed by , Robert looked fixedly at Vanna , and grey eyes and brown exchanged an unspoken duel .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 6]: `` Leave us alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 4]: entreated the brown .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 7]: `` You know ; you understand !
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 14]: As you are wise be merciful ... '' `` Not one step ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 4]: replied the grey .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 10]: `` Here I am , and here I stay .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 13]: This is my post , and I will stick to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 7]: `` Be hanged to your post !
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 7]: You take too much upon yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 7]: Hand over your post to me .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 22]: Think of the difficulties , the contrivings , the explainings I have had to undergo before getting away from town ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 24]: `` You had no business to leave ... '' Vanna stuck obstinately to her guns , and at last Gloucester abandoned his efforts .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 23]: Another man would have been angry , impatient , would have eyed her with cold antagonism , but Robert betrayed no irritation .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 15]: Rather did his brown eyes dilate with mischievous amusement as they met her own .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 10]: `` Please yourself , '' they seemed to say .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 6]: `` Do your little best .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 5]: Erect your puny barriers .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 13]: A day or two more or less -- what does it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 6]: The end is sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 26]: The Cottage with its sloping garden was perched high on the side of one of two outstanding cliffs which formed a deep , narrow bay .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 28]: So far did these chalk-walls jut out , so narrow was the space between , that the view from the land had a confined , stage-like effect .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 49]: The coast-line on either side was completely hidden from sight , only the blue-green waters stretched ahead , but these waters were one of the highways of a nation 's life , and o'er its surface all kinds of craft passed to and fro , in endless panorama .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 49]: When the tide was up , the great steamers could safely take the inshore channel , while near at hand , and looking as if one could , in nautical language , `` throw a biscuit aboard , '' the smaller craft plied their way to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 57]: Now it would be a small sailing barge , with captain , mate , and crew , comprised in one single hand , anon a white-sailed yacht , with gleaming brass-work and spotless paint , or a coasting collier , grimy and drab , her screw out of water , as she churned her homeward way .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 47]: In fine weather coasting passenger-boats ventured near shore , while farther off the pilot-boats of many nations could be discerned , decked with gay strings of signalling flags , and the busy tugs plied far and near , endlessly on the watch for chances of salvage .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 86]: One misty day as Jean sat perched alone on the edge of the railed-in garden , at a point from which she could have dropped a stone into the sea beneath , a smooth grey keel glided noiselessly round the corner of the cliff , and another , and yet a third -- low-built , ominous-looking monsters , the colour of the fog , the colour of the waves , Her Majesty 's battleships , each bearing on board its complement of seven hundred men .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 19]: To-night , as the daylight faded slowly away , the different lights at sea attracted the watching eye .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 59]: From the left came a merry , starlike twinkle , as from a faithful friend who kept firmly to his post ; beyond him in the dim distance was the humourist , who for ten seconds on end indulged in a stony stare , then darkened , gave two cunning winks , and so again to his stare .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 32]: Right ahead was the big revolving light which , like a constable afloat , divided the traffic -- `` This way for the river , that for the North Sea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 14]: High over all swung the rays from the great lighthouse on the downs .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 116]: Presently round the farther cliff came a great ocean liner , its cabin windows showing out a blaze of light , the throb , throb of its engines heard distinctly in the distance , a floating city , bearing home an army of men : the man who had toiled and reaped his reward ; the man who had toiled and failed , the idler , the drone , the remittance man back again to prey on his friends ; the bridegroom speeding to his bride ; the trembler , to whom the wires had flashed a message of tragedy ; the sinner , fleeing from justice , the pleasure lover seeking a new world .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 8]: Those brilliantly lighted rooms held them all .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 38]: Up the long channel they sailed ; past the shifty sand-banks , past the hidden rocks ; gliding smoothly along the beaten track , while the captain stood on his bridge and grew pale beneath his tan .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 14]: Until the dangerous channel was navigated , he would not leave his post .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 22]: The three who were seated on the garden bench watched the great vessel in silence until she disappeared behind the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 22]: `` A week ago , '' said Robert softly , `` a week ago I was steaming along this very coast .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 6]: Only one little week ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 22]: He broke off suddenly , and there was no response , but Vanna felt Jean 's fingers twitch within her arm .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 16]: Was she too beginning to realise the bearing of this week upon her own life ?
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 40]: During the days which elapsed before Mr and Mrs Goring and the two schoolboys arrived at the Cottage , Jean kept sedulously by her friend 's side , and allowed Robert Gloucester no chance of a _ tete-a-tete _ .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 47]: Instead of being ordered to keep her distance , as on the occasion of Piers Rendall 's visit , Vanna was held firmly by the arm , invited to join every expedition , considered so necessary that , without her company no expedition could be faced .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 22]: Where Jean went , Vanna must needs go also ; who wished to see one , must see the other also .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 14]: But when the family arrived , the chaperonage could no longer be preserved .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 9]: The Cottage was crowded to its fullest limit .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 7]: Miggles was busy with household affairs .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 21]: Mr Goring , his wife , the two schoolboys , all made their own demands on the girls ' time .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 26]: If Jean were bidden to accompany her father for a walk along the downs , Vanna must needs hunt for crabs among the rocks below .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 20]: If Vanna was writing letters to tradespeople , Jean must run to the village and order cakes for tea .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 31]: Young girls should make themselves useful ; a daughter should be ready to wait on her father ; a sister should be glad to amuse her brothers in their holidays .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 66]: In these days it was worth while for an occupant of the inn-parlour to keep a sharp lookout on the winding path leading from the cliff to the village , for if by chance a girl 's graceful form were seen descending , there was time to snatch hat and stick , and reach the corner of the road at the same moment as herself .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 63]: Jean , intercepted on her way to fulfil a commission , and without possibility of escape , would promptly adopt an air of freezing dignity , reply in monosyllables , and hurry through her work in the shortest possible space of time ; but no amount of coldness , of snubbing , or neglect could damp the ardour of Gloucester 's pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 154]: Before a week was past , the budding romance was discerned not only by the different members of the household , but by the village _ en bloc _ ; and while parents discussed prospects and settlements , and the schoolboys planned holiday visits to `` Jean 's house , '' Mrs Jones of the general stores moved the position of a row of sweet-bottles in the shop window , in order to enjoy a better view of the daily encounter , and the boatmen waiting impatiently for customers consulted their watches on the appearance of either of the interesting couple , and indulging an apparently ingrained habit , bet pennies together concerning the time which would elapse before the advent of `` t ` other , '' And still Jean wrapped herself in her mantle of reserve , and refused to mention Gloucester 's name even in private conclave with her friend .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 38]: Piers Rendall often walked over to the Cottage to spend some hours of the day with his friends , and , strange as it might appear , the two young men seemed mutually attracted to each other .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 27]: Vanna believing them both to be in love with the same girl , was constantly watching for signs of jealousy and irritation , but none appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 43]: If Piers was occasionally somewhat silent and distrait , the fact did not interfere with his transparent enjoyment of Gloucester 's company ; while Robert himself seemed to take a positive pride and pleasure in the knowledge of the other 's devotion .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 10]: `` He admires her desperately , does n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 4]: Every one does .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 16]: There are dozens of fellows head over heels in love with her , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 2]: Scores !
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 11]: She must be kept busy refusing them , poor fellows !
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 34]: Hard lines for a girl , especially when she is so sweet and sensitive , and sympathetic , and -- '' Vanna threw up her hand with a comical little grimace of appeal .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 9]: `` That 's enough , that 's enough !
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 11]: Three adjectives are quite a good allowance for one sentence .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 5]: Spare me the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 13]: Miss Goring has a charming disposition , and she is duly appreciated .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 4]: That 's settled .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 8]: Now we 'll talk of something else .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 8]: How did the fishing go this morning ?
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 5]: A good haul ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 11]: They looked at each other and laughed with mischievous enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 11]: Each time they found themselves alone the same thing happened .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 15]: Gloucester persistently endeavoured to talk about Jean ; Vanna as persistently turned the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 12]: On both sides the contest was conducted with absolute good humour .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 27]: It was as amusing as a game , in which each tried to outwit the other , to set for him an unconscious trap and pitfall .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 28]: To-day they walked along the country lanes , Jean and Piers Rendall ahead , Miggles bringing up the rear , with a schoolboy hanging on each arm .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 40]: These two lads , Jack and Pat , adored the old woman who had been their confidante and mentor from their earliest years , and there was literally no end to the sympathetic interest which she bestowed upon them .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 20]: Father and mother might weary of eternal cricket and sixth-form reminiscences , and impatiently suggest bed or a book .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 44]: Jean might , and did , wax frankly cross and bored , but Miggles never failed to produce a due display of surprise ; never denied the expected admiration , nor shirked a question which gave the conversation a new turn of life .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 61]: At this moment Vanna could hear Pat 's voice reeling off the everlasting details : `` Smith , major , was bowling his hardest -- he 's a terror to bowl -- and the pitch was fast , and a ball got up , and got me on the shoulder -- '' `` Dear , dear , think of that !
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 6]: And you went on playing ?
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 6]: You _ are _ brave !
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 13]: And made a fine score too , I 'll be bound ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 21]: How much of Miggles 's happiness did she owe to this blessed capacity for sympathy in the interests of others ?
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 56]: The destination of this afternoon 's walk was a little wood lying about a mile inland , and as a short cut across country , Jean and Piers led the way through a farmyard , and thence on to a winding lane , sunk deep between two hedgerows , fragrant with honeysuckle and wild rose .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 29]: To right and left lay the fields belonging to the farm ; pleasant fields of wheat and corn , of delicate , green-eared barley , of sweet-smelling beans .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 17]: It was a typical English lane ; a perfect English afternoon , not typical , alas !
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 17]: except so far as it demonstrated the perfection to which our erratic climate can occasionally attain .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 88]: The sky overhead was deeply , uncloudedly blue ; the sea in the distance the clear , soft green of an aquamarine , sparkling with a thousand points of light ; all that the eye could see was beautiful and harmonious ; all that the ear could hear , peaceful and serene ; laughter , happy voices , the soaring notes of a lark ; all things animate and inanimate seemed to speak of peace and happiness ; and then suddenly , horribly , the scene changed .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 41]: What had appeared the distant lowing of cattle , swelled into a threatening roar ; a man shouted loudly , and his call was echoed by many voices , by a clamour of sound , by high , warning cries .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 41]: From the far end of the narrow lane came the sound of galloping feet -- heavy , thundering feet seeming to shake the ground ; light , racing feet pursuing ; swifter footsteps , which were yet mysteriously left behind .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 22]: Borne on the air came the cries of men 's voices , and ever and anon that deep , dull roar .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 16]: Nearer and nearer drew the danger , but the tall hedges hid it from sight .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 26]: Jean and Piers turned hurriedly back ; Miggles and the boys hurried forward to where Vanna and Gloucester stood , the centre of the group .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 32]: The two men exchanged swift , anxious glances , divining , without consultation , the nature of the danger -- a bull , escaped from its chain , rushing towards them .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 5]: What could be done ?
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 27]: The towering hedges gave no chance of escape , and so far as the eye could reach there was neither gate nor entrance into the fields .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 17]: Before there was time to consult or to issue directions , the danger was upon them .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 29]: With incredible swiftness , within as it seemed one moment from the time when the first cry had burst upon their ears , the danger was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 50]: Round a corner of the road the huge beast rushed into view ; a terrible , nerve-shattering sight , filling up , as it seemed , the whole space of the narrow path , pawing the earth , sending up clouds of dust , bellowing with rage and fear .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 11]: Breathless with horror , they stood and watched it come .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 7]: And then a strange thing happened .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 22]: At that moment of strain and terror the thoughts of the four elders of the little party flew instinctively towards Jean .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 4]: Danger and Jean !
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 4]: Death and Jean !
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 5]: The idea was insupportable .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 17]: Jean , who was in herself the embodiment of youth , of health , of joy .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 76]: The woman who had been to her as a second mother ; the girl who was her lifelong friend ; the man who until now had been the most favoured of her admirers , turned with a common impulse to succour Jean , and Jean , white-faced , trembling , primitive woman , stripped in one moment of conventions and pretence , indifferent , oblivious of them all , leapt forward into Gloucester 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 35]: They closed round her ; she clung to him , hiding her head on his breast ; he pressed a hand on her hair , screening her eyes till the danger should have passed .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 8]: In another moment it was upon them .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 11]: An agonised gasp of fear passed from one to another .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 5]: The danger was past !
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 43]: The great brute went plunging down the lane , his head bent low , his small eyes blinking , foam upon his lips ; in his anxiety to escape his pursuers , taking no heed of the figures flattened against the hedge .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 19]: With shouts and oaths , brandished sticks and panting breath , the farm hands galloped in his rear .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 22]: They passed out of sight , and the quiet lane , sunk beneath its flowering hedges , regained its wonted peace .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 17]: Not so the human beings for whom that moment had been fraught with such startling emotions .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 15]: Jean 's revulsion of feeling was as swift as the impulse which had preceded .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 32]: Hardly had the pursuit clattered by than she had wrenched herself from Robert 's grasp , and with crimson cheeks and haughtily tilted head , taken shelter by Miggles 's side .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 17]: Vanna , still trembling , leant back against the hedge , gazing from side to side .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 15]: Robert Gloucester turned and walked down the lane , following the line of pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 15]: She caught a glimpse of his face as he went -- radiant , aglow !
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 9]: At the other man she would not look .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 10]: Sympathy for his discomfiture and pain withheld her gaze .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 21]: She knew exactly how Piers Rendall would look at this moment : his eyes brilliantly hard , his lips a-twitch .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 9]: For her own sake she would not look .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 7]: She hated to see that twitch .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 12]: Miggles leant against the hedge , and burst into unrestrained tears .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 14]: Blessed Miggles , who could always be trusted to come to the rescue !
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 27]: Her sobs , her tears , her simple oblivion to the subject which was engrossing the minds of her companions were the saving of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 10]: `` Oh , my dear Jean -- a bull !
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 4]: A runaway bull !
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 16]: Never in all my life -- and to think that to-day , of all others .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 4]: This narrow lane !
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 5]: Your poor dear father !
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 8]: If you had worn your red dress !
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 7]: It might so easily have happened !
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 3]: Thank God !
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 3]: thank God !
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 8]: Your arm , dear , your arm .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 5]: I do so tremble !
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 11]: My poor old heart feels as if it would burst .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 4]: What a Providence !
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 5]: What a Providence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 13]: `` What a wicked , wretched man to leave the gate unlocked !
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 16]: I 'll ask father to have him discharged at once , '' cried Jean hotly .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 8]: `` It 's wicked , criminal carelessness .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 8]: We might all have been killed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 17]: From the bottom of the hedge crawled the scratched and blackened figures of the two schoolboys .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 5]: `` I say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 5]: gasped Jack , breathless .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 5]: `` What a lark !
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 6]: What a blooming lark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 3]: TREASURE TROVE !
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 9]: Miggles did not easily recover from her fright .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 44]: The good body was in precarious health : it was only the power of mind over body which kept her going , and when the motive power was temporarily eclipsed it was startling , even alarming , to behold the corresponding physical change .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 30]: The light faded from the eyes ; the chin dropped ; a dozen unsuspected lines furrowed the face ; beaming middle-age was transformed in a moment into suffering age .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 30]: `` I think , my dears , '' she announced apologetically , `` so sorry to spoil your walk , but I _ think _ I 'll go home !
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 7]: Bulls , you know , bulls !
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 6]: They _ are _ disconcerting .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 31]: When you 've lived all your life in towns you are not accustomed ... I 've got a little , '' she gasped painfully , `` stitch in my side !
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 7]: It will soon be gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 16]: The grey hue of her face showed only too plainly the explanation of that stitch .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 18]: Miggles knew it herself , but , as ever , preferred to make light of her ailments .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 29]: She leant on Piers 's arm , glancing affectionately in his face , and made no objections when Vanna came forward to support her on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 7]: `` I _ am _ honoured !
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 6]: Quite a triumphal procession ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 7]: she gasped , with blue lips .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 12]: The two schoolboys had scampered off to join in the chase .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 41]: Jean was preparing to follow Miggles and her supporters , when a hand was laid on her arm , and Robert Gloucester 's voice spoke in her ear : `` You and I are going on to the wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 9]: Jean jerked herself free with a haughty air .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 9]: `` Excuse me , I am going home .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 8]: I must look after Miss Miggs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 8]: `` Miss Miggs has plenty of helpers .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 6]: She does n't need you .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 3]: I do .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 7]: Be kind to me , Jean .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 7]: I 've waited so long . ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 3]: So long !
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 26]: It was not yet a fortnight since he had arrived in England ; but time has different values , as Jean had discovered for herself .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 18]: These last days had counted for more in life than all the years which had gone before .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 19]: She looked for one moment into the brown eyes bent upon her , then hastily lowered her lids .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 12]: But she turned down hill in the direction of the wood .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 31]: There was nothing in the world so mad or impossible that she could have refused Robert Gloucester when he looked at her with his clear eyes lighted by that flame .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 21]: They walked in silence along the quiet lane , golden with buttercups , into the cool shadow of the wood .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 4]: `` Now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 11]: said Jean 's heart , beating painfully against her side .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 4]: `` Now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 38]: She was not unversed in occasions of the kind , and as a rule had no difficulty in `` heading off '' her suitor by a baffling flow of conversation , but to-day no words would come .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 51]: She looked at the soft carpet of moss beneath her feet ; she looked at the branches overhead ; she looked down the gladelike vista , and saw ahead a green space encircled by trees -- a sunlit , sun-kissed space , doubly bright from contrast with the surrounding shade .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 7]: said the voice in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 7]: `` It will be there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 17]: It seemed fitting that Robert Gloucester should tell his love in the light and the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 23]: Right into the centre of the sunny space they walked , and as by a mutual impulse halted , face to face .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 9]: For once Robert 's radiant calm was eclipsed .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 36]: Before the tremendous purport of the moment , confidence , tranquillity , all the varied qualities which combined to sustain the equilibrium of his character , were swept aside as though they had never been .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 21]: The world held but one person , and that was Jean ; if Jean failed him , nothing was left .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 20]: At that moment the physical strain of long sojourn abroad showed itself painfully in sunken cheek and pallid hue .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 41]: In the light grey clothes , which hung so loosely on his thin form , he looked like the ghost of a man , a ghost with living eyes -- glowing , burning eyes , aflame with love and dread .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 14]: He stood with hands clasped at his back , not daring a touch .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 4]: `` Jean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 35]: he said breathlessly , `` I am a beggar at your gate , I am starving , Jean , and I have nothing to offer you -- nothing but myself and my love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 53]: Afterwards Jean had many criticisms to make concerning the fashion of Robert 's avowal -- criticisms at which she would make him blush when his hair was grey ; but at the moment she was conscious of one thing only -- that Robert was in torture and that she could ease him .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 17]: With a smile which was divine in its abandon she held out her hands towards him .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 14]: `` But that 's all I want , '' said Jean , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 35]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ They sat for an hour by the side of an old oak , the sunshine flickering through the branches on the illumined loveliness of Jean 's face , on Robert 's rapturous joy .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 30]: Even to a cold , outside eye they would have appeared an ideal couple : what wonder that to each the other seemed the crowning miracle of the world !
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 25]: The perfect moment was theirs ; the ineffable content , the amazement of joy which God in His mercy vouchsafes to all true lovers .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 28]: The love lasts , but the glory wanes ; of necessity it must wane in a material world , but the memory of it can never die .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 21]: It lives to sweeten life , to be a memory of perfect union , a foretaste of the life beyond !
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 34]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ They talked in the tongue of angels , in such words as can never be transcribed in print ; they marvelled and soared , and then at last came down to facts .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 15]: A shadow flitted across Robert 's face ; his voice took an anxious note .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 9]: `` I am a poor man , Jean .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 15]: Until now I have not cared , but I 'm grieved for your sake .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 24]: I should like to have kept you like a queen , but I am poor , and I fear shall never be otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 25]: We shall have to live in a small house with a couple of servants , and think twice of every sovereign we spend . ''
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 5]: `` Shall we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 4]: asked Jean absently .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 26]: She was occupied in measuring her small white hand against Robert 's sunburnt palm , and had no attention to spare for such minor details .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 36]: Her own dress allowance of a hundred a year had invariably to be supplemented by an indulgent father , but it seemed to her a matter of supreme unimportance whether Robert were rich or poor .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 33]: At that moment she would have received with equanimity the news that he was a huckster of goods , and that she would be expected to follow his barrow through the streets .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 20]: Monetary conditions simply did not exist ; but on another point there was no end to her exactions . ''
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 10]: _ How _ much do you love me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 16]: `` Beyond all words , and all measures , beyond the capacity of mortal man .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 14]: That is why I feel a giant at this moment -- a god !
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 15]: There 's no room for my love in a man 's poor frame . ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 4]: Jean dimpled deliriously .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 19]: This was just as it should be , and such good hearing that it could bear endless repetition .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 7]: `` And am I the first ?
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 9]: Have you never loved any one before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 6]: `` Not for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 9]: The thought of marriage never entered my head .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 11]: I thought I was far better off as I was .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 8]: Oh , Jean , imagine it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 10]: Jean smiled at him with shy , lovely eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 13]: `` And never flirted , nor run after a pretty girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 8]: `` Goodness , _ yes _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 15]: The emphasis of Robert 's affirmative was a trifle disconcerting to Jean 's complacence .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 10]: `` What do you take me for , Jean ?
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 5]: I adore pretty girls .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 10]: I should be a fool if I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 17]: At balls and picnics it 's part of the programme to get up a passing flirtation .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 18]: I wish I had a sovereign for every one I 've enjoyed in the last ten years .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 22]: Half a dozen dances and supper , and forget all about her next day -- you know the sort of thing !
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 11]: It does n't enter into _ our _ calculations . ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 9]: Jean stared , considered , and finally laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 7]: `` No , it does n't !
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 7]: Thank goodness I am not jealous .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 24]: I have dozens of faults , as you will find out to your cost , poor boy ; but that 's not one .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 11]: I do n't mind how many pretty girls you admire .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 6]: We 'll admire them together .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 10]: You are mine ; we belong to each other .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 15]: As you say , that sort of thing does n't _ enter _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 9]: She sat silent , musing with parted lips .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 27]: A bird hopped lightly across the grass , peered at them for a moment with bright , curious eyes , and soared up to the blue .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 14]: The air was sweet with the fresh , pungent scent of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 8]: `` What _ is _ it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 14]: questioned Jean , as every lover has questioned since the days of Eve .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 26]: `` What is it that makes the difference , the yawning , illimitable difference between just one person and all the rest of the world ?
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 9]: Why do we love each other like this ?
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 16]: You have seen hundreds of girls , but you have never wished to marry one .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 17]: Men have loved me , and I hated them the moment they began to make love .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 10]: But you -- if _ you _ had n't !
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 9]: -- Robert , what should I have done ?
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 25]: I should have lived on -- I am so strong , but my heart would have died ; there would have been nothing left .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 9]: And a fortnight ago we had not met !
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 29]: People will say that it is madness , that we can not know our own minds ; but the marvel of it is -- we knew at once !
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 24]: I was frightened , and ran away , but I knew ; deep down in my heart I knew that you would follow .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 16]: Tell me when _ you _ began to know -- the very first moment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 40]: And then Robert retold the story to which Vanna had listened on the night of the ball , with the thrilling addition of the encounter in the conservatory , and Jean listened , thrilled , and trembling with agitation .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 7]: `` Yes , it is true .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 6]: I was waiting for you .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 6]: It was meant to be .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 11]: We were made to meet and love each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 15]: `` From the beginning of the world , my Rose , my Treasure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 4]: said Robert Gloucester .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 4]: THE WEDDING DAY .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 22]: Jean Goring and Robert Gloucester were married in the early days of October , after a bare three months ' engagement .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 28]: They themselves found the period one of ideal happiness , but , as is usually the case , it was somewhat trying to their relations and friends .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 52]: Jean , in her gay young beauty , had filled the centre of the stage for many friends , who were bound to suffer when the light shone no more upon them , and Jean had neither eyes , ears , nor heart for any one but her _ fiance _ .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 26]: Mr Goring gave his consent to the engagement with a readiness which was largely based upon the affection which his prospective son-in-law had already awakened .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 13]: `` He 's a splendid fellow -- a man in a thousand .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 19]: Thank Heaven you 've chosen a man who wo n't bore me to death hanging about the house .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 16]: It 's a poor match in a worldly sense , but that 's your affair .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 16]: You had chances of rich men before now , and would n't look at them .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 15]: I believe in letting people live their own lives , in their own way .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 23]: I 'll give you a good trousseau , and allow you two hundred a year ; but I ca n't do more .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 10]: There 's the boys ' education coming on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 8]: `` Oh , thank you , father .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 6]: That 's sweet of you .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 6]: I never expected so much .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 14]: We shall be poor , of course , but I sha n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 15]: It will be rather fun living in a small house and playing at housekeeping .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 8]: I never cared much for money . ''
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 5]: Mr Goring grimaced expressively .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 16]: Jean had not cared for money , simply because she had never realised its value .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 28]: Every want had been supplied , and there had been a comfortable certainty of a lenient parent in the background when her own generous allowance ran short .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 15]: Graceless mortals never realise the value of the blessings which are theirs in abundance .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 24]: Jean had enjoyed easy means and perfect health all her life , and took them as much for granted as light and air .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 14]: `` Had n't you better take some cooking lessons , or something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 5]: asked her father uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 41]: It crossed his mind at that moment that he had not done his duty by the man whom Jean was about to marry , in allowing his girl to grow up in absolute ignorance of her work in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 21]: `` Gloucester does n't strike me as a man likely to make money , and you ought to be trained .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 4]: Talk to Miggles .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 3]: Ask her .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 17]: She has about as good an idea of running a house as any woman I know .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 15]: It 's a good thing you are going to live within reach of home .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 11]: I 'm thankful Gloucester thinks of settling in town . ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 7]: `` Yes , oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 24]: Of course , if they gave him a really good offer for India -- I should rather like to live in India ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 16]: Jean smiled into space , blissfully unconscious of the pain on her father 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 49]: He was not a demonstrative man , and no one but himself knew how he had loved and cherished this child of his youth -- the daughter who had inherited the beauty and charm of the girl-wife with whom he had spent the golden year of his life .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 50]: To his own heart he acknowledged that Jean was his dearest possession -- dearer than wife , dearer than sons , dearer than life itself , and Jean could leave him without a pang -- would `` rather like '' to put the width of the world between them !
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 10]: `` India 's a long way off , Jean .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 9]: I should miss you if you went . ''
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 9]: `` But we 'd come home , father .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 11]: We 'd have a long holiday every five years . ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 2]: well !
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 15]: Mr Goring reminded himself that in his own youth he had been equally callous .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 27]: He recalled the day of his first marriage , and saw again the twisted face of his mother as she bade him adieu at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 26]: He had known a pang of regret at the sight , regret for _ her _ suffering , her loss ; not for his own .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 33]: For himself , the moment had been one of unalloyed triumph ; he had heaved a sigh of relief as the carriage bore him away and he was alone with his bride .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 29]: It was natural that it should be so -- natural and right ; but when one came to stand in the parent 's place , how it hurt !
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 7]: He set his teeth in endurance .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 38]: Mrs Goring regarded the engagement and prospective marriage primarily as a disagreeable upset to domestic routine , and did not rest until she had secured Vanna 's consent to prolong her visit until the bride had departed .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 19]: `` There will be so much to arrange , endless letters to write , and people to see .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 19]: Jean will be worse than useless , and poor dear Miss Miggs is not fit to rush about .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 18]: If you _ would _ stay and help , my dear , I should be unutterably grateful .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 12]: When you undertake a thing it is always well done . ''
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 12]: `` I should like to stay , '' replied Vanna simply .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 15]: The first days of Jean 's rapturous happiness had been hard for her friend .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 41]: It was not in human nature to avoid a feeling of loss , of loneliness , of hopeless longing for such happiness for herself , but it was a comfort to know that she could be of real practical help .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 47]: Jean , of course , had declared in words that nothing , no , nothing , could ever lessen the warmth of her friendship , and Vanna had faith to believe that in the years to come the love between them would increase rather than diminish .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 35]: In the meantime , however , she must needs stand aside , and be content to be neglected , ignored , regarded at times as an unwelcome intruder -- a difficult lesson to learn .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 34]: At the very first meeting after the engagement the difference of relationship had made itself felt , for Jean had shown a distinct annoyance when Vanna referred to the prophecy of the rose .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 9]: `` He had told you -- you knew ?
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 8]: He talked about it to you afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 38]: You knew how he felt -- '' Her face flushed with resentment ; there was a cool aloofness in her glance , as though a friend whom she had trusted had been discovered prying into hidden treasures .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 17]: `` Please do n't speak of it again ; do n't let any one else know .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 8]: Promise me never to mention it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 24]: That was all , but her manner said as plainly as words , `` It is our secret -- Robert 's and mine .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 10]: What right have you on our holy ground ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 37]: Vanna was by nature just and reasonable , and she told herself that in Jean 's place she might have felt the same irritation , though perhaps she would have been more chary about showing it .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 18]: She held herself in check , and was careful never again to refer to the forbidden topic .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 48]: On another occasion , when called to give her advice on a matter in consultation between the lovers , Robert had addressed his _ fiancee _ as `` Rose '' when Vanna , looking up quickly , surprised a swift glance of reproach on Jean 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 10]: `` You have forgotten , '' said that look .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 6]: `` We are not alone .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 11]: That name is not for the ears of a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 26]: It is for use only between you and me , when we are alone in our own kingdom , with the world shut out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 16]: The lonely ones of the world smart under many darts planted by these wordless arrows .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 4]: And Piers Rendall ?
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 12]: Vanna was perplexed and mystified by his reception of the news .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 42]: She had dreaded to see him amazed , broken down , despairing , and when he arrived at the Cottage the day after the great event , had felt her heart throb with a sympathy that was painful in its intensity .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 42]: They were seated in the hall drinking tea , a happy family group , the lovers side by side on an old oak settle , when the gate clicked , and Piers 's tall figure was seen walking up the path .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 37]: He looked anxiously towards the open door , and Vanna felt convinced that he had noticed the absence of the couple the afternoon before , and had a premonition of the news which lay in store .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 26]: She lowered her eyes , and braced herself , as if it had been upon her own shoulders that the blow were about to fall .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 7]: `` Oh , it 's Piers !
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 6]: I must tell Piers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 4]: cried Jean gaily .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 20]: Now that the deed was done , her former reserve had given way to an abandon of light-hearted joy .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 30]: She told the great news to every one she met ; it was her great joy to tell it , her regret that there were so few to listen .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 15]: Now , at sight of her old friend , she sprang from her seat .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 31]: `` Robert , come , '' she cried , stretching out a beckoning hand , and standing proudly linked together , the lovers met the unconscious Piers on the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 3]: `` Piers !
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 2]: Piers !
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 7]: I 'm so glad you came .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 8]: I did so want to see you .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 5]: Guess what has happened !
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 4]: Guess -- quick !
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 9]: We are so happy -- so ridiculously happy .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 3]: Guess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 17]: Piers stood still , looking from one to the other with a swift , questioning glance .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 20]: Despite herself , despite her dread , Vanna felt it impossible to restrain from one look at his face .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 22]: She turned shrinking eyes upon him , but what she saw was strangely , wonderfully different from what she had expected .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 34]: Piers stood looking from one to the other of the triumphant lovers , and for the first time since she had known him , Vanna saw his face illumined with happiness and content .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 9]: It seemed incredible , but it was true .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 29]: The dark eyes had lost their hard , irritable brilliance , and shone deep and soft ; the discontent of the mouth was turned into a happy smile .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 12]: `` You mean -- you mean -- '' he stammered incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 4]: `` By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 7]: you are engaged -- you two !
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 6]: Is it really possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 3]: Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 12]: Jean jumped on her feet , like a small excited child .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 10]: `` You 've guessed it ; it 's true .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 5]: Congratulate us , Piers .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 7]: We love to be congratulated . ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 5]: `` By Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 5]: ejaculated Piers once more .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 24]: Jean 's assumption of haughtiness had evidently put him off the scent , for the news appeared to take him completely by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 11]: `` By Jove , I _ do _ congratulate you .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 4]: You deserve congratulations .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 10]: Gloucester , you are the luckiest man on earth .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 17]: Jean , he is the only man I have ever met who is worthy of you .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 13]: You 're a wise girl ; you 've done the right thing .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 10]: I do congratulate you with all my heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 17]: Jean jumped again , while Robert looked down at her , his soul in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 7]: `` Oh , you nice Piers !
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 6]: How nicely you say it .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 7]: I knew you would be pleased .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 11]: Come in , come in ; we 're having tea .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 7]: Come and congratulate the family . ''
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 43]: Piers duly went the round , repeating his congratulations in more formal manner to Mr and Mrs Goring ; but it was not until tea was over and they had adjourned into the garden that he and Vanna had any conversation together .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 22]: He was still overflowing with excitement and pleasure , and eager to discuss the great news with Jean 's chosen friend .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 35]: `` I saw that he admired her , of course -- every one does ; but she was so off-hand and casual that I never imagined that things were near a _ denouement _ .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 13]: I 've seen her more encouraging to half a dozen other fellows .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 15]: But it 's splendid ; the best news I 've heard for an age .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 17]: Jean and Gloucester -- those two together -- it 's poetry , romance , the ideal !
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 15]: He is a man in a thousand ; she will be safe with him .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 8]: Humanly speaking , her future is assured .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 18]: You feel that , do n't you -- the absolute goodness and sincerity of the fellow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 7]: I told you so once before .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 40]: It was of him that I spoke when we were discussing temperaments , and I told you of a man I had just met whose ` aura ' was so radiantly attractive -- that afternoon in the glen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 17]: `` The Happy Land , '' he corrected , looking down at her with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 16]: `` So that was Gloucester , and we agree in our estimate of his character .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 4]: That 's good !
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 13]: Dear little Jean , I 'm so glad of her happiness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 14]: Vanna laughed , an inexplicable sense of relief sending her spirits racing upwards .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 13]: `` And I 'm so glad that _ you 're _ glad .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 11]: I was so afraid that this would give you pain .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 17]: I expected -- I imagined -- I thought you also were in love with Jean . ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 5]: His face sobered swiftly .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 12]: `` And so did I ; but it was only imagination .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 21]: It gave me no pain to hear this news , and if it had , I should deserve no pity .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 36]: I 've known her for years ; I had my chance , but I never took it ; was never even sure that I _ wanted _ to take it ; was contented to drift .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 9]: Gloucester carried the camp in fourteen days . ''
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 44]: The old shadow of discontent was clouding his face once more ; he was seeing in imagination Robert 's face as he looked at Jean , and telling himself drearily : `` Love is a gift , as much as other great powers .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 15]: It is not in every nature to rise to a wonderful , transforming passion .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 6]: He can , that man .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 8]: One can read it in his face .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 26]: He has not frittered away his gift ; it was all there , unused , unsullied , waiting for Jean , until she should appear .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 17]: He has a genius for loving , and like all geniuses he makes his power felt .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 4]: Jean felt it .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 10]: It is that that has drawn her to him .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 24]: To gain Jean in a fortnight , while I , poor weakling , wavered for years , asking myself if I loved her !
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 4]: _ Love _ !
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 10]: I do n't understand the meaning of the word .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 4]: I never shall .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 52]: It 's the same there as in everything else : I only half-way -- never to the end ... '' Vanna was doubly relieved to be assured of Piers 's well-being when the family returned to town , and she saw Edith Morton 's suffering behind her gallant assumption of content .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 26]: Can anything be more pitiful than the position of a woman who loves , and finds herself passed over in favour of a chosen friend ?
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 70]: She can not escape to distant scenes , as a man may do in a similar strait ; her pride forbids her to withdraw from accustomed pursuits ; day by day , night by night , she must smile while her heart is torn , while her eyes smart with the tears she dare not shed , while her soul cries out for the sympathy she may not ask .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 46]: Vanna 's heart ached for Edith during those weeks , when every conversation turned upon preparations for the forthcoming wedding , and the lovers were blissfully engaged in the finding and furnishing of their home ; but Jean herself exhibited a curious _ volte-face _ .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 16]: `` We were quite mistaken about Edith , '' she informed Vanna casually one day .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 25]: `` Robert and she have been like brother and sister all their lives ; there was never any question of sentiment on either side .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 12]: I ca n't think why we imagined anything so foolish . ''
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 5]: Vanna did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 26]: She divined , what was indeed the truth , that Jean 's disbelief was the result , not of conviction , but of deliberate intent .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 19]: She simply did not choose to allow a painful thought to disturb the unclouded sunshine of her day .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 56]: She was selfish -- frankly , openly , designedly selfish , as young things are apt to be to whom love comes before suffering has taught it lessons ; to whom it appears a right , a legitimate inheritance , rather than a gift to be received with awe , to be held with trembling .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 6]: And so the weeks passed .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 60]: Summer turned into autumn , and one October morning Jean and Robert stood side by side before the altar of a dim old church , and spoke the words which made them one for life , while Vanna Strangeways and Edith Morton stood among the group of white-robed bridesmaids , hiding the ache in their hearts behind smiling faces .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 30]: To one was given the best gift of life ; from the others was taken away , by the saddest of ironies , that which they had never possessed .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 24]: The church and the house were crowded with guests ; the paraphernalia of a `` smart wedding '' was duly and ceremoniously enacted .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 56]: The newly married pair stood backed against the drawing-room fireplace to receive their guests , who passed by in a line , thence defiling into the library to regard a glittering display of gifts ; thence again to the dining-room to partake of the formal , sit-down luncheon which was the fashion of the day .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 39]: The bride and bridegroom sat at the top of the horseshoe table with the bridesmaids and their attendant groomsmen ranged on either side , Vanna and Piers Rendall , as foremost couple , occupying the place of honour .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 36]: At the conclusion of the meal Jean stood up in her place , her gauze-like veil floating behind her , and cut the great white cake , while the spectators broke into cheers of applause .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 55]: There were certain points at which it was the custom to cheer at these wedding feasts -- this was one of them ; another , perhaps the most popular , was when it came to the turn of the stammering bridegroom to return thanks for the speech in which his health had been proposed .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 47]: It was at the point when the inevitable reference was made to the newly made partner that the laughter was timed to break out ; but no one laughed when Robert Gloucester pronounced for the first time those magic words '' _ My wife _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 62]: Down the length of the long tables more than one of the elder guests hurriedly glanced aside , or bit at the end of a moustache , hearing in that voice a magic note which wafted them back through the long years of prose and difficulty to the day when they , too , stood upon the glad threshold of life .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 45]: Later on Jean disappeared to died her bridal trappings , and came down half an hour later in hat and coat , to run the blockade of the assembled guests in the hall , _ en route _ to the carriage at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 51]: Her cheeks were pink , her eyes were shining ; as each hand was stretched out she pressed it warmly in her own ; to each good wish she returned a gracious acknowledgment ; when a face was held forward expectantly she was ready with a kiss and a caress .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 13]: Every one praised her graciousness , her affectionate remembrance of old friends .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 10]: `` She kissed me _ so _ lovingly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 12]: `` She said goodbye to me _ so _ sweetly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 47]: A buzz of appreciation followed her as she went ; but in reality Jean had walked in a dream , seeing an indistinct blur of faces , hearing a meaningless babble of words , conscious only of Robert 's figure waiting for her at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 39]: Mr Goring had escaped from the crowd and bustle to stand bare-headed on the pavement , whence he could catch a last glimpse of his daughter as she drove away from the house which had been her home .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 52]: His face looked pinched and worn in the keen autumn air ; he smiled and joked with the men by his side , but his eyes were restless , and kept turning back to the door through which Jean would pass for the last time as a daughter of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 17]: Another moment and she was there ; the crowd surged after her on to the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 11]: He stood before her , and held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 24]: She held up her cheek , smiled , and leapt lightly into the carriage , the door of which Robert was holding open .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 37]: He sprang to his seat , there was a vision of two heads bent forward , of two radiant , illumined faces ; the coachman flicked up his horses -- they had passed out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 11]: Mr Goring shivered , and turned back to the house .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 11]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ `` The happiest moment of my wedding day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 12]: answered Jean to a question put to her some months later .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 23]: `` The happiest moment of all was when the carriage drove off from the door , and left you all behind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 3]: CONTRASTED FATES .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 33]: While Jean was blissfully enjoying the first weeks of her married life , the friend who had been to her as a second mother was lying dangerously ill in her upper room .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 53]: The bustle of the last few months , culminating in the excitement of the wedding , had proved too much for Miggles 's weak heart ; and having gallantly kept on her feet until the supreme need was past , she had the less strength left with which to fight the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 6]: `` Do n't tell Jean .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 7]: Promise not to tell Jean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 32]: That was her first and most insistent cry ; and being satisfied on the point , she laid herself down , and spoke no more for many weary days and nights .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 46]: Once again Vanna found herself bound to the household , and had the consolation or feeling of help to the mistress and of comfort to the invalid , who seemed to cling pathetically to Jean 's friend in the absence of her own dear nursling .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 39]: Hospital nurses were much rarer luxuries in the seventies than at the present day , and in this case the duty of nursing the invalid was undertaken by Mrs Goring , her maid , and Vanna , equally .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 111]: The maid slept in the sick-room , ready to pay any attention which was required during the night ; Mrs Goring was exact and punctilious in administering medicines and food at the right intervals , and in seeing that the sick-room was kept scrupulously in order ; it devolved upon Vanna to ease the invalid by the innumerable , gentle little offices which seem to come by instinct to women of sympathetic natures , and later on as she grew stronger , to amuse her by reading aloud , talking , and -- what in this case was even more welcome -- lending an attentive ear while the other discoursed .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 25]: The sudden breakdown had called attention to the state of Miggles 's heart , which had troubled her at times for some years back .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 22]: The result was serious , so serious that the doctor had warned her that her days of active service were over .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 31]: Henceforth she must be content to live an idle life , in some quiet country spot , where she would be free from the bustle and excitement of town life .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 49]: Mr and Mrs Goring proposed that she should live in the Cottage at Seacliff , where the capable woman who acted as caretaker could wait upon her and do the work of the house , and Miggles , as usual , was full of gratitude for the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 26]: `` A haven , my dear , opened out to me at the very moment I need it , '' she said ardently to Vanna .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 12]: `` It 's been like that with me all my life .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 4]: Goodness and mercy !
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 26]: I 've always loved that dear little house by the sea ; there 's no place on earth where I would rather end my days .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 10]: The doctor says I shall go off quite suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 19]: He did n't want to tell me , but I explained that I was not at all afraid .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 49]: From battle , murder , and _ lingering _ death , that 's the way I 've always said it -- not that I wish to put myself above the Prayer Book , but one must be honest , and that 's how I felt in my heart .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 19]: I 've no claim upon any one , and a long , expensive illness is a great drag .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 6]: I 'd be so ashamed !
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 27]: ` Our times are in His hand , ' my dear ; but if it 's not presumptuous , I hope He 'll take me soon .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 16]: Next summer , perhaps , before the boys want to come down for the holidays .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 14]: I should like to have the winter just to be quiet and prepare .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 4]: June , now !
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 11]: June would be a sweet month to pass away in .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 8]: Would it not , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 4]: `` Miggles ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 10]: cried Vanna , half laughing , half in tears .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 10]: `` Miggles , how can you be so callous ?
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 11]: I absolutely refuse to discuss the date of your death .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 34]: It 's not a cheerful subject for us , whatever it may be for you ; and I hope you 'll be spared for a long , long rest after your busy life .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 23]: How can you talk about dying in that matter-of-fact way , as if it were a removal from one house to another ?
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 40]: Have you no dread , not of the mere act of death -- that is often a real ` falling asleep , ' but of the leap in the dark , the unknown change , the mystery behind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 33]: Miggles lay back against her pillow , a large , unwieldy figure , with thin bands of hair brushed back beneath an old-fashioned night-cap , her hands clasped peacefully on her knee .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 19]: `` No , my dear , '' she said tranquilly ; `` the mystery does n't trouble me .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 16]: I 'm a poor , weak creature , and I was never clever at understanding .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 24]: I only know that it 's going to be a change for the better , so of course I 'm ready to go .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 55]: When I hear people talk of shrinking and trembling at the thought of death , I think they ca n't really believe what they profess , or why should they prefer to live on , lonely , and suffering , and poor , rather than make a little journey to gain peace and rest ?
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 14]: It 's not reason , my dear , it 's not reason . ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 17]: Miggles was silent , blinking her little eyes , and panting after the exertion of talking .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 18]: Gradually a pucker gathered on her forehead , and an expression of anxiety spread over her face .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 20]: `` There is only one thing that troubles me -- only one thing ; but it 's very serious .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 26]: I ca n't '' -- she turned solemn , innocent eyes upon the girl 's face -- `` I ca n't feel myself a sinner !
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 29]: That 's a great secret , my dear , but you 've been so kind to me this last week that I feel I can make the confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 9]: Of course I should not wish it repeated .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 5]: is n't it sad ?
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 13]: I 've tried my best , but I ca n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 11]: It seems to me that I have done my best .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 6]: I was a good daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 32]: My dear mother died blessing my name ; and with the dear Gorings I 've done my duty -- for love , I 've done it , far more than money .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 19]: All through I 've done my duty , and I have loved God and the people round me .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 45]: I 've never felt ill-will towards a living creature ; and when I come to search for my sins , dear -- really and truly -- I tell you in confidence , _ I ca n't find them _ , '' cried Miggles sadly .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 33]: She lowered her chin , glancing sideways at Vanna as a shamed child might do discovered in the perpetration of an infantile peccadillo , and Vanna smiled a tender , humorous response .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 7]: `` Ca n't you , Miggles ?
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 7]: Not if you try very hard ?
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 10]: I ca n't help you , I 'm afraid .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 11]: My bad memory refuses to remind me of your crimes .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 9]: It 's a serious state of affairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 11]: `` It is , dear , '' agreed Miggles gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 24]: `` I 've been taking myself to task , lying here upon this bed , and examining into the state of my soul .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 22]: I fed very grateful , and full of faith , and quite tranquil and happy at the thought of passing away .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 27]: I could not fed that , you know , if I had a ` conviction of sin , ' like all the good people in books .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 31]: It has always put me so terribly out of the way when I have failed to please any one , and they have been cold and stand-off in their manner .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 30]: It does happen like that sometimes , even with the best intentions ... If I believed I had grieved my dear Heavenly Father , how wretched I should be !
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 11]: But I do n't , dear , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 9]: I am quite happy , quite at peace .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 10]: The question is , _ Am I justified _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 18]: It would be rather a comfort to be a Catholic sometimes -- would it not , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 11]: -- and confess to a dear , saintly old priest .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 42]: Not , of course , that I could subscribe to their creed I can tell you that I 've been quite upset in church sometimes when they intone the Litany , and call themselves miserable sinners in such very despondent tones .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 19]: I did not feel myself a miserable sinner , and it was no use pretending that I did .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 25]: That made me wretched in another way , for I thought I must be a Pharisee , which would be worst of all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 29]: `` Dear Miggles , the Litany was written at the time of the Plague of London , and was meant to be a sort of national penitential psalm .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 33]: The plague was believed to have been sent as a punishment for the sins of the nation , and the priests marched in procession through the streets intoning this cry for mercy .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 46]: It was never intended to be used as a regular part of the Church service in times of peace and prosperity ; and I think a good many people feel like you , who would not have the courage to put their thoughts into words .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 12]: A service of praise would often seem more dignified and inspiring .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 15]: Dear , good , kind little soul , why trouble yourself to find trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 30]: If you have peace , you have the greatest of all blessings , and a blessing that is never enjoyed , dear Miggles , until it has been won .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 15]: I 'm struggling for it now , but it 's a long way off .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 9]: I have still many battles to fight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 15]: The old woman looked at the young one with a long , questioning glance .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 6]: `` Yes , dear child !
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 8]: I have seen it , and wondered .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 13]: But you are so young still , and your life is ahead .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 22]: We shall see you happy like Jean , starting your home with a fine young husband -- '' `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 7]: Vanna held up a warning hand .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 9]: `` Miggles , you have confided in me .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 17]: I 'll tell you something about myself , but you must never allude to it again .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 7]: It does n't bear speaking of .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 10]: There is a reason why I can never marry .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 16]: I ca n't tell you what it is , but it is fixed -- irrevocable .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 9]: I shall never be happy like Jean . ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 20]: Miggles stretched out her hand and laid it upon the dark head , smoothing the hair with gentle touch .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 6]: But she did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 29]: In the course of her sixty years she had heard many such assertions from the lips of girls who had afterwards lived to become happy wives and mothers .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 22]: She told herself that dear Vanna had no doubt suffered a disappointment , and was feeling cast-down and hopeless in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 49]: Quite natural , poor dear -- quite ; but in time youth would reassert itself ; she would meet some one else , such an attractive girl as she was , and would find that the heart which she supposed dead was still capable of love and joy .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 21]: Oh , certainly she would marry and be happy ; but for the moment one could not tell her so .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 5]: That would be cruel .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 2]: Time !
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 2]: time !
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 6]: that was the best medicine .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 39]: She smoothed and stroked with tender , motherly touch , and Vanna , blessing her for her silence , felt the sudden crystallising of an idea which had been growing quietly in her mind during the past week .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 31]: `` Miggles , '' she said quietly , turning her head sideways , so as to be able to look the other in the face without disturbing that caressing hand .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 19]: `` Miggles , how would you like it if I came down to live with you at Seacliff ?
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 24]: Carter can look after the house and make you comfortable , but you would have no companion , and might feel lonely sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 11]: Evenings seem very long and dreary when one is alone .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 21]: We are two solitary women , alone in the world , without any ties ; we might help each other .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 6]: What do you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 6]: Miggles subsided into instant tears .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 8]: `` It 's too good of you .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 18]: Oh , my dear , my dear , I could n't -- I could n't let you .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 10]: It 's too good of you , too sweet .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 22]: I shall always remember and bless you for thinking of it , but it would be too selfish -- too grasping .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 7]: I could not allow it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 5]: `` Miggles , listen !
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 33]: I 've been puzzling what to do with myself this next year ; I have no home , now that my aunt is dead , and no tie to any special place .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 14]: That 's a lonely feeling , Miggles , when you are only twenty-three .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 17]: It would be a solution of the problem if you could let me come to you .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 18]: I sounded Mr Goring and he was willing ; more than willing , delighted at the idea .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 41]: And I have some money of my own , you know , dear , and as Mr Goring would not hear of my paying anything towards the household expenses , I am going to spend it on pleasures and luxuries .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 30]: I have a lovely plan -- to buy a comfortable little pony carriage in which to drive you along the lanes , and give you fresh air without fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 19]: Then , when you do n't feel inclined to go out I 'll use the horse for riding .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 15]: I love riding , and it will be good exercise to scour the countryside .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 8]: Perhaps sometimes there 'll be a Meet .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 10]: If there were hunting I should feel quite gay .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 15]: I _ want _ to come , if you care to have me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 4]: `` Care ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 49]: Miggles laughed , cried , gasped , ejaculated , panted , in such extravagance of joy , such depths of humility , such paeans of gratitude , that Vanna had to exercise her prerogative as nurse , administer a soothing draught , and insist upon a rest forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 5]: `` Not another word .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 20]: If you are good and obedient , I 'll come ; if you are not , I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 12]: I am not going to saddle myself with a rebellious patient .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 5]: So now you know .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 44]: Kiss me , and shut your eyes -- '' `` But , '' protested Miggles , `` but -- but -- '' Long after Vanna had left the room she lay awake , staring with wistful , puzzled eyes at the opposite wall .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 25]: A social creature , devoted to her kind , no one but herself knew how heavily the prospect of loneliness had weighed upon her .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 35]: Vanna 's proposition had been like a flash of sunshine lighting up a grey country , but she could not rejoice with a full heart until she was satisfied of the girl 's happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 23]: `` A young thing like that shut up with an old , ailing woman -- it 's not right , not fitting .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 6]: I must not be selfish .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 14]: I need quiet at the end of my days , but at twenty-three !
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 19]: To take her to that lonely place , away from all her friends : can it be right ?
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 32]: I 'd love her , and mother her , but with all my will I ca n't do the thing she needs most of all -- be young with her again .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 44]: She is sad , dear child , and it 's only a friend of her own age who can comfort and cheer -- '' Suddenly Miggles jerked in her bed ; the fixed eyes brightened ; the heavy cheeks broadened into a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 4]: `` Ah-h ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 4]: she murmured happily .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 3]: `` Ah-h !
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 12]: _ That _ is well , _ that 's _ well .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 22]: That will bring it all right '' ; and nestling down in the pillows , she composed herself happily to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 18]: Across the trouble of her mind there had flashed the remembrance of the visits of Piers Rendall .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 6]: THE COTTAGE ON THE CLIFF .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 36]: For the next two years Vanna lived quietly in the cottage on the cliff , five miles from the nearest railway station , and as many more from anything in the shape of a town .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 28]: The hamlet in which she had lived with her aunt had been quiet and uneventful , but in comparison with Seacliff it was a whirl of gaiety .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 47]: During the summer months there was indeed a small influx of visitors , but Seacliff had not as yet sprung into popularity , and accommodation was limited to a few scattered houses along the sea-front and the big red hotel on the top of the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 47]: The hotel was closed in the winter months , and the first day that Vanna looked across the bay and beheld the smoke rising from the chimneys , she knew a thrill of joy in the realisation that the long grey winter was at an end .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 8]: Long and grey , yet not unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 45]: Looking back over the monotonous record of the months , and remembering her own tranquillity and content , Vanna marvelled , as many of us have done in our time , at the unlooked for manner in which our prayers have met their response .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 64]: She had asked for guidance ; had pleaded , with a very passion of earnestness , for some miracle of grace to fill her empty life , but no miracle had happened , no flash of light had illumined the darkness ; the heavens had appeared as brass to her cry -- and yet , yet , had not the answer been vouchsafed ?
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 42]: It would not have been her own choice to pass the best years of her youth in seclusion , with no other companion than a homely , unsophisticated old woman , over whom the shadow of death crept nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 49]: She had dreamt of romance and adventure , and not of a home bounded by two cliff walls ; nevertheless , in this companionship and in this seclusion she had found peace , and as the time passed by a returning sense of joy and interest in life .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 29]: She was loved , she was needed , she was understood ; and the human creature of whom so much can be said is fortunate among his fellows .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 48]: In addition to her sunny temperament , Miggles possessed the great gift of tact , and when the shadow of depression fell over the girl 's spirits she asked no questions , made no comment thereon , but ministered to her generously with the meed of appreciation .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 11]: `` What should I do without you , child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 20]: `` Ah , my dear , how I thank God for sending you to me these last years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 30]: Such words as these , uttered with the good-night kiss , dried many a tear on the girl 's cheeks , and sent her to bed revived and peaceful .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 31]: As the weeks passed by Vanna found friends out of doors also , and was surprised to discover the importance of her presence to the community in the little village .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 52]: `` Well , now , I tell you , I ca n't think what we did without you all the dull old winters , '' said Mrs Jones of the grocer 's emporium one day , as she scribbled down the weekly order with the much-battered stump of a lead pencil .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 29]: `` You 've been a regular godsend , cheering us up , and giving us something to think of , instead of moping along from September to June .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 16]: I 'm sure we 've cause to be grateful for all you 've done . ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 14]: Vanna flushed , surprised and a trifle overwhelmed by so gushing a compliment .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 16]: `` Really , Mrs Jones , I do n't feel that I deserve any thanks .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 18]: I have been so much occupied with Miss Miggs that I have had no time to spare .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 14]: I ca n't think of anything I have done to help you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 6]: `` Oh , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 10]: protested Mrs Jones , in accents of strong reproach .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 15]: `` Oh , miss ; _ and three new hats since autumn _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 5]: Blessed sense of humour !
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 11]: That reply was sufficient to brighten Vanna 's whole day .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 37]: It did more , for it served to nip in the bud that lassitude concerning the toilette , that feeling that `` anything will do , '' which creeps over those who dwell in lonely places .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 49]: Henceforth Vanna realised that to the natives of this little sea-bound village she stood as a type of the great world of fashion , and that it was a real pleasure in their quiet lives to behold her moving about in their midst in pretty , tasteful attire .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 13]: The knowledge proved beneficial to her appearance , and to her spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 71]: The pony carriage proved of less use than had been hoped , as the invalid 's nerves grew less and less able to face the precipitous road leading up to the house ; but some time every day Vanna found time for a scamper on the back of her beloved Dinah , saddling her herself , rubbing her down , and giving her a feed of oats on her return .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 34]: Miggles did not care for indoor pets , so that it was an extra pleasure to make friends with Dinah , to rub her soft nose , and bequeath odd gifts of sugar .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 50]: Her informal riding-costume was composed of a dark green habit and a felt hat of the same shade , which , being somewhat battered out of the original shape , she had twisted into a Napoleonic tricorn , which proved surprisingly becoming on her small , daintily poised head .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 11]: `` I 've never seen a riding-hat like that before .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 16]: That 's the very _ latest _ from Paris , I suppose , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 17]: said Mrs Jones of the emporium ; and Vanna had not the heart to undeceive her .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 25]: Once or twice a week , instead of mounting to the downs , Vanna would turn inland to pay a visit to Mrs Rendall .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 34]: The old lady was not an interesting personality , but she was lonely , which fact made perhaps the strongest of all appeals to Vanna 's sympathy at this period of her life .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 48]: It grew to be an accepted custom that these visits should be paid on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons , and as she trotted up the long avenue leading to the house Vanna never failed to see the white-capped figure at the library window watching for her approach .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 13]: The conversation was almost identically the same on each of these visits .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 52]: Mrs Rendall would discuss the weather of the last three days , inquire into Miss Miggs 's symptoms , relate accurately the behaviour of her own cough and the tiresome rheumatic pains in her left shoulder , chronicle the progress in the garden , and the delinquencies of her servant maids .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 51]: Vanna seemed to herself to do little more than murmur a conventional yes and no from time to time ; nevertheless Mrs Rendall invariably pleaded with her to prolong her visit , and never failed to add to her farewell the urgent reminder : `` You 'll come on Wednesday ?
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 6]: You wo n't forget . ''
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 38]: If the visitor chanced to turn her head at the bend of the avenue , the white-capped figure was again at the window , watching for the last , the very last glimpse of her retreating figure .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 39]: At the sight of that watching figure a faint realisation came to Vanna of one of life 's tragedies -- the pathetic dependence of the old upon the young ; the detachment and indifference of youth to age .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 16]: To herself these weekly visits were a duty and , frankly speaking , a bore .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 31]: To the old woman , alone in her luxurious home , they formed the brightness and amusement of life , the epochs upon which she lived in hope and recollection .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 7]: `` Poor , dull old soul !
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 5]: I must go regularly .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 19]: I must not shirk , '' determined Vanna conscientiously , but she loved her duty none the more .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 37]: It was towards the end of her third month 's residence at Seacliff that , on cantering up the drive of the Manor House , Vanna noticed a change in the position of the white-capped figure .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 33]: It was there , watching as usual , but at the side , instead of the centre , of the library window , and by her stood a tall , dark figure .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 25]: Vanna 's heart leapt within her ; the blood rushed through her veins ; in one moment languid indifference was changed to tingling vitality .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 28]: She straightened herself on the saddle , and as Piers 's figure appeared in the porch , lifted her gauntleted hand to her hat in merry salute .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 39]: The episode of Jean 's marriage , with the association of chief bridesmaid and groomsman , had brought the two friends of the bride into closer intimacy , so that the greeting between them was frank and cordial .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 6]: `` Salaam , Diana ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 11]: `` Salaam , oh , Knight of the -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 25]: Vanna paused , for it was no Knight of the Rueful Countenance who looked into her face as she drew rein by the door .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 17]: The dark eyes looking into hers were alight with pleasure -- with something more than pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 20]: Vanna recognised a gleam of surprised admiration and thrilled at the sight even as it forced itself into words .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 11]: `` By Jove , how well you are looking . ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 9]: `` Rusticating suits me , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 25]: She leapt lightly to the ground , and , gathering up the graceful long riding-skirt of that day , entered the house before him .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 31]: As she passed along the ugly , commonplace hall , Vanna was confronted by her own reflection in the glass of the old-fashioned hat-stand , and started at the sight .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 76]: This was not the girl whom she was accustomed to see in that same glass -- the girl with the pale face , and listless eyes ; this girl walked with a quick , lightsome tread ; her daintily poised head , crowned by the picturesque green hat , assumed a new charm ; the grey eyes were sparkling beneath the arched brows ; the cheeks were flushed to the colour of a wild rose .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 22]: This was the vision which Piers Rendall had beheld , the vision at which his hard eyes had softened in admiration .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 30]: Vanna blushed at the sight of her own fairness , and felt the thrill of pure , undiluted joy which every true daughter of Eve knows at such moments .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 28]: She tilted her head over her shoulder to answer Piers 's question , with a smile and a glance which would have done credit to Jean herself .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 24]: What he asked she hardly knew -- some of the conventional , unimportant questions which are tossed to and fro on such occasions .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 16]: What she answered mattered still less ; the mere fact of his presence eclipsed all .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 39]: The bigness of him , the strongness , the firm , dark face , the deep bass voice , the masculine presence after the long , monotonous months , with no companionship save that of two old women .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 24]: It was as if a part of the girl 's being which had been drugged to sleep awoke suddenly and clamoured for existence .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 12]: At the door of the library Vanna knew a momentary pause .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 19]: Conscious of her own transformed face , she shrank with something like shame from facing old Mrs Rendall .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 5]: What would she say ?
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 5]: What would she think ?
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 28]: Another moment proved the needlessness of her dread , for on this happy day of reunion the mother had no eyes for any one but her son .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 49]: In a mechanical fashion she went through the ordinary list of questions , and Vanna vouchsafed the ordinary replies ; but the ordinary interest was impossible while Piers stood with his back to the fire , puffing at his cigarette , listening with a smile on his face .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 27]: That smell of smoke impregnating an atmosphere which was usually equally reminiscent of furniture polish and paregoric -- how intoxicating it smelt in Vanna 's nostrils !
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 53]: She kept her eyes riveted on the old lady 's face so long as conversation between them continued , but the moment that mother and son were engrossed with each other , her eyes returned greedily to the long , straight limbs , the close-cropped head , the strong , sinewy hands .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 5]: Youth called to youth .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 5]: Sex called to sex .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 21]: At the end of ten minutes ' general conversation Piers made the move for which Vanna had anxiously been waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 9]: `` When will lunch be ready , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 12]: Miss Strangeways must stay to lunch in honour of my return .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 17]: We 'll go a little turn round the grounds and be back in half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 18]: Then I 'll ride over with her , and see Miggles while you have your rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 11]: A shade of disappointment passed over Mrs Rendall 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 44]: It was hard to allow her son to pass out of her sight for even half an hour , but she assented quietly , after the manner of mothers of grown-up sons , and the two young people strolled out into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 28]: The geranium beds were bare and brown , but the lawn was still a velvety green and the belt of evergreen trees presented a similitude of summer .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 16]: Piers led the way forward , and Vanna followed , a smile upon her lips .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 6]: `` The Happy Land ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 5]: `` The Happy Land .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 2]: Naturally !
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 9]: It is an appropriate walk for you to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 8]: No need to ask how it goes .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 14]: You look blooming -- a different girl from when you were here last .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 10]: And you really like it -- this buried-alive existence ?
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 18]: When I heard of the arrangement I could not believe it would last beyond a few weeks .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 6]: It seemed unnatural -- unfair .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 7]: But you have stood it out .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 7]: You have not been lonely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 3]: Vanna hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 22]: They stood at the entrance to the glen , looking down through a network of bare branches on the stream beneath .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 24]: The ground was covered with a carpet of leaves , the sweet , soft smell of earth rose refreshingly in the wintry air .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' she said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 25]: `` I have been lonely , but -- remember that I am bound to look on the bright side of things in this place !
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 6]: -- I have had compensations .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 5]: I am needed here .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 21]: Miggles could not be left alone with a servant , and there is a great satisfaction in feeling oneself necessary .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 28]: This new home was offered to me at a moment when I was adrift in the world , and every one in it is kind and loving .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 15]: I have every comfort , and a dear luxury in the shape of Dinah .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 22]: I am becoming quite an experienced horsewoman , and it is impossible to feel depressed after a gallop across the downs .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 5]: And you know Miggles !
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 26]: It 's rather wonderful to live beside a person who is preparing for death as cheerfully and happily as most people prepare for a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 11]: We talk about it every day , but never gloomily .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 13]: In a peaceful kind of way she 's excited at the prospect .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 14]: Quite suddenly she will exclaim , ` Oh , I shall see Emma .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 12]: I have n't seen Emma since we were girls at school .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 12]: I shall have so _ much _ to tell Emma . '
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 12]: And she is full of interest as to her new work .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 9]: It is to be helping her earth friends .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 5]: That 's quite decided .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 12]: ` It 's what I have been trained for , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 10]: It stands to reason I must go on . '
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 34]: And she has quite definite ideas of what ought to be done -- things that , according to her judgment , have been overlooked , and concerning which she can -- very tactfully !
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 6]: -- drop a gentle reminder .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 12]: She has a mission on hand for each one of us .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 8]: You are to receive special attention . ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 6]: The young man smiled affectionately .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 6]: `` Bless her old heart !
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 4]: That 's well .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 7]: I am thankful she is happy .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 35]: It 's a great thing for her to have you ; that 's natural enough , but -- '' He stopped short with that air of reservation which Vanna _ found _ so attractive .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 37]: Never once had he descended to the banality of a compliment in words ; always it had been left to her to divine his approval from eyes and voice -- a gratification delightfully freed from embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 21]: He bit his lip , frowned , and demanded suddenly , `` How long do you mean to stay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 10]: `` I hope , as long as she lives .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 24]: For my own sake as well as hers , for I 've grown to love her , and she is a delightful companion .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 15]: Beyond her simplicity and sweetness , she has such a pretty sense of humour .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 21]: She makes me laugh in my darkest mood , and -- which is equally important -- she laughs at me .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 31]: It would be too boring to live with a person who received one 's best sallies with silence or a strained smile ; but Miggles is nothing if not appreciative .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 14]: I shall certainly not leave her by any act of my own . ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 6]: `` And -- afterwards ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 16]: Vanna looked up at him : her eyes were brave , but her lips trembled .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 24]: From his tall stature he looked down upon the struggle on her face , the trembling lips , the brave , gallant eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 11]: `` I do n't know -- I ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 7]: I do n't want to think .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 13]: It 's a subject I ca n't discuss -- _ here _ .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 8]: Talk of something else -- something cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 5]: Tell me about Jean .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 6]: Have you seen her lately ?
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 6]: When did you see her ?
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 5]: How is she looking ?
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 9]: Tell me everything you can about her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 10]: Piers lifted his brows and slightly shrugged his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 6]: `` Jean is -- Robert !
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 5]: Robert is -- Jean !
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 9]: There you have the situation in a word !
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 16]: Bound up in each other -- blind , deaf , dumb to every other interest .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 7]: I 've called once or twice .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 5]: Their house is charming .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 17]: She is lovelier than ever ; he is , if possible , still more radiantly content .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 12]: They seem unfeignedly pleased to see one -- for ten minutes !
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 30]: After that their attention begins to flag , and at the end of half an hour you feel that you would be a perfect brute to stay another second .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 16]: I have come to the conclusion that it is kinder to leave them alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 7]: `` I 'm sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 14]: I do n't even trouble Jean with letters more than once a month .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 28]: I send constant bulletins of Miggles to Mrs Goring , so that she knows how things go , and for the rest -- I bide my time .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 29]: When a year or so has passed away , I hope they will still be as much in love ; but there will be more room for outsiders .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 12]: It 's just as well that I am away from town .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 10]: It is easier to be philosophical at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 23]: If I were in town and felt myself unwanted and out in the cold , I should probably be huffy and jealous .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 18]: As it is , I look forward , and tell myself she will want me another day .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 15]: One can afford to wait when there 's a surety at the end . ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 7]: `` Yes , that 's easy .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 33]: If one were ever sure -- '' His brow darkened , but meeting her eyes , he smiled , throwing aside the dark thought , with an effort to match her own .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 12]: `` Doubt is forbidden , I suppose , with other repinings ?
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 6]: the Queen must be obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 24]: Do you remember saying that it was little use to possess a Happy Land so far away that you could rarely see it ?
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 19]: And behold the next move in the game is that you are plumped down at its very gates !
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 17]: How many times have you visited your domain since we were here together in summer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 4]: `` Not once .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 27]: When I have ridden over it has been to see your mother , and I do n't care to leave Miggles for long at a time .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 8]: Besides , I think I shirked it .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 47]: It was winter , and the trees were bare , and I was alone , and it is difficult to be very happy all by oneself , and sometimes I was in a contrary mood , when I did not even want to _ try _ .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 9]: But I am glad to be here to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 8]: I am glad you brought me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 7]: `` I must bring you again .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 6]: I must come down oftener .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 27]: As you are giving up your life to help Miggles , it is the duty of all her friends to make things as easy as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 22]: I shall feel that Seacliff has a double claim on me if I can help you as well as my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 17]: It will be good for us both to come here and be compelled towards happiness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 9]: Vanna 's smile of acknowledgment was somewhat forced .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 34]: It would have been unmixed joy to look forward to the promised visits , but for those two words which stood out in such jarring prominence that they seemed to obscure her joy .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 8]: `` Duty , '' `` Claim . ''
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 21]: When in the history of woman did she appreciate a service thus offered by a member of the opposite sex ?
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 13]: `` That is very kind of you , '' she answered formally .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 18]: `` After the excitements of London , Seacliff must seem very dull at this time of year .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 11]: How long are you going to stay this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 15]: `` Until -- '' he hesitated for a moment -- `` until Monday . ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 34]: That evening , when Vanna went up to her own room , she sat for an hour beside her little window facing the bay , living over again the events of the day .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 2]: Duty !
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 2]: Claim !
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 11]: For the hundredth time the words tolled in her ears .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 20]: She looked over the grey waste of waters and saw in them a type of her own colourless life .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 2]: Duty !
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 2]: Claim !
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 6]: But then the scene shifted .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 22]: She was back again in the library of the Manor House , listening to old Mrs Rendall 's words of lament .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 11]: `` He is no sooner here than he has gone .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 11]: He tells me he must positively leave on Friday . ''
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 8]: Why had Piers elected to stay on ?
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 38]: She was back again in the dining-room , feeling his gaze upon her -- a gaze so deep , so pregnant with meaning that it had forced the question from her lips , `` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 7]: What are you thinking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 3]: `` You !
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 2]: Here !
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 4]: In this house .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 21]: The difference it makes -- the astounding difference -- '' _ What _ difference was it which her presence made ?
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 12]: His eyes told her that it was a difference of gain .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 19]: A twinkling light shone out on the darkness , flashed and waned , flashed again into brighter glow .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 9]: The waste of waters was illumined with light .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 4]: THE SANEST WOMAN .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 34]: During the remainder of the winter Piers Rendall paid frequent visits to Seacliff , appearing at unexpected moments , sometimes after but a week 's interval , sometimes but once in the month .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 20]: The feeling that he might arrive at any moment brought an element of excitement into Vanna 's quiet life .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 28]: It was delightful to awake in the morning and feel that there was something to which she could look forward -- an object towards which to move .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 78]: When he came there would be invigorating gallops across the downs , visits to the Happy Land , where each was bound to cast care to the winds ; happy tea-parties in the dining-room ; cosy chats round the fire , Miggles lying on her sofa , Vanna seated on the footstool by her side , Piers in his favourite position on the hearthrug , his long legs stretched out , his back resting against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 35]: Sometimes he would recount the doings of the great city , and discuss politics up to date for the edification of the two women , who were keenly interested in the course of events .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 35]: Sometimes he would read aloud from a book in which Miggles was interested ; sometimes they would roast chestnuts , and laugh and jest and cap amusing anecdotes like a party of merry children .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 33]: Looking at Piers 's face illumined by the firelight on one of these occasions , a sudden vision flashed before Vanna 's eyes of that face as she had seen it first .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 23]: The tightly drawn skin , the down-turned lips , the hard brilliancy of the eyes , the nervous twitching of the features .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 14]: This man smiling upon her looked strong , and happy , and glad .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 6]: Whence had come the change ?
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 34]: At Whitsuntide Jean and Robert came down for a three days ' visit -- the first since their marriage , and the little cottage was filled with the atmosphere of spring and joy .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 19]: Two people more utterly content , more beautiful in their happiness , it would be impossible to conceive .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 54]: Jean was in her gayest , least responsible mood , full of histories of her own failures as housekeeper , her difficulty with bills , her hopeless exceeding of the weekly allowance -- the which she recounted with triumphant amusement , while Robert sat looking on with an air of penitence and guilt .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 14]: That he should dare to inflict petty economies upon this goddess among women !
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 17]: Towards her old friend Jean 's manner was composed of a mingling of tenderness and wonder .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 34]: `` There 's no question about this place suiting you , Vanna , '' she said the last evening , as the two girls enjoyed a short _ tete-a-tete _ in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 14]: `` I have never seen you look so well ; nor so pretty .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 6]: Robert says so , too .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 25]: Somehow -- I do n't know how it is , but you look different , I keep looking at you to see the cause .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 8]: You have not changed your hair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 12]: `` No ; my hair is as you last saw it .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 10]: It wo n't ` go ' any other way .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 9]: There 's no difference that I know of .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 8]: It exists only in your imagination . ''
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 4]: Jean was obstinate .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 5]: `` You look different .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 16]: Dear old thing , it 's a comfort to see you so sweet and blooming .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 12]: I was afraid I should find you all gone to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 7]: I _ do _ admire you .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 10]: When I think of your life , and mine !
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 7]: I should be such a beast .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 7]: Miggles says you are an angel .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 4]: So does Piers .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 9]: Not in so many words , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 7]: Piers never says what he feels .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 26]: He is such a silent , shut-up creature , but I could see that he was simply bursting with admiration of your life down here .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 6]: Does n't he look well ?
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 8]: I have never seen him so bright .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 13]: Robert says he goes a great deal to the Van Dusens ' .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 7]: They have such a pretty daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 14]: I 've wondered so often if he could be in love at last .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 7]: That would account for it all .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 8]: I hope he is -- Old Piers !
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 9]: I should like him to be happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 6]: `` Very probably it is .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 10]: He is certainly changed , '' said Vanna briefly .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 19]: The next day the Gloucesters took their departure , and left behind a sense of loss and blank .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 52]: Miggles struggled under a weight of depression at the thought that this might be the last time that she would ever behold her beloved child and pupil ; the maid covered up the furniture of the guest-room with dull regret ; Vanna was racked by an access of bitterness and jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 14]: All the dearly won composure of the past eight months seemed swept aside .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 19]: She was back again in the slough of despond which had followed the memorable visit to the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 47]: Every sight , every sound , every word that was uttered seemed to press against her nerves with unbearable jar ; she felt a sense of enmity against Miggles , the village , the whole human race ; above all , against Jean and her husband .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 26]: She shut herself within the walls of a cold and sullen reserve , never speaking unless spoken to , answering with the curtest of monosyllables .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 52]: For three long days she hardened herself against the pleading of Miggles 's eyes and the tenderness in the feeble voice , but on the afternoon of the third day she brought her footstool to the side of the sofa , and laid her head against the old woman 's knee .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 6]: `` Comfort me , Miggles !
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 6]: My heart is so sore .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 25]: I 'm sad , and I 'm bad , and I 've made you miserable , and now I come to you for help .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 7]: I 'm so _ tired _ .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 8]: Say something to help me along ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 7]: `` What is it , dearie ?
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 14]: Grieving after Jean , and feeling lonely to be left without your friend ?
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 7]: It was such a short visit .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 22]: So good of them to spare the time , but from our point of view it was _ rather _ aggravating .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 20]: You want her back again , as I do , and grieve that she 's so far away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 7]: `` No , I do n't !
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 8]: I do n't want to see her .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 8]: I 'm glad she 's in town .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 8]: I hope she wo n't come again .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 6]: The contrast is too great .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 6]: I ca n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 9]: She has everything , and I have nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 5]: It 's not fair .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 11]: She does n't deserve it any more than I do .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 28]: Why should she be beautiful , and strong , and happy , and adored , while I am lonely , and sad , and tainted by disease ?
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 6]: I ca n't bear it .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 8]: I wish she had never come . ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 13]: Miggles 's face showed a network of lines of distress and bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 9]: `` But -- but I do n't understand !
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 10]: You love Jean ; she is your best friend .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 11]: You are not _ sorry _ that she is happy ?
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 9]: You do n't grudge her her good fortune ?
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 6]: That would n't be possible .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 7]: You are far too sweet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 8]: Vanna gave a short , despairing laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 8]: `` No , I 'm not sweet .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 29]: I 'm bitter , bitter to the core ; and you might as well know the truth -- at this minute I _ do _ grudge her happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 14]: I grudge it so much that my very love seems changed to gall .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 18]: You are an angel , Miggles , but you are old , and your life is over .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 10]: I 'm young , and it 's all ahead .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 21]: It 's the most difficult lesson of all to stand aside and look at happiness through the eyes of others .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 11]: It 's easy enough to weep with those that weep .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 27]: If we are whole ourselves we are thankful that we have escaped ; if we are under the ban , there 's a companionship in suffering .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 31]: We understand each other , and help each other along ; but to rejoice with those who rejoice demands a nobility of which at the moment I am simply incapable .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 7]: This world is unfair and unjust .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 7]: Things are too horribly uneven . ''
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 10]: `` Dear child , this world is not all .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 12]: It 's only the beginning , and so soon over . ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 12]: `` Oh , no , Miggles , that 's not true .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 27]: It may seem so from the standpoint of eternity ; but we are human creatures , and from our standpoint it 's terribly , terribly long .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 13]: Fourscore years , and how slow those years are in the passing !
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 9]: When I think I may have fifty more !
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 10]: ... Besides , even eternity does n't right things .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 4]: How can it ?
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 19]: If we are all going to be happy in heaven , Jean will be as happy as I .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 47]: There will be no difference between us , but she will have had the earth-joy which I have missed , the dear , sweet , simple , domestic joys for which I was made , for which my body was fashioned , for which I crave .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 8]: They are gone -- gone for ever !
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 8]: Eternity itself ca n't make them up .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 6]: There seems no compensation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 22]: The old woman pressed her hand on the girl 's dark head , but for some minutes she did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 60]: Into her placid , gentle nature , such upheavals had never come ; she had been content to walk along the narrow way , taking each day as it came , without bitterness or repining , but the natural shrewdness which relieved her character from insipidity would not allow her to take the credit of this attribute to herself .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 16]: `` It 's because I was given that disposition , '' she told herself humbly .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 7]: `` Vanna is clever and ambitious .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 8]: It 's more difficult for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 19]: She shut her eyes , and prayed that the right words might be sent to her feeble lips .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 28]: `` But , dearie , I 'm not so sure that we _ shall _ all be equally happy in heaven , any more than on earth .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 20]: I never could believe that just because your body died you were going to wake up a perfected saint .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 17]: We 've got to learn our lessons , and perhaps happiness is n't the quickest way .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 45]: I ca n't argue -- never could ; the dear boys found that out , and used to lay traps for me , asking me to explain ; but life is only a little voyage -- a trial trip , as the papers say .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 25]: You may have fine weather , or you may have storms ; the only thing that matters is to get safe to the haven .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 27]: Sometimes when we 've been down here for the summer it has rained persistently ; 1861 was one year -- the time Pat broke his leg !
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 29]: We 've been cross and disappointed , and at the time it has seemed hard , but looking back after a few years it has faded into nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 7]: ` Was n't it wet ? '
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 6]: we say , and laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 12]: It was only for a month -- such a little time !
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 16]: Who would think of looking back and grizzling over a little disappointment twelve years old !
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 54]: And perhaps , dear , just because we could n't go out in the sunshine to pick the dear flowers , because we had to stay indoors and be quiet and patient , we learnt something , found out something , that helped us along , and made us fitter for the haven .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 20]: I 'm very stupid -- I ca n't explain -- '' `` Dear Miggles , you are very wise !
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 7]: I am fortunate to have you .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 19]: Be patient with me , and love me a little bit in spite of my naughty words . ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 5]: `` A little bit !
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 16]: Indeed , my dear , I have grown to love you with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 14]: After Jean , I really believe you are my dearest on earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 3]: After Jean !
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 3]: That stung .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 5]: Jean had so much .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 34]: She might surely have spared the first place in one old woman 's heart ; and what a sweetness it would have been to come first to just one person in the world !
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 41]: Vanna 's sense of justice pointed out that it was not reasonable to expect a few months ' devotion to eclipse the association of a lifetime ; but though reason may convince the brain , it leaves the heart untouched .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 72]: Jean had Robert ; Miggles had a whole family of adopted children ; Mrs Rendall had her son ; Piers had -- a sharp stab of pain penetrated through the dull misery of her mood , a stab which had pierced her at every recollection of Jean 's light words -- `` Always at the Van Dusens ' -- such a pretty daughter -- I believe he is in love . ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 4]: Was it true ?
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 10]: and if so , how did it affect herself ?
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 39]: Vanna went out into the garden and seated herself in her favourite seat , at the edge of the cliff , whence the winding steps cut out in the face of the chalk descended steeply to the shore .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 37]: The tide was out , and a few village children scrambled barefoot over the slippery boulders , searching for treasures in the pools between ; the sound of their happy voices floated up to her ears .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 14]: What was it to her if Piers Rendall loved and wedded another woman ?
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 31]: He was her friend ; during the last few months he had given a hundred signs of his care for her , his anxiety to help and cheer her life .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 8]: She in return must be equally generous .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 13]: She must rejoice over his happiness , and pray for its coming .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 3]: Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 7]: It was no loss to her .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 6]: She herself might never marry .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 8]: Piers Rendall could be nothing to her .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 16]: Vanna threw back her head and burst into a peal of high , unnatural laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 43]: The children playing on the rocks glanced up in amaze , and stood staring at the strange spectacle of `` The Cottage Lady '' laughing all to herself , and Vanna laughed on and on , with ever harder , higher notes .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 7]: Piers could be nothing to her .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 4]: No , nothing !
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 22]: nothing but life , and sun , and air , and food , and raiment , and hope , and comfort .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 4]: Nothing but that .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 9]: Everything in the world , and nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 6]: Unutterable joy , unfathomable loss .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 4]: She knew now .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 8]: The scales had fallen from her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 27]: In a blinding flash of light she saw her own heart , and knew that it held but one thought , one image , one hope .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 7]: How long had she loved him ?
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 35]: She recalled their first meeting , when he had frowned at the sight of her , and she had watched him walk along the shore by Jean 's side with resentment in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 57]: Their acquaintance had begun with prejudice and dislike , yet almost at once her sympathy had gone out towards him ; almost from the first it had distressed her to see his depression ; that nervous twitch of the features had been a positive pain , she had turned away her head to avoid the sight .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 52]: Later on , when Jean was engaged , he had drawn nearer , and looking back on the day of the wedding , she knew that it had been for his sake that she had taken an interest in her costume , from a desire to appear fair in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 21]: At the moment of entering the church it had been his face which had stood out from all the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 10]: She had been so thankful to see his smile .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 36]: All that afternoon and evening he had been quietly , unostentatiously attentive , as if divining her sense of loss , and striving , in so far as might be , to fill the gap .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 38]: Twice again she had seen him before leaving town , and then had come the morning when he had appeared at the Manor House window , and she had seen her own transfigured face in the glass .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 21]: That was the day when the last barrier had broken down , and friendship had finally made place for love .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 51]: Nature , which had decreed that she might never marry , had not at the same time been merciful enough to take away the power of loving ; rather had it bestowed it upon her in a deeper , fuller fashion than is possessed by nine women out of ten .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 17]: Every power of her being surged towards this man in a passion of love and longing .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 18]: She stretched out her hands as if to grasp him , and sobbed to feel them empty .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 15]: Laughter turned to tears -- the slow , difficult tears of a breaking heart .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 10]: For ever and ever these hands must remain empty .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 17]: As if the present were not sufficiently painful , Vanna then projected herself into the future .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 59]: In imagination she saw Piers engaged to this pretty , strange girl ; listened to his mother 's endless prattle concerning her beauty , his happiness , the coming wedding ; saw him located at the Manor with his bride by his side , bringing her over to the Cottage , sitting beside her in the Happy Land .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 9]: The future was desolated ; and the past ?
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 12]: The past also crumbled to nothingness before this shock of self-revelation .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 19]: Where now was the peace and conquest on which she had congratulated herself during the last few months ?
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 15]: Not only had they disappeared , but it appeared that they had never existed .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 52]: That lightsome frame of mind , which she believed to have been gained as a reward for duty well done , had in reality been nothing more or less than the dawnings of love ; the deep undercurrent of joy and hope which had lain beneath the surface of her life .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 8]: Vanna hid her face in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 18]: At that moment the sight of the gay , smiling scene seemed but to mock her grief .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 29]: She felt a wild longing for winter , for the stormy sky and sea , the frowning cliff , which would be a fit setting for her life .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 23]: How could she go on tending Miggles , sitting quietly in the house , separated from Piers , seeing him with another ?
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 19]: The sound of footsteps startled her from her trance -- ascending footsteps , scaling upwards from the beach .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 16]: She straightened herself , thrust back her hair , and struggled to compose her features .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 30]: It seemed part of the same dull trance that it should be Piers 's face which rose into sight , his dark eyes which turned anxiously to her face .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 51]: She had not known of his coming , but she was not surprised ; a stupor of indifference had succeeded the passion of despair ; she felt no surprise , no embarrassment , but sat watching him stonily , until he reached the last step and stood by her side .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 10]: `` Was that _ you _ laughing just now ?
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 10]: I heard you as I came along the shore .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 7]: It _ was _ you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 15]: `` Yes , it was I. '' `` And now you are crying ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 9]: His tone was quick and tense with anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 6]: `` What is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 5]: You are not well .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 6]: Something has been troubling you .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 10]: It is not like you to be hysterical . ''
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 12]: Vanna 's lips curled , her eyes stared steadily into his .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 15]: A sudden impulse seized her , and she gave herself no time to pause .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 5]: `` And why not ?
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 12]: On the contrary , it is just what you might expect .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 10]: There is no counting on what I may do .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 14]: My moods are very variable , but you must make excuses for me .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 7]: There is madness in my family .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 15]: My father died in an asylum , and my grandmother , and two aunts .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 14]: I have been warned that I may have the same fate in store .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 12]: You can hardly expect me to behave like a normal creature .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 11]: It is no wonder if I wax hysterical at times .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 19]: It 's not exactly a pleasant prospect to look forward and picture _ that _ fate in store .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 9]: You must make allowances for occasional outbursts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 25]: He stood above her , looking down with dark , intent eyes as though he would see into the very heart of her being .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 6]: `` When were you warned ?
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 2]: Lately ?
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 6]: Since I was here last ?
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 9]: Is that what is troubling you now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 8]: `` I saw the doctor last summer .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 17]: He warned me then , but I had known the facts for two years before that .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 22]: They had been hidden from me , but I found them out , and went to the doctor for advice . ''
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 5]: `` A year ago !
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 14]: You have known all these months when you have been happy and gay ?
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 9]: Then this has nothing to do with to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 7]: What is troubling you to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 6]: She looked at him blankly .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 25]: On his face was a great sympathy , a great tenderness , but no sign of the horror and amazement which she had expected .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 19]: The great tragedy of her family seemed to weigh as nothing as compared to her grief of to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 14]: The tears rose in her eyes , but they were tears of relief .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 9]: Her voice faltered in pitiful , childlike fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 36]: `` I was lonely , and I remembered , and I was afraid -- afraid to look forward ... '' He bent down and took her hands in his with a firm but gentle pressure .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 4]: `` Get up !
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 7]: You are not lonely any more .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 7]: My horse is in the village .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 13]: Go and get ready , and we will have a ride . ''
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 11]: He strengthened his grasp , looking deep into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 16]: `` What does it matter to me if every soul belonging to you were mad ?
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 16]: You are the sweetest , the _ sanest _ woman I have ever met . ''
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 5]: THE COMPANY OF SAINTS .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 28]: From that day forward Vanna deliberately shut her eyes to the barriers which blocked her life , and gave herself up to the joy of the present .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 35]: Piers knew her dread secret , and the knowledge would surely be sufficient to put any thought of her as a wife out of his mind , if indeed such a thought had existed .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 40]: Her conscience being clear that he at least would not suffer through a continuance of their intimacy , she for her own part was ready to pay the price of future suffering for the rich joy of the present .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 55]: The joy would not , could not last , but it was better , a thousand times better , to taste the full flavour of life , even if but for a few short months , than to drag on to old age ignorant of the deepest experiences which can stir the human soul .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 27]: If suffering must come , knowledge would come with it -- comprehension , sympathy , and to the end of time the memory of golden hours .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 28]: Piers 's visits increased in number , and he was unceasing in his efforts for all that concerned the welfare of the two inmates of the Cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 12]: In his presence Vanna expanded like a flower in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 41]: Love , the magician , worked his spell upon mind and body , so that beholding her own likeness in the glass she would often blush again , as she had blushed on the afternoon of Piers 's first visit .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 27]: Her pale cheeks were tinged with colour , her eyes shone , her very hair showed rich russet gleams as she wandered bare-headed in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 48]: The sound of her own laugh , the aptness of her own words , astonished and delighted no one so much as herself : it was as if a hundred unsuspected beauties and charms , after lying latent all her life , had sprung suddenly to birth .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 30]: There were moments when , from sheer pride and self-congratulation , she came near following Gwendoline Harleth 's historic example , and kissing her own reflection in the glass .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 6]: `` I am happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 5]: she told herself triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 12]: `` This is happiness -- the best I shall ever know .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 15]: I must realise it , enjoy every moment , enjoy it to the full .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 28]: I must guard it preciously , shut my eyes and ears to all the little jars and frets , and not _ allow _ them to interrupt .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 6]: It is my golden time .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 26]: In years to come , I must be able to look back and remember that I made the most of it when it was mine .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 21]: It would be madness to waste an hour ... '' Meanwhile the two old ladies looked on with silent understanding .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 42]: Mrs Rendall had been in her own way an ardent admirer of Vanna in the earlier days of their acquaintance ; but a mother looks with changed eyes upon a girl whom she suspects her son of honouring with his love .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 27]: No one is worthy of that honour , and it is rarely indeed that an element of coolness and jealousy does not tinge the former affection .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 23]: Mrs Rendall pursed her lips at the mention of Vanna Strangeways , and no longer pressed for repetitions of the weekly visits .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 22]: To Miggles it was unalloyed joy to behold the growing attachment between the two young people whom she loved so dearly .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 50]: Never by word or deed did she hint at her desire ; but as the months passed by and her health steadily declined , she hugged the thought that when her hour came the dear child who had comforted her last days would find another and a sweeter home .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 21]: An ever-increasing feebleness warned her that her days were numbered , though so far she had been spared severe suffering .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 29]: The local doctor confided in Vanna that such immunity could not be expected to the end , for in such cases violent paroxysms of pain were almost inevitable .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 26]: Vanna shrank with fear from the prospect ; but the God in whom Miggles so sweetly trusted had decreed an easier release for His child .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 27]: Sitting beside an open window in the second spring of her sojourn at the Cottage , Miggles contracted a chill , which quickly developed into bronchitis .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 42]: The attack did not appear serious to onlookers ; but some premonition of the end seemed to visit the invalid herself , for she called Vanna to her bedside , and whispered an eager request : `` My keys , dear !
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 4]: On the ring !
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 6]: I want them here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 19]: Vanna brought the big , jingling bunch from its place in the work-basket with its red silk linings .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 35]: Miggles had the slavish devotion to locking up which characterised her time , and it was seldom indeed that any of her possessions could be reached without the aid of at least two keys .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 21]: Now with feeble fingers she separated two from the rest , and held them out for the girl 's inspection .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 19]: `` This big one with the red thread , that 's for the cupboard in the spare room .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 17]: This little one -- the smallest but two -- that 's for the bottom drawer inside .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 19]: If I die this time -- one can never tell -- go at once and open that drawer .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 5]: _ At once _ !
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 6]: To save you trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 12]: Vanna nodded , and put back the bunch in the basket .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 45]: She herself had no fear that this illness would end fatally , until in the still hours of the night she crept to the bedside and beheld on her friend 's face the grey shadow which , once seen , can never be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 39]: The doctor was summoned , with Piers Rendall , who by good providence was staying at the Manor , and the dread sentence was pronounced in the little sitting-room in which so many peaceful hours had been spent .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 4]: `` Slipping away !
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 3]: Heart failure !
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 18]: The heart is too weak to stand the extra strain caused by this oppression on the lungs .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 8]: She will not last out the day .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 7]: Do n't grieve , Miss Strangeways .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 6]: It 's a merciful release .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 11]: If she had lived she would have had great suffering .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 9]: We must be thankful for her sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 16]: Vanna and Piers sat together by the bedside during the long hours of that morning .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 31]: A telegram of warning had been dispatched to Mr and Mrs Goring , but it was not possible that they could reach the secluded village before late in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 16]: Miggles lay with closed eyes , breathing heavily , but without further sign of distress .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 27]: For the most part she seemed to sleep , but once , when Piers bent over her , she opened her eyes and essayed to smile .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 8]: `` How are you now , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 6]: How do you feel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 13]: asked the young man anxiously ; and Miggles struggled bravely to reply .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 6]: `` Quite -- well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 18]: said the feeble voice ; and after a moment 's pause -- `` And very happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 24]: After that she sank ever deeper and deeper into unconsciousness , while the watchers sat on either side , watching the still face .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 54]: It was just as the clock struck five , and the sun passing beyond the barrier of the cliff left the little room grey and dull , that with a movement of surprise , as if wakened by the touch of an invisible hand , Miggles suddenly lifted her lids and gazed around .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 34]: The heavy , bulging cheeks had wasted away , and the eyes , which in health had appeared small and insignificant , now stared out , large and wide from the hollow sockets .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 16]: As she looked , the first surprise was superseded by a great and incredulous joy .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 41]: She turned her head from side to side , the faint smile deepening to rapture , while her panting lips gasped out the same word -- once , a second time , and again a third : '' _ Angels !
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 2]: Angels !
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 4]: Angels _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 13]: The two who looked on bowed their heads , and were still .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 36]: To them it was a small , dull room , prosaic in furnishing , grey , with the shadow of night and death , but Miggles 's opening eyes beheld therein the company of saints .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 13]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Piers and the faithful maid turned Vanna out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 8]: She had done enough , they said .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 14]: It was not for her to be pained by the last sad rites .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 25]: She allowed herself to be led on to the little landing ; but when Piers tried to lead her downstairs she refused to move .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 30]: Remembrance had come to her of Miggles 's request with respect to the keys , and the search which was to be made '' _ at once _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 39]: She had no idea what she was to find as she knelt beside that bottom drawer , while Piers stood watchfully at her side ; it was the impulse of obedience pure and simple which guided her movements .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 18]: The first glance brought no illumination , for a strip of muslin hid the contents from view .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 56]: With its removal came the scent of lavender , and there , neatly ranged in order , lay a pair of fine linen sheets with pillow cases to match , a nightgown , and a cap with a border of pleated lace , its muslin strings neatly folded and secured in place with a pin .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 5]: Miggles 's burial clothes !
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 21]: prepared long since with her own hands , and put aside to `` save trouble '' to those left behind .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 13]: Vanna bowed her head , and burst into a passion of tears .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 4]: VANNA 'S KINGDOM .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 11]: Miggles was buried at Seacliff by her own written request .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 33]: A letter addressed to Mr Goring was discovered after her death , in which her wishes were expressed with the simple candour and consideration for others which had ever characterised her utterances .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 10]: `` I wish to be buried here at Seacliff .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 20]: It will be less trouble than taking me to town , and I have always loved the little place .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 28]: I do n't wish money wasted on an elaborate coffin , but I should love all the flowers which people find it in their hearts to send .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 23]: I do n't wish any one to wear mourning , or to give up their pleasures or amusements because of my death .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 33]: I always loved to see you dear ones happy and gay , and if I can still see you from the other world , it would grieve me to see you sad .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 24]: I want you to go on with your lives in the usual way , and not think it necessary to mourn for me .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 8]: But I should like to be remembered .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 11]: I hope you will still let me share your lives .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 18]: Talk of me sometimes when you are together -- not sadly , but quite cheerfully and happily .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 10]: Say sometimes , ` Miggles would like that ! '
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 7]: ` Miggles would say that ! '
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 7]: ` how Miggles would laugh ! '
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 9]: just as if I were in another room .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 50]: I may be even nearer , and it seems to me now that even heaven itself could not make me happy if I saw you sad ... '' Mr and Mrs Goring , the two schoolboys , Piers Rendall , his mother , and Vanna were the chief mourners .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 40]: Jean was expecting a baby , and had been somewhat alarmingly delicate during the last months , so that it was impossible for her to travel to Seacliff , and Robert refused to leave her even for a day .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 32]: The little burial-ground lay inland , nearer the Manor House than the cottage on the cliff , and after the service was over the mourners returned to lunch with Mrs Rendall .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 69]: Piers and Vanna followed slowly after the others until a side gate was reached leading into the grounds , when Piers produced a key from his pocket , and , entering , led the way , not towards the house , but down hill in the direction of the glen , but Vanna stood still in the path , looking at him with surprised , reproachful eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 5]: _ To-day _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 3]: `` To-day !
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 3]: Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 19]: She is happy ; it was her great wish for us that we should be happy , too .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 3]: Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 16]: He took her hand in his , and she made no attempt to withdraw it .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 28]: Worn out as she was with the strain and grief of the last few days , the firm clasp seemed to bring with it strength and comfort .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 15]: Hand-in-hand they descended the sloping path and stood beneath the shelter of the trees .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 22]: As on the day of their first visit together , the delicate beauty of early summer surrounded them on every side .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 35]: The foliage still retained the fresh green of springtime , the grass was dotted over with patches of fragrant violets and anemones , the water of the stream babbled musically over the mossy stones .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 28]: As Piers gazed around there was on his face an expression which Vanna had never seen before -- an expression of exaltation , of almost incredulous content .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 15]: `` Vanna , '' he cried breathlessly , `` it is _ true _ !
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 9]: All my life I have feared and doubted .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 25]: Even as a child , when my mother taught me at her knee , the doubts arose in my mind , and the questions .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 10]: You have wondered why I never went to church .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 12]: It would have been a mockery when I could not believe .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 23]: I have read , and listened , and discussed ; and out of it all came only more doubt , more confusion .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 19]: It is my nature to mistrust -- _ was _ my nature , till I met you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 10]: His hand tightened on hers with almost painful pressure .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 25]: `` You have taught me the reality of goodness and truth , and now , through you , this has come -- this revelation .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 4]: It is true !
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 5]: There is another life .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 6]: This world is not all .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 19]: I have doubted all other evidence , but I can not doubt what I have _ seen _ .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 24]: They were there , Vanna , close around us , the spirits -- the ` angels ' of Miggles 's sweet old faith !
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 17]: We were too blind to see , but they were there , and she saw them .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 6]: That light in her eyes !
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 5]: Can you ever forget ?
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 14]: That was not death -- it was life -- the coming of life !
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 14]: Oh , my darling , my darling , what this means to me !
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 8]: A new heaven -- a new earth .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 7]: The falling of the scales ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 41]: He lifted his quivering face to the sky as though asking forgiveness of the God whom he had denied ; but the woman by his side had no thought at that moment for anything in heaven or earth but himself .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 17]: Amazement of joy following so hard upon grief seemed to sap the last remnant of strength .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 11]: She trembled violently , and gripped at Piers 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 20]: He turned in alarm , but the face looking up to his was quivering with joy , not pain .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 3]: `` Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 27]: `` You called me -- you called me -- '' She broke off , trembling , shaking , blushing to the roots of her hair . ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 9]: _ What _ did you call me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 36]: For a moment he stared bewildered ; then remembrance came -- the echo of his own words throbbed in his ear , bringing with them a second revelation , the revelation of his own heart .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 23]: He seized her in a grasp violent in its intensity , and drew her towards him , gazing deep into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 6]: `` Vanna , my beloved !
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 3]: This too !
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 6]: My love , and yours !
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 5]: A new earth indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 28]: The words said themselves , darling ; they have lived so long in my heart that they slipped from my lips before I had realised my wealth .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 43]: I who thought I could never love , to have walked into it , step after step , deliberately , blindly , until I found myself so deep down , so engulfed , that I could not be free if I would .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 11]: Vanna , I have only lived since I knew you .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 33]: It was you I needed all those empty years : you have given me life , joy , hope ; you must give me the last thing , too -- your love !
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 10]: After this vision I ca n't live without it .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 14]: You are mine , Vanna ; I ca n't give you up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 51]: He drew her head to his shoulder and pressed passionate kisses on her lips , her hair , her white , closed lids , and she clung to him , forgetting everything in the bliss of certainty , the intoxicating nearness , the touch of his lips on her own .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 3]: `` Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 25]: Was it _ this _ you felt -- a foretaste of this joy -- when you walked into your kingdom and read its message ?
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 16]: It 's in your Happy Land , my dearest , you have found your love .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 9]: May it be an omen of the future !
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 4]: Speak to me !
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 6]: ... Tell me in words .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 15]: I have never heard a woman 's lips speak to me of love . ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 32]: Vanna looked up at him , a wealth of devotion in the depths of her eloquent eyes , but her lips trembled over the words : `` What can I say ?
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 6]: The words wo n't come .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 13]: I was lonely , too , and you are everything -- everything .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 10]: From the very first day you filled my mind .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 6]: I thought it was friendship .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 28]: When I found out , I struggled , but it was no use , so I gave in , and let myself love you more and more .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 14]: It was my best happiness -- the only happiness I could look for .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 12]: I never ventured to hope that you could love me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 23]: He laughed , a low , tender laugh , and framing her face between his hands , lifted it towards his own .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 7]: `` Was I blind and deaf ?
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 25]: Could I see you , and talk to you , and listen to your praises from far and near , and keep my head ?
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 11]: Do you know in the least what you are like ?
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 23]: I 'll carry a little mirror in my pocket and let you see yourself some time when you are animated and happy .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 8]: I 'll make you admire yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 13]: `` Have you fallen in love with me for my looks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 3]: `` Partly .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 2]: Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 13]: I love your looks , and I wo n't have them depreciated .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 33]: And with your goodness , and sweetness , and strength , and your unreasonableness , and temper , and weaknesses -- and which I love the most I really ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 21]: There 's not a bit of you I do n't love , or would have altered if I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 3]: Vanna shivered .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 15]: Already the golden moment had passed , and a shadow fell across her joy .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 16]: This climax of bliss -- what could it be but a presage of the end ?
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 10]: She drew herself away from Piers 's encircling arms .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 8]: `` Ah , what have I done ?
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 7]: Piers , what have I done ?
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 9]: I have forgotten -- we have both forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 16]: I told you my secret that day on the cliff when you heard me cry .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 9]: Do you know _ why _ I cried ?
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 19]: Because Jean had spoken of a girl in town , with whom she thought you were in love .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 13]: It tortured me ; I was nearly wild with jealousy and despair .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 12]: And then you came , and I blurted it all out .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 5]: it was not noble .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 6]: I was thinking of myself .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 20]: I wanted to get the weight off my mind , that I might enjoy you with an easy mind .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 39]: I felt that if you knew the worst , and cared to be with me after that , the responsibility was yours , not mine ; and I tried -- I _ tried _ to make you care !
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 15]: I deluded myself , but I know now that I _ did _ try .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 15]: I thought I could not help it , but it was selfish -- cowardly .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 8]: I should have thought of your good .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 15]: Piers , I can never be your wife ; you can never marry me .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 7]: I have only brought fresh trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 7]: Can you ever forgive me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 19]: He smiled at her , and , disregarding the outstretched hands , drew her back into his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 9]: `` Forgive you , my best of blessings !
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 11]: For the moment I can think of nothing but love .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 14]: My mind is n't big enough to grasp anything beyond that tremendous fact .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 12]: The present is ours , darling ; be content in that .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 20]: We are here together in our Happy Land -- you and I. Nothing can rob us of this hour .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 17]: If it ended here , this minute , I should still bless God for His goodness .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 22]: To know you love me , to hold you here in my arms -- it 's worth living for , Vanna .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 8]: But it 's not going to end .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 4]: Trust to me .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 7]: I will go up to town .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 6]: I will interview the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 6]: I will find a way .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 16]: You are mine , and all the world shall not keep you from me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 11]: Vanna smiled in his face with happy , love-lit eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 14]: He was a god in her eyes , and the gods are omnipotent .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 15]: If Piers willed a thing it did not seem possible that he could fail .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 4]: Reason fled discomfited .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 7]: She loved , and was blind .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 4]: THE SECOND BEST .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 20]: Piers lost no time in going to town to interview Dr Greatman , but the result was not encouraging .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 24]: He came back to Vanna with a worn face , and the restless discontent of older days eclipsing the happiness of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 51]: `` If it were only my own risk , I would take it a thousand times over , '' he declared ; `` but when he tells me that it would be worse for you , that I should be increasing your danger , there is nothing to be said .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 9]: I would kill myself rather than do that .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 22]: I have racked my brain , I paced the floor the whole of last night , but no inspiration will come .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 7]: There seems no way out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 11]: `` There is no way , '' said Vanna quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 28]: They were sitting in the morning-room in the Cottage , that little room which seemed so empty without the familiar figure on the sofa by the window .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 34]: In deference to Miggles 's wishes , Vanna was wearing a simple white dress ; but although the melancholy aspect of mourning robes was removed , her face also looked bleached and wan .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 17]: The waiting hours had been terribly long to the woman whose fate hung on the verdict .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 6]: `` There is no way !
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 33]: You made me hope in spite of myself , for it seemed impossible that any one could refuse you what you wished ; but nothing is changed since I saw him last .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 11]: There was no reason why he should alter his opinion .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 30]: I can see now that he spoke to me so plainly just to try to avoid this crisis ; but it has come , and it is my fault .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 26]: I ran away from another man who was beginning to love me , but when it came to my own turn my courage gave way .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 28]: I knew that the day would come when I should have to suffer for every hour of joy , but I was prepared to pay the price .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 5]: I am prepared still .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 6]: I have had my day .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 23]: I know what happiness is -- the greatest happiness which a human soul can know ; and nothing can take that away .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 71]: I never dared to think that you would love me , but you do ; and it 's such perfect bliss to know that , and to feel your arms round me , and to be able to say all I feel , instead of bottling it up in my heart as I have had to do all these months , that for my own sake I ca n't regret .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 11]: Only for yours , dearest ; only for yours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 10]: `` What do you think it means to me ?
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 17]: Before I met you I was lonely and dissatisfied -- you know what I was like !
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 9]: People talk of _ joie de vivre _ .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 17]: I never knew it -- never until this last year , since I have known you .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 10]: When we have been together I 've wanted nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 12]: I 've been more than happy : I 've been content .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 18]: When we have been apart I have lived for the time when I should see you again .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 20]: If you love me , how can you regret having given me the great joy of my life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 6]: `` If it could last !
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 5]: If it could last !
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 19]: But when it is only to bring a worse pain upon you , how can I help regretting ?
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 6]: Oh , it is hard .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 18]: To think what this moment means to other couples , and that we should be shut out .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 44]: I feel like you -- my own risk is nothing ; it is the dread of its consequences for you that weighs , and he said -- he said , that the worst time , the time of the worst danger lay ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 16]: Piers , how _ can _ you love me with that knowledge in your mind ?
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 21]: I thought when I told you , I honestly thought that it would stop every possibility of your caring . ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 7]: `` Nothing could have stopped me .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 30]: I told you then , as I tell you now , that you are the sweetest , the sanest woman I have ever met , and you are mine .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 14]: I will never give you up ; never to my dying day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 11]: `` Piers , Piers , we have no choice . ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 25]: He drew her towards him , a hand on each arm ; drew her roughly , passionately , his dark face twitching with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 4]: It is true .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 5]: We have no choice .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 11]: You have said it , and it is the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 19]: We belong to each other , and nothing that any one can say or do can alter that .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 13]: For better or worse we belong ; till death us do part .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 5]: There is no choice .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 23]: You ca n't get away -- Vanna , does it strike you that we are doing a wrong , a wicked thing ?
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 14]: We are killing our golden hour almost as soon as it is born .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 25]: Those other lovers that you speak of , do they trouble their heads about marriage the first moment they are alone with their love ?
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 7]: I do n't believe they do .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 9]: I do n't believe it is even mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 13]: It is enough joy , enough wonder , to realise the present .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 7]: Ca n't we follow their example ?
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 13]: Ca n't we be content just to be together -- like this ?
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 10]: Is n't the present rich enough to content us ?
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 15]: It is more , a hundred times more than I ever dared to expect .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 17]: You could not be so cruel , Vanna , as to take it from me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 6]: `` If it could last !
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 6]: If it could last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 5]: moaned Vanna once more .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 42]: `` Oh , Piers , it is heaven just to sit here , with my head on your shoulder , and your arms around me ; but I must go away , far away to the other end of the world .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 22]: We ca n't even be ` engaged ' like other people , and have the right to meet and be alone .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 12]: How could we be engaged when we can never marry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 6]: `` How could we not ?
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 15]: If we can not have the best thing , we must take the next .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 11]: Do all engaged lovers marry and live happily ever after ?
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 6]: You know they do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 11]: They ca n't see what is waiting one day ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 6]: There are a hundred risks .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 9]: At the last moment death may divide them .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 18]: The only thing that is secure is the present ; they grasp that , and are happy .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 15]: That 's the philosophy of life , darling ; that must be our philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 4]: You are mine .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 10]: I am not going to give up my rights .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 15]: We must be able to meet , to see each other when we wish .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 21]: If to do that and satisfy conventions , we must call ourselves ` engaged , ' engaged we will be .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 13]: I shall tell my mother to-night , you must tell the Gorings .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 15]: We are engaged , and we adore one another , and are gloriously happy .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 9]: Do you remember Jean when she was engaged ?
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 9]: Were n't _ they _ gloriously happy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 6]: `` For three months ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 32]: Cruel memory flashed back echoes of impatient words and sighs which had escaped the lovers ' lips even during that short period : `` These eternal good-byes , these eternal interruptions !
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 7]: When shall we be alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 6]: -- `` For three months !
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 11]: If it had been three years -- thirteen -- thirty !
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 11]: I ca n't imagine Robert waiting for long indefinite years .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 23]: Oh , Piers , you would grow tired -- impatient -- '' He pressed her to him with a groan of anguish .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 15]: `` Of course I shall be tired ; of course I shall be impatient .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 10]: Do n't torture me , darling -- and yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 31]: It 's a second best , and it must be hard ; but it is all that 's left , and for a time at least it will be bliss .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 7]: One never knows what may happen .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 19]: We are not particularly strong people , you and I ; we may not have long to live .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 20]: Vanna , knowing the uncertainty of life , dare you , _ dare _ you refuse me my joy ?
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 19]: You say this has come upon us by your fault ; then surely you feel your responsibility also .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 10]: You owe me something , and you must pay .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 8]: Vanna , is it so hard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 3]: `` Hard !
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 8]: Do you think I want to refuse ?
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 15]: Do you think it would not be bliss to me to give way too ?
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 39]: For myself it would be all gain -- your love , your companionship , your help ; but for you it would be a barrier , shutting out better things -- a wife , children , a home .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 13]: You need them , Piers ; you are not made for solitude .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 10]: As you grow older you will need them more .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 8]: How dare I shut them out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 5]: He did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 17]: Vanna felt his cheek twitch against her own , heard the sharp indrawing of the breath .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 29]: Her words had gone home ; she felt a wild surge of anger against herself -- against the morbid conscientiousness which had sought to wreck her own joy .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 28]: The gods had thrust a gift into her hands , and because it was not pure gold she had thrust it aside , leaving herself to starve .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 14]: The slackening of Piers 's arms brought with it a stab of anguish .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 8]: Had she convinced him against his will ?
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 10]: Was he about to take her at her word ?
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 25]: But instead of turning away he drew her to her feet , holding her by both hands so that they stood face to face .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 13]: `` Vanna , you remember what I said to you about Miggles ?
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 6]: The lesson of her death ?
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 24]: You believe -- I believe that this world is not all ; that it is only a beginning -- the portal of life .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 12]: Ca n't we lift our love above the ordinary human conception ?
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 25]: Ca n't we be content to wait -- to suffer if it must be , in the hope of all that is to come ?
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 16]: I do n't pretend that it will be easy ; but we have no choice .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 19]: The love has come ; we ca n't alter it ; we do n't want to alter it .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 21]: We belong to each other for life and eternity ; we must help each other to live on the heights .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 26]: We must not allow ourselves to regret and to pine for what we can not have ; we must be thankful , and look forward .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 13]: You are so good , so strong ; you must help me !
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 28]: We must go on with our lives ; but if this love is worth anything , it will be a strength to us -- not a bar .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 7]: It would be folly to part .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 19]: Should we think of each other any the less because we were at opposite ends of the world ?
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 2]: Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 19]: surely you of all women should be the last to deny the possibility of a spiritual love . ''
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 6]: But Vanna did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 18]: Her head fell forward until her face was hidden from sight ; her hands burned within his .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 22]: She was a woman , and for the moment there was no place in her heart for Piers 's lofty self-abnegation .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 14]: A spiritual love -- self-sacrifice and suffering in the hope of future bliss !
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 49]: And she was to be strong and brave , and help him when he failed ; she , who was filled with a passion of longing for the dear , human , everyday joys ; to whom for the moment they towered above the far-off , spiritual gain .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 13]: The woman 's birthright of intuition revealed the future with flashlight clarity .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 40]: Her heart was torn with a presage of the pangs which would rend it afresh , as she beheld happy wives , rich in home , husband , and children , while she wandered outcast , unsatisfied , athirst .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 62]: The man , with shorter vision , could content himself in the present , and in the fulness of love 's revelations delude himself that joy would remain ; but to the woman , for whom the love of him was an aching longing of body and soul , the sharpest pang of all came from the certainty of his mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 25]: She looked forward and beheld him restless and rebellious , chafing against his chains -- the old , irritable discontent on lips and eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 11]: He would suffer ; of a certainty he would suffer .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 24]: So surely as he was made in man 's image , the day would dawn when his joy would be changed into despair .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 40]: A wild longing seized Vanna to give her lover happiness while she might ; to give him such a summer of joy and content that when the winter came he should look back and feel the price well paid .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 15]: Her fingers tightened on his arm , her eyes sought his in feverish entreaty .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 3]: `` Piers !
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 78]: if I do give in -- I have no strength to oppose you -- if I give in , swear to me that if the time comes when you regret -- when you feel bound , because there is some one '' -- she gulped painfully -- `` some one else whom you could take for a wife -- swear that you will be honest with me ; that you will not let me spoil your life !
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 10]: Swear that you will tell me the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 19]: He smiled into her troubled face , taking possession of her hands in a close , comforting grasp .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 14]: `` What would you think if I asked the same promise of you ?
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 13]: Ca n't you give me credit for as much consistency as yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 14]: Is it possible that I could grow tired of _ you _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 15]: But at that moment Vanna had no ears for the sweet protestations of love .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 13]: Her grasp grew but the tighter , her gaze the more distressed .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 5]: `` Swear to me !
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 3]: Swear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 8]: Piers gave a short , half-impatient laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 5]: `` I swear it .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 6]: Now are you content ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 4]: A FALSE POSITION .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 61]: Vanna begged a month 's grace before the announcement of her engagement was made public , and before half that time had passed , had said good-bye to the seaside cottage in which she had known such peaceful , happy days , and , in response to an urgent invitation , had gone to pay a long visit to Jean .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 29]: `` You said the time would come when I should need you , '' wrote Jean , in a long pencilled scrawl , `` and it has arrived !
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 12]: I need you badly , dear ; I crave for you .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 20]: At this moment I feel I must either have a kind , understanding woman near me , or die !
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 15]: I am so ill , Vanna , and so weak , and so frightened !
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 23]: It has been such a long , long time , and I never knew before what it was like to be ill .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 22]: One does not grow used to it -- it grows harder and harder , and the days are so eternally long .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 37]: I do n't apologise for asking you to exchange one invalid for another ; another person might think it hard , but not you , you dear angel -- it will be an inducement to you .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 27]: And you 'll stay until it is over , wo n't you , and keep house , and look after Robert , when I 'm upstairs ?
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 34]: Oh , the joy , and the ease , and the comfort it would be to see you walk in at this moment , and to know that you 'd come to stay !
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 39]: I want you more than I 've ever wanted you before ; and if you say no , I 'll collapse at once , and it will be your fault , and you 'll repent for ever after .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 5]: Wire your reply . ''
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 10]: Vanna smiled happily as she read the characteristic words .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 7]: Yes , her time had come .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 8]: She had waited to a good purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 24]: Jean needed her , and she needed Jean ; she was longing eagerly for long , heart-to-heart talks with her only woman friend .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 35]: Except those few short days at Seacliff , the two friends had not met since the day of the wedding , and there would be so much to hear , so much to say .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 11]: What would Jean have to say to her great news ?
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 41]: She recalled Jean 's face of dismay as , kneeling on the ground , she had listened to Dr Greatman 's verdict ; heard again the tremble in her voice as she asked , `` Is there no escape ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 26]: Surely Jean would not blame her , because when happiness had been placed into her hand she had not had strength to thrust it away ?
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 21]: Surely out of the riches of her own wealth she would rejoice that some crumbs had fallen to her friend ?
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 5]: What would Robert say ?
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 23]: He was a man : he would judge from a man 's standpoint , with his head rather than with his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 8]: Vanna shrank nervously from Robert 's disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 17]: He was one of the simple , upright men who are apt to be hard judges .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 16]: To them there are but two courses in life -- a right and a wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 24]: They have neither sympathy nor understanding for those who pitifully essay to find byways by which to escape the rigours of the path .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 26]: Yet when love had seized Robert in its grip he had made short work of obstacles -- had laughed to scorn Vanna 's prudent advice .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 20]: When she had condemned him , and refused her help , he had replied that it was not needed .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 7]: He required no help from outside .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 15]: Vanna lifted her chin with proud resolve ; she herself could be equally independent .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 30]: It would make the future more difficult if Robert and Jean adopted a disapproving attitude , but for the moment she need not trouble herself about such a contingency .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 24]: She would allow Jean time for the discussion of her own affairs before seizing a quiet opportunity for telling her own great news .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 53]: The tall town house , with its narrow staircase , and high , box-like rooms , felt close and stuffy after the wind-swept cottage , but it glowed with the colour dear to the heart of its mistress , and was refreshingly different from the ordinary houses of that most inartistic age .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 26]: Jean had copied her interior from pictures rather than from upholsterers ' catalogues , and her principal furniture had been made from her own designs .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 39]: Robert had placed no limit on her expenditure ; he could not afford a large house , but she was to have `` everything she wanted '' for the small one which she had graciously consented to occupy .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 22]: Such were his instructions , and Jean had proceeded to carry them into effect with a literal interpretation of the words .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 43]: Being one of the happy people who always know exactly what they want , no time was wasted in discussion , the only difficulty being to procure fabrics as beautiful and artistically tinted as those which were pictured in her fertile brain .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 38]: When the last treasure had been discovered , and fitted into its niche , the completed whole was a triumph of good taste , beautiful and restful ; a home of which any man might be proud .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 21]: Robert was proud of it because it was Jean 's doing , and spectators waxed enthusiastic in Jean 's praise .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 52]: For himself , he would have been as well satisfied with a walnut suite and moreen curtains , perhaps more so , for he felt uneasily that he should never be able to smoke comfortably in such fine surroundings , nor to cross a floor without pausing to rub his boots .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 31]: Neither of the two had a glimmering of an idea of what it cost to furnish a house ; but when the bills came in Robert had a disagreeable shock .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 35]: The sum which he had laid aside was ludicrously inadequate , and he was obliged to have recourse to `` selling a share or two , '' and so reduce his already slender capital .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 5]: But Jean was content .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 15]: Jean was proud of her house ; all other considerations were second to that .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 36]: Vanna met her friend in the drawing-room , which , being situated at the back of the house , with a depressing outlook , had the ordinary window replaced by one of rich stained glass .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 30]: Gas jets had been arranged outside the window , which , being lit at dusk , served to show the glowing colours of the design through the evening hours .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 37]: On this summer afternoon the mellowed light , and absence of prospect , combined to give the room the aspect of a shrine , and Jean moving slowly forward was certainly beautiful enough for a high-priestess .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 50]: She wore a wonderful flowing robe of a dull blue , softly falling silk , the long open sleeves hanging almost to the ground , and showing her slim arms encased in some thin metallic substance , in which gold shot into silver , and silver back to gold .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 28]: The folds at the neck were caught together with a metal clasp and chains , and slippers of the same colour peeped out beneath the sweeping skirts .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 33]: The first glance at her face , however , brought with it a thrill of fear , for suffering and weariness were written there with an eloquence beyond the power of words .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 35]: The eyes were haggard and encircled with violet shadows , the cheeks had lost their curves , the lips drooped , yet , as ever , Jean 's beauty rose triumphant over all drawbacks .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 28]: Vanna asked herself if she were not more beautiful than ever , for the childlike pathos of expression added the needed touch of softness to her features .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 8]: `` Oh , Vanna , you blessing !
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 7]: You have come at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 7]: `` I 've come , darling .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 4]: Come to stay !
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 8]: As long as you want me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 35]: Jean kissed her again and again , the tears gathering in the lovely eyes , but she dashed them away , and in another minute was laughing and chattering in her old gay voice .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 7]: `` Bring tea , bring tea !
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 7]: And I 'm engaged , remember !
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 10]: Not a soul is to disturb me this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 6]: Vanna , you look sweet .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 16]: If you go on improving at this rate , you 'll soon beat me hollow .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 11]: Sit here , opposite , where I can see you .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 13]: Oh , you look so fresh , and happy , and well !
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 9]: You are like a breath of sea air .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 29]: I 've been stifling for months in this stuffy room , with not even a tree to look at , to remind me that it 's spring . ''
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 21]: She threw an impatient glance at the stained-glass window which had made such a deep hole in Robert 's purse .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 13]: `` Robert goes out at nine , and gets home at seven .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 8]: Oh , my dear , such days !
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 15]: I 've had such a dose of my own society that I 'm sickened .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 19]: If there 's a person on earth I detest at this moment , it 's Jean Gloucester . ''
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 4]: Vanna smiled whimsically .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 8]: `` It does n't look like it .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 16]: You seem to me to take a very fair amount of interest in her still .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 11]: You look as charming as ever , you wonderful person .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 5]: What a marvellous gown !
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 11]: Where in the name of mystery did you evolve it ?
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 14]: and how many coffers of gold did you squander in the purchase ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 7]: Jean had the grace to blush .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 5]: `` Oh , well !
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 5]: one must be respectable .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 8]: It _ is _ rather a marvel .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 29]: It was designed for me by an artist woman who has gone in for gowns ; but no earthly inducement will ever make me tell what it cost .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 17]: It 's so soothing to have something becoming that it 's been as good as medicine .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 12]: Looked at in that way , it 's _ cheap _ !
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 12]: And I have been so good about money all the year .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 15]: Rob balanced our books last week , and we were only a hundred out .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 18]: Very good , I call it , when you remember that I had _ no _ experience .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 15]: The first time we had asparagus for dinner I could n't eat a bit .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 8]: I just sat staring at every stick .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 8]: You have always to pay for experience .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 30]: Besides , as I said to Rob , you are only newly married once , and it would be a sin to rub off the bloom worrying about pennies .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 19]: It 's silly to spoil the present for the sake of what may happen in a dozen years .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 18]: We may be dead , or if we are not , we shall probably be better off .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 22]: Rob 's position will be improved , the boys ' education will be finished , and father can allow me more .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 24]: Men are so fussy about capital ... Vanna , do you realise that it is a whole year since I 've seen you ?
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 12]: You have told me very little about yourself in your letters .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 9]: There 's so much I want to hear .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 10]: Not about Miggles to-day -- we 'll leave that .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 7]: I do n't want to cry .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 6]: Tell me about yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 6]: `` Oh , not yet !
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 6]: One thing at a time .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 25]: I 've not half finished with you , '' said Vanna with a thrill of nervousness , which she tried her best to conceal .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 13]: `` There are a hundred things that I am longing to hear .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 5]: But first about Robert .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 4]: How is he ?
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 13]: Well -- flourishing -- giving satisfaction -- as nice as ever ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 4]: `` Nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 7]: Jean tossed her head in disdain .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 6]: `` What a paltry word .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 12]: He is the best man out of Heaven , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 10]: That is the only description for _ him _ .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 19]: I 've lived with him for eighteen months , and have not discovered one single , solitary fault .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 8]: That 's simple truth , not exaggeration .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 8]: I honestly believe he is perfect . ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 8]: `` And with you for a wife !
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 29]: You are a darling , Jean ; but method was never your strong point , and by your own account your housekeeping has n't always been a success .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 26]: Does he continue to smile through all the upsets , and forgettings , and domestic crises , such as you described to us at Seacliff ?
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 11]: I ca n't believe it of a mere man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 16]: `` Oh , I did n't mean to say that he preserves a dead-level calm .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 8]: I should hate him if he did .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 8]: He is rather irritable in small ways .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 47]: You can excite him to frenzy -- comparatively speaking -- by moving the matches from his dressing-room , or mislaying his sponge or nail scissors ; but then it is the servants who get blamed -- never me ; and in big things he is great !
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 17]: If he became paralysed to-morrow , or lost every penny he possessed , or if ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 54]: -- Jean 's face sobered -- '' _ died _ , he might suffer tortures , but he would not speak one word of rebellion , and he would keep his interest in other people , and be truly , unfeignedly , ungrudgingly glad that they were so much more fortunate than himself .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 7]: Oh , he is a marvel !
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 4]: I adore him .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 9]: I would give worlds to be like him .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 47]: I am bursting with pride at being the woman he has chosen out of all the world ; but he spoils me so , that it 's becoming second nature to want all my own way , so I keep falling farther and farther behind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 7]: `` Robert would n't admit that !
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 20]: No doubt he thinks himself the laggard , and you just such another paragon as you have described . ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 9]: Jean pursed her lips in a whimsical grimace .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 13]: The droll part of it is , he does _ not _ .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 16]: He does n't understand me one bit ; I 'm a continual enigma to him .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 22]: Half the time he is puzzled out of his wits , and the other half he is -- _ shocked _ .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 3]: Such eyes !
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 24]: You should see them staring at me , growing bigger and bigger , when I let myself go , and grumble or rage .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 30]: He disapproves , but he makes excuses , because I am I , and he loves me , and would n't change me for the greatest paragon alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 25]: She was silent , smiling mischievously to herself for several minutes , then burst out suddenly : `` Can you imagine it , Vanna ?
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 10]: I sometimes wish he were not quite so good !
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 18]: It 's aggravating for a sinner like me to be shown up continually against such a contrast .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 20]: And sometimes it lands one in such fixes ... I could tell you such stories of this year ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 7]: She snuggled back against her cushions .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 13]: `` Ah , it _ is _ good to have you here .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 28]: I have so longed for a girl to talk to ... The first six months we went about a great deal , paying visits to his friends .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 19]: The first time I asked him to describe the people , as I knew them only by name .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 6]: ` Oh , Meg ! '
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 20]: he said , ` Meg is the simplest of creatures : kindly , and easy-going as you find 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 9]: You 'll feel at home in five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 6]: No fuss , no ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 12]: The sort of house where you feel absolutely at home . '
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 12]: Well , what would _ you _ expect from that description ?
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 33]: I saw a vision of a suburban villa , and a stout , frumpy woman with a fat smile , and packed a modest little semi-evening frock to let her down gently .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 3]: My dear !
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 17]: it was a mansion , and she was the very smartest creature I have ever beheld .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 20]: The first glimpse of her in afternoon clothes took away my breath ; but there was worse to come .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 47]: She had asked a dozen people to dinner to meet us , and while we were dressing -- it was a summer evening , and quite light -- I saw carriages bowling up to the door , and visions in satin dresses trailing up the steps .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 52]: There was nothing for it ; I put on my wretched little frock , eating my heart out the while at the thought of all my trousseau grandeurs lying useless at home , and descended -- the bride , the guest of honour -- the worst dressed woman in the room !
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 7]: Can you imagine my suffering ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 3]: Vanna smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 18]: She could ; and also the manner in which Jean would upbraid her husband after the fray .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 4]: `` And Robert ?
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 6]: What had he to say ?
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 12]: How did he look when he first saw you alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 6]: `` Radiant , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 2]: Beaming !
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 5]: Absolutely , utterly content .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 13]: Blankly astonished and dismayed to find that I was not the same .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 13]: Utterly unconscious that my dress had been any different from the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 16]: Blindly convinced that there had not been one in the room to touch it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 12]: They both laughed , a tender indulgence shining in their eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 28]: It was the look with which women condone the indiscretion of a child ; but Jean was still anxious to expound her own side of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 17]: It 's charming ; but you 've no idea how trying it can be at times .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 11]: Other women lament because their husbands complain of their meals .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 10]: I wish to goodness Robert _ would _ complain .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 9]: It would make things easier with the maids .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 21]: Good plain cooks need so much keeping up to the mark , and I never get a chance of grumbling .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 31]: When the things are unusually bad , and I am mentally rehearsing what I shall say in the kitchen next morning -- ` you really must make the soup stronger .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 15]: The gravy was quite white ... Why did the pudding fall to pieces ? '
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 29]: -- you know the kind of thing -- Robert will lean back with a sigh , and say , ` I _ have _ had a good dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 6]: You 've eclipsed yourself to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 7]: I am getting quite spoiled . '
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 11]: I glare at him , but it 's no use .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 12]: He says , ` What is the matter , dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 26]: and I see a smug smile on Brewster 's face , and know she will go straight into the kitchen and repeat the whole tale .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 7]: How can I grumble after that ?
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 10]: The wind is taken completely out of my sails .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 19]: Sometimes I think that for practical , everyday life a saint is even more trouble than a sinner .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 7]: Then the friends he brings here !
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 8]: You never knew such a motley throng .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 13]: It may be any one from a duke -LRB- figuratively a duke .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 31]: He has met all sorts of bigwigs , ` east of Suez ' -RRB- to a vagrant with broken boots , and not an ` h ' in his composition .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 22]: And it 's always the same description : ` do you mind if I bring a man home to dinner to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 19]: I met him at -- ' some outlandish place -- ` and he was awfully decent to me .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 15]: He is passing through town , and I should like to have him here .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 6]: Such a good fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 29]: Then , of course , if I have rice pudding , it 's the duke ; or if I order in an ice , it 's the vagrant .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 14]: Once or twice I 've tried cross-questioning , but it 's no use .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 13]: If I ask , ` is he a gentleman , Robert ? '
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 29]: he looks at me with his biggest eyes , and asks , ` would I ask any one to meet _ you _ , who was not ? '
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 5]: But , bless him !
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 13]: his ideas and mine on that point do _ not _ agree .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 33]: So here , my dear , you behold the novel spectacle of a woman who has only one complaint to make of her husband , that he is _ too _ good !
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 11]: But he loves me , Vanna , more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 19]: We have n't grown a bit stodgy , only just lately I 've been so ill and depressed .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 15]: It will be better now you are here ... Now tell me about yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 14]: You 've had a sad time , but you do n't look sad .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 6]: You look happy and well .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 2]: Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 4]: you are blushing .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 3]: Tell me .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 9]: There is something -- I know there is .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 6]: Tell me at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 8]: `` Yes , there is something . ''
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 17]: Vanna braced herself against the chair , a thrill of nervous foreboding coursing through her veins .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 34]: She drew off her left glove , which she had purposely left on during tea , and held out the hand , on the third finger of which sparkled a large square diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 6]: `` There is that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 3]: `` Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 3]: A ring ?
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 5]: On your engagement finger !
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 6]: Who gave you that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 5]: `` Piers Rendall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 22]: The colour rushed in a crimson flood over Jean 's face ; her lips parted in breathless , incredulous surprise . ''
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 4]: _ Piers _ !
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 2]: Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 6]: You _ mean _ it ?
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 2]: Piers ?
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 4]: Piers and you ?
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 4]: You are engaged ?
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 2]: When ?
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 2]: Where ?
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 5]: For how long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 4]: `` At Seacliff .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 4]: A fortnight ago .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 11]: But we have loved each other from the first . ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 14]: `` And you never told me ; you never said a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 17]: I have not seen you ; but even if I had I could not have spoken .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 7]: Remember how _ you _ felt !
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 12]: Could you have discussed Robert with me while you were waiting ?
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 14]: I asked Piers not to announce the engagement until I had told you .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 13]: No one has been told so far , except his mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 4]: `` Mrs Rendall ?
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 3]: She knows ?
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 5]: It is settled then ?
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 5]: Really absolutely settled ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 5]: I told you so .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 5]: A fortnight ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 11]: A little chill of offence sounded in Vanna 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 18]: Jean 's congratulations were a trifle too long delayed ; her surprise too blank to be flattering .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 12]: `` Are n't you going to congratulate me , Jean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 24]: `` But -- but -- You told me -- you said -- the doctor said -- '' `` That I should never marry .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 3]: Just so !
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 4]: That fact remains .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 14]: Piers knows ; I did not deceive him ; he knew months ago .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 9]: He came up to interview Dr Greatman himself .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 22]: We know that we can never marry , but we love each other , and mean to take what happiness remains .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 10]: No one ever forbade me to be engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 7]: `` How can you be engaged ?
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 3]: What for ?
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 8]: Engaged _ not _ to be married ?
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 4]: It 's absurd .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 5]: What could you say ?
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 5]: How could you explain ?
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 6]: What would people think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 9]: Vanna laughed -- a short , hard laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 13]: Still Jean had not congratulated her , nor said one loving word .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 25]: `` If it is a false position , it is just those ` people ' of whom you speak who force us into it .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 20]: The conventions of society do n't allow a man and a woman to enjoy each other 's society undisturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 15]: To be engaged is the only way in which they can gain the liberty .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 9]: Therefore that is the way we must take .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 9]: There is nothing else to be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 11]: `` And -- when you _ do n't _ marry ?
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 11]: You are both well off , and not too young .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 23]: People will expect you to marry at once , and when you do n't -- '' `` That is our own affair .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 37]: They will be told at the beginning that it will be a long engagement , and however much they may wonder among themselves , they will hardly have the impertinence to question us on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 14]: I imagine they will be polite , and kind , and congratulate us .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 22]: I do n't think there will be many who will hear the news without speaking _ one _ kind word . ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 11]: The inference was undisguised -- was intended to be undisguised .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 10]: Jean flushed again , and knitted her delicate brows .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 25]: `` I do n't mean to be unkind , but it sounds so wild , so impracticable , so utterly unlike you , Vanna .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 5]: Where will you live ?
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 5]: How can you meet ?
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 5]: You are only twenty-five .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 7]: People are so ready to talk .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 10]: What do you propose to _ do _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 8]: `` To go on with our lives .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 7]: I have money , thank goodness .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 33]: I must have a little house -- it wo n't be rich and luxurious like yours -- just a little corner where I can put my things , and feel at home .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 32]: I must make a sacrifice to convention and have a sheep dog , too , I suppose -- some lonely woman like myself , who will be thankful for a home .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 24]: She can look after the servants , and the cleaning , and understand from the first that she leaves _ me _ alone .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 7]: Then I shall find some work .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 18]: I have an idea working out in my head which I hope will bring interest and occupation .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 8]: And Piers shall come to see me .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 15]: We shall have a place where we can meet in peace and comfort . ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 13]: `` Vanna , you wo n't have peace -- it 's impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 39]: Oh , I know it 's hard that your life should be spoiled , terribly , terribly hard ; but remember what the doctor said -- that you had no right to spoil the man 's life also .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 17]: When you repeated that to me that afternoon you said there was no fighting against it .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 21]: If you hold Piers to you now , you will steal his chance of wife and home and children . ''
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 12]: `` Ah , there they are again -- those children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 8]: Vanna 's lip curled in bitter passion .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 15]: `` Those visionary children who are for ever cropping up to block the way .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 10]: No legal form can make a wife and home .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 22]: I am more to Piers than any other woman , despite all my limitations ; his home is where I am .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 29]: Why should I be sacrificed , a live woman , with all my powers strong within me , for the sake of problematic infants who may never arrive ?
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 14]: And if they did , is it all joy to be a father ?
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 10]: Are you sure that the joy equals the pain ?
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 14]: Your father was broken-hearted that day when you left him with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 21]: You did not trouble about him ; why should I give up everything for the sake of possible children ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 29]: There was silence for several moments ; then Jean spoke : `` Vanna , you talk as if I did not _ want _ you to be happy .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 3]: Ask Robert !
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 32]: He 'll tell you how often I have spoken about you ; how I 've cried in the midst of my own happiness to think you could never have the same .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 3]: But this !
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 22]: Oh , it 's a mistake , dear ; it 's a mistake ; it will land you in worse trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 27]: Piers will never be content ; you wo n't be content yourself ; it wo n't be happiness , but a long , long fret . ''
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 27]: `` Other people -- married people , happy married people -- look back and call the years of their engagement the happiest time of their lives .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 5]: I 've heard them .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 7]: You 've heard them yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 3]: But why ?
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 18]: They lived in the future , building castles , the castles in which they were to live .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 31]: If you could have heard them talking when they were alone , you would have found that it was almost always about the future -- When shall we be married ?
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 8]: Where shall we go for our honeymoon ?
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 5]: Where shall we live ?
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 38]: They imagined it all sunshine , all joy ; and when the reality came , and its shadows , and ups and downs , they looked back , and realised how happy and unburdened they had been .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 49]: But , Vanna dear , if you take away the future -- if there is no looking forward -- a dread , instead of a hope -- '' Vanna shivered , but she held herself erect , and took no heed of the hand held out towards her .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 35]: She looked round the beautiful , luxurious room , at the glowing stained-glass window , which shut out the grey aspect of the outer world , and as she did so , bitterness arose .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 9]: Once more the knife-edged question cleft her heart .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 36]: Why should the ugliness of life be turned into colour and beauty for one traveller , while the other might not even take to herself a crumb of life 's feast without reproach and misgiving ?
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 32]: A moment before she had craved for Jean 's sympathy ; now she felt cold , and hard , and resentful , unwilling to accept such sympathy if it were offered .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 7]: Jean was too happy to understand .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 18]: She was one of fortune 's favourites , for whom life had always been smooth and easy .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 16]: How could she realise the hunger of one who had stood continually outside the feast ?
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 11]: Of what use were sweet words if understanding were lacking ?
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 17]: Her voice when she spoke again sounded chill and aloof : `` You need not enlarge .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 44]: Piers and I realise too well that our lot is different from other happy lovers , but we have both known what it is to feel lonely and sad , and we believe that we shall find consolation in each other 's love .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 8]: We mean to try , at least .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 16]: Our minds are firmly made up on that point , whatever our friends may think .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 29]: If you wish to cast me off , Jean -- I shall be sorry -- but , I tell you frankly , it will make no difference . ''
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 8]: `` Vanna , _ do n't _ !
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 28]: Do n't be so bitter ; do n't speak to me in that voice ; I ca n't bear it , '' cried Jean with gasping breath .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 33]: The sound of her voice brought Vanna 's eyes upon her in startled inquiry , and at the sight of her face resentment vanished , in a spasm of love and fear .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 14]: So white she looked , so spent , so pitifully frail and broken .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 16]: Jean was ill : this was no moment to trouble her with exhausting mental problems .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 33]: Vanna felt a swift pang of penitence at the thought that she who had arrived in the character of nurse and consoler had already contrived to bring about a crisis of weakness .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 26]: In a trice her arms were supporting the lovely head , her lips pressed to the white cheek , her lips cooing out tenderest reassurements .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 7]: `` There , darling , there !
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 13]: I was a brute , a mean , bitter , grudging brute .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 10]: Forgive me , and we 'll never quarrel again .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 6]: I know it , Jean !
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 39]: All you have said , and _ morel _ I did make a stand ; I refused to listen , but I love him so ; I 'm so hungry for happiness -- I could n't stand out !
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 18]: Whatever comes , whatever happens in the future , we shall have _ some _ time together .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 14]: Think how you would feel in my place , and you 'll understand .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 19]: You and Robert mean so much to us both , you _ must _ wish us well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 39]: Jean cried , and clung to Vanna 's hands with feverish protests of love and fealty ; but she allowed herself to be soothed and petted and waited upon with a docility as new as it was touching .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 59]: When Vanna skilfully led the conversation to brighter topics , she slowly regained her composure , and some of her old brightness , but her face still showed signs of her distress , and Vanna inwardly quailed at the thought of Robert 's wrath when he returned and discovered the manner in which she had inaugurated her arrival .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 41]: For every one 's sake she considered it wise to avoid a second argument that night , and returned to her own room to unpack before Robert arrived , leaving Jean to break the news to him as she pleased .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 38]: The sound of his cheery whistle came up to her from the hall ; she heard the doors open and shut , and flushed and paled as she followed in imagination the conversation in the room below .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 18]: A quarter of an hour passed , then came footsteps , and a tap at the door .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 3]: `` Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 4]: It 's I !
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 10]: May I speak to you for a moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 11]: The voice was cordial , with its old cheery note .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 24]: At the sound of it Vanna dropped the bundle of clothes which she was holding , and hurried to fling open the door .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 26]: Robert was standing before her , pale and , if possible , thinner than ever , but with a great tenderness shining in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 19]: Without preamble he took both her hands in his , and said : `` Jean has told me .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 6]: She is your oldest friend .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 18]: We want you to feel that this is your home until you have one of your own .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 6]: Ask Piers whenever you like .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 6]: He will always be welcome .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 12]: There 's the little den ; it is at your service .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 12]: We 'll do everything we can for you , Vanna . ''
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 16]: But he did not congratulate her , and the lack smote on Vanna 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 11]: `` Thank you , Robert , '' she said wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 6]: `` That 's like you .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 18]: I am very grateful , but , but ca n't you say you are _ glad _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 16]: Piers and I love each other very much , and we have been very lonely .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 22]: Robert , you , of all people , ought to be able to understand the possibility of a spiritual love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 9]: But Robert only flushed , and looked distressed .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 10]: `` We are not spiritual beings yet , Vanna .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 5]: That 's the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 5]: I understand the temptation .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 7]: I do n't presume to judge .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 8]: Piers is a better man than I .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 12]: He may be able to rise where I should sink . ''
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 14]: `` What would _ you _ do if you were in our place ?
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 17]: If Jean were like me , and you loved her , but could not marry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 35]: Robert 's eyes craved pardon , but his lips did not hesitate : `` I should take a passage in the first boat , and put the width of the world between us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 3]: THE REAPER .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 30]: Robert and Jean made no further remonstrance , but the consciousness of their disapproval was a weight from which Vanna could only escape in the company of Piers himself .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 24]: Alone with him in the shelter of the den she tasted content , all the more perfect from the contrast with darker hours .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 46]: Encircled by Piers 's arms , with Piers 's eyes looking into hers , the world itself had no power to touch her , and she found herself translated into that woman 's kingdom where everything that _ she _ did was right and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 10]: `` Jean does not approve of me , Piers .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 10]: She thinks I am acting unfairly by you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 9]: `` My Heart , why worry about Jean ?
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 18]: She is a child -- the most charming and lovable of children , but still a child .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 16]: You have more brains in your little finger than she has in her whole head .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 9]: She is incapable of understanding your sentiments . ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 7]: `` Robert does n't approve ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 6]: `` Robert does n't count .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 7]: He is an echo of Jean .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 8]: He judges you from her standpoint . ''
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 17]: `` If you get tired of me , Piers , you have promised to speak ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 6]: `` I 've sworn it .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 11]: I 'll swear it again , ten thousand times over .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 9]: Does one grow tired of the sun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 45]: Then Vanna would abandon argument and talk delicious nonsense , and tell herself a hundred times over that , come what might , she was the happiest , the most blessed of women , to have gained the heaven of Piers Rendall 's love .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 16]: The days drifted past , quiet and peaceful except for the growing fear about Jean .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 31]: The doctor shook his head , pronounced her condition `` not normal , '' and Robert , though invariably cheerful in his wife 's presence , grew haggard with suspense .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 68]: And then suddenly , some weeks before it was expected , came the end -- a ghastly day , a day of hasty comings and goings , of urgent summons for further help , of anguish of body for Jean , and for those who loved her , the mental anguish of sitting still hour after hour waiting with trembling for the verdict of life or death .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 25]: It was four o'clock in the morning , the soft grey dawn of a summer 's day , when at last the waiting ended .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 16]: The doctor opened the door of the den , and faced Robert 's hungry eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 9]: `` It is all over , Mr Gloucester .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 6]: Your wife is coming round .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 10]: She is young , and has a good constitution .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 7]: I think she will pull through .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 27]: She is very low -- that is only to be expected ; but we have nature on our side , and must hope for the best .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 15]: Unfortunately , circumstances are not so favourable for her recovery as one could wish .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 18]: I regret to say that in spite of all our care we could not save the child .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 4]: A fine boy !
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 16]: I deeply regret ; but you will be thankful that your wife is spared . ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 17]: The tears flooded Robert 's eyes , but they were tears of joy , not grief .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 20]: At that moment he had no room in his mind for the little son whom he had never seen .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 27]: After the blackness of those hours when he had seen a vision of life without Jean , he could do nothing but rejoice and thank God .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 11]: But Vanna 's heart contracted with a spasm of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 3]: Poor Jean !
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 3]: Poor Jean !
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 8]: What a bitter awakening would be hers !
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 15]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ And Jean lay on her bed , bruised , aching , incredibly fatigued .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 35]: She asked no questions , displayed no interest ; with eyelids closed over sunken eyes , pale lips apart , she lay like a broken flower , indifferent to everything in heaven or earth .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 48]: At intervals of a few hours the doctor came and felt her pulse ; at times some one put the tube of a feeding-cup to her mouth , and she swallowed , shuddering with distaste ; at intervals it was dark , at intervals it was light .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 24]: Once an urgent voice spoke in her ear telling of Robert 's presence , and she opened her eyes and tried to smile .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 9]: All her life long Jean remembered that smile .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 31]: An effort was required of her ; she realised as much , and with all the force of her feeble will endeavoured to twist her lips into the looked-for greeting .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 21]: They were stiff as iron , heavy as lead ; she struggled wearily -- was it for hours she struggled ?
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 9]: -- and at last mechanically felt them part .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 7]: She smiled , and Robert cried !
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 15]: It seemed a poor reward , and she shut her eyes in weary despair .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 14]: At times she slept , to awake with a gasp and a cry .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 31]: Always she was falling -- falling from the high gallery of a cathedral , from the top of a pile of scaffolding , from the topmost crag of a precipice .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 21]: Then some one wiped her brow , and spoke soothing words , and she cried , weakly , without cause .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 30]: Four days of nightmare , then at last rest -- a real sleep , without dreams or fear ; peace in the troubled frame , appetite instead of nausea .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 22]: The fire burned brightly on the hearth , the curtains were drawn , nurse was drinking tea comfortably beside the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 20]: The old homely , everyday life , how good and natural it looked after the black , nightmare dreams .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 4]: `` Nurse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 11]: whispered Jean weakly , `` where is my baby ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 31]: The white-capped nurse leapt to her feet ; it must be uncomfortable , thought Jean , to feel those stiff , white bows for ever pinned beneath one 's chin .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 21]: She came to the bedside , and looked down at her patient with an expression of mingled anxiety and relief .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 7]: `` Ah , you look better !
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 6]: You have had a deep .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 18]: You will be ready for some food -- '' `` My baby -- I want my baby !
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 9]: Why is it not in the room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 7]: `` You have been too ill .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 7]: We had to keep you quiet .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 14]: You are getting on nicely now , but you must still be careful .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 16]: Be good now , and drink this milk , and try to sleep again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 10]: `` Is it a girl or a boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 5]: `` A boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 7]: Jean 's voice thrilled with joy .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 5]: `` I knew it .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 4]: I knew it .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 11]: I _ said _ it could not be a girl .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 6]: A boy -- a son !
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 12]: Oh , bring him to me , nurse ; bring him !
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 9]: I ca n't wait a moment longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 15]: `` You have waited four days ; you can wait a few more minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 11]: Drink your milk , and I will call your husband .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 9]: Poor man , he has been so wretched !
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 11]: You would like to see him _ first _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 9]: Nurse was masterful , and Jean was weak .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 23]: She swallowed the milk , and impatiently waited for Robert 's arrival , hugging the thought of the burden in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 30]: Surely he would bring him to her -- the hard-won treasure , the tiny , precious son for whose sake she had gone down to the gates of death !
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 8]: The door opened , and Robert entered .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 32]: His face was drawn and aged , his hazel eyes haggard with suffering ; but for once Jean had no thought for him -- her eyes saw only his empty arms .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 6]: `` Where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 10]: Robert went down on his knees by the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 9]: `` Jean , darling , speak to me !
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 14]: I have been hungering all these days ... Thank God you are better .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 16]: Oh , Jean , nothing matters in all the world if I have you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 11]: Jean smiled , and her fingers feebly returned his caress .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 4]: `` Poor lad !
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 3]: poor lad !
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 12]: You have suffered , too , but he will comfort us .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 5]: Bring him to me !
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 10]: put him here , between us on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 8]: Let us look at him together . ''
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 5]: `` Jean , sweetheart !
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 14]: We have been happy together ; sufficient for each other all these months .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 11]: Am I not more to thee than ten sons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 21]: Then in a flash fear dawned on Jean 's heart ; her great eyes widened , her lips fell apart .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 4]: `` My baby !
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 5]: Do n't torture me .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 6]: Where is my baby ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 9]: `` With God , '' said Robert softly .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 10]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The nurse had cleared away the tea things .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 24]: After a due interval she had returned to the room , and been relieved to find the patient lying quietly on her pillow .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 15]: Mr Gloucester sitting by her side looked more agitated and distressed than she did .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 17]: His face wore the pitiful , baffled expression of a child whose overtures have been rejected .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 29]: It was with an air of absolute timidity that he bent forward to kiss his wife 's cheek when bidden to depart by the autocrat of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 7]: `` I must go , darling .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 7]: I 'll come back soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 20]: Jean 's head moved slightly on the pillow , but the movement was away from him , not nearer .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 5]: She spoke no word .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 20]: Nurse Emma moved about the room , performing necessary duties in the deft , noiseless manner of her kind .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 17]: From time to time she cast a curious glance at the still face on the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 4]: `` Poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 11]: Too weak , no doubt , to take it in !
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 12]: Yet she had seemed excited at the thought of the boy .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 17]: A pity , after such a hard time , but there would be plenty more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 20]: She shook out some dainty , lace-frilled garments before the fire , and approached the bed , judiciously cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 8]: `` Now , it is six o'clock !
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 13]: You are so much better this afternoon -- what do you say ?
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 10]: Could you fancy a nice cup of tea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 10]: Jean opened her eyes , and looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 21]: It was not a look , it was a glare ; the grey eyes were dry , tearless , blazing .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 11]: At the sight Nurse Emma was positively shaken with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 14]: `` Oh , my dear , do n't look at me like that !
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 6]: It was not my fault .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 12]: We did our best for you -- more than our best .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 8]: I never saw Dr Erroll so anxious .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 7]: You owe your life to him .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 24]: It 's sad , of course ; a great disappointment , but you are so young , and you have your good husband .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 6]: You must n't fret . ''
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 7]: `` I am not fretting . ''
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 3]: `` Not ?
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 3]: What then ?
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 7]: You look -- '' `` Furious !
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 4]: I 'm furious .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 5]: I have been cheated .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 6]: It 's not fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 6]: `` Oh , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 6]: Do n't talk like that .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 7]: These things happen , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 6]: You 're not the first .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 14]: We all have our troubles , and you are pulling round so nicely .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 12]: There was a time when we feared for you , too .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 16]: You must be thankful that your life was spared for your poor husband 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 19]: It 's been most trying for him , with your weakness , and the funeral , and all .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 8]: Come now , have a little cry .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 6]: It will do you good .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 8]: Then you shall have some tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 15]: Jean glared at her again -- glared with an intensity that was almost hatred .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 12]: `` You are a foolish woman , '' she said coldly .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 10]: `` You have no right to be a nurse .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 4]: Go away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 15]: Nurse Emma bit her lip and went back to her seat by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 2]: Really !
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 30]: But it was her duty to ignore the outbursts of irritable patients , and preserve an unruffled calm , and she honestly strove to live up to her creed .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 11]: Half an hour later she renewed her offer of tea .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 26]: When her second and third attempt alike failed to produce any response , she determined once more to summon the husband to second her efforts .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 31]: Outside the bedroom door was a small square landing , the sort of landing , unworthy the name of hall , which one finds in most small , middle-class houses .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 16]: The gas was not yet lighted , and it had a dreary , depressing air .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 25]: Before the window , gazing blankly into the street , stood Robert Gloucester , every line of his body eloquent of fatigue and depression .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 16]: Nurse Emma looked at him sympathetically ; but her first thought was for her patient .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 13]: `` I think you had better go to Mrs Gloucester , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 8]: I ca n't get her to eat .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 8]: The food is ready on the table .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 9]: Perhaps she will take it for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 13]: Robert passed her without a word , shutting the door behind him .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 8]: Jean stared at him across the room .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 3]: `` Darling !
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 9]: Nurse is distressed that you wo n't eat .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 9]: She has sent me to persuade you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 11]: `` She is a stupid woman -- stupid and heartless .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 10]: She has no right to be a nurse . ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 8]: `` Do n't say that , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 10]: She has nursed you well -- been most devoted .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 12]: For three nights she has not had off her clothes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 8]: Jean 's upper lip curled in scorn .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 20]: A strong , self-contained woman , who had lost three nights ' rest in performance of her paid duty .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 3]: Three nights !
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 35]: For how many weary months had she herself missed her sleep , dreading the night , dreading the day , travelling wearily nearer and nearer a martyrdom of pain , and now -- nothing !
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 9]: Hungry arms , hungry heart , incredible disappointment !
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 10]: She pushed aside the offered cup with impatient hand .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 7]: `` I do n't want it .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 6]: It would choke me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 13]: `` But you are so weak ; you will be worse again .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 7]: For my sake , sweetheart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 4]: I am better .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 6]: You can see for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 6]: I feel really stronger . ''
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 11]: And strange as it appeared , Jean spoke the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 23]: In some mysterious fashion the flood of anger coursing through her body seemed to have brought with it fresh life and energy .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 17]: The tone of her voice was clearer , a tinge of colour showed on her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 13]: She looked her husband in the face with cold , challenging eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 26]: `` You took away my baby -- my baby , and hid him for ever , without letting me have one sight of his face !
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 4]: Was that just ?
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 4]: Was that fair ?
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 14]: Does a woman wait all those months to be cheated at the end ?
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 9]: It was a cruel thing to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 6]: `` But you were ill .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 7]: Your own life was in danger .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 13]: It would have killed you to be roused to hear that news .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 13]: If you think it over , dear , you will understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 7]: `` It 's easy to talk .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 4]: You saw him .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 4]: You can remember .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 5]: I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 5]: Robert 's face twitched .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 3]: he remembered .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 29]: All his life he would remember the small , dank face of his first-born -- that pitiful image , so cruelly unlike the cherub of Jean 's dreams .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 57]: He had another memory also -- the memory of a grey , rainy morning when he stood by his son 's grave in the dreary city cemetery , while his wife lay unconscious at home , grudging each moment in his longing to be back beside her -- dreading to return to hear a worse report .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 25]: Jean had been spared more than she knew -- more than she would ever guess , for no word of his would enlighten her .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 14]: It was not Robert Gloucester 's custom to speak of his own woes .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 20]: He sat by the bed holding Jean 's slack hand , gazing at her with wistful , puzzled eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 20]: He loved her as surely no man had loved a woman before , but he could not comfort her .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 9]: That was the tragic , the inexplicable fact .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 12]: In the first great sorrow of life she thrust him aside .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 28]: It was terribly hard for her , poor darling ; a crushing blow , _ but _ there was still so much for which to be thankful .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 16]: Her own life was spared ; they were given back to each other 's love .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 9]: Could she not realise , and be consoled ?
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 3]: Poor Robert !
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 25]: As well expect the dead child to rise from its grave as Jean to develop patience in the crash of her first great grief .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 37]: If she had fallen from one deep faint to another , if she had hysterically cried and sobbed , he could have understood and sympathised ; but this bitter cry of rebellion was beyond his comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 25]: At the moment when he most longed to draw near , the great barrier of temperament shut him out from his wife 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 29]: The darkness deepened in the room ; the face of Jean on the pillow became dim and blurred , her hand lay slack and unresponsive in his grasp .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 31]: Robert sat silent , his whole being expended in a prayer for strength and wisdom -- for the power to say the right word to meet his wife 's needs .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 8]: `` Beloved , '' he whispered softly .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 4]: `` Be patient !
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 8]: Be content with me a little longer .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 21]: There will be others ... '' But what woman fresh from her fiery trial can take comfort in that thought ?
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 11]: With a cry of pain Jean wrenched away her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 14]: `` Oh , you do n't , you _ do n't _ understand !
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 9]: I want Vanna -- I want a woman .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 6]: Send Vanna to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 10]: So once again he had said the wrong thing .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 16]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Vanna crept in through the doorway , and knelt down by Jean 's side .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 28]: The gas was lighted now , turned up just high enough to make visible the various objects in the room , without dazzling the patient 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 20]: Those eyes were raised with strained appeal to the other girl 's face , as if mutely asking help .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 23]: Here was another woman , a woman who loved her , a woman who would never have a child of her own .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 4]: Would she understand ?
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 11]: What words of comfort would she offer in her turn ?
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 6]: But Vanna said no words .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 19]: She laid her face down on Jean 's hand , and the hot tears poured from her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 15]: The trembling of her form shook the bed , and Jean trembled in response .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 13]: A spasm of weakness threatened her , but she would not succumb .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 13]: She pressed her lips together , and stared fixedly with burning eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 23]: Was this the `` little cry '' which was to act as the prelude to the `` nice cup of tea '' ?
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 7]: What comfort had Vanna to offer ?
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 22]: she said in that cold , faint voice which sounded so poor an echo of her usual full , musical tones .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 6]: what have you to say ?
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 8]: I sent for you , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 5]: My baby is dead .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 6]: He is _ dead _ .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 5]: I have no baby .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 9]: It has been all useless , for nothing !
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 8]: Nothing is left -- '' `` Jean !
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 2]: Jean !
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 6]: My poor little Jean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 9]: `` Is that all you have to say ?
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 16]: You ought to tell me to be brave , to be brave and not fret .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 7]: I am not the first person !
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 13]: ... Can you believe it , Vanna ; _ can _ you ?
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 11]: That little chest of drawers is full of his things .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 16]: I 've stitched at them for months , and dreamt of him with every stitch .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 16]: I 've turned them over a hundred times , waiting , looking forward to to-day .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 13]: There 's his cot in the corner , and his little bath .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 11]: It 's all ready -- but he is not here .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 5]: My baby is dead .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 14]: They took him away , and hid him where I can never see .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 6]: Think of it , Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 12]: all those months , and never even to see his face .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 25]: To have had a little son , and never to have touched him , given him one kiss -- '' `` Poor little mother !
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 5]: Poor little hungry mother .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 7]: Oh , my poor Jean . ''
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 13]: Jean shut her eyes , and pressed her head against the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 5]: `` Vanna , Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 6]: How shall I bear it ?
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 21]: I was so happy , so content ; I wanted nothing but Robert , and then _ this _ came .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 26]: I had never been ill before -- it was dreadful to be ill , but I looked forward : you know how I looked forward .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 17]: I thought and thought ; it seemed at last as if one thought of nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 21]: It grew so real , so near ; it filled one 's heart , and then -- _ nothing _ !
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 6]: nothing but pain and loss .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 20]: You do n't understand ; you ca n't guess the horror of it -- the baffled , incredible horror .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 8]: You 'll never know it , Vanna .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 5]: Thank God for that !
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 19]: When you grieve because you can never marry , remember this day , and what you have escaped .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 10]: My little son , that I shall never see !
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 9]: What can you say to me , Vanna ?
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 9]: What can you say to comfort me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 4]: `` Nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 3]: said Vanna .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 4]: `` Nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 35]: She raised her tear-stained face , and laid it beside Jean 's on the pillow , and at that touch , at the sound of the broken voice , the hard composure broke down .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 23]: Jean trembled , gasped , and clinging tightly to the outstretched arms , sobbed out her heart in a paroxysm of grief .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 40]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An hour later Robert was again summoned to the sick-room ; but this time it was by Jean 's request , and when he entered she stretched out her hand towards him , and pitifully endeavoured to smile .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 4]: `` Poor darling !
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 7]: I 'm sorry I was unkind .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 13]: I will try , I _ will _ try to be good !
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 6]: I am calmer now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 6]: `` Vanna helped you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 3]: Jean nodded .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 14]: Robert sat gazing at her , his eyes wistful , like his voice .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 20]: It was not jealousy which he felt , nor anger , nor impatience -- but simplest , saddest humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 8]: He had failed and Vanna had succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 14]: With all his soul he longed to find the secret of her power .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 9]: `` How did she help you , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 6]: What did she say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 3]: `` Nothing !
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 3]: She cried .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 8]: The tears rolled down her face . ''
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 20]: Robert sat silent , holding his wife 's hand , and striving , hopelessly , pitifully , to understand .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 3]: LIFE WORK .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 37]: After the first few weeks were over Jean recovered her strength more quickly than had been expected , and by the end of the second month was able to take her usual place in the household .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 47]: One of the first things which she had done after being pronounced convalescent was to fold away with her own hands all the tiny garments which had been prepared with such joy , and to cover the dainty new furnishings of the nursery with careful wrappings .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 32]: This done , the key was turned in the lock , and henceforward there was a ghost-chamber in the house -- a chamber haunted by the ghost of a dead hope .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 53]: Jean spoke but little of her loss -- the wound went too deep for words ; and as time went on some of the old interest in life began to revive , aided by the joys of recovered health , and of Robert 's devotion , if possible more ardent than before .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 18]: Nevertheless no one could look upon her without realising the change wrought by the last few months .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 49]: She had been a merry , thoughtless girl , to whom grief and pain were but abstract words conveying no definite impression : now the great revelation had come , anguish of body , anguish of soul , and she emerged from the shadows , sobered and thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 7]: `` What women have to suffer !
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 7]: The thought of it haunts me .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 40]: I ca n't get away from it , '' she said to Vanna one afternoon as they sat together in the autumn gloaming , enjoying that quiet _ tete-a-tete _ which was the most intimate moment of the day .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 16]: `` I walk along the streets staring at the women I meet , and marvel !
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 36]: There they are -- thousands of them , British matrons , plain , ordinary , commonplace creatures with dolmans , and bonnets far back on their heads , each with a family of -- what ?
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 12]: four , six , eight , sometimes _ ten _ children !
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 40]: For years and years of their lives they have been chronic invalids , goaded on by the precepts that it is ` only natural , ' and that they have no right to shirk their work on that account .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 13]: The courage of them , and the patience , and the humility !
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 11]: They never seem to consider that they deserve any praise .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 55]: If they read in the newspaper of a soldier who saved a life in the rush and excitement of battle , and was wounded in the act , they rave of him by the hour together ; but if you offered _ them _ the Victoria Cross , they would think you were mad !
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 19]: Yet every life given to the world means nearly a year of suffering for some poor mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 4]: Vanna was silent .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 57]: It was inevitable that in her position she should see the other side of the question , and feel that a year would be a light price to pay for the joy of holding Piers 's son in her arms ; but Jean had lost that great recompense which wipes away the remembrance of the anguish .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 8]: Her heart was still hungry and sore .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 18]: Having no words of comfort to offer , Vanna deftly turned the conversation to a safer channel .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 20]: `` Apropos of suffering , Jean , I have been waiting to talk to you about my own plans .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 18]: I 've been here over four months , dear , and it 's time I moved on .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 17]: I told you I had a plan in my head which was slowly working itself out .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 10]: at last , I think I can see daylight .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 19]: I have my life to live , and I ca n't be content just to fritter it away .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 16]: I must find something that is worth doing , and which will justify my existence .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 21]: I 've thought of many things , but it always comes back to nursing as the likeliest and most suitable .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 19]: For the last four years that 's been my work , and I know I did it well .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 13]: Every doctor I have met told me I was a born nurse .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 18]: One Sunday when you were ill I went to Dr Greatman , and had a long talk .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 7]: He had asked me to go .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 48]: I told him what I wanted -- technical training to add to what I had learnt by experience , and then when I was properly equipped to _ give _ my services to poor gentlewomen who could not afford to pay to be properly cared for . ''
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 4]: `` A nurse !
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 4]: A hospital nurse !
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 5]: _ You _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 8]: Jean 's tone was eloquent with dismay .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 23]: The day of lady nurses was but in its dawn , and public opinion had yet to be reconciled to the thought .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 11]: `` Vanna , you could not stand the everlasting strain .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 13]: And you spoke of a home , a house of your own !
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 17]: If you were at the hospital -- '' `` Let me finish my story , dear .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 6]: Do n't interrupt half through .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 8]: Dr Greatman was most kind and understanding .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 28]: I think in a kind of way he feels that he owes me some compensation , as it was he who laid the bar on my life .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 18]: I took him letters from the doctors who know me , giving my character as professional nurse .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 7]: They were rather nice , Jean .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 24]: I was proud of them , and Dr Greatman said he wished he could speak as highly of many of his certificated nurses .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 16]: He advises me to take a two years ' course of training at a hospital .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 52]: I should have to ` live in , ' and give up all my time ; but as soon as the two years are over I will look out for a house and a sheep dog , and gather together my treasures to make a real little home of my own .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 10]: You shall help me to arrange it , Jean !
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 29]: It shall be in town , as near to you as rents will allow , in a quiet street , with at least two spare rooms facing south .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 12]: Then I shall be ready for work as it comes along .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 57]: Sometimes I shall go to a patient 's house , and nurse her there ; sometimes -- if her own house is unsuitable , or if she is a poor governess , or a worker who has n't got a home -- I 'll take her in , and look after her in my own rooms .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 14]: At other times I 'll have convalescents who want kitchen food and kindness .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 28]: Sometimes I 'll have guests -- poor , dull drones who are suffering from all work and no play , and dose them with kindness and amusement .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 22]: Then I shall fed of some use , and that my house is doing good to other people besides myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 33]: `` They 'll sponge upon you , and tire you out , and take everything they can get , and then go away , and slander you behind your back . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 5]: _ Tant pis _ !
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 26]: Let 's hope they 'll do it sufficiently far away to let me continue in my blissful delusion that I 've done some good . ''
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 8]: `` You 'll get sick of it .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 19]: It 's no use pretending ; you were as fond of gaiety and amusement as I was myself .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 9]: You 'll get sick of everlasting invalids . ''
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 21]: `` Then I 'll take a spell off , and do nothing , and be as selfish as I please .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 5]: I 'm not bound .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 18]: If a roving fit seizes me I can shut up house and go off on my travels .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 13]: I do n't intend to spend all my life in a rut .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 13]: I 'm a poor gentlewoman myself , and need my own medicine .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 31]: Do n't imagine that I 'm tying myself down to continual drudgery , for I 'm not ; but I must , I must have an object in life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 17]: `` And for two whole years you propose to shut yourself up in a hospital ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 26]: `` I do ; with the exception of an afternoon a week , a day a fortnight , and three weeks ' annual holiday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 11]: `` May I ask what Piers has to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 9]: Vanna 's smile was both whimsical and pathetic .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 10]: `` You may ; but I sha n't answer .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 29]: Several volumes of very strong language , poor dear man ; but he knows -- at the bottom of his heart he knows that I am right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 24]: Not even to Jean could Vanna confess that her plans for the future had a nearer and more personal object than mere philanthropy .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 5]: The conservation of love !
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 12]: This was the great problem with which she struggled in secret .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 35]: Her clear , far-sighted brain realised the truth , despised by most lovers , that love is a plant which needs careful and assiduous tending if it is to live and retain its bloom .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 56]: Kindred interests , kindred hopes , kindred efforts and aims -- these are the foods by which it is nourished in happy home-life ; but if these be wanting -- if instead of the hill tops there stretches ahead a long flat plain , what then can nourish the plant and guard it from decay ?
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 34]: Piers had sworn that his troth should not bind him if his heart grew tired ; but , having received that promise , Vanna never again allowed herself to allude to the subject .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 20]: Her woman 's instinct taught her that no good could come of continually putting such a possibility into words .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 26]: She must write , act , speak , as if the eternity of the love between them was beyond doubt -- fixed as the hills .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 26]: What precautions seemed advisable to keep it so she must take upon herself , and with as slight an appearance of intention as might be .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 32]: Piers might rage and fume at the prospect of her years in hospital , but she knew that the scarcity of their meetings would be a gain rather than a loss .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 36]: Once a week they would meet for a few hours ; once a fortnight there would come a long happy day , which would make an epoch to be anticipated and remembered with tenderest thought .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 28]: Better so than to run the risk of satiety , and the hastening of that day when the dread question might arise : `` What next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 46]: This conviction , deeply rooted in Vanna 's mind , made her strong to resist all arguments and reproaches , and the end of the year found her established as a nurse at one of the largest and most advanced of the great London hospitals .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 4]: AFTER FIVE YEARS .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 21]: Five years later Vanna Strangeways and Piers Rendall were taking tea with Robert and Jean Gloucester in their London home .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 34]: Those years of busy living had left their trace on all four friends ; but , as is usually the case , these changes were most marked on the faces of the women .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 41]: A man of forty is almost invariably handsomer than the same man at the age of twenty-five ; but though a woman may gain in expression , the delicate bloom of youth is a charm which can never be replaced .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 21]: Jean Gloucester would always be beautiful , but already in her thirtieth year she wore a worn and fragile air .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 17]: The two children who now occupied the nursery upstairs had made heavy demands on her strength .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 21]: Jean was one of the women who , though naturally robust , seem totally unfitted for the strain of child-bearing .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 77]: Her figure was slight almost to emaciation , and her cheeks had lost their bloom , but she was still a picture fascinating to the eye as she leant back against the cushions of the sofa -- bright rose-coloured cushions , newly covered to show off the beauty of a wonderful grey gown made in the long flowing folds which she affected , and which were in striking contrast to the inartistic dresses of the period .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 14]: In whatever direction Jean economised it was never in dress or household decorations .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 17]: She was one of the women in whom the beauty instinct takes precedence above other tastes .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 48]: If it had been her lot to live in a garret on ten shillings a week she would have deprived herself of food until she had saved enough money to paper the walls with a harmonious colour , and to buy a strip of curtaining to match .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 26]: To purchase a prosaic garment for five pounds , when an artistic one could be procured for ten , was to her practically an impossibility .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 17]: She stifled any pangs of conscience by arguing that the outlay was economical in the end .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 33]: Good things wore longer , one did not grow wearied of them as of cheaper designs ; and , to do her justice , these theories were invariably supported by her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 45]: His wife 's beauty was a continual joy to Robert Gloucester , and he took a boyish delight in the moments when , walking by her side , he encountered chance City friends , and watched the first casual glance brighten into surprised admiration .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 39]: It appeared to him but another instance of Jean 's surprising cleverness that she always `` hit upon such stunning clothes , '' and he pitied from his heart the poor fellows who possessed dull , dowdy wives .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 24]: Jean looked like a queen beside them ; but a queen is an expensive luxury in the home of a struggling business man .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 42]: The process of `` selling out a share or two '' had been resorted to several times in the course of the last few years , and Robert had begun to lie awake at nights , pondering uneasily about the future .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 42]: The lines in his forehead had deepened into furrows , but his eyes were clear and bright as ever ; he moved in the same quick , alert fashion , and his laugh rang full and joyous as a boy 's .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 24]: Piers Rendall 's dark hair had turned grey -- a curious dark shade of grey which gave an effect of _ poudre _ .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 21]: The change gave an added distinction to his appearance , and showed the dark eyes and eyebrows in striking contrast .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 20]: He was thin , however , and the nervous twitching of the features was more frequent than of old .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 30]: As for Vanna , what attractions she possessed had never been of the golden-haired , pink-cheeked category , and there was consequently little change visible at a casual glance .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 33]: She was prettily dressed in a soft blue gown , and the stag-like setting of the head , the arched black brows , and the delicate oval of the face were untouched .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 36]: Love and work had filled her life , and her expression was both sweet and strong ; but there were new lines written on her face -- lines whose secret no one knew but herself .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 17]: All these years Vanna had been fighting a battle -- a battle against self and fate .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 41]: When at the end of her hospital course _ she _ had settled down in her own house , Piers had been hotly indignant at discovering that the same embargo as of old was to be laid against his visits .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 5]: One night a week !
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 5]: The thing was preposterous .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 30]: He had given way to her wishes , had been patient and self-sacrificing , more patient than ninety-nine men out of a hundred would have been under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 48]: He had waited , marking off the months as they passed , counting on the future to reward him for his abstinence , and now was she going to put him off again , to forbid him the house , to treat him like a common acquaintance ?
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 9]: He stormed and argued , Vanna stood firm .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 26]: They parted for the first time in coldness and anger , but the next day Piers took back his words , and begged for forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 11]: `` You may be right , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 15]: Women are so confoundedly calm and reasoning ; but it 's hard , Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 31]: If you knew how I long for you -- what a lost , aimless wretch I feel hanging about , knowing that you are alone -- a few streets off !
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 21]: It was easier when you were shut up in hospital and I could n't get to you ; but now !
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 7]: Sometimes it drives me half mad .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 9]: You ca n't blame me for flaring out .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 14]: It 's because I love you , darling -- love you so wildly .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 10]: You would n't have me love you less ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 6]: a thousand times no . ''
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 10]: Yet no persuasion could move Vanna from her point .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 32]: On that one evening a week she was all that the most ardent lover could desire ; with every power she possessed she strove to secure the perfection of that hour .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 51]: Piers 's favourite dishes appeared at dinner ; his favourite flowers decked the rooms ; she rested during the day , so as to be at her best and brightest in the evening , dressed herself in his favourite colours , lavished love upon him in generous , unstinted flow .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 30]: Every evening he left her aglow with love , chafing at the thought of the time which must elapse before their next meeting , breathing out threats of rebellion .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 43]: Now and again he did indeed break through the rule , making an excuse of an opportunity to take Vanna to some special entertainment ; but these occasions had the excitement of stolen pleasures , and were not allowed to become common .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 39]: Sometimes when Piers was visited by one of his black fits of depression ; when she realised that these fits grew more frequent with each year as it passed , Vanna knew a terrible sinking of the heart .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 33]: But she strove valiantly to disguise it even from herself , for she realised that for her wisdom lay in living in the present and resolutely shutting her eyes to the future .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 20]: Piers also she strove to inoculate with this doctrine , forcing him to see outside reasons for his depression .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 21]: `` Our love is more perfect , we mean more to each other than nine out of ten married couples .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 13]: If we have not their joys , we are spared their griefs .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 9]: Dearest , is any human being really content ?
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 9]: Is he _ meant _ to be content ?
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 34]: The animals are peaceful and satisfied to browse , and eat , and lie down and sleep ; they are in their rightful environment , but we as spiritual beings are wandering adrift .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 19]: The divine spark within is eternally urging us on , further , higher -- casting aside the baubles .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 11]: It is not a fault ; it 's a birthright .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 12]: We can be patient , but never , never content . ''
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 7]: `` Robert -- '' `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 27]: He has Jean , and she has his heart , but he wants her to be stronger ; he wants to be richer for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 12]: He craves for the perfection which he can never know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 36]: But it was hard to be always strong , to be compelled to reason and argue , and fight down self , instead of claiming her woman 's privilege of being cared for and protected .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 34]: There were hours when Vanna would have given all she possessed to break down and cry her heart out in Piers 's arms ; but it was an indulgence she dared not claim .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 21]: A fuller knowledge of her lover 's character had shown that his powers of endurance were less than her own .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 23]: He would have been all tenderness and compassion , but she would have paid for that hour by weeks of heavy depression .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 9]: So Vanna fought on , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 38]: In one respect her circumstances were happier than her lover 's ; for while Piers 's interest in business was of the perfunctory order of the already rich man , her own work was a continual delight .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 24]: From time to time she visited a patient , but by far the greater number came to her to be housed and tended .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 51]: They were a pathetic crowd ; middle-aged and elderly women of gentle birth , worn out with the struggle of life , shrinking with terror from bodily illness , not because of the suffering involved , but from the fear of loss of employment and subsequent want which it involved .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 26]: To be nursed , housed , and fed free of charge was a godsend indeed , and Jean 's prophecy of ingratitude was rarely fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 36]: Sometimes , indeed , Vanna felt that ingratitude would have been easier to bear than the trembling blessings called down on her head by those poor souls for whom perforce she could do so little .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 42]: She grew to dread the last few days of a visit , to shrink afore-hand from the pitiful glances which the departing guest would cast around the pretty , cosy rooms , as if storing up memories to brighten barren days .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 30]: Her charity had the sting of all such work , the inability to do more ; but in it she found interest and occupation , and a continual object-lesson .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 33]: These poor waifs and strays , who were thankful for a few weeks ' haven , would think themselves rich beyond measure if they owned one half the blessings she herself possessed .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 8]: Ought she not to be grateful too ?
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 17]: On this autumn afternoon Jean had an exciting piece of news to tell to her visitors .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 6]: `` Guess who is engaged !
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 14]: Some one you know -- know very well : an intimate friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 6]: `` Fine or superfine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 12]: `` Both , of course ; but you know her best .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 5]: A very old friend .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 19]: Near here -- '' `` Do n't tell , Jean ; do n't be in such a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 27]: Let them guess , '' cried Robert , laughing ; but already Vanna was gasping in incredulous tones : '' _ Not _ Edith Morton ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 3]: Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 10]: Jean clapped her hands with her old childlike abandon .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 6]: `` Is n't it lovely ?
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 5]: Are n't you pleased ?
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 9]: She came round last night to tell me .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 4]: To Mr Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 12]: She has seen a lot of him at their literary society .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 18]: He is a clever man ; every one speaks highly of him , and he is rich .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 13]: It 's all as charming as possible , and most suitable . ''
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 3]: Mr Mortimer !
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 27]: Vanna knitted her brows , recalling a grave , middle-aged figure , and striving to imagine him in the new role of Edith Morton 's lover .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 73]: Edith had sailed for Canada shortly after Jean 's marriage to pay a visit to a married sister , and had returned at the end of two years , apparently heart-whole ; but Vanna knew that her life had been empty of interest , and feared lest the attraction of a home of her own and a definite place in the world might have induced her to give her promise without love .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 4]: `` Mr Mortimer !
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 14]: He is a fine man ; I like him -- but for Edith ?
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 9]: He seems so old , so settled down .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 9]: I never dreamt of his getting engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 3]: `` Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 8]: He is forty-five and she is thirty-two .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 3]: Very suitable .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 9]: A woman ages more quickly than a man .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 37]: He will look years younger with a wife to smarten him up ; and they are as much in love as if they were twenty ; beaming , both of them -- the picture of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 9]: The wedding is to be almost at once .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 17]: He says they have waited long enough , and ca n't afford to waste another day .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 26]: I should n't wonder if they rushed it through in six weeks , and took a furnished house till they had time to look round .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 6]: Much the best plan . ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 4]: `` Much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 4]: agreed Vanna quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 41]: Jean 's impetuous speech often planted a dart of which she was the first to repent ; but as she would ruefully confess to Robert , it was so difficult to think of Vanna and Piers as an engaged couple .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 30]: They were so much more like a settled-down , married couple , living on quietly from day to day , taking life as it came , making no plans .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 22]: It was only when she saw the shadow fall on the faces of the two listeners that she realised her mistake .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 12]: She sprang to her feet and pulled loudly at the bell .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 7]: `` We 'll have the children !
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 11]: Lorna would never forgive me if I let you go .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 16]: Babs looks too sweet in her new frock ... '' `` Just for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 7]: I must be taking Vanna home .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 14]: It 's damp , and I ca n't let her risk cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 17]: Piers spoke hastily , and rose to his feet as if in preparation for saying adieu .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 30]: Jean 's children were dainty little creatures , to whom he and Vanna were truly attached ; but each shrank from seeing them in the presence of the other .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 41]: The family group of the lovely mother , with her golden-haired babies , the proud , happy father , was so perfect , so complete , that less happy mortals looking on might well be excused a stab of envy .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 25]: Vanna and Piers each knew the pang of the childless , which was doubled in intensity in the knowledge of the other 's suffering .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 11]: The two little girls entered the room side by side .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 37]: Their sex had been a grievous disappointment to Jean , who had the overpowering desire for a son which possesses many women ; but the little maids were pretty and charming enough to satisfy any parent .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 29]: Lorna , dark , glowing , with her mother 's wonderful eyes ; the baby Joyce , a delicious fat ball crowned with a mop of yellow curls .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 29]: They were delightfully free from shyness , and greeted the two visitors with sweet , moist kisses , and `` bears ' hugs '' from tiny white arms .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 47]: Vanna took Joyce on her knee and tried bravely to talk baby-talk , and keep her eyes averted from Piers 's lowering face ; but at the end of ten minutes she gave up the struggle , made her farewells and followed him into the street .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 31]: It was a dark , misty evening -- one of those evenings when the cold penetrates to the marrow , and the great city is at its worst and dreariest .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 36]: Piers turned up the collar of his coat , so that Vanna could see little of his face ; but his walk , his bearing , the forward droop of his head were painfully eloquent .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 44]: During the whole of the ten minutes ' walk he did not speak a word , but Vanna knew that when they were alone in her own quiet room the floodgates would open , and trembled at the thought of yet another scene .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 42]: When the door was opened she went straight to her bedroom , lingering purposely over her toilette , in the hope that Piers would have time to calm down , and remember his resolution made so ardently after each fresh outburst .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 24]: Of what avail to rail against fate , when the effort could only revert on one 's own head in weariness and remorse ?
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 15]: Was it not he who had first preached the beauty of a spiritual love ?
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 27]: This was the view on which she must lay fullest stress to-night , this the pure and lofty ideal to which she must raise his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 43]: And then Vanna -- a woman through and through -- stood another five minutes before the glass , carefully bestowing those little touches to her toilette which would add to her physical charm , and evoke Piers 's admiration to the uttermost .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 10]: He was pacing the room from end to end .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 26]: The sound of his footsteps reached her ears before the door opened , and the moment she appeared he came towards her with outstretched arms .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 3]: `` Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 4]: this must end .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 4]: It is unsupportable .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 8]: We can not endure it any longer .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 9]: Why can every one be happy except us ?
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 7]: Edith Morton married in six weeks !
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 15]: Good God , and we have waited five years ; may wait for ever .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 28]: To hear Jean prattling of its being so wise , so sensible , and you agreeing in a calm , even voice -- it drove me wild !
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 10]: There are some things a man can not stand .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 11]: I have come to the end of my tether . ''
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 16]: Vanna stood like a statue , eyes cast down , hands clenched by her sides .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 18]: this was not one of the scenes to which she was accustomed ; this was something more .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 23]: There was a note in Piers 's voice which she had not heard before -- a note of determination , of finality .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 11]: Within her soul she heard the knell of the end .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 13]: `` Vanna , you must feel for yourself that things are impossible .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 4]: We must marry .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 5]: We must risk all .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 7]: This farce can not go on .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 11]: We have done our best , and we have failed .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 18]: Nothing that could happen could be worse than to go on through the years wasting our lives .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 11]: We must take our risks , and face them together .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 5]: We must marry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 25]: To the last day of her life Vanna never ceased to marvel at her own courage and calmness at this moment of supreme temptation .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 28]: A hundred times over she had tremblingly acknowledged to herself that if Piers made a violent attack upon her determination she could not answer for the result .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 36]: The temptation to consent , to gain happiness at whatever cost , would be so immense that continued resistance would be next to impossible ; but at this moment there was no feeling of temptation .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 35]: The steady , persistent effort of years finds its reward in these crises of life -- in a strength of character , a stiffening of the mental muscles , which changes tumult into calm .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 29]: Vanna ceased to tremble ; she stood motionless before her lover , oblivious of his outstretched arms , her whole being projected into the thought of the future .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 32]: It was as if on a darkened night a sudden flash of light had been vouchsafed , by which the landscape was revealed , with the pitfalls yawning at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 71]: A tranquil , trustful soul like Robert Gloucester might have taken on himself the burden of her life , and have come unscathed through the ordeal -- calm himself , calm in his influence , a true doctor in the home ; but Piers , by reason of those very qualities which endeared him to her woman 's heart , was the last man on earth to support the strain .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 20]: His fear , his anxiety , though expressed in tenderest devotion , must inevitably act and react on both .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 30]: At this moment the great question appealed to her woman 's heart less in its abstract than in the personal form , as affecting the happiness of the beloved .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 36]: Whatever he might feel at this moment of stress and passion , it could not be for Piers Rendall 's ultimate happiness to marry a woman over whom hung the deep cloud of inherited madness .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 12]: His aim accomplished , joy would be speedily eclipsed in dread .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 20]: In imagination she could see his haggard looks , feel the dark eyes brooding over her with fearful care .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 7]: So far he had been free .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 17]: If the chains fretted too sorely he had only to drop them , and go forth .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 11]: How would he bear it if there were no escape ?
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 11]: How could _ she _ bear it for his sake ?
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 13]: Vanna lifted her head and looked deep into her lover 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 12]: Her voice was clear and steady : `` No , Piers !
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 6]: I will never marry you .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 8]: Never , to the end of time .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 7]: But I will not bind you .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 10]: You are quite free -- '' `` Free ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 11]: He turned from her with a loud , harsh laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 10]: `` Good God , how you quibble with words !
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 18]: I have loved you , I have given you my life -- how can I be free ?
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 10]: What have I left if you cast me off ?
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 7]: What have _ you _ left ?
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 9]: How can you insult me with such words ?
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 10]: How can you be so cold , so cruel ?
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 5]: Women have no hearts .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 20]: They do n't know what it is to love -- '' The wild words flowed on in breathless torrent .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 24]: Then suddenly came the collapse : he turned towards her , met the glance of her piteous eyes , and melted into remorse .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 10]: `` My poor Vanna , I am hurting you .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 5]: Forgive me , darling !
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 20]: I am a brute , a selfish brute ; I am half mad myself ... Oh , this world !
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 7]: what a hell it can be !
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 11]: What have we done to be cursed and set aside ?
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 6]: It is cruel -- unjust .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 13]: If we can never marry , why did we ever meet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 4]: Vanna shivered . ''
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 9]: _ Why did we ever meet _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 9]: Was it Piers who had spoken those words ?
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 24]: -- Piers , who had declared that to love her was a higher joy than to be the husband of any other woman !
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 10]: Once again the knell-like bell tolled in her ears .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 20]: It was almost a relief when , after a few more incoherent words , Piers suddenly turned to depart .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 6]: `` I wo n't stay .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 5]: I am hurting you .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 13]: I 'll go now , and come back when I am calm .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 40]: You 'll be better alone -- '' For the first time in five years he left her without a kiss or a caress , and Vanna sat , stunned and motionless , gazing on the ruins of her life .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 9]: No one came near to interrupt her solitude .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 25]: It was a rule that she should be uninterrupted when Piers was present , and his departure had apparently passed unnoticed by the household .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 18]: A dense , overhanging shadow possessed her spirit , out of which one thought alone was clear .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 4]: Piers was unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 22]: She , who would have sheltered him from every ill , had brought upon him the keenest suffering of his life .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 34]: Two hours later , when Piers himself opened the door , he found Vanna in practically the same attitude in which he had left her , crouched in the corner of the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 21]: The fire had died out in the grate , and the air of the little room struck bleak and chill .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 29]: The face turned towards him had the delicacy of an etching , the dark brows arched above the deep-set eyes , the finely moulded cheeks white and wan .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 27]: Unlike most women , Vanna 's attraction was distinct from colour ; she looked her best , not her worst , in minutes of mental strain .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 23]: Piers closed the door , approached her hastily , and , taking her hands in his , drew her to his side .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 42]: He spoke but two words , but they were prompted by the force which is the greatest diviner of the needs of the human heart , and the whole wealth of the language could not have added to their eloquence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 6]: _ My Joy _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 27]: he said , in that deep , full voice which Vanna had heard but once or twice before , in the great moments of their love .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 17]: They wept , and clung together , and Vanna 's hungry heart found comfort once more .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 17]: After all , would she have been more content if Piers had _ not _ rebelled ?
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 2]: PARTED .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 8]: The next year passed slowly and heavily .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 30]: In the spring Jean had an illness which made it necessary for her to spend several months on the sofa -- a decree which she accepted with extraordinary resignation .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 30]: Nothing could have demonstrated so powerfully the change which the last seven years had wrought in her physical condition as this willingness to be shut off from social life .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 47]: `` I 've been so tired , '' she confided in Vanna , letting her head fall back on the pillow , and closing her eyes with a long-drawn sigh , `` so tired , that it 's been a struggle to get through each day .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 15]: It 's bliss to be lazy , and to feel that one is justified .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 24]: When I wake up in the morning and remember that I need n't get up for breakfast , I could whoop with joy .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 7]: The doctor expected me to rebel .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 2]: Goodness !
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 66]: I wonder how many thousand tired women would hail such a prescription -- to lie in bed until eleven ; dress quietly , and go down to the sofa ; read amusing books ; have a friend to tea ; sleep again , to be fresh for the husband 's return ; to bed at nine ; and _ you must not be worried _ !
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 9]: My dear , it 's Heaven begun below !
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 38]: I do n't say I should like it as a permanency , but as a change from general servants ' work -LRB- which is plain English for a middle-class wife and mother -RRB- it is highly refreshing .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 12]: We 'll have to get an extra maid , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 25]: I 've worked like a slave to keep the house as it must be kept if I 'm to have any peace in life .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 47]: We have such heaps of silver and in town it needs constant cleaning , and the mending is everlasting , and the making for the children , _ and _ the shopping , and helping in the nursery to set nurse free to do some washing .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 16]: The laundry bills are ruinous ; but you _ must _ have children in white !
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 9]: It 's a nuisance having to spend more .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 8]: It always happens like that with us .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 34]: Just as we say , ` the next quarter must be lighter ; we shall need nothing new , ' bang comes another big drain , and sends us back farther than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 7]: Money _ is _ a trial !
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 18]: You do n't half realise how much you are saved by having a comfortable income , Vanna .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 18]: That 's a _ big _ blessing , and you ought to be thankful for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 3]: Vanna considered .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 6]: she was not actively thankful .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 59]: When at any special moment the subject was brought before her , she could indeed realise the benefit of a sufficiency of money , which enabled her to choose and carry on the work which was most congenial ; but as a rule the accustomed good was calmly taken for granted , and brought no feeling of joy .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 17]: She made a mental note , and passed on to the consideration of Jean 's problem .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 16]: `` Could n't you contrive to reduce work while you are laid up , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 19]: Lock up all the silver that is not absolutely needed , and let the children wear coloured overalls .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 21]: I 'd make them for you , of a pretty , becoming blue , which would save half their washing .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 9]: You might shut up the drawing-room , too .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 14]: You ca n't entertain , and you are comfier here in the den .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 12]: It would be so nice if you could avoid extra help .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 11]: Another servant in the house would be a trial . ''
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 8]: But Jean only smiled with indulgent patronage .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 12]: `` Oh , my dear , I ca n't upset everything .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 17]: And I shall need some one to wait upon me , and run up and down .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 18]: It would be very poor economy to save a few pounds , and be worried to death .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 21]: You have no idea how difficult it is to get any rest when you are the mother of a family .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 18]: One day -- I 've often intended to tell you about this , and make you laugh !
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 42]: -- you know how you have told me how lonely and sad you feel when _ you _ are ill , and lie all day alone in your room , never seeing a soul except when your meals are brought up .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 19]: _ Well _ , at the beginning of this attack I awoke one morning with a crashing headache .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 17]: I struggled up , hoping it would go off after breakfast , but it grew worse .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 21]: Robert brought me in here and tucked me up on the sofa , and ordered a ` quiet day . '
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 27]: He said it was such a comfort to think that I _ could _ be quiet , and need do nothing but lie still and rest .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 21]: He could not have borne to go away and leave me ill if he had not been sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 5]: Dear , blind bat !
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 15]: He had not been gone five minutes when cook arrived for ` orders . '
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 20]: There was nothing in the house except the bit of mutton , and she thought that was going bad .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 8]: Would I like to look at it ?
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 20]: She stood there gazing before her in that calm , detached way they have -- it is so maddening !
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 45]: -- never making one single suggestion , while I wrestled with it all -- children 's dinner , kitchen dinner , dining-room dinner , kitchen supper , to-morrow 's breakfast ... I was so worn out that I forgot all about my own lunch .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 4]: So did she !
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 54]: After she went it took about ten minutes before the horrible throbbing in my head calmed down to what it had been before , and by that time nurse appeared to say that Joyce had some spots on her chest , and did I think it was wise for her to go out ?
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 16]: Would I be able to keep her for an hour while she promenaded with Lorna ?
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 11]: Lorna got so fratchety if she was in all day .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 5]: I investigated the spots .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 30]: I sent for the doctor , and said they were _ all _ to stay in , and nurse was cross , and slammed the doors all day long .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 36]: I lay down again , and sniffed smelling-salts , till cook came back to say the fishman was very sorry , but he _ had _ no smelts , and what would I have instead ?
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 21]: After that I slept for a good quarter of an hour , till a parcel arrived with tenpence to pay .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 15]: I had only a sovereign in my purse , and no one had change .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 17]: There was nothing for it but to get the keys and go upstairs to my bureau .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 6]: After that the piano-tuner arrived .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 26]: He comes once a quarter , and picks his visits with demoniacal cunning for the very _ worst _ times in the whole three months .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 26]: Mason had n't the sense to send him away , and I did n't know he was there until the awful _ arpeggios _ began .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 53]: Then I worked myself into a fever trying to decide whether I should send him away , whether he would charge twice over if I did , whether it would be bad for the piano , whether he would be long , whether I could bear it if I covered my head .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 32]: At last the strum , strum , on one note began , and I rang and told Mason to send him away at once , and _ she _ was cross .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 29]: Half an hour later some one sent a note with , ` bearer waits reply ' on the envelope , and I had to sit up and write .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 26]: The doctor came at twelve , and said Joyce was perfectly well , but I looked feverish ; could n't I lie down and rest ?
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 38]: I could not look at lunch , which was just as well , as there was none for me , and Joyce fell off her high-chair just over my head , and I thought she was killed .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 20]: She screamed for an age , and I forgot my own head , thinking of hers ; but afterwards !
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 25]: I cried to myself with sheer pain and misery , and I thought of your ` long , solitary day ' with such envy .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 23]: The afternoon was the same story , and when Robert came home he was _ so _ disappointed to find me worse !
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 44]: I did n't tell _ him _ my experiences ; he does n't see the humour of them when they affect me , but I said miserably to myself , ` some day I 'll tell Vanna , and we 'll laugh . '
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 15]: Dear me , what a comfort it is to have a woman friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 6]: Vanna smiled at her affectionately .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 40]: It was good to hear Jean rattle away in her old racy fashion , but her skilled eye was quick to note the signs of fragility in the lovely face , which paled and flushed with such suspicious rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 23]: `` I think Sister Vanna had better apply for the vacant ` place , ' and take possession until you are strong .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 11]: Would you like to have me with you , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 39]: We have been having rather a strenuous time lately , and when the present inmates leave at the end of this week , I should be quite glad to shut the house and give the staff a rest .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 26]: It 's a poor thing if I give my life to nursing , and ca n't wait upon my one friend when she needs me .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 8]: Would you like to have me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 34]: Needless to say , Jean was enchanted at the prospect ; so was Robert when he returned at the close of the day ; so also , more inexplicably , was Piers himself .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 52]: Vanna had been prepared for expostulations against a proposal which would leave her less free for his visits , but none came , and their absence added to the dull weight of oppression which had hung over her ever since the evening when she had heard of Edith Morton 's engagement .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 35]: Try as she would to live in the present , and avoid vain imaginings , she could not blind herself to a certain change in Piers , which seemed to increase rather than diminish .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 39]: It was not a lessening of love ; never had she known him more devoted , more passionately her own ; but in his tenderness was an element of sorrow , of self-reproach , which chilled her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 6]: Piers was sorry for her !
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 17]: Some thing was working in his mind , the knowledge of which must give her pain .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 5]: What could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 30]: The revelation came one evening after she had been located for some weeks in the Gloucester _ menage _ , and for all her forebodings , found her unprepared .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 11]: `` Vanna , I have something to tell you to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 11]: I have been trying to say it for some time .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 8]: Darling , can you be brave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 6]: Vanna looked at him sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 25]: They were sitting together on a sofa drawn up before the fire , and the kindly glow hid the sudden whitening of her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 19]: She leant back against the pillows , feeling faint and sick with the rapid beating of her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 7]: `` Not -- very , Piers !
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 4]: Tell me quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 5]: Do n't wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 9]: `` Vanna , I 'm going abroad . ''
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 6]: Her eyes dilated with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 8]: This was not what she had expected .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 14]: Compared with the greater dread , the announcement came almost as a relief .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 17]: She struggled with the oppression in her throat and breathed a breathless , `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 4]: `` To India .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 5]: I have a chance .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 7]: A junior partner is invalided home .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 10]: I can take his place for a few years .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 12]: It is the best thing -- I am sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 8]: I have made up my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 16]: `` Is it because you are -- _ tired _ of me , Piers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 8]: He turned upon her in passionate protest .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 3]: `` Tired ?
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 24]: Heaven knows I am tired ; tired to the soul of waiting for the woman I love ; of eternal fighting against self !
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 8]: It 's more than I can bear .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 13]: I ca n't go on without some change , some break . ''
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 11]: `` You would find it easier to leave me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 13]: He hesitated , shrinking , then braced himself to a painful effort .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 5]: it would be easier .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 11]: You think me brutal , but I am a man .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 7]: I can not endure this life .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 12]: If you can not be my wife , I must go .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 24]: It is hard to part , but it will help us both , and after a year or two we can begin afresh .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 8]: I have been trying to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 20]: I was thankful to know you were to be here , with Jean , for I must sail soon .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 6]: In a few weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 25]: Vanna had a sudden rending remembrance of the moment when she sat in Dr Greatman 's consulting-room , and heard her life laid waste .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 29]: Now , as then , she felt no disposition to weep or lament ; the fountains of her heart were frozen , and she was numb with pain .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 7]: `` Yes ; I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 8]: The best time for the Red Sea .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 15]: You must avoid the heat ... You will enjoy the voyage , Piers . ''
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 9]: Her frozen calm was more piteous than tears .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 11]: Piers groaned , and buried his face in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 7]: `` Oh , Vanna , Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 6]: my poor , poor darling !
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 7]: What must you think of me ?
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 37]: I have failed you after all my vows ; and yet , God knows , it is _ because _ I love you , because my love is stronger than myself , that I must go !
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 12]: You will never understand , but ca n't you believe me ?
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 8]: Ca n't you trust me still ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 9]: `` I know you love me , Piers .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 11]: Will you write to me when you are away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 5]: `` Will I write ?
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 6]: Do you need to ask ?
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 7]: I shall live for your letters .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 26]: There will be nothing else to look for but their arrival , and being able to write back , and tell you all my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 26]: I 'll make a diary for you , dearest ; write something every day , so that each mail shall bring you a small volume .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 27]: We have always maintained that distance could make no difference to our love , but it does this much , darling -- it silences angry words !
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 36]: I have made you miserable with my repinings many times these last years ; but whatever I might feel , I could never endure to send a hard word travelling to you across the world .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 13]: It may be happier for you , darling -- more peaceful . ''
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 9]: She smiled -- a wan , strained smile .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 24]: `` I wo n't try to keep you , Piers , if you want to go , but -- I ca n't pretend !
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 6]: Letters can never make up .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 31]: I have been happy -- happier than I even thought I could be ; but Jean was right , Robert was right -- it has not been fair to you .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 17]: I should not have consented , but I loved you so ; I was so tempted .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 7]: Even now I am not sorry .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 9]: No ; I am _ not _ sorry !
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 43]: Even if I never see you again , I have had these years -- six years of happiness and love , and you are still young , you have your life ahead -- '' He stopped her with his lips on hers .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 13]: `` You do n't meant it , you do n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 8]: Do n't hurt me , my heart !
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 17]: Be generous ; be patient ; and I 'll come back more your own than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 14]: It 's because I love you -- because I love you -- . ''
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 34]: That was the strain which he dinned into her ears -- the one fundamental fact on which all arguments hung ; but Vanna 's sore heart could find in it no solid comfort .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 17]: A love which finds separation easier than loving intercourse is incomprehensible to a woman 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 3]: MARKING TIME .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 7]: Robert and Jean were not surprised .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 15]: That was the fact which , for Vanna , stood out in conspicuous relief .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 47]: They were grieved , sympathetic , unspeakably tender towards her ; but she divined that if they felt any surprise , it was not that Piers had found his present position untenable , but rather that he should have been able to endure it so long .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 49]: That they should feel so , who were her dearest , most admiring friends , planted a sharp stab in Vanna 's heart , yet it was to them that she owed what poor comfort was to be found during the long intolerable weeks before Piers 's departure .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 4]: Jean said little .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 51]: In her own hour of blackness she had discovered the futility of words , but in a hundred quiet , exquisitely tactful ways she forced upon Vanna the importance of what remained : of the place which she occupied in so many lives ; of her own love and need .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 14]: `` You will never know what you have been to me , Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 19]: I have often wanted to tell you ; but it is n't easy to speak of these things .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 19]: I think after one has married and settled down , one needs a woman friend more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 16]: There is so much that even the best and tenderest of men ca n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 9]: You 've been my safety-valve and my prop .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 25]: Multiply my gratitude by the number of all the poor souls whom you have nursed and tended , and you will realise your riches .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 28]: Thoughts _ help _ , Vanna -- I 'm convinced of that -- loving , thankful thoughts going out towards you from all parts of the land .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 22]: It 's impossible that your life should be cold or bald -- '' `` Is it , Jean , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 18]: It sounds very sweet , dear , and very lofty ; but put yourself in my place .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 15]: Would all the gratitude in the world cheer you if Robert went away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 18]: The colour flooded Jean 's face , then slowly ebbed away , leaving her pale and wan .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 9]: `` No , '' she sighed , breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 5]: `` No ; nothing !
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 6]: There would be no comfort .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 8]: He is everything to me -- everything !
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 22]: More , a thousand times more , than when we were married ; but , Vanna , can you believe it ?
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 16]: there have been times during these last years when I have envied _ you _ .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 12]: The balance has n't been _ all _ on my side .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 69]: To be well ; to be strong ; to be able to run about , and plan out one 's life ; to say ` I will do this , I will do that ' ; to shut up house at a day 's notice , shake off responsibilities , and go away for long , lovely rests -- oh , it has seemed so _ good _ !
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 26]: When we were young we took health for granted : one has to be ill to realise how it counts ; how desperately it counts .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 25]: Love is said to triumph over all ; but , Vanna dear , one needs to be well to be able even to love .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 15]: That sounds strange , but it 's true ; there 's no feeling left .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 36]: Often and often I 've longed all day for Robert to come home , and after he has been in the room for five minutes , I 've longed for him to go away again .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 6]: I 've been too tired !
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 22]: Of course every woman does not suffer as I have done ; but then how many have a husband like Robert ?
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 24]: I tell him sometimes that my bad health is the price I 've had to pay for having a saint for my husband .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 13]: If I 'd kept well , it would have been too perfect .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 13]: One does not get everything ... And the children -- little pets !
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 38]: they love me now ; I am a sort of god to them ; all that I do is right ; but sometimes as I hold them a pang goes through my heart ; such a pang !
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 9]: _ I know it wo n't last _ !
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 23]: I shall go on loving them more and more , _ needing _ them more ; but they will grow past me .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 22]: They will make their own lives , their own friends , and I shall retreat farther and farther into the background .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 25]: They will love me still ; I shall be the ` dear old mater ; but they wo n't need me any more . '
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 8]: I wo n't really touch their lives .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 16]: I remember how father loved me , and how I left him without a pang !
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 72]: Is it _ possible _ that he felt as I should do , if Lorna or Joyce ... The young are cruel to the old -- '' Thus Jean , with many tender , loving words ; but Vanna noted with a pang that she never once expressed the belief which alone could have brought comfort -- the belief that Piers would speedily return home , and remain faithful until death .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 12]: The last day came -- a blur of pain and grief .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 86]: Piers spent his last hour alone with Vanna in the den , in which the first happy hours of their engagement had been passed , demanding of her a dozen impossible promises -- that she would stay with Jean until his return , that she would not tire herself , that she would be happy ; and if at times a bitter reply trembled on her lips , she repressed it valiantly , knowing that by so doing she was saving herself an added sting .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 35]: His last words imprinted themselves in her brain , and were sweet to remember : '' ... If I am ever any good in this world or the next , it is your doing .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 19]: You have given me faith , you have given me joy , the revelation of heaven and earth .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 16]: Everything that I have , that is worth possessing , is your gift ... ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 16]: When the door closed behind him -- oh , the knell of that closing door !
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 35]: -- Jean left her friend alone until an hour had passed , and then sent her children as missioners of comfort -- the two dainty little maidens in their sublime innocence of untoward happening .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 46]: Lorna had acquired two new pieces of `` poentry '' -- `` Oh , Mary , go and call the kettle home , '' and `` anozzer one '' called , `` Twice ones is two '' -- which she must needs recite without delay .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 35]: Joyce developed earache , and remembering former help in need , expressed a wailing desire to sleep in `` Wanna 's bed , '' for `` Wan na to _ stwoke _ me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 37]: The little , soft , warm body clinging to her , the touch of the baby lips were unspeakable comfort to Vanna during those long wakeful hours when every moment carried Piers farther and farther away .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 24]: A week later Vanna returned to the hospital where she had been trained , to fill a temporary vacancy for a few months .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 39]: Hard work was her best medicine -- hard , incessant work , which left no time for thought , and sent her to bed so weary that sleep came almost as soon as her head touched the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 19]: A nurse by instinct , it was not in her nature to perform her duties in mechanical fashion .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 36]: The human aspect of a case made a direct appeal to her heart , and , surrounded on every hand by suffering and want , she was forced into a realisation of her own blessings .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 61]: She was alone , but youth , health , and money remained to help her on her way , and Piers 's letters arrived by each mail -- long , closely written sheets , detailing every day of his life , drawing word-pictures of home surroundings , new acquaintances ; above all , breathing the tenderest , most faithful love .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 41]: Each letter was read and reread until it was known by heart , was answered with a length equal to its own , and by the time this was dispatched -- wonderfully , surprisingly soon -- another letter was due .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 17]: She read of the arrival of the mail at Brindisi , and counted over the hours .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 15]: The first shock of parting was over , six months had already passed by .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 18]: Six months was half a year , a quarter of the time of Piers 's probable absence !
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 37]: When the half was over , what joy to strike off the months which must elapse before his return ; and meantime could any other man in the world have written such delightful , heart-satisfying letters ?
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 49]: Vanna was keenly interested also in the changes in hospital treatment which had taken place during the four years since she had finished her course , and felt that the six months ' experience had been valuable from a medical as well as a mental point of view .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 27]: Nevertheless , it was with no regret that she saw the nurse return whose place she had taken , and made her own preparations for departure .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 58]: At thirty-two the unaccustomed strain of hospital life told heavily on a constitution weakened by mental strain , and she thought with joy of the comfort of her own home , of long , restful hours , when she could write to Piers at her ease , of talks with Jean , of play with the children .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 30]: She drove straight from the hospital to the Gloucesters ' , where she had arranged to spend a week in idleness before the effort of reopening her own home .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 13]: The rooms were _ en fete _ , profusely decorated with flowers .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 30]: Jean and the children rushed to the door to receive her -- a charming trio , all dressed alike , in a flutter of white muslins and blue ribbons .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 32]: The whole made an entrancing picture to one accustomed to the bare austerity of a hospital ward ; and Vanna felt her spirits soar upwards with a delightful sense of exhilaration .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 57]: She hugged Jean with schoolgirl effusion , swung the children about in a merry dance , and gave herself up with undisguised zest to the pleasures of the moment : the daintily spread , daintily provided tea , the luxurious appointments of the little house , her own comfortable bedroom , the easy laxity of hours .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 50]: The first long chat with Jean seemed but to open out the way for a hundred other subjects which both were longing to discuss , and when it was over , the agreeable task remained of dressing herself in a pretty gown to partake of the sociable evening meal .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 5]: `` Oh , dear !
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 23]: The pomps and vanities of this world , how I love them ; how good they are , '' she sighed happily .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 75]: `` What a delight it is to sit at a dear little table bright with silver and flowers , and eat indigestible dainties , and know you can sit still and be lazy all evening , and go to bed when you like , and get up , no , _ not _ get up , stay in bed and have breakfast , and snoodle down to sleep again if you feel so inclined !
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 8]: I _ shall _ be lazy to-morrow !
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 29]: And to wear a pretty dress , and a necklace , on a nice bare neck , instead of a stiff starched bow sticking into one 's chin .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 7]: Have my strings marked my neck ?
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 5]: How do I look ?
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 17]: I seemed to myself a perfect vision of beauty , but Jean looks at me askance .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 9]: I do n't fancy she looks flattering . ''
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 12]: `` No , not a bit , '' said Jean bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 19]: `` You look a wreck , like most discharged patients -- fit for nothing but a convalescent home .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 6]: Do n't talk of necks !
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 10]: It 's nothing but bones , a perfect disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 14]: I shall feed you up , and forbid work for weeks to come .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 10]: What you need is a good , bracing change .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 7]: I need a change , too .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 15]: Could n't we three go off together , and do something _ nice _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 15]: I 've had nothing but seaside holidays with the babies since we were married .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 26]: A month in Switzerland , in high , bracing air , in good hotels , among the mountains -- oh , how good it sounds .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 9]: Say yes , Rob , like a darling .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 8]: I _ want _ it so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 6]: But Robert did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 41]: It was the first time in the history of their acquaintance that Vanna had known him show even a moment 's hesitation in granting a request from Jean 's lips , and _ she _ looked at him in surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 30]: Distress was written upon his face , and a wistful appeal for forgiveness , but stronger than all , an air of decision which gave no promise of weakening .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 12]: `` I 'm sorry , darling ; but it 's impracticable .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 23]: It will be hard enough to squeeze out any holiday this year ; an extra trip abroad is out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 15]: Expenses have been heavy lately '' -- he shrugged his shoulders with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 23]: `` They always _ are _ heavy , somehow , and we must be careful not to launch into fresh extravagance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 9]: `` We have _ not _ been extravagant .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 12]: The money has gone in uninteresting , disagreeable _ necessities _ .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 19]: No one can call a doctor 's bill extravagance , or a new cistern , or stair carpets .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 30]: _ Au contraire _ , we 've been so dull and prudent that it would be a tonic to spend a little money on fun , for a change .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 10]: Ca n't we manage it , somehow , Rob ?
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 2]: Do !
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 7]: Sell a share , or something .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 9]: It _ would _ be a treat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 14]: The lines on Robert 's face deepened suddenly ; his smile flickered out .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 10]: `` No ; I 've done that too often .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 7]: That must come to an end .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 8]: My shares are painfully near an end .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 12]: I 'm sorry , dear , but it 's impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 5]: Jean shrugged her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 22]: The lines deepened on her face also , and her lip quivered with disappointment , but she made no fruitless protestation .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 47]: For the rest of the meal she was silent , leaving the conversation to be carried on by Vanna and Robert ; but before leaving the room she went out of her way to pass Robert 's chair and lay a caressing hand on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 25]: He lifted his face to her with the old adoring expression in his brown eyes , and the tired lines disappeared from his brow .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 36]: He had kept up the conversation out of consideration for Vanna 's feelings , but his attention had really been engrossed by Jean , and his own regrets at being obliged to refuse her request .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 17]: Now he evidently felt himself forgiven , and was transparently grateful for his wife 's forbearance .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 2]: DISASTER .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 15]: It was the first of October , 1878 , a day of fateful memory .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 23]: Jean Gloucester stood before the mirror in her bedroom , surveying a new gown which she was wearing for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 45]: The soft grey crepe was swathed and draped in absolute disregard of the stiff fashion of the day , two quaint silver buckles of Norman design held the folds together over the breast , an old lace tucker was tied by a silver cord .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 23]: Jean affected delicate shades of grey , and the neutral colour formed a perfect background for the vivid beauty of her face .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 37]: She stood back from the mirror , turning slowly round and round , patting , smoothing , pressing with careful , deliberate touch , but the light in her eyes spoke more of expectation than complacence .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 5]: Jean was not vain .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 10]: Really beautiful people are seldom victims of this sin .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 21]: It is your `` rather pretty '' woman who spends her life in the effort to add to her charms .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 34]: Jean was accustomed to her beauty , and accepted it -- with other such blessings -- as a matter of course , but Robert 's fervid admiration was a factor in her life .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 25]: This afternoon she was feeling unusually well , and as usual under these circumstances , was fired by the old girlish spirit of mischief .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 32]: Jean was ever a child at heart , loving to play tricks , to plan surprises , and weave pretty , dramatic _ denouements _ out of the prose of life .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 31]: A hundred times had she so taken Robert by storm , and the hundredth time had found him as astounded , as unprepared , as blankly mystified as the first .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 29]: After years of matrimony Jean was still an enigma , concerning which nothing could be foretold but the unexpected ; but the mystery added strength to her charm .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 22]: Life with Jean might at times be somewhat difficult and trying , but never by any possibility could it become dull .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 17]: This evening Jean amused herself by planning an effective appearance for herself in her new gown .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 54]: Instead of awaiting Robert in the den , she would stay in her bedroom until he was safely inside the hall , and would then sweep down the staircase in all her bravery , while he stood gazing upward with the glow of delight she loved to see shining in his hazel eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 41]: Then he would affect to be overcome with surprise , would stagger against the wall , and lean there helplessly while she stood beneath the lamp , revolving slowly round and round to show herself from every point of view .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 103]: Then they would retreat into the den , and he would kiss her , and call her his beautiful darling , his bonnie , bonnie Jean , and she would preen herself , and ask if he were not a proud man to be allowed the privilege of paying the bill for such a heavenly gown , and they would laugh and spar , like a couple of happy children , rather than a staid old married couple , Jean gave a little skip of anticipation even as she crept to the head of the staircase to listen for Robert 's return .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 8]: He was due now -- this minute !
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 36]: She failed to catch his usual whistle , but presently the key turned in the latch , and she drew back her head , not wishing to be seen until the dramatic moment should arrive .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 13]: Robert shut the door and advanced a few steps into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 40]: He did not whistle again , which seemed curious , as no wife had appeared to greet him , neither did he advance towards the carved oak armoire in which he was used to hang his coat and hat .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 21]: Jean gathered her skirts round her , and stretched forward her lovely , laughing face to spy what was happening .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 16]: What she saw smote the smile from her lips in a flash of agonised fear .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 8]: Robert had not taken off his hat .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 44]: He stood still just within the threshold , in the attitude of a man unable to move a step , the light of the lamp shilling full on his face -- the face of an old man , haggard , contorted , vacant-eyed .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 35]: For one moment Jean stood still , paralysed with horror ; at the next the blood raced through her veins , and her heart swelled within her in an anguish of love and longing .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 29]: In the history of the last eight years Jean had invariably been the one to need pity and help ; Robert , the one to strengthen and console .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 35]: She had suffered , and he had ministered ; she had despaired , and he had consoled ; she had repined , and he had gallantly borne her burden as well as his own .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 13]: Until this moment his strength had made no demand on her weakness .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 8]: But now , now it had come .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 31]: He was in trouble -- her Robert -- in desperate , aching need , and Jean 's whole being rushed out towards him in a passion of love and longing .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 25]: Dropping her skirts , she skimmed down the stairway , scarcely seeming to touch the ground , so light and swift were her steps .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 12]: Out of her white face her eyes gleamed with unnatural light .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 16]: There was something almost tigerish in the flame of Jean 's love at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 12]: Some one had been cruel to her mate , her man .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 14]: She must fly to the rescue -- hold him safe in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 3]: `` Robert !
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 47]: The vacant eyes looked into hers , those clear , brown eyes , which more than any other eyes she had ever seen were the windows of the soul within , and for the first time since their meeting there came no lightening to greet hers .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 23]: Jean 's thoughts flew backward to that afternoon years ago when she had seen the same dazed look in Vanna 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 8]: Her heart contracted with a sickening dread .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 7]: `` Robert , are you ill ?
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 6]: Have you seen a doctor ?
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 11]: Has he said -- '' He shook his head blankly .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 6]: No -- not that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 8]: Jean drew a long , thankful breath .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 32]: Relieved of this dread , she felt prepared to face all other ills ; but first she must be alone with Robert , behind shut doors , safe from intruding eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 23]: She slid her arm through his , and leading him into the den , pushed him gently into his own big chair .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 40]: His hat was still on his head , she lifted it off , smoothed the hair on his forehead with a swift , caressing touch , then sinking on her knees before him , lifted her face to his .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 18]: `` Robert , we are here together -- you and I , in our own dear home .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 5]: The children are upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 16]: There is nothing , nothing in all the world worth grieving for so much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 8]: He looked at her hopelessly , blankly .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 12]: `` But it 's gone , Jean -- it 's gone .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 5]: The home 's gone !
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 7]: It 's all gone -- everything !
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 2]: Gone !
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 3]: Ruined ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 5]: `` What , darling ?
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 4]: What has gone ?
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 3]: Tell me !
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 11]: I want to know -- I want to help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 6]: `` The Bank , Jean !
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 4]: The Glasgow Bank .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 2]: To-day !
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 9]: Ruin for us ; ruin for thousands . ''
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 17]: Jean rested her hands on the arms of the chair , and braced herself to thought .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 4]: The Glasgow Bank !
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 29]: Father had disapproved of it from the first , and had wished Robert to sell his shares , but he had objected because of the high interest given .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 14]: They were always hard up , and needed every penny they could get .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 25]: Besides , Robert declared that it was perfectly safe -- as safe as the Bank of England ; it was absurd to doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 12]: And now it had stopped , and he talked of ruin .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 43]: Jean 's knowledge of finance had not increased with her years of matrimony , and after the first shock of surprise she told herself with a sigh of relief that , after all , there could not be so much to lose .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 25]: When she had spoken of selling shares a few weeks ago , Robert had refused on the score that there were so few left .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 15]: Robert was so dazed , poor man , that he was exaggerating his loss .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 7]: He must be calmed and soothed .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 31]: `` Dearest boy , I 'm sorry -- dreadfully , dreadfully sorry for all those poor people ; but you and I have not much to lose , have we ?
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 32]: We have rubbed along quite comfortably without a big balance at the Bank , and if a few hundreds have gone -- well , we 'll do without them , too .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 12]: I 'll turn over a new leaf , and be economical .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 25]: We 'll have no holiday , no new things , the bills for the new furniture are all paid -- we need nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 7]: Do n't grieve so , dear .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 5]: I 'll help you .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 7]: I _ will _ help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 13]: Robert stretched out his arms and folded her close to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 13]: The dazed expression was beginning to give way to a yearning tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 15]: Jean had yet to be enlightened as to the full extent of the calamity .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 10]: He must brace himself to the task of explanation .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 21]: `` Jean , it is not an ordinary bank -- it 's unlimited ; that was why your father disapproved .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 14]: But I thought I knew best -- I stuck to my own way .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 21]: If I could bear the consequences alone I would n't grumble ; it 's for you , and the children .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 16]: I have only five shares , but I 'm responsible , to my last penny .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 30]: They can clean me out of everything I possess , can sell our furniture above our heads -- every stick in the house , leave us without a bed .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 6]: And they 'll do it .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 10]: The calls will be enormous -- must be enormous .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 13]: I 've ruined you , Jean , by my self-willed folly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 12]: Jean lifted her lips and kissed him softly on the cheek .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 48]: She felt faint and limp , as though suddenly overpowered by fatigue ; but the predominant feeling was still that Robert was in trouble , that he was appealing to her for strength , that whatever trials were to come , she must not fail him now .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 9]: `` You 've given me everything worth having .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 14]: All the riches in the world could n't give me happiness without you .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 25]: If the money goes , we 'll have to love each other more , and no bank , no bank , can touch that .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 3]: Robert ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 25]: -- her voice broke on a note of exquisite tenderness -- `` remember what you called me that first day -- remember the prophecy !
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 12]: If fortune has gone , you have still your treasure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 21]: And Robert , blessing her , shedding tears of mingled joy and sorrow , declared that he was rich indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 5]: THE FEET OF CLAY .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 38]: Time did nothing to soften the severity of the blow which had fallen upon the shareholders of the Glasgow Bank ; rather , with every day as it passed did the situation become more hopeless and terrible .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 44]: Defalcations of three years ' standing left a deficit so abysmal that nothing short of the uttermost farthing could hope to fill it , and even the enormous preliminary call spelt ruin to many small holders , of whom Robert Gloucester was one .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 31]: When every copper which he possessed had been realised , he was still far behind the amount demanded , and a bill of sale was issued on his household effects .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 18]: To Mr Goring the disaster came at once as a shock and a confirmation of old fears .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 46]: He found himself in the position of being able to say `` I told you so '' ; but there was little pleasure in the advantage when the chief sufferer was his dearest child , and the transgressor so humble and penitent as his son-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 48]: His chief grief was that , owing to decreasing income from his own investments , and the expenses of two big sons at Oxford , he could not increase the allowance of two hundred a year which he had regularly contributed towards the Gloucester _ menage _ .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 26]: Jean expected him to offer to buy her furniture at a valuation , but , to her intense disappointment , he made no such proposition .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 26]: `` Get rid of the things as best you can -- they 'll sell well , or ought to , considering the price Robert paid .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 36]: They would n't fit into a small house , and you 'll want a different style of thing altogether -- plain , simple furniture , that can be kept in order by less experienced maids .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 21]: All these curios and odds and ends are very well in their way , but they mean work -- work !
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 13]: There 'll be no time for dusting old china and polishing brasses .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 22]: Get rid of them all , and I 'll see what I can do towards helping you to a fresh start .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 24]: We have been looking through the rooms at home , and there are a lot of odds and ends which we can share .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 28]: You 'll have to lie low for a time , and be satisfied with usefuls ; but I 'll see that you are comfortable , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 7]: I 'll see to that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 15]: `` Thank you , sir , thank you indeed , '' cried Robert warmly .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 10]: `` It 's most good and kind of you .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 7]: You have always been most generous .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 17]: You are quite right about this furniture , it would be unsuitable under the new conditions .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 29]: It 's all one to me -- I do n't notice these things , and Jean has been heroic about it all -- she does n't mind either .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 8]: She 's quite prepared for the change .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 7]: Are n't you , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 20]: Jean assented with a small , strained smile , and Robert continued to discuss the subject with philosophic calm .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 38]: Jean had declared with her own lips that worldly goods were of no importance in her eyes when compared to the treasure of their love , and in simple faith he had taken her at her word .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 52]: It was beyond his powers of comprehension to realise that the last few minutes , with their calm condemnation of her Lares and Penates , had been one of acute agony to his wife 's soul -- the worst moment she had known , since the springing of the bad news .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 41]: When she was silent and distrait for the rest of the day , he asked her tenderly if her head ached , and enlarged enthusiastically on the goodness of Mr and Mrs Goring in proposing to despoil their own home .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 17]: `` You 'll find life easier , I hope , darling , in a smaller house .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 25]: They 've been a worry to you sometimes , all these collections , keeping them cleaned and dusted , and that kind of thing .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 21]: We 'll go in for the simple life , and be done with useless ornamentation , '' he declared cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 25]: Now that the first shock of the misfortune had spent itself , his invincible optimism was slowly but surely beginning to make itself felt .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 34]: The worst had happened ; every penny that could be scraped together had already been confiscated ; he faced the situation , and calmly and courageously set his face towards a fresh start .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 6]: `` Jean does n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 6]: Jean says she is prepared .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 6]: That takes away the sting .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 19]: So long as she is happy , it does n't matter a rap to me where we live .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 11]: After all , we ought to consider ourselves jolly lucky .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 22]: It 's only the extras which we shall have to shed , while many poor wretches will be in actual need .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 7]: We ought to be thankful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 23]: As the weeks passed by , Robert 's complacence increased , just as , in inverse ratio , Jean 's courage collapsed .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 66]: It was one thing to declare the world well lost , when her husband lay in her arms , broken-hearted , dependent on her support ; but it required a vastly more difficult effort to maintain that attitude during the painful process of hunting for a house at about a third of the old rent , and arranging her treasured possessions for an auction sale .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 20]: To Vanna , her invariable safety-valve , Jean poured forth her feelings , in characteristic , highly coloured language .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 42]: `` I feel sometimes as if I could not bear it another moment -- as if I must shriek , as if I must scream , as if I must take Rob by the arms and shake him till I drop !
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 32]: It 's so maddening to be taken so literally at one 's word , and to be expected to sit smiling on the top of a pedestal while the world rocks .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 86]: Yesterday , going over that hateful , stuffy little house , when he would persistently make the best of everything , even the view of the whitewashed yard and I had to go on smiling and smiling as if I agreed , I felt as if something in my head would snap ... I believe it will some day , and I shall lose control , and rage , and say terrible things , and he will be broken hearted with sorrow -- and surprise !
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 19]: He has n't an idea , not a glimmering ghost of an idea , what I 'm suffering !
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 26]: I said I did n't care , and he _ believed _ it , just as simply as if I 'd told him the time .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 4]: Oh , dear !
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 6]: the blindness of men . ''
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 8]: `` And the strangeness of women ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 11]: Vanna looked at her with her tender , whimsical smile .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 12]: `` You believed it yourself at the time , dear girl .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 9]: I can imagine how eloquent you would be .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 7]: No wonder poor Robert was convinced .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 24]: I was overcome with admiration for you that first week , but being a woman , I knew that the reaction must come .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 32]: That 's inevitable ; but you must live up to yourself , Jean ; you 've created a precedent by being magnificently brave , and you must keep it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 9]: `` I -- _ ca n't _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 11]: said Jean , and the tears rolled down her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 15]: `` That night I could think of nothing but Rob -- his poor face !
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 19]: I would have cut off my hand to make him smile , but my home -- my home !
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 7]: To have to break it up !
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 55]: My home where we came after we were married , where the babies were born ... It breaks my heart to leave it , and to give up all my treasures that I collected with such joy ... And Robert does n't see , he does n't know -- that seems hardest of all .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 12]: If he just realised -- '' `` He would suffer again !
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 9]: Is _ that _ what you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 14]: Jean cast a startled glance , and sat silent , considering the problem .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 30]: Her eyes were circled by dark violet stains , as from long wakeful nights ; there were hollows at her temples which the cloudy hair could not altogether conceal .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 20]: `` It sounded rather like it , '' she said slowly at last , `` but _ no _ !
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 12]: indeed I do n't -- I love him far too much .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 16]: But just sympathetic a little , Vanna -- and _ appreciative _ of my loss !
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 43]: Yesterday when we stood in that little back dining-room if he had said to me : ` it 's awfully hard on you , darling , but it 's only for a time : put up with it for a time ! '
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 11]: I should have hugged him , and felt a heroine .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 23]: But he looked out on that awful backyard , and said serenely , ` oh , it does n't matter about views !
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 22]: You never cared about looking out of windows , ' and went on calmly planning where we could put a sideboard .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 6]: And I wanted to scream !
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 9]: He does n't _ understand _ , Vanna .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 13]: He does n't understand -- '' `` Men do n't , dear !
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 11]: It 's no use expecting more than they can give .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 17]: They pull a wry face , accept a situation , and say no more about it .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 11]: It would seem to them contemptible to go on grizzling .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 30]: It 's a fine attitude -- much finer than ours ; and if you look upon it in the right light , Robert 's unconsciousness is a great compliment .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 19]: He simply gives you credit for being as good as your word , as he is himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 14]: But Jean pouted , and protruded her chin in the old pugnacious fashion .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 19]: `` But -- in our case , I 'm not so sure that it _ is _ finer !
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 19]: This upheaval is not one hundredth part so great a trial to Rob as it is to me .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 44]: He 's sorry , of course , and regrets that he did not sell out his shares ; but it will be no trial to him to have a small house , with a greengrocer 's shop at the corner of the road .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 35]: _ He _ wo n't mind a marble paper in the hall ; it wo n't cost him a thought to have a drawing-room composed of odd hideosities , instead of my lovely Chippendale .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 20]: He wo n't even notice if the little girls are shabby , and I wear a hat two years .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 19]: Is there much credit in being calm and resigned over a thing you do n't _ feel _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 29]: I nag at the servants , and snap at the children , and grizzle to you , and any one looking on would say : What a saint !
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 4]: What a wretch !
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 58]: but really and truly I 'm fighting hard , and slaying dragons every hour of the day ; and if I succeed in stifling my feelings and being decently agreeable for an hour or two in the evening , I 've won a big victory ; and it 's I who am the saint , not he !
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 11]: Vanna -- do you think I am a beast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 9]: Vanna 's laugh was very sweet and tender .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 4]: `` Not I !
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 19]: I quite agree ; but I want to help you , dear , to fight to the end .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 9]: Grumble to me as much as you like .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 15]: I 'm a woman , and understand ; but play the game with Robert .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 8]: You are his Ideal , his Treasure .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 4]: Be pure gold !
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 12]: Hide the feet of clay -- '' `` Do n't preach !
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 5]: Do n't preach ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 29]: cried Jean ; but before the words were out of her mouth , she had rushed across the room and thrown her arms impetuously round Vanna 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 6]: `` Yes ; I will !
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 3]: I will !
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 8]: Oh , Vanna , how you help !
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 3]: Scold me !
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 4]: Make me ashamed !
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 18]: I do n't want anything in the world but to be a good wife to Rob . ''
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 22]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A month later the removal was accomplished , and Jean struggled valiantly to make the best of the altered conditions .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 33]: She rarely complained -- never in Robert 's presence ; set herself diligently to the study of economy , and put aside embroidery and painting in favour of plain sewing and mending .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 44]: In six months ' time the new _ menage _ was running as smoothly as if it had been in existence for years , and neither the master of the house nor his children had suffered any diminution of comfort from the change .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 37]: Robert 's special little fads were attended to as scrupulously as in the larger establishment ; the little girls were invariably spick-and-span , but no observant eyes could fail to notice the change in Jean herself .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 14]: She was older , graver , less ready to sparkle with mischievous gaiety .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 32]: She had hidden her trouble out of sight , as years before she had hidden the baby clothes destined for the little dead son , but it had left its mark .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 48]: With the best will in the world she could not change her nature , and her artistic sensibilities met a fresh wound every time she walked up and down stairs , every time she entered a room , every time she walked down the dull suburban street .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 16]: She was in the wrong environment , and her beauty-loving nature was starved and hungry .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 24]: Robert was happily unconscious of the change , or if he noticed it was content to ascribe it to a more obvious reason .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 18]: He himself was ready to welcome his fourth child with an ardour undamped by considerations of money .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 34]: He adored children , and was delighted that the three-year-old Joyce should have a successor ; but Jean 's satisfaction was dependent on a possibility -- `` If it is a boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 23]: A live son would compensate a hundred times over for the added strain and burden involved by the addition to the nursery .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 25]: But the son was not forthcoming , and when a third little daughter was put into her arms Jean shed weak tears of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 38]: `` She 's the prettiest of all your babies , Jean , '' Vanna declared a week later as she nursed the little flannel bundle on her arm , and gazed down at the small downy head .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 8]: `` She has just your eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 10]: `` All babies ' eyes are the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 15]: `` This baby 's are n't ; and she has the daintiest little head !
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 9]: Lorna 's head was ugly at this stage .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 4]: And her nose !
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 6]: Her nose is perfect . ''
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 5]: `` Is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 22]: The voice from the bed was so listless and faint that Vanna held up the little face , insisting upon notice .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 5]: `` Look at her !
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 4]: Look for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 8]: Acknowledge that she is a duck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 5]: Jean 's lip quivered .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 28]: `` I wanted a boy , a little son to make up ... It seems so hard -- '' Vanna pressed the downy head to her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 6]: `` Poor little superfluous woman !
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 8]: You are not wanted , it seems .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 15]: Give her to me , Jean -- she 'd be worth the whole world .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 7]: I mean it , you know !
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 19]: Say the word and I 'll take her home this moment , and adopt her for life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 10]: But at this Jean opened wide , protesting eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 6]: `` As if I would !
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 5]: My own little child !
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 7]: She _ is n't _ superfluous .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 21]: I shall adore her as much as the others , but just at first it _ is _ a disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 26]: But I 'll call her after you this time , Vanna , say what you will , and you shall be her second mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 27]: I 'd like this one to have my name , and she _ is _ mine , for I wanted her , and you did n't .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 7]: Remember that , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 23]: No one pays one penny piece for anything this baby wears , or wants , or learns , but her Mother Vanna .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 15]: I 'm going to have a _ real _ claim , not only sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 15]: She 's going to mean a great , great deal in my life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 6]: Jean smiled , well content .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 33]: For herself it would be a relief to be freed from extra expense ; and she realised that in giving her consent she was enriching rather than impoverishing her friend 's life .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 9]: And so little Vanna adopted a second mother .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 4]: THE INDIAN MAIL .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 21]: Two years had passed since Piers Rendall had left England , and still there came no word of his return .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 42]: Vanna heard from him regularly every mail , letters as long , as intimate , as tender as during the first month after his sailing , yet gradually there dawned in them a difference which made itself surely , increasingly felt .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 4]: What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 26]: In the depths of her own heart , where alone the change was admitted , Vanna pondered the question , but could find no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 27]: The first zest of interest and occupation in a new world had died an inevitable death ; that was natural enough and could raise no surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 35]: The effects of a hot climate were beginning to make themselves felt , he had been overworked , overstrained -- natural again ; but in this case the remedy lay in his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 7]: Why did he not use it ?
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 46]: Vanna had never allowed herself to ask one questioning word on the subject of Piers 's return ; but she could not avoid knowing that the junior partner whose place he had taken was entirely recovered , and most anxious to return to his post .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 27]: Old Mrs Rendall , too , was growing sadly impatient , and , on the rare occasions when they met , treated Vanna with frigid disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 21]: It was this girl 's doing that her son was homeless and exiled -- deprived of the joys of manhood .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 31]: There was some mystery about this long , dragging engagement -- a mystery which had been purposely concealed , a mystery which in some inexplicable fashion referred to Vanna herself .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 5]: What could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 36]: The consciousness of this underlying curiosity had been one of Vanna 's greatest trials in her social intercourse during the last few years , and its presence heightened the ever-growing longing for Piers 's return .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 62]: The evening of mail-day often found her depressed rather than cheered , though the three closely written sheets had arrived as usual ; for weary and disconsolate as was Piers 's mood , there was still no reference to a return ; but during the week hope would again lift up its head and whisper encouragement concerning `` next time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 41]: So elastic a thing is the human heart , that a bracing wind , a gleam of sunshine through the fog , will send the spirits racing upwards , and open out possibilities where the road has appeared hopelessly barred .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 18]: It was in such a mood that Vanna greeted her weekly letter one grey morning in February .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 29]: The night before she had spent a particularly happy evening with Jean and Robert , who had appeared in better spirits than since the beginning of their trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 54]: Little Vanna had developed a fresh set of baby charms , and had allowed herself to be nursed with bland complacence , and on returning to her own house Robert had spoken a few memorable words when saying good-bye : `` Every day of my life I thank God for you , Vanna !
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 8]: Such a friend is a big gift .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 13]: You have been a good angel to us this last year . ''
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 50]: The memory of those words had been a good sleeping-draught ; the warmth of them remained to cheer her as she dressed in the morning , and when her eye fell on the well-known envelope on the breakfast table , a little leap of the heart prophesied good news .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 13]: To-day it seemed fitting that her waiting should come to an end .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 6]: It was a thin envelope .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 9]: One sheet of paper replaced the usual three .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 5]: So much the better .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 14]: Four words would be sufficient to say all that she wanted to know .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 14]: Vanna seated herself at the table , and bent eagerly over the sheet .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 37]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ `` My Dearest and Best -- `` I have your last letter beside me , and have been reading it over and over , wondering how to answer all that is written between the lines .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 24]: I can read it , Vanna ; I have read it for a long time , but have not had courage to reply .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 50]: You are too sweet and unselfish to allow yourself to write what is really in your thoughts , but I know you so well -- you are no calm , equable , cold-blooded saint ; you must have known many moments of bitterness , of anger , of resentment .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 14]: I know it ; I understand ; I bless you for your patience .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 11]: _ Why have I not come home to you _ ?
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 23]: That is the question you are asking me across the world ; the question I can almost hear spoken in my ear .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 27]: You know by my letters that I am miserable and alone ; you must have heard by this time that Brentford is anxious to get back .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 7]: He wrote to me last mail .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 18]: It is for me as senior partner to make my choice , and I have made it .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 34]: I wrote to-day to say that I preferred to stay on -- '' The paper trembled in Vanna 's hand ; her lips lost their curves and straightened into a thin red line .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 20]: She shut her eyes for a moment before she could see clearly to continue her reading : `` There !
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 4]: it is out .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 7]: It is terrible to write it .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 22]: I feel as if with the writing I have cut myself off from the best and happiest years of my life .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 12]: For that is what it means , Vanna -- the end !
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 22]: I have suffered tortures this last year , fighting it out , arguing it over and over again in my heart .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 27]: I could not have borne it if it had not been for your letters , and yet in a fashion they have added to my suffering .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 19]: If ever a man loved a woman , with his soul and strength , I have loved you .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 23]: I have waited eight years , and it would have seemed as a day if there had been hope at the end .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 12]: I would wait twenty years to gain you in the end .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 9]: But , Vanna , when hope is dead !
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 27]: ... I am very sad , very lonely ; I miss you every hour , but I dare not come home to endure a worse pain .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 18]: The years are passing ; my youth is over ; I can not face a solitary age .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 11]: Vanna , dearest , I promised you to be honest .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 4]: I swore it .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 6]: I must keep my word .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 17]: If the best is denied me , I must be content with what I can have .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 46]: There is a girl here -- '' Vanna 's arm dropped on to the table , the fluttering sheet fell from her fingers , the dull , heavy thuds with which her heart had been beating for the last few minutes seemed suddenly to cease .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 14]: She lifted her hand to her head , and brushed back her hair .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 7]: `` A _ girl _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 36]: For one moment the room seemed to swim ; consciousness appeared about to desert her , the next _ she _ was tinglingly alert , devouring the remaining words with hot , smarting eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 7]: -- The daughter of our Colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 12]: I have seen a good deal of her these last months .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 22]: She is not pretty , but she is sweet and kind , and has an echo of _ your _ charm .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 12]: If I tried , I think I could love that girl .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 10]: _ Vanna , I am going to try _ !
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 6]: ... Do you despise me ?
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 8]: Do you think me a faithless hound ?
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 29]: Can you understand in the faintest degree that it is just because you have shown me what love can mean that I can not live my life alone ?
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 9]: Will you care to write to me still ?
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 10]: I do n't know ; I ca n't tell .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 9]: I dare not think how you may feel .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 23]: I , who longed above all else in life to shield and guard you , to have to deal you this blow !
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 42]: ... Forgive me , Vanna -- my dearest , dearest love ... '' ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Vanna laid the letter on the table once more , and raised a grey face , from which the lingering youth had been stricken at a blow .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 7]: Her eyes stared through her window .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 12]: The dull vista of chimney-tops stretched away into an illimitable distance .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 10]: Dun banks of smoke hung pall-like over the city .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 5]: The rain was falling .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 14]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ How does one live through the first days of an intolerable grief ?
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 42]: Looking forward , looking back , it appears impossible that reason itself could remain , yet in reality the automaton with the broken heart eats and sleeps , clothes itself , speaks in an ordinary voice , performs its necessary work .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 23]: Throughout the hours of that tortured morning Vanna told herself repeatedly that she would go mad , she would certainly go mad .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 12]: It was impossible that any human creature could endure such anguish .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 17]: She , in whose blood ran the fatal taint , must surely succumb sooner than others .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 11]: She would go mad , and Piers would be justified .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 7]: All the world would pity him .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 8]: All the world would hail his escape .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 7]: But she did not go mad .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 6]: She was not even ill .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 19]: During the whole time of that awful soul-sickness there was not one hour when she was physically incapacitated .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 22]: This extraordinary immunity of the flesh , over which each mourner marvels afresh , seemed at the time a fresh grievance .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 27]: To be too ill to think , too ill to care , would have been heaven as compared with this hell of bitter , rambling thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 33]: Her hero had fallen ; his protestations had been empty words ; there was no faith , or truth in this world , or the next ; no mercy , no justice !
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 10]: She shut her doors and would admit no one .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 11]: Jean and Robert would grieve for , and with her .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 4]: Jean would cry .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 34]: Robert 's face would cloud over with that pained , shrinking expression which it wore when any one dear to him was in grief , _ but they would not be surprised _ !
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 20]: In conclave one with another they would absolve Piers 's conduct , and say it was `` natural . ''
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 12]: Vanna laughed -- a harsh , bitter laugh at the thought .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 25]: So easy , so easy , when one had all the world could give , to be calm and judicial for others less fortunate !
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 4]: She hated Jean .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 4]: She hated Robert .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 6]: She hated the whole world .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 5]: She hated God Himself .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 41]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Days and nights of darkness , weeks of black anger and despair , then slowly , quietly , like the coming of the dawn , the clouds began to melt , and the struggling light to make itself felt .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 33]: First shame , and a shuddering horror of evil thoughts ; secondly , bitterness thrust aside , instead of welcomed ; finally the search-light turned upon herself , instead of on others .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 23]: At that moment healing began , though it would be long indeed before any comfort from the process could be sensibly felt .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 43]: To a just and generous nature it is impossible to cherish a heart-grudge where the head has pronounced absolution ; and when Vanna 's first flame of anger had burnt itself out she had little blame in her heart for Piers Rendall .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 19]: If he had fallen short of the ideal , was not she herself open to the same reproach ?
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 42]: She who had always insisted upon the possibility of a spiritual love , was it consistent that she should wish to keep him sad and dissatisfied , or grudge him happiness because it was given by other hands than her own ?
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 17]: He had given her eight years of his life ; he had been honest with her .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 15]: Could she not bear to stand aside , and say `` God speed '' ?
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 39]: But the light was still flickering and uncertain ; the black clouds hung overhead ready to engulf her in fresh storms ; a chance word or sound would open up the wound with a piercing anguish of pain .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 11]: Why dwell upon the picture of a soul in torment ?
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 30]: Vanna struggled on as thousands have done before her ; but it was not until five weeks had passed that her return letter was dispatched to Piers in India .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 10]: `` You are right , and you are brave .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 6]: Thank you for being brave .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 13]: Thank you for sparing me from the doom of spoiling your life .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 7]: Do n't pity me too much .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 20]: You have given me more than you know , far more ; something greater even than love -- understanding !
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 15]: Now I can feel ; now I can sympathise ; now I can help .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 14]: This is your doing , your gift to me , so be comforted !
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 13]: All my life long I shall be thankful for these eight years .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 8]: I will not write ; not yet !
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 32]: In time to come we may meet and be friends , but this is Her day , it belongs to her -- to that young girl who will be your wife .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 12]: I 'm not perfect , dear ; you know my faults .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 13]: I should be jealous -- that 's only natural , I think .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 18]: It would hurt me to hear her praises , and perhaps -LRB- I 'm very feminine ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 20]: I might in revenge put out all my wiles -- and I know how to charm you , Piers !
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 10]: -- to keep you a little longer to myself .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 31]: I 'm honest , you see ; as you say , we have always been honest with each other -- for all our sakes , we 'll leave letters alone .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 36]: When it is settled -- it _ will _ be settled , I feel that -- you can write and let me know , and tell me her name , and send me her photograph .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 32]: I 'm so poor and mean a thing that I am glad she is not pretty ; glad that for the last time you called me your ` dearest love . '
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 20]: `` I am quite well , and Jean is good to me , and so -- good-bye ... ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 4]: THE SUPREME SECRET .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 28]: On the evening of her thirty-eighth birthday Vanna Strangeways said adieu to her last patient , and slowly traversed the streets leading towards Jean Gloucester 's home .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 15]: It was a dull and dreary evening , but her thoughts were not sad .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 37]: The years which had passed by since the receipt of Piers Rendall 's farewell letter , and the subsequent news of his engagement and marriage , had marked the various stages which attend all great griefs .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 45]: First the storm , with the roar of the wind , which threatens to destroy the very foundations of life ; then the desert ; loneliness ; an outlook of flat , colourless sand ; finally , slowly and surely , the inflowing calm .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 20]: Hopeless , long-cherished grief is impossible to a soul who has tasted of love for God and its fellow-men .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 34]: However severely a tree has been pruned , its leaves shoot forth bravely at the call of the spring , and in a few years ' time strength is gathered for another blossoming .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 12]: Vanna had put much good hard work into these last years .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 66]: In the great metropolis of the world , a woman who is willing to work for others , and to work without pay , need never know a moment 's idleness , and Dr Greatman had always a list of patients who were in dire need of help -- patients belonging to that section of humanity to whom in especial Vanna 's sympathies went out .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 82]: Every day of her life she was brought into contact with women compared with whom her own lot was unspeakably calm and happy -- poor waifs on life 's ocean , perishing not only for lack of physical help , but also for the want of love , and sympathy , and brightness ; and Vanna , as a free agent , blessed with health and means , had it in her power to minister to mind as well as body .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 32]: She was that rare thing , a voluntary worker on whom one might depend for regular , systematic service ; and in her work she found her best and sweetest comfort .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 68]: Jean 's old epithet , `` Consolation Female , '' was truly descriptive of Vanna in these first years of her sorrow ; but as time passed by , and the inevitable healing began to make itself felt , there came moments of restlessness and rebellion -- moments when a life of philanthropy no longer satisfied , when the inner Ego awoke , and clamoured for recognition .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 44]: A duller woman might have looked upon these outbursts as backslidings , and have taken herself severely to task for faltering in the path , but Vanna , more clear-sighted , recognised in them a natural and healthy revival of her old spirit .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 42]: She made no attempt to stifle the growth of this unrest , but rather welcomed it as a sign of recovered strength , and took a keen natural joy in ministering to herself , even as she had done to others .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 59]: The first longing for a pretty new dress , the first time that a social gathering became a pleasure instead of a bore , the first interested planning for the future on her own behalf -- she congratulated herself on each impulse as it came , and so far as might be , gratified it to the full .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 11]: `` You are the sanest woman I ever met . ''
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 32]: Piers 's words were echoed by more than one person who knew Vanna at this period of her life -- by Dr Greatman himself , between a frown and a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 24]: `` Absolutely sane ; no extremes -- a perfectly balanced woman , sweet and capable , and humorous -- one in ten thousand !
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 30]: It seems as though she had inherited the extra share of ballast which her relations have lacked ; and yet it is there , the danger , the shadow .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 4]: I was right .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 11]: If I were consulted again I should say the same .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 11]: Even in the last year another cousin has developed symptoms .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 9]: Such a family ought to be stamped out .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 16]: But I 'd give five years of my life to see that woman happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 24]: This evening as she paced the muddy streets , Vanna 's thoughts were engaged with half a dozen details of her busy life .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 32]: From ten o'clock in the morning she had been hurrying from house to house , yet had not been able to finish the list with which she had started the day .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 31]: More people had been waiting for her , longing for her coming , than she had been able to visit ; the memory of grateful words sounded in her ears .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 27]: She was returning home to rest and ease , or , if she pleased , to go forth in search of amusement and distraction of mind .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 46]: For the hundredth time she told herself that she was one of the fortunates of earth ; and for the hundredth time '' _ But I am alone _ '' answered the woman 's heart , and could find no solace to fill that void .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 20]: Vanna threw back her head with the quick , defiant gesture which had grown habitual in years of struggle .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 26]: This was the direction in which thought could not be allowed to turn , the direction of earthquake and upheaval ; the death of peace .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 14]: Even as the pain cramped her heart she had decided on her medicine .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 9]: `` I will go to see my baby !
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 11]: There is still half an hour before her bedtime . ''
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 43]: Little Vanna , Jean 's youngest daughter , had been brought up by her parents to consider herself as equally the child of themselves and `` Mother Wan na '' and had shown herself delightfully eager to avail herself of the privilege .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 14]: `` You 've gotten only one mummie ; I ` se two ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 18]: was one of the earliest boasts by which she endeavoured to demonstrate her superiority over her sisters .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 68]: She was a delightful little person , pretty , as were all Jean 's children , with her mother 's dark , cloud-like hair , and her father 's hazel eyes ; affectionate , strong-willed , and already , at five years old , amusingly conscious of the powers of a dimpled cheek and a beguiling lisp , to gain for her the ambition of the minute .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 45]: Jean had faithfully kept her promise of allowing her friend to adopt the small Vanna financially as well as mentally ; and if it was a delightful task to purchase her small garments , it was still more thrilling to plan for years ahead .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 15]: Little Vanna must have an education to fit her for her place in life .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 58]: Her talents from the beginning should receive the most skilful training ; she should be taken abroad to learn languages in the only way in which they can be truly mastered ; if her attainments justified she should go on to College ; if she preferred a social life , she should enjoy it to the full .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 38]: Privately Vanna cherished the hope that her fledgling might develop not into a grave student but into a natural , light-hearted girl , whose happiness might atone to her in some wise for her own blighted youth .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 28]: All that love , and money , and the most careful forethought could do , should be done to secure for the second Vanna an unclouded girlhood .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 97]: In imagination she pictured her in the various stages of growth ; the schoolgirl coming home from school , to be taken for holiday trips abroad ; the gayest , least responsible of companions , running short of pocket-money , mislaying her effects , full of wild , impractical plans ; later on the debutante , a tall , dim maiden , reviving memories of her lovely mother at the same age , attiring herself in a filmy white gown , peeping with sparkling eyes inside a jeweller 's case , showering sweet kisses as thanks .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 38]: Later on , the coming of Prince Charming -- a Prince Charming who could be welcomed without a pang , for , thank God , there were no dark pages in the history of this second Vanna .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 30]: Finally a marriage , with its happy bustle of preparation , trousseau buying , and furnishings , the interests of the young home ; children of the third generation .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 15]: The future could not be blank with such an interest as this in prospect !
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 25]: The church clock at the corner of the street had just struck five as Vanna knocked at the door of Robert Gloucester 's house .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 42]: It was the children 's hour , when Jean was sure to be found in the den striving to amuse her three little daughters , while each vied with each other in the effort to attract the largest share of attention .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 26]: They crowded into the hall at the sound of Vanna 's patent knock , and drew her into the room in a clamour of welcome .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 24]: Each one of the four had a budget of news to unfold , and was eager , for the privilege of first innings .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 34]: Jean made several futile efforts to send the children back to their several games , but soon abandoned the effort and lay back comfortably in her chair , content to bide her time .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 15]: As usual , she was beautifully dressed , though more simply than of old .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 18]: In the shaded lamplight it was impossible to believe that her fortieth birthday was well in sight .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 29]: Her soft dark hair was as abundant as ever , and the thinness of her face seemed but to show more plainly the exquisite moulding of her features .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 38]: Vanna glanced at her with the old , never-dying admiration , as she held her godchild on her knee , and listened to the eager confidences of her sisters , and Jean smiled back with affectionate languor .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 58]: Behind her in a recess of the wall stood a medley of photographs , large and small : Mr Goring , white-haired and spectacled , proudly holding his eldest grandchild on his knee ; the two tall , handsome brothers ; Robert , with uplifted head and happy , smiling eyes ; baby faces nestled closely together .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 29]: At her feet in front of the old brass fender lay Robert 's dippers waiting his return , but Jean had no thought of any of these things .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 47]: She had an air of snatching the moment 's leisure , as something precious which should not be wasted , and her eyes showed a dreamy indifference to the children 's sallies -- an abstraction which , with juvenile sharpness , they were quick to note .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 43]: Vanna was a newcomer , and could always be counted on as an interested audience ; but no normal child can be satisfied for long if there remains one person in the room who is not paying the due meed of attention .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 25]: Before ten minutes were passed the trio were once more swarming over their mother 's chair , tugging at her gown to attract attention .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 4]: `` Jean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 10]: asked Vanna suddenly , `` are you happy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 8]: Jean stared at her with stolid surprise .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 12]: `` Of course I am happy , '' she said flatly .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 18]: `` But are you blissfully , ecstatically , unspeakably happy -- almost too happy to live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 10]: Jean 's stare took on a tinge of affront .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 4]: Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 6]: Why should I be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 6]: `` Why should you not ?
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 19]: If such a thing is possible to any one on earth , it ought to be to you .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 10]: You have everything that is worth having -- everything !
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 17]: Robert -- his wonderful love ; these children , interest in life , hope , expectation .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 8]: You are so _ rich _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 5]: Jean 's face softened .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 30]: She looked at the white-robed figures at her feet , and for a moment her eyes shone ; for a moment , and then once more the shadow fell .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , I know !
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 22]: I _ am _ well off , but one ca n't live on the heights ; and , oh , dear !
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 9]: oh , dear , there are such worries !
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 6]: Morton has given me notice .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 13]: It 's so difficult to find a decent cook for small wages .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 12]: I shall have to begin the weary old hunt once more .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 8]: And Lorna keeps complaining of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 15]: Robert says she must see an oculist , but I do so dread it .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 14]: If _ she _ has to wear spectacles it will break my heart .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 13]: And you remember those dining-room curtains that I sent to be dyed ?
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 14]: They came back to-day the wrong shade -- simply shrieking at the walls .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 2]: Ruined !
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 41]: Is n't it maddening -- I feel so depressed -- '' She looked across the room with a transparent appeal for sympathy , but with a quick , glad laugh Vanna leapt to her feet and swept towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 3]: `` Good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 4]: I 'm going .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 7]: Thank you so much ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 5]: _ Going _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 7]: Jean rushed after her in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 8]: `` Vanna , you 've just come .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 7]: Thank me for _ what _ ?
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 10]: You mad creature , what do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 4]: `` My lesson !
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 17]: Do n't stop me , Jean , I 'll come again -- I must go . ''
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 25]: She fled into the street , and the sound of her laughter floated back to Jean as she stood by the open door . ''
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 10]: _ The dining-room curtains do n't match _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 23]: Jean , the beloved , had said these astounding words ; had advanced them in all seriousness as a reason for unhappiness !
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 14]: In the midst of plenty , this infinitesimal crumb could mar her joy .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 10]: And Jean was but a type of her class .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 43]: All over London while their lonely sisters were eating their hearts with envy , the women rich in home , husband , and children , were allowing pigmy trials to obstruct the sun , squandering their joy , wasting the precious days .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 52]: And at the other end of the world that young girl who was Piers Rendall 's wife , the mother of his child , she too , perchance , was vexing herself over many things , bemoaning her trials , so dulled by custom that she no longer appreciated her joys .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 24]: The great , the supreme secret of life , came home to Vanna with overwhelming force as she walked through the quiet streets .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 27]: Not without , but within , must man look for happiness ; in himself , the divine soul of him , or nowhere lies his joy .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 28]: All outer possessions are as naught -- the baubles , the playthings of a child , which , once gathered , grow tame and lose their gilt .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 29]: Vanna had known great grief , and had travelled on bleeding feet through the desert of loneliness , but from the rough journey she had reaped her spoil .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 28]: Her eyes were opened ; she saw the riches of this world at their true worth ; her heart was filled with an immense , encompassing love .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 11]: It was impossible that she should ever again be lonely .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 8]: She thanked God , and took courage .
