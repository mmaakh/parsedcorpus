Parsing [sent. 1 len. 17]: Big Game A Story for Girls By Mrs George de Horne Vaizey A charming little book .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 30]: The son of the family aspires to be a poet , much to his father 's annoyance : he ought to have a proper job in the family firm .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 33]: His sister hits on a plan to get his work published , which would be a step in the right direction , one that might help to change the father 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 35]: She discovers that the editor of a poetry magazine always takes a holiday in a very remote hotel in the Scottish highlands , so she books a holiday for them in the same hotel .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 48]: The woman who runs the hotel hates women guests , and is n't very polite to most people , but they manage to charm her , and get her on their side , until one Sunday they make the fatal mistake of going to the wrong church .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 5]: That eventually passes over .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 13]: Meanwhile Margot , the heroine , has been wooing the poetry editor .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 21]: They go fishing together , and one day they go for a long walk in which the weather turns nasty .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 8]: Margot catches pneumonia and is very ill .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 9]: They get back to their homes in London .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 29]: Margot 's lover turns out not to have been the poetry editor after all , yet somehow young Ron finds that one of his poems has been published .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 10]: How this happens is revealed in the last chapter .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 13]: An average length book , probably more for girls than for boys .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 16]: N.H. BIG GAME A STORY FOR GIRLS BY MRS GEORGE DE HORNE VAIZEY CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 2]: PLANS .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 35]: It was the old story of woman comforting man in his affliction ; the trouble in this instance appearing in the shape of a long blue envelope addressed to himself in his own handwriting .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 4]: Poor young poet !
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 27]: He had no more appetite for eggs and bacon that morning ; he pushed aside even his coffee , and buried his head in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 5]: `` Back again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 3]: he groaned .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 23]: `` Always back , and back , and back , and these are my last verses : the best I have written .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 11]: I felt sure that these would have been taken ! ''
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 14]: `` So they will be , some day , '' comforted the woman .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 12]: `` You have only to be patient and go on trying .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 28]: I 'll re-type the first and last pages , and iron out the dog 's ears , and we will send it off on a fresh journey .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 11]: Why do n't you try the _ Pinnacle Magazine _ ?
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 8]: There ought to be a chance there .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 9]: They published some awful bosh last month . ''
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 9]: The poet was roused to a passing indignation .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 9]: `` As feeble as mine , I suppose !
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 21]: Oh , well , if even you turn against me , it is time I gave up the struggle . ''
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 51]: `` Even you '' was not in this instance a wife , but `` only a sister , '' so instead of falling on her accuser 's neck with explanations and caresses , she helped herself to a second cup of coffee , and replied coolly -- `` Silly thing !
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 18]: You know quite well that I do nothing of the sort , so do n't be high-falutin .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 23]: I should not encourage you to waste time if I did not know that you were going to succeed in the end .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 11]: I do n't think ; I _ know _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 4]: queried the poet .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 18]: He had heard the reason a dozen times before , but he longed to hear it again .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 31]: He lifted his face from his hands -- an ideal face for a poet ; clean-cut , sensitive , with deep-set eyes , curved lips , and a finely-modelled chin .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 7]: `` How do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 5]: `` I feel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 5]: replied the critic simply .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 28]: `` Of course , I am prejudiced in favour of your work ; but that would not make it haunt me as if it were my own .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 11]: I can see your faults ; you are horribly uneven .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 57]: There are lines here and there which make me cold ; lines which are put in for the sake of the rhyme , and nothing more ; but there are other bits , '' -- the girl 's eyes turned towards the window , and gazed dreamily into space -- `` which sing in my heart !
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 46]: When it is fine , when it is dark , when I am glad , when I am in trouble , why do your lines come unconsciously into my mind , as if they expressed my own feelings better than I can do it myself ?
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 9]: That 's not rhyme -- that 's poetry !
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 10]: It is the real thing ; not pretence . ''
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 30]: A glad smile passed over the boy 's face ; he stretched out his hand towards the neglected cup , and quaffed coffee and hope in one reviving draught .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 11]: `` But no one seems to want poetry nowadays ! ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 3]: `` True !
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 18]: I think you may have to wait until you have made a name in the other direction .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 5]: Why not try fiction ?
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 13]: Your prose is excellent , almost as good as your verse . ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 9]: `` Ca n't think of a plot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 3]: `` Bah !
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 9]: you are behind the times , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 7]: You do n't need a plot .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 20]: Begin in the middle , meander back to the beginning , and end in the thick of the strife .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 16]: Then every one wonders and raves , and the public -- ` mostly fools ! '
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 18]: -- think it must be clever , because they do n't understand what it 's about . ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 15]: `` Like the lady and the tiger , -- which came out first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 17]: if you could think of anything as baffling as that , your future would be made .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 13]: Write a novel , Ron , and take me for the heroine .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 16]: You might have a poet , too , and introduce some of your own love-songs .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 21]: I 'd coach you in the feminine parts , and you could give me a royalty on the sales . ''
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 6]: But Ronald shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 20]: `` I might try short stories , perhaps -- I 've thought of that -- but not a novel .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 15]: It 's too big a venture ; and we ca n't spare the time .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 24]: There are only four months left , and unless I make some money soon , father will insist upon that hateful partnership . ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 12]: The girl left her seat and strolled over to the window .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 32]: She was strikingly like her brother in appearance , but a saucy imp of humour lurked in the corners of her curving lips , and danced in her big brown eyes .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 19]: Margot Vane at twenty-two made a delightful picture of youth and happiness , and radiant , unbroken health .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 67]: Her slight figure was upright as a dart ; her cheeks were smooth and fresh as a petal of a rose ; her hair was thick and luxuriant , and she bore herself with the jaunty , self-confident gait of one whose lines have been cast in pleasant places , and who is well satisfied of her own ability to keep them pleasant to the end .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 12]: `` Anything may happen in four months -- and everything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 4]: she cried cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 33]: `` I do n't say that you will have made your name by September , but if you have drawn a reasonable amount of blood-money , father will have to be satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 6]: It is in the bond !
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 8]: Work away , and do n't worry .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 21]: You are improving all the time , and spring is coming , when even ordinary people like myself feel inspired .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 22]: We will stick to the ordinary methods yet awhile , but if matters get desperate , we will resort to strategy .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 11]: I 've several lovely plans simmering in my brain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 6]: The boy looked up eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 3]: `` Strategy !
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 2]: Plans !
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 3]: What plans ?
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 12]: What can we possibly do out of the ordinary course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 12]: But Margot only laughed mischievously , and refused to be drawn .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 29]: The cruel parent in the case of Ronald Vane was exemplified by an exceedingly worthy and kind-hearted gentleman , who followed the profession of underwriter at Lloyd 's .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 16]: His family had consisted of three daughters before Ronald appeared to gratify a long ambition .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 32]: Now , Mr Vane was a widower , and his son engrossed a large share in his affections , being at once his pride , his hope , and his despair .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 38]: The lad was a good lad ; upright , honourable , and clean-living ; everything , in fact , that a father could wish , if only , -- but that `` if '' was the mischief !
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 56]: It was hard lines on a steady-going City man , who was famed for his level-headed sobriety , to possess a son who eschewed fact in favour of fancy , and preferred rather to roam the countryside composing rhymes and couplets , than to step into a junior partnership in an established and prosperous firm .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 70]: It is part of an Englishman 's creed to appreciate the great singers of his race , -- Shakespeare , Milton , Tennyson , not to mention a dozen lesser fry ; but , strange to say , though he feels a due pride in the row of poets on his library shelves , he yet regards a poet by his own fireside as a humiliation and an offence .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 47]: A budding painter , a sculptor , a musician , may be the boast of a proud family circle , but to give a youth the reputation of writing verses is at once to call down upon his head a storm of ridicule and patronising disdain !
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 29]: He is credited with being effeminate , sentimental , and feeble-minded ; his failure is taken as a preordained fact ; he becomes a butt and a jest .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 19]: Mr Vane profoundly hoped that none of the underwriters at Lloyd 's would hear of Ronald 's scribbling .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 25]: It would handicap the boy in his future work , and make it harder for him to get rid of his `` slips '' !
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 21]: No one could guess from the lad 's appearances that there was anything wrong , -- that was one comfort !
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 22]: He kept his hair well cropped , and wore as high and glossy collars as any fellow in his right mind .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 12]: `` You do n't know when you are well off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 5]: cried the irate father .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 30]: `` How many thousands would be thankful to be in your shoes , with a place kept warm to step into , and an income assured from the start !
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 15]: I am not asking you to sit mewed up at a desk all day .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 25]: If you want to use your gift of words , you could n't have a better chance than as a writer at Lloyd 's .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 11]: There 's scope for imagination too , -- judiciously applied !
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 25]: And you would have your evenings _ free _ for scribbling , if you have n't had enough of it in the daytime . ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 44]: Ronald 's reply dealt at length with the subject of environment , and his father was given to understand that the conditions in which his life was spent were mean , sordid , demoralising ; fatal to all that was true and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 47]: The lad also gave it as his opinion that , so far from regarding money as a worthy object for a life 's ambition , the true lover of Nature would be cumbered by the possession of more than was absolutely necessary for food and clothing .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 31]: And as for neglecting a God-given gift -- `` What authority have you for asking me to believe that the gift exists at all , except in your own imagination ?
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 9]: Tell me that , if you please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 4]: cried the father .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 30]: `` You spend a small income in stamps and paper , but so far as I know no human creature can be induced to publish your God-given rhymes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 38]: At this point matters became decidedly strained , and a serious quarrel might have developed , had it not been for the diplomatic intervention of Margot , the youngest and fairest of Mr Vane 's three daughters .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 28]: Margot pinched her father 's ears and kissed him on the end of his nose , a form of caress which he seemed to find extremely soothing .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 18]: `` He is only twenty-one , darling , '' she said , referring to the turbulent heir .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 25]: `` You ought to be thankful that he has such good tastes , instead of drinking and gambling , like some other young men .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 27]: Really and truly I believe he is a genius , but even if he is not , there is nothing to be gained by using force .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 45]: Ron has a very strong will -- you have yourself , you know , dear , only of course in your case it is guided by judgment and common sense -- and you will never drive him into doing a thing against his will .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 14]: Now just suppose you let him go his own way for a time !
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 29]: Six months or a year ca n't matter so very much out of a lifetime , and you will never regret erring on the side of kindness . ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 20]: `` Since when , may I ask , have you set yourself up as your father 's mentor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 27]: cried that gentleman with a growl ; but he was softening obviously , and Margot knew as much , and pinched his nose for a change .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 15]: `` You must try to remember how you felt yourself when you were young .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 30]: If you wanted a thing , how _ badly _ you wanted it , and how _ soon _ , and how terribly cruel every one seemed who interfered !
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 22]: Give Ron a chance , like the dear old sportsman as you are , before you tie him down for life !
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 20]: It 's a pity I 'm not a boy -- I should have loved to be at Lloyd 's .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 30]: Even now -- if I went round with the slips , and coaxed the underwriters , do n't you think it might be a striking and lucrative innovation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 28]: Mr Vane laughed at that , and reflected with pride that not a man in the room could boast such a taking little witch for his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 13]: Then he grew grave , and returned to the subject in hand .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 17]: `` In what way do you propose that I shall give the boy a chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 18]: `` Continue his allowance for a year , and let him give himself up to his work !
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 61]: If at the end of the year he has made no headway , it should be an understanding that he joins you in business without any more fuss ; but if he _ has _ received real encouragement , -- if even one or two editors have accepted his verses , and think well of them -- '' `` Yes ?
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 4]: What then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 12]: `` Then you must consider that Ron has proved his point !
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 26]: It is really a stiff test , for it takes mediocre people far longer than a year to make a footing on the literary ladder .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 29]: You would then have to continue his allowance , and try to be thankful that you are the father of a poet , instead of a clerk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 24]: Mr Vane growled again , and , what was worse , sighed into the bargain , a sigh of real heartache and disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 22]: `` I have looked forward for twenty years to the time when my son should be old enough to help me !
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 22]: I have slaved all my life to keep a place for him , and now he despises me for my pains !
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 23]: And you will want to be off with him , I suppose , rambling about the country while he writes his rhymes .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 12]: I shall have to say good-bye to the pair of you !
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 16]: It does n't matter how dull or lonely the poor old father may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 9]: Margot looked at him with a reproving eye .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 13]: `` That 's not true , and you know it is n't !
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 22]: I love you best of any one on earth , and I am only talking to you for your own good .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 32]: I 'd like to stay in the country with Ronald in summer , for he does so hate the town , but I 'll strike a bargain with you , too !
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 10]: Last year I spent three months in visiting friends .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 24]: This year I 'll refuse all invitations , so that you sha n't be deprived of any more of my valuable society . ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 12]: `` And why should you give up your pleasures , pray ?
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 12]: Why are you so precious anxious to be with the boy ?
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 13]: Are you going to aid and abet him in his efforts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 7]: `` Yes , I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 4]: answered Margot bravely .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 20]: `` He has his life to live , and I want him to spend it in his own way .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 23]: If he becomes a great writer , I 'll be prouder of him than if he were the greatest millionaire on earth .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 26]: I 'll move heaven and earth to help him , and if he fails I 'll move them again to make him a good underwriter !
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 6]: So now you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 9]: Mr Vane chewed his moustache , disconsolately resigned .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 4]: `` Ah well !
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 13]: the partnership will have to go to a stranger , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 10]: I ca n't get on much longer without help .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 26]: I hoped it might be one of my own kith and kin , but -- '' `` Do n't be in a hurry , dear .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 26]: I may fall in love with a pauper , and then you can have a son-in-law to help you , instead of a son . ''
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 10]: Mr Vane pushed her away with an impatient hand .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 8]: `` No more son-in-laws , thank you !
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 13]: One is about as many as I can tackle at a time .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 38]: Edith has been at me again with a sheaf of bills -- '' His eldest daughter 's husband had recently failed in business , in consequence of which he himself was at present supporting a second establishment .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 16]: He sighed , and reflected that it was a thankless task to rear a family .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 44]: The infantine troubles of teething , whooping-cough , and scarlatina were trifles as compared with the later annoyance and difficulties of dealing with striplings who had the audacity to imagine themselves grown-up , and competent to have a say in their own lives !
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 13]: If things turned out well , they took the credit to themselves !
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 11]: If ill , then papa had to pay the bills !
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 13]: Mr Vane was convinced that he was an ill-used and much-to-be-pitied martyr .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 3]: THE SISTERS .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 33]: Mr Vane 's house overlooked Regent 's Park , and formed the corner house of a white terrace boasting Grecian pillars and a railed-in stretch of grass in front of the windows .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 23]: The rooms were large and handsome , and of that severe , box-like outline which are the despair of the modern upholsterer .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 35]: The drawing-room boasted half a dozen windows , four in front , and two at the side , and as regards furnishings was a curious graft of modern art upon an Early Victoria stock .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 38]: Logically the combination was an anachronism ; in effect it was charming and harmonious , for the changes had been made with the utmost caution , in consideration of the feelings of the head of the household .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 35]: Mr Vane 's argument was that he preferred solid old-fashioned furniture to modern gimcracks , and had no wish to conform to artistic fads , and his daughters dutifully agreed , and -- disobeyed !
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 33]: Their mode of procedure was to withdraw one article at a time , and to wait until the parental eye had become accustomed to the gap before venturing on a second confiscation .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 36]: On the rare occasions when the abduction was discovered , it was easy to fall back upon the well-worn domestic justification , `` Oh , that 's been gone a _ long _ time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 20]: when , in justice to one 's own power of observation , the matter must be allowed to drop .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 66]: The eldest daughter of the household had married five years before the date at which this narrative opens , and during that period had enjoyed the happiness of a true and enduring devotion , and the troubles inseparable from a constant financial struggle , ending with bankruptcy , and a retreat from a tastefully furnished villa at Surbiton to a dreary lodging in Oxford Terrace .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 61]: Poor Edith had lost much of her beauty and light-hearted gaiety as a result of anxiety and the constant care of two delicate children ; but never in the blackest moment of her trouble had she wished herself unwed , or been willing to change places with any woman who had not the felicity of being John Martin 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 46]: Trouble had drawn Jack and herself more closely together ; she was in arms in a passion of indignation against that world which judged a man by the standpoint of success or failure , and lay in readiness to heave another stone at the fallen .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 31]: At nightfall she watched for his coming to judge of the day 's doings by the expression of his face , before it lit up with the dear welcoming smile .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 22]: At sight of the weary lines , strength came to her , as though she could move mountains on his behalf .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 35]: As they sat together on the horsehair sofa , his tired head resting on her shoulder , the strain and the burden fell from them both , and they knew themselves millionaires of blessings .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 19]: The second daughter of the Vane household was a very different character from her sensitive and highly-strung sister .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 45]: The fairies who had attended her christening , and bequeathed upon the infant the gifts of industry , common sense , and propriety , forgot to bestow at the same time that most valuable of all qualities , -- the power to awaken love !
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 32]: Her relatives loved Agnes -- `` Of course , '' they would have said ; but when `` of course '' is added in this connection , it is sadly eloquent !
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 43]: The poor whom she visited were basely ungrateful for her doles , and when she approached empty-handed , took the occasion to pay a visit to a neighbour 's back yard , leaving her to flay her knuckles on an unresponsive door .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 30]: Agnes had many acquaintances , but no friends , and none of the young men who frequented the house had exhibited even a passing inclination to pay her attention .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 26]: Edith had been a belle in her day ; while as for Margot , every masculine creature gravitated towards her as needles to a magnet .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 35]: Among various proposals of marriage had been one from so solid and eligible a _ parti _ , that even the doting father had laid aside his grudge , and turned into special pleader .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 67]: He had advanced one by one the different claims to consideration possessed by the said suitor , and to every argument Margot had meekly agreed , until the moment arrived at which she was naturally expected to say `` Yes '' to the concluding exhortation , when she said `` No '' with much fervour , and stuck to it to the end of the chapter .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 27]: Pressed for reasons for her obstinacy , she could advance none more satisfying than that `` she did not like the shape of his ears '' !
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 21]: but the worthy man was rejected nevertheless , and took a voyage to the Cape to blow away his disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 15]: No man crossed as much as a road for the sake of Agnes Vane !
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 22]: It was a tragedy , because this incapacity of her nature by no means prohibited the usual feminine desire for appreciation .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 38]: Agnes could not understand why she was invariably passed over in favour of her sisters , and why even her father was more influenced by the will-o ' - the-wisp Margot than by her own staid maxims .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 7]: Agnes could not understand many things .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 20]: In this obtuseness , perhaps , and in a deadly lack of humour lay the secret of her limitations .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 39]: On the morning after the conversation between the brother and sister recorded in the last chapter the young poet paced his attic sitting - room , wrestling with lines that halted , and others which were palpably artificial .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 38]: Margot 's accusations had gone home , and instead of indulging in fresh flights , he resolved to correct certain errors in the lines now on hand until the verses should be polished to a flawless whole .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 34]: Any one who has any experience with the pen understands the difficulty of such a task , and the almost hopeless puzzle of changing a stone in the mosaic without disturbing the whole .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 27]: The infinite capacity for taking pains is not by any means a satisfying definition of genius , but it is certainly one great secret of success .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 21]: Ronald 's awkward couplet gave him employment for the rest of the morning , and lunch-time found him still dissatisfied .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 24]: An adjective avoided his quest -- the right adjective ; the one and only word which expressed the precise shade of meaning desired .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 29]: From the recesses of his brain it peeped at him , now advancing so near that it was almost within grasp , anon retreating to a shadowy distance .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 42]: There was no help for it but to wait for the moment when , tired of its game of hide-and - seek , it would choose the most unexpected and inappropriate moment to peer boldly forward , and make its curtsy .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 76]: Meantime Margot had dusted the china in the drawing-room , watered the plants , put in an hour 's practising , and done a _ few _ odds and ends of mending ; in a word , had gone through the programme which comprises the duties of a well-to-do modern maiden , and by half-past eleven was stepping out of the door , arrayed in a pretty spring dress , and her third best hat .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 82]: She crept quietly along the hall , treading with the cautious steps of one who wishes to escape observation ; but her precautions were in vain , for just as she was passing the door of the morning-room it was thrown open from within , and Agnes appeared upon the threshold -- Agnes neat and trim in her morning gown of serviceable fawn alpaca , her hands full of tradesmen 's books , on her face an expression of acute disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 6]: `` Going out , Margot ?
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 3]: So early ?
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 9]: It 's not long past eleven o'clock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 5]: `` I know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 7]: `` Where are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 6]: `` Do n't know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 16]: `` If you are passing down Edgware Road -- '' `` I 'm not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 15]: The front door closed with a bang , leaving Agnes discomfited on the mat .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 19]: There was no denying that at times Margot was distinctly difficult in her dealings with her elder sister .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 19]: She herself was aware of the fact , and repented ardently after each fresh offence , but alas !
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 3]: without reformation .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 6]: `` We do n't fit .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 12]: We never shall , if we live together a hundred years .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 35]: Edgware Road , indeed , on a morning like this , when you can hear the spring a-calling , and it 's a sin and a shame to live in a city at all !
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 23]: If I had told her I was going into the Park , she would have offered stale bread for the ducks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 60]: Margot laughed derisively as she crossed the road in the direction of the Park , and passing in through a narrow gateway , struck boldly across a wide avenue between stretches of grass where the wind and sun had full play , and she could be as much alone as possible , within the precincts of the great city .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 24]: In spite of her light and easy manner , the problem of her brother 's future weighed heavily upon the girl 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 51]: The eleventh hour approached , and nothing more definite had been achieved in the way of encouragement than an occasional written line at the end of the printed rejections : `` Pleased to see future verses , '' `` Unsuitable ; but shall be glad to consider other poems . ''
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 25]: Even the optimism of two-and-twenty recognised that such straws as these could not weigh against the hard - headed logic of a business man !
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 45]: It was in the last degree unlikely that Ronald would make any striking success in literature in the time still remaining under the terms of the agreement , unless -- as she herself had hinted -- desperate measures were adopted to meet desperate needs .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 40]: A scheme was hatching in Margot 's brain , -- daring , uncertain ; such a scheme as no one but a young and self - confident girl could have conceived , but holding nevertheless the possibilities of success .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 19]: She wanted to think it out , and movement in the fresh air gave freedom to her thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 22]: Really it was simple enough , -- requiring only a little trouble , a little engineering , a little harmless diplomacy .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 36]: Ronald was a mere babe where such things were concerned , but he would be obedient and do as he was told , and for the rest , Margot was confident of her own powers .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 38]: The speculative frown gave way to a smile ; she laughed , a gleeful , girlish laugh , and tossed her head , unconsciously acting a little duologue , with nods and frowns and upward languishing glance .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 24]: All things seem easy to sweet and twenty , when the sun shines , and the scent of spring is in the air .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 13]: The completed scheme stood out clear and distinct in Margot 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 19]: Only one small clue was lacking , and that she was even now on the way to discover !
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 3]: A TONIC .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 46]: Margot wandered about the Park so lost in her own thoughts that she was dismayed to find that it was already one o'clock , when warned by the departing stream of nursemaids that it must be approaching luncheon hour she at last consulted her watch .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 80]: Half an hour 's walk , cold cutlets and an irate Agnes , were prospects which did not smile upon her ; it seemed infinitely more agreeable to turn in an opposite direction , and make as quickly as possible for Oxford Terrace , where she would be certain of a welcome from poor sad Edith , who was probably even now lunching on bread and cheese and anxiety , while her two sturdy infants tucked into nourishing beefsteak .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 29]: Edith was one of those dear things who did not preach if you were late , but was content to give you what she had , without apologising .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 27]: Margot trotted briskly past Dorset Square , took a short cut behind the Great Central Hotel , and emerged into the dreary stretch of Marylebone Road .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 30]: Even in the spring sunshine it looked dull and depressing , with the gloomy hospital abutting at the corner , the flights of dull red flats on the right .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 19]: A block of flats -- in appearance the most depressing -- in reality the most interesting of buildings !
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 17]: Inside those walls a hundred different households lived , and moved , and had their being .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 28]: Every experience of life and death , of joy and grief , was acted on that stage , the innumerable curtains of which were so discreetly drawn .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 12]: Margot scanned the several rows of windows with a curious interest .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 20]: To-day new silk _ brise-bise _ appeared on the second floor , and a glimpse of a branching palm .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 23]: Possibly some young bride had found her new home in this dull labyrinth , and it was still beautiful in her sight !
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 15]: Alas , poor bird , to be condemned to build in such a nest !
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 24]: Those curtains to the right were shockingly dirty , showing that some over-tired housewife had retired discomfited from the struggle against London grime .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 27]: Up on the sixth floor there was a welcome splash of colour in the shape of Turkey red curtains , and a bank of scarlet geranium .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 50]: Margot had decided long since that this flat must belong to an art student to whom colour was a necessity of life ; who toiled up the weary length of stairs on her return from the day 's work , tasting in advance the welcome of the cosy room .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 26]: She herself never forgot to look up at that window , or to send a mental message of sympathy and cheer to its unknown occupant .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 30]: Oxford Terrace looked quite cheerful in comparison with the surrounding roads , -- and almost countrified into the bargain , now that the beech trees were bursting into leaf .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 40]: Margot passed by two or three blocks , then mounting the steps at the corner of a new terrace , walked along within the railed-in strip of lawn until she reached a house in the middle of the row .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 50]: A peep between draped Nottingham lace curtains showed a luncheon table placed against the wall , after the cheerful fashion of furnished apartments , when one room does duty for three , at which sat two little sailor-suited lads and a pale mother , smiling bravely at their sallies .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 39]: Margot felt the quick contraction of the heart which she experienced afresh at every sight of Edith 's changed face , but next moment she whistled softly in the familiar key , and saw the light flash back .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 12]: Edith sprang to the door , and appeared flushed and smiling .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 8]: `` Margot , how sweet of you !
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 6]: I _ am _ glad !
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 6]: Have you had lunch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 6]: Give me anything you have .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 5]: I 'm awfully late .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 7]: Bread and jam will do splendidly .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 8]: Halloa , youngsters , how are you ?
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 16]: We 'll defer kisses , I think , till you are past the sticky stage .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 34]: I 've been prowling about the Park for the last two hours enjoying the spring breezes , and working out problems , and suddenly discovered it was too late to go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 20]: She sank down on a seat by the table , shaking her head in response to an anxious glance .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 14]: `` No , not my own affairs , dear ; only Ron 's !
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 15]: Ca n't the boys run away now , and let us have a chat ?
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 21]: I know you have had enough of them by your face , and I 've such a lot to say .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 6]: Do n't grumble , boys !
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 19]: Be good , and you shall be happy , and your aunt will take you to the Zoo .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 5]: Yes , I promise !
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 28]: The very first afternoon that the sun shines ; but first I shall ask mother if you have deserved it by doing what you are told . ''
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 43]: `` Run upstairs , dears , and wash , and put on your boots before Esther comes , '' said Mrs Martin fondly ; and the boys obeyed , with a lingering obedience which was plainly due rather to bribery than training .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 48]: The elder of the two was a sturdy , plain-featured lad , uninteresting except to the parental eye ; the younger a beauty , a bewitching , plump , curly-headed cherub of four years , with widely-opened grey eyes and a Cupid 's bow of a mouth .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 27]: Margot let Jim pass by with a nod , but her hand stretched out involuntarily to stroke Pat 's cheek , and ruffle his curly pow .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 28]: Edith smiled in sympathetic understanding , but even as she smiled she turned her head over her shoulder to speak a parting word to the older lad .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 5]: `` Good-bye , darling !
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 10]: We 'll have a lovely game after tea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 15]: Then the door shut , and she turned to her sister with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 4]: `` Poor Jim !
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 14]: everybody overlooks him to fuss over Pat , and it is hard lines .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 11]: Children feel these things much more than grown-up people realise .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 21]: I heard yells resounding from their bedroom one day last year , and flew upstairs to see what was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 32]: There was Pat on the floor , with Jim kneeling on his chest , with his fingers twined in his hair , which he was literally dragging out by the roots .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 52]: He was put to bed for being cruel to his little brother , but when I went to talk quietly to him afterwards , he sobbed so pitifully , and said , ` I only wanted some of his curls to put on , to make people love me too ! '
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 4]: Poor wee man !
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 22]: You know what a silly way people have of saying , ` Will you give me one of your curls ? '
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 20]: and poor Jim had grown tired of walking beside the pram , and having no notice taken of him .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 23]: I vowed that from that day if I showed the least preference to either of the boys it should be to Jim .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 15]: The world will be kind to Pat ; he will never need friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 8]: `` No , Pat is all right .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 16]: He has the ` come-hither eye , ' as his mother had before him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 6]: `` And his aunt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 4]: Margot chuckled complacently .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 8]: it 's a valuable thing to possess .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 10]: I find it most useful in my various plights .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 30]: They are dear naughty boys , both of them , and I always love them , but rather less than usual when I see you looking so worn out .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 14]: You have enough strain on you without turning nursemaid into the bargain . ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 10]: Mrs Martin sighed , and knitted her delicate brows .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 34]: `` I do feel such a wicked wretch , but one of the hardest bits of life at the present is being shut up with the boys in one room all day long .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 33]: They are very good , poor dears , but when one is racked with anxiety , it is a strain to play wild Indians and polar bears for hours at a stretch .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 29]: We do some lessons now , and that 's a help -- and Jack insisted that I should engage this girl to take them out in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 33]: I must be a wretched mother , for I am thankful every day afresh to hear the door bang behind them , and to know that I am free until tea-time . ''
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 3]: `` Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 7]: Do n't be artificial , Edie !
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 24]: You know that you are nothing of the sort , and that it 's perfectly natural to be glad of a quiet hour .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 7]: You are a marvel of patience .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 20]: I should snap their heads off if I had them all day , packed up in this little room .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 7]: What have you had for lunch ?
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 3]: No meat ?
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 8]: And you look so white and spent .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 6]: How wicked of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 20]: `` Oh , Margot , '' sighed the other pathetically , `` it 's not food that I need !
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 12]: What good can food do when one is racked with anxiety ?
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 12]: It 's my mind that is ill , not my body .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 43]: We ca n't pay our way even with the rent of the house coming in , unless Jack gets something to do very soon , and I am such a stupid , useless thing that I can do nothing to help . ''
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 54]: `` Except to give up your house , and your servants , and turn yourself into nurse , and seamstress , and tailor , and dressmaker , rolled into one ; and live in an uproar all day long , and be a perfect angel of sympathy every night -- that 's all !
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 14]: -- and try to do it on bread and cheese into the bargain !
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 16]: There must be something inherently mean in women , to skimp themselves as they do .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 35]: You 'd never find a man who would grudge tenpence for a chop , however hard up he might be , but a woman spends twopence on lunch , and a sovereign on tonics !
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 14]: Darling , will it comfort you most if I sympathise , or encourage ?
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 15]: I know there are moods when it 's pure aggravation to be cheerful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 11]: Edith sighed and smiled at one and the same moment .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 6]: `` I do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 27]: I 'd like to hear a little of both , I think , just to see what sort of a case you could make out . ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 18]: `` Very well , then , so you shall , but first I 'll make you comfy .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 12]: Which is the least lumpy chair which this beautiful room possesses ?
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 15]: Sit down then , and put up your feet while I enjoy my lunch .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 6]: I do love damson jam !
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 29]: I shall finish the pot before I 'm satisfied ... Well , to take the worst things first , I do sympathise with you about the table linen !
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 9]: One clean cloth a week , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 12]: It must be quite a chronicle of the boys ' exploits !
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 16]: I should live on cold meat , so that they could n't spill he gravy .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 4]: And the spoons .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 8]: They feel gritty , do n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 10]: What is it exactly that they are made of ?
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 6]: Poor old , dainty Edie !
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 17]: I know you hate it , and the idea that aliens are usurping your own treasures .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 42]: Stupid people like Agnes would say that these are only pin-pricks , which we should not deign to notice , but sensible people like you and me know that constant little pricks take more out of one than the big stabs .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 31]: If the wall-paper had not been so hideous , your anxieties would have seemed lighter , but it 's difficult to bear things cheerfully against a background of drab roses .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 6]: Here 's an idea now !
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 10]: If all else fails , start a cheerful lodging-house .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 20]: You 'd make a fortune , and be a philanthropist to boot ... This _ is _ good jam !
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 14]: I shall have to hide the stones , for the sake of decency .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 14]: -- I know you think fifty times more of Jack than of yourself .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 20]: It 's hard luck to feel that all his hard work ends in this , and men hate failure .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 41]: They have the responsibility , poor things , and it must be tragic to feel that through their mistakes , or rashness , or incapacity , as the case may be , they have brought hard times upon their wives .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 13]: I expect Jack feels the table cloth even more than you do !
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 17]: You smart , but you do n't feel , ` This is my fault ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 15]: `` It is n't Jack 's fault , '' interrupted Jack 's wife quickly .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 16]: `` He never speculated , nor shirked work , nor did anything but his best .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 43]: It was that hateful war , and the upset of the market , and -- '' `` Call it misfortune , then ; in any case the fact remains that he is the bread-winner , and has failed to provide -- cake !
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 9]: We are not satisfied with dry bread nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 16]: You are always sure of that from father , if from no one else . ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 7]: `` But I loathe taking it !
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 18]: And I would sooner live in one room than go home again , as some people do .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 20]: When one marries one loses one 's place in the old home , and it is never given back .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 19]: Father loves me , but he would feel it a humiliation to have me back on his hands .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 11]: Agnes would resent my presence , and so would you .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 5]: Yes , you would !
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 11]: Not consciously , perhaps , but in a hundred side-issues .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 17]: We should take up your spare rooms , and prevent visitors , and upset the maids .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 31]: If you ran into debt , father would pay your debts as a matter of course , but he grudges paying mine , because they are partly Jack 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 6]: `` Yes , I understand .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 9]: It must be hateful for you , dear .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 45]: I suppose no man wishes to pay out more money than he need , especially when he has worked hard to make it , as the pater has done ; but if you take him the right way he is a marvel of goodness .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 21]: -- This year -- next year -- sometime -- never ; -- I 'm going to be married next year !
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 19]: Just what I had decided myself ... I must begin to pick up bargains at the sales . ''
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 31]: Margot rose from her seat , flicking the crumbs off her lap with a fine disregard of the flower-wreathed carpet , and came over to a seat beside her sister .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 18]: `` Now , shall I change briefs , and expatiate on the other side of the question ?
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 22]: ... Why , Edie , every bit of this trouble depends on your attitude towards it , and on nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 35]: You are all well ; you are young ; you adore each other ; you have done nothing dishonourable ; you have been able to pay your debts -- what does the rest matter ?
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 7]: Jack has had a big disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 14]: Very well , but what 's the use of crying over spilt milk ?
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 12]: Get a fresh jug , and try for cream next time !
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 25]: The children are too young to suffer , and think it 's fine fun to have no nursery , and live near Edgware Road .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 24]: If you and Jack could just manage to think the same , you might turn it all into a picnic and a joke .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 23]: Jack is strong and clever and industrious , and you have a rich father ; humanly speaking , you will never want .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 8]: Take it with a smile , dear !
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 9]: If you will smile , so will Jack .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 24]: If you push things to the end , it rests with you , for he wo n't fret if he sees you happy .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 9]: He _ does _ love you , Edie !
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 25]: I 'm not sentimental , but I think it must be just the most beautiful thing in the world to be loved like that .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 27]: I should like some one to look at me as he does at you , with his eyes lighting up with that deep , bright glow .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 17]: I 'd live in an attic with my Jack , and ask for nothing more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 15]: The elder woman smiled -- a smile eloquent of a sadder , maturer wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 30]: She adored her husband , and gloried in the knowledge of his love of herself , but she knew that attics are not conducive to the continuance of devotion .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 24]: Love is a delicate plant , which needs care and nourishment and discreet sheltering , if it is to remain perennially in bloom .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 33]: The smile lingered on her lips , however ; she rested her head against the cushions of her chair and cried gratefully -- `` Oh , Margot , you do comfort me !
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 7]: You are so nice and human .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 13]: Do you really , truly think I am taking things too seriously ?
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 8]: Do you think I am depressing Jack ?
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 14]: Would n't he think me heartless if I seemed bright and happy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 6]: `` Try it and see !
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 24]: You can decide according to the effect produced , but first you must have a tonic , to brace you for the effort .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 21]: I 've a new prescription , and we are going to Edgware Road to get it this very hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 6]: `` Quinine , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 22]: Esther and the boys can get it at the chemist 's , but really it will do roe no good . ''
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 8]: `` I 'm sure it would n't .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 9]: Mine is a hundred times more powerful . ''
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 3]: `` Iron ?
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 6]: I ca n't take it .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 6]: It gives me headaches . ''
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 6]: `` It is n't iron .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 14]: Mine wo n't give you a headache , unless the pins get twisted .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 15]: It 's a finer specific for low spirits feminine , than any stupid drugs .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 5]: A new hat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 10]: Edith stared , and laughed , and laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 5]: `` You silly girl !
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 3]: What nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 8]: I do n't need a hat . ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 8]: `` That 's nonsense if you like !
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 27]: It depresses me to see you going about in that dowdy thing , and it must be a martyrdom for you to wear it every day .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 39]: Come out and buy a straw shape for something and ` eleven-three ' , '' -LRB- it 's always `` eleven-three '' in Edgware Road -RRB- , `` and I 'll trim it with some of your scraps .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 6]: You have such nice scraps .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 38]: Then we 'll have tea , and you shall walk part of the way home with me , and meet Jack , and smile at him and look pretty , and watch him perk up to match .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 6]: What do you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 18]: Edith lifted her eyes with a smile which brought back the youth and beauty to her face .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 8]: `` I say , thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 4]: she said simply .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 9]: `` You are a regular missionary , Margot .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 10]: You spend your life making other people happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 4]: `` Goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 5]: cried Margot , aghast .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 4]: `` Do I ?
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 5]: How proper it sounds !
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 13]: You just repeat that to Agnes , and see what she says .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 13]: You 'll hear a different story , I can tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 4]: MARGOT 'S SCHEME .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 37]: The sisters repaired to Edgware Road , and after much searching finally ran to earth a desirable hat for at least the odd farthing less than it would have cost round the corner in Oxford Street .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 73]: This saving would have existed only in imagination to the ordinary customer , who is presented with a paper of nail-like pins , a rusty bodkin , or a highly - superfluous button-hook as a substitute for lawful change ; but Margot took a mischievous delight in collecting farthings and paying down the exact sum in establishments devoted to eleven-threes , to the disgust of the young ladies who supplied her demands .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 44]: The hat was carried home in true Bohemian fashion , encased in a huge paper bag , and a happy hour ensued , when the contents of the scrap-box were scattered over the bed , and a dozen different effects studied in turn .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 54]: Edith sat on a chair before the glass with the skeleton frame perched on her head at the accepted fashionable angle , criticising fresh draperies and arrangement of flowers , and from time to time uttering sharp exclamations of pain as Margot 's actions led to an injudicious use of the dagger-like pins .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 60]: Her delicate finely-cut face and misty hair made her a delightful model , and she smiled back at the face in the mirror , reflecting that if you happened to be a pauper , it was at least satisfactory to be a pretty one , and that to possess long , curling eyelashes was a distinct compensation in life .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 52]: Margot draped an old lace veil over the hard brim , caught it together at the back with a paste button , and pinned a cluster of brown roses beneath the brim , with just one pink one among the number , to give the _ cachet _ to the whole .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 9]: `` There 's Bond Street for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 24]: she cried triumphantly ; and Edith flushed with pleasure , and wriggled round and round to admire herself from different points of view .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 9]: `` It _ is _ a tonic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 4]: she declared gratefully .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 9]: `` You are a born milliner , Margot .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 22]: It will be a pleasure to go out in this hat , and I shall feel quite nice and conceited again .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 10]: It 's so long since I 've felt conceited !
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 9]: I 'm ever and ever so much obliged .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 21]: Can you stay on a little longer , dear , or are you in a hurry to get back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 20]: I shall get a scolding anyway , so I might as well have all the fling I can get .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 19]: I 'll have tea with you and the boys , and a little private chat with Jack afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 12]: You wo n't mind leaving us alone for a few minutes ?
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 24]: It 's something about Ron , but I wo n't promise not to get in a little flirtation on my own account . ''
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 6]: Jack 's wife laughed happily .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 10]: `` Flirt away -- it will cheer him up !
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 15]: I 'll put the boys to bed , and give you a fine opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 9]: Here they come , back from their walk .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 12]: I must hurry , dear , and cut bread and butter .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 17]: I 'll carry down the hat , and put it on when Jack comes in . ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 14]: Aunt Margot 's appearance at tea was hailed with a somewhat qualified approval .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 54]: `` You must talk to _ us _ , mother , '' Jim said sternly ; `` talk properly , not only , ` Yes , dear , ' ` No , dear , ' like you do sometimes , and then go on speaking to her about what we ca n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 8]: She 's had you all afternoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 7]: `` So I have , Jim .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 6]: It 's your turn now .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 8]: What do you want to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 6]: Jim immediately lapsed into silence .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 36]: Having gained his point , he had no remark to offer , but Pat lifted his curly head and asked eagerly -- `` Muzzer , shall I ever grow up to be a king ? ''
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 15]: `` No , my son ; little boys like you are never kings . ''
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 16]: `` Not if I 'm very good , and do what I 'm told ? ''
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 9]: `` No , dear , not even then .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 23]: No one can be a king unless his father is a king , too , or some very , very great man .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 11]: What has put that in your head , I wonder ?
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 10]: Why do you want to be a king ? ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 40]: Pat widened his clear grey eyes ; the afternoon sunshine shone on his ruffled head , turning his curls to gold , until he looked like some exquisite cherub , too good and beautiful for this wicked world . ''
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 36]: 'Cause if I was a king I could take people prisoners and cut off their heads , and stick them upon posts , '' he said sweetly ; his mother and aunt exchanged horrified glances .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 47]: Pat alternated between moods of angelic tenderness , when every tiger was a `` good , _ good _ tiger , '' and naughty children `` never did it any more , '' and a condition of frank cannibalism , when he literally wallowed in atrocities .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 12]: His mother forbode to lecture , but judiciously turned the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 13]: `` Kings can do much nicer things than that , Patsy boy .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 13]: Our kind King Edward does n't like cutting off heads a bit .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 14]: He is always trying to prevent men from fighting with each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 5]: `` Is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 6]: `` Yes , he is .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 15]: People call him the Peace-maker , because he prevents so many wars . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 6]: _ Bother _ him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 4]: cried Pat fervently .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 4]: Margot giggled helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 21]: Mrs Martin stared fixedly out of the window , and Jim in his turn took up the ball of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 10]: `` Mummie , will you die before me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 12]: `` I ca n't tell , dear ; nobody knows . ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 8]: `` Will daddy die before me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 6]: `` Probably he will . ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 12]: `` May I have his penknife when he 's dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 16]: `` I think it 's about time to cut up that lovely new cake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 10]: cried Margot , saving the situation with admirable promptitude .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 23]: `` We bought it for you this afternoon , and it tastes of chocolate , and all sorts of good things . ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 48]: The bait was successful , and a silence followed , eloquent of intense enjoyment ; then the table was cleared and various games were played , in the midst of which Jack 's whistle sounded from without , and his wife and sons rushed to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 42]: They looked a typical family group as they re - entered the room , Edith happily hanging on to his arm , the boys prancing round his feet , and the onlooker felt a little pang of loneliness at the sight .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 18]: John Martin was a tall , well-made man , with a clean-shaven face and deep-set grey eyes .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 49]: He was pale and lined , and a nervous twitching of the eyelids testified to the strain through which he had passed , but it was a strong face and a pleasant face , and , when he looked at his wife , a face of indescribable tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 43]: At the moment he was smiling , for it was always a pleasure to see his pretty sister-in-law , and to-night Edith 's anxious looks had departed , and she skipped by his side as eager and excited as the boys themselves .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 14]: `` Dad , dad , has there been any more ` splosions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 16]: `` Has n't there been no fearful doings on in the world , daddy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 3]: `` Jack !
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 2]: Jack !
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 7]: I 've got a new tonic .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 11]: It has done me such a lot of good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 8]: Jack turned from one to the other .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 13]: `` No , boys , no , -- no more accidents to-day !
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 6]: What is it , darling ?
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 4]: You look radiant .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 6]: What is the joke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 10]: `` Look out of the window for a minute !
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 16]: Margot , you talk to him , and do n't let him look round . ''
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 28]: Edith pinned on the new hat before the mirror , carefully adjusting the angles , and pulling out her cloudy hair to fill in the necessary spaces .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 38]: Her cheeks were flushed , her eyes sparkled ; it was no longer the worn white wife , but a pretty , coquettish girl , who danced up to Jack 's side with saucy , uplifted head .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 8]: What do you think of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 12]: The answer of the glowing eyes was more eloquent than words .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 19]: Jack whistled softly beneath his breath , walking slowly round and round to take in the whole effect .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 10]: `` I say , that _ is _ fetching !
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 14]: That 's something like a hat you wore the summer we were engaged .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 8]: You do n't look a day older .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 11]: Where did you run that to earth , darling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 11]: `` Ca n't you see Bond Street in every curve ?
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 8]: I should have thought it was self-evident .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 24]: Margot said I was shabby , and that a new hat would do me good , so we went out and bought it .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 7]: Do you think I am extravagant ?
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 25]: It 's better to spend on this than on medicine , and three guineas is n't expensive for real lace , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 18]: She peered in her husband 's face with simulated anxiety , but his smile breathed pleasure unqualified .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 12]: `` I 'm delighted that you have bought something at last !
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 15]: You have not spent a penny on yourself for goodness knows how long . ''
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 4]: `` Goose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 3]: cried Edith .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 9]: `` He has swallowed it at a gulp .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 10]: Three guineas , indeed -- as if I dare !
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 47]: Four and eleven-pence three-farthings in Edgware Road , and my old lace veil , and one of the paste buttons you gave me at Christmas , and some roses off last year 's hat , and Margot 's clever fingers , and my -- pretty face !
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 9]: Do you think I am pretty still ? ''
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 9]: `` I should rather think I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 35]: Jack framed his wife 's face in his hands , stooping to kiss the soft flushed cheeks as fondly as he had done in the time of that other lace-wreathed hat six years before .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 33]: Pat and Jim returned to their dominoes , bored by such foolish proceedings on the part of their parents , while Margot covered her face with her hands , with ostentatious propriety .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 8]: `` This is no place for me !
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 6]: Consider my feelings , Jack .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 24]: I 'm like a story I once read in an old volume of _ Good Words _ , ` Lovely yet Unloved ! '
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 23]: When you have quite finished love-making , I want a private chat with you , while Edie puts the boys to bed .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 35]: They will hate me for suggesting such a thing , but it is already past their hour , and I must have ten minutes ' talk on a point of life and death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 12]: `` Come away , boys ; we are not wanted here .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 15]: Daddy will come upstairs and see you again before you go to sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 25]: Mother and sons departed together , and Jack Martin sat down on the corner of the sofa and leant his head on his hand .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 30]: With his wife 's departure the light went out of his face , but he smiled at his sister - in-law with an air of affectionate _ camaraderie _ .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 9]: `` You are a little brick , Margot !
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 9]: You have done Edie a world of good .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 9]: What can I do for you in return ?
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 7]: I am at your service . ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 37]: Margot pulled forward the chair that her sister had chosen as the least lumpy which the room afforded , and seated herself before him , returning his glance with an odd mixture of mischief and embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 6]: `` It 's about Ron .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 9]: The year of probation is nearly over . ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 6]: `` I know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 17]: `` Two months more will decide whether he is to be a broker or a poet .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 14]: It will mean death to Ronald to be sent into the City . ''
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 6]: `` You are wrong there .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 29]: If he is a poet , no amount of brokering will alter the fact , any more than it will change the colour of his eyes or hair .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 10]: It is bound to come out sooner or later .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 29]: You will probably think me a brute , if I suggest that a little discipline and knowledge of the world might improve the value of his writings . ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 6]: `` Yes , I will !
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 19]: What does a poet want with a knowledge of the world , in the common , sordid sense ?
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 14]: Let him keep his mind unsullied , and be an inspiration to others .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 35]: When we were children , we used to keep birds in the nursery , in a very fine cage with golden bars , and we fed them with every bird delicacy we could find .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 16]: They lived for a little time , and tried to sing , poor brave things !
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 24]: We threw away the cage in a fury , after finding one soft dead thing after another lying huddled up in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 12]: No one shall cage Ronald , if I can prevent it !
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 23]: It 's no use pretending to be cold-blooded and middle-aged , Jack , for I know you are with us at heart .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 17]: This means every bit as much to Ron as your business troubles do to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 11]: Jack drew in his breath with a wince of pain .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 12]: `` Well , what is it you wish me to do ?
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 26]: I am afraid I have very little influence in the literary world , and I have always heard that introductions do more harm than good .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 21]: An editor would soon ruin his paper if he accepted all the manuscripts pressed upon him by admiring relatives . ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 13]: `` But you see I do n't ask you for an introduction .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 18]: It 's just a piece of information I want , which I ca n't get for myself .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 9]: You know the _ Loadstar Magazine _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 6]: `` Certainly I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 14]: `` Well , the _ Loadstar _ is -- the _ Loadstar _ !
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 7]: The summit of Ron 's ambition .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 28]: It 's the magazine of all others which he likes and admires , and the editor is known to be a man of great power and discernment .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 25]: It is said that if he has the will , he can do more than any man in London to help on young writers .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 15]: It is useless sending manuscripts , for he refuses to consider unsolicited poetical contributions .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 23]: He shuts himself up in a fastness in Fleet Street , and the door thereof is guarded with dragons with lying tongues .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 3]: I know !
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 29]: I have made it my business to inquire , but I feel convinced that if he once gave Ron a fair reading , he would acknowledge his gifts .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 22]: There is no hope of approaching him direct , but I intend to get hold of him all the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 15]: Jack Martin looked up at that , his thin face twitching into a smile .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 5]: `` You little baggage !
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 8]: and you expect me to help you .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 14]: I must hear some more about this before I involve myself any further .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 9]: What mischief are you up to now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 16]: `` Dear Jack , what can I do ; a little girl like me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 23]: cried Miss Margot , mightily meek all of a sudden , as she realised that she had ventured a step too far .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 13]: `` I would n't for the whole world get you into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 23]: It 's just a little , simple thing that I want you to find out from some one in the office . ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 12]: `` I do n't know any one in the office . ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 11]: `` But you could find out some one who did ?
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 11]: For instance , you know that Mr Oliver who illustrates ?
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 11]: I 've seen his things in the _ Loadstar _ .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 17]: You could ask him in a casual , off-hand manner without ever mentioning our name . ''
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 8]: `` What could I ask him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 9]: `` Such a nice , simple little question !
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 26]: Just the name of the place where the editor proposes to spend this summer holiday , and the date on which he will start . ''
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 46]: Jack stared in amazement , but the meekest , most demure of maidens confronted him from the opposite chair , with eyes so translucently candid , lips so guilelessly sweet , that it seemed incredible that any hidden mischief could lurk behind the innocent question .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 15]: Nevertheless seven years ' intimacy with Miss Margot made Jack Martin suspicious of mischief .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 10]: `` What do you know about this editor man ?
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 6]: Have you seen him anywhere ?
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 12]: He is handsome , I suppose , and a bachelor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 7]: `` You 're a wretch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 4]: retorted Miss Margot .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 69]: `` I do n't know the man from Adam , and he may be a Methuselah for all I care ; but if possible I want it to happen that Ron and I chance to be staying in the same place , in the same house , or hotel , or _ pension _ , whichever it may be , when he goes away for his yearly rest .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 27]: We are going to the country in any case -- why should we not be guided by the choice of those older and wiser than ourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 18]: Why should we not meet the one of all others we are most anxious to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 4]: `` Just so !
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 30]: and having done so , you will confide in the editor that Ronald is an embryo Poet Laureate , and try to enlist his kind sympathy and assistance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 9]: Margot smiled ; a smile of lofty superiority .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 5]: `` No , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 7]: I know rather better than that !
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 22]: He will be out on a holiday , poor man , and wo n't want to be troubled with literary aspirants .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 10]: He has enough of them all the year round .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 41]: We 'll never mention poetry , but we will try to get to know _ him _ , and to make him like us so much that he will want to see more of us when we return to town .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 47]: No one can live in the same house with Ron , and have an opportunity of talking to him day by day , without feeling that he is different from other boys , and alone together in the country one can never tell what may happen .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 12]: Opportunities may arise , too ; opportunities for help and service .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 27]: We would be on the look-out for them , and would try by every means in our power to forge the first link in the chain .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 15]: Do n't look so solemn , old Jack , it 's all perfectly innocent !
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 12]: You can trust me to do nothing you would disapprove . ''
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 6]: `` I believe I can .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 14]: You are a madcap , Margot , but you are a good girl .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 35]: I 'm not afraid of you , but I imagine that the editor will be a match for a dozen youngsters like you and Ron , and will soon see through your little scheme .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 9]: However , I 'll do what I can .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 28]: In big offices holiday arrangements have to be made a good while ahead , so it ought not to be difficult to get the information you want .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 16]: Now I must be off upstairs to see the boys before they get into bed .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 11]: Shall I see you again when I come down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 5]: `` No , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 38]: I 've played truant since half-past eleven , so I shall have to hang about the end of the terrace until father appears , and go in under his wing , to escape a scolding from Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 11]: I had arranged to pay calls with her this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 21]: I wonder how it is that my memory is so dreadfully uncertain about things I do n't want to do !
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 10]: Good-bye then , Jack , and a hundred thanks .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 9]: Posterity will thank you for your help . ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 8]: Jack Martin laughed and shrugged his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 16]: He had a man 's typical disbelief in the ability of his wife 's relatives .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 3]: AN EXPLOSION .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 34]: Relationships were somewhat strained in the Vane household during the next few weeks , the two elder members being banded together in an unusual partnership to bring about the confusion of the younger .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 14]: `` I ca n't understand what you are making such a fuss about .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 11]: You 'll have to give in , in the end .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 6]: You a poet , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 3]: What next ?
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 35]: If you would come down to breakfast in time , and give over burning the gas till one o'clock in the morning , it would be more to the point than writing silly verses .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 15]: I 'd be ashamed to waste my time scribbling nonsense all day long ! ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 29]: So cried Agnes , in Martha-like irritation , and Ronald turned his eyes upon her with that deep , dreamy gaze which only added fuel to the flame .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 21]: He was not angry with Agnes , who , as she herself truly said , `` did not understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 22]: Out of the storm of her anger an inspiration had fluttered towards him , like a crystal out of the surf .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 18]: `` The Worker and the Dreamer '' -- he would make a poem out of that idea !
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 42]: Already the wonderful inner vision pictured the scene -- the poet sitting idle on the hillside , the man of toil labouring in the heat and glare of the fields , casting glances of scorn and impatience at the inert form .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 11]: The lines began to take shape in his brain . ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 65]: ... And the worker worked from the misty dawn , Till the east was golden and red ; But the dreamer 's dream which he thought to scorn , Lived on when they both were dead ... '' `` I asked him three times over if he would have another cup of coffee , and he stared at me as if he were daft !
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 27]: I believe he _ is _ half daft at times , and he will grow worse and worse , if Margot encourages him like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 13]: Agnes announced to her father , on his weary return from City .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 49]: It was one of Agnes 's exemplary habits to refuse all invitations which could prevent her being at home to welcome her father every afternoon , and assist him to tea and scones , accompanied by a minute _ resume _ of the bad news of the day .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 59]: What the housemaid had broken ; what the cat had spilt ; the parlourmaid 's impertinences ; the dressmaker 's delinquencies ; Ronald 's vapourings ; the new and unabashed transgressions of Margot -- each in its turn was dropped into the tired man 's cup with the lumps of sugar , and stirred round with the cream .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 7]: There was no escaping the ordeal .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 45]: On the hottest day of summer there was the boiling tea , with the hot muffins , and the rich , indigestible cake , exactly as they had appeared amidst the ice and snows of January ; and the accompanied recital hardly varied more .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 21]: It was a positive relief to hear that the chimney had smoked , or the parrot had had a fit .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 30]: Once a year Agnes departed on a holiday , handing over the keys to Margot , who meekly promised to follow in her footsteps ; and then , heigho !
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 22]: for a fortnight of Bohemia , with every arrangement upside down , and appearing vastly improved by the change of position .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 29]: Instead of tea in the drawing-room , two easy-chairs on the balcony overlooking the Park ; cool iced drinks sipped through straws , and luscious dishes of fruit .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 35]: Instead of Agnes , stiff and starched and tailor-made , a radiant vision in muslin and laces , with a ruffled golden head , and distracting little feet peeping out from beneath the frills .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 7]: `` Is n't this fun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 4]: cried the vision .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 10]: `` Do n't you feel quite frivolous and Continental ?
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 23]: Let 's pretend we are a newly-married couple , and you adore me , and ca n't deny a thing I ask !
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 35]: There was a blouse in Bond Street this morning ... Sweetest darling , would n't you like me to buy it to - morrow , and show me off in it to your friends ?
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 10]: I told them to send it home on approval .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 21]: I knew you could n't bear to see your little girl unhappy for the sake of four miserable guineas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 62]: This sort of treatment was very agreeable to a worn-out City man , and as a pure matter of bargaining , the blouse was a cheap price to pay for the refreshment of that cool , restful hour , and the pretty chatter which smoothed the tired lines out of his face , and made him laugh and feel young again .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 67]: Another night Mr Vane would be decoyed to a rendezvous at Earl 's Court , when Margot would wear the blouse , and insist upon turning round the pearl band on her third finger , so as to imitate a wedding-ring , looking at him in languishing fashion across the table the while , to the delight of fellow-diners and his own mingled horror and amusement .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 29]: Then they would wander about beneath the glimmer of the fairy-lights , listening to the band , as veritable a pair of lovers as any among the throng .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 38]: As summer approached , Mr Vane 's thoughts turned to these happy occasions , and it strengthened his indignation against his son to realise that this year a cloud had arisen between himself and his dearest daughter .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 45]: Margot had openly ranked herself against him , which was a bitter pill to swallow , and , so far from showing an inclination to repent as the prescribed time drew to a close , the conspirators appeared only to be the more determined .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 20]: Long envelopes were continually being dispatched to the post , to appear with astonishing dispatch on the family breakfast-table .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 20]: The pale , wrought look on Ronald 's face as he caught sight of them against the white cloth !
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 26]: No parent 's heart could fail to be wrung for the lad 's misery ; but the futility of it added to the inward exasperation .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 24]: Thousands of men walking the streets of London vainly seeking for work , while this misguided youth scorned a safe and secure position !
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 24]: The pent-up irritation exploded one Sunday evening , when the presence of Edith and her husband recalled the consciousness of yet another disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 23]: Mr Vane had made his own way , and , after the manner of successful men , had little sympathy with failure .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 16]: The presence of the two pale , dejected-looking young men filled him with impatient wrath .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 18]: At the supper-table he was morose and irritable , until a chance remark set the fuse ablaze .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 5]: `` Yes , yes !
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 26]: You all imagine yourselves so clever nowadays that you can afford to despise the experience of men who knew the world before you were born !
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 12]: I can see you look at each other as I speak !
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 5]: I 'm not blind !
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 28]: I 'm an out-of-date old fogey who does n't know what he is talking about , and has n't even the culture to appreciate his own children .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 32]: Because one has composed a bundle of rhymes that no one will publish , he must needs assume an attitude of forbearance with the man who supplies the bread and butter !
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 45]: I 've never been accustomed to regard failure as an instance of superiority , but no doubt I am wrong -- no doubt I am behind the times -- no doubt you are all condemning me in your minds as a blundering old ignoramus !
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 24]: A father is nothing but a nuisance who must be tolerated for the sake of what can be got out of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 12]: He looked round the table with his tired , angry eyes .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 20]: Jack Martin sat with bent head and lips pressed tightly together , repressing himself for his wife 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 5]: Edith struggled against tears .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 9]: Agnes served the salad dressing and grunted approval .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 21]: Margot , usually so pert and ready of retort , stared at the cloth with a frown of strained distress .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 8]: Only Ronald faced him with steady eyes .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 15]: `` That is not true , father , and you know it yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 8]: `` I know nothing , it appears !
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 7]: That 's just what I say .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 8]: Why do n't you undertake my education ?
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 44]: You never show me your work ; you take the advice of a child like Margot , and leave me out in the cold , and then expect me to have faith enough to believe you a genius without a word of proof .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 9]: You want to become known to the public ?
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 18]: Very well , bring down some of that precious poetry and read it aloud to us now !
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 15]: You ca n't say then that I have n't given you a chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 6]: It was a frightful prospect !
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 21]: The criticism of the family is always an ordeal to the budding author , and the moment was painfully unpropitious .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 18]: It would have been as easy for a bird to sing in the presence of the fowler .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 17]: Ronald turned white to the lips , but his reply came as unwavering as the last .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 20]: `` Do you think you would care to hear even the finest poetry in the world read aloud to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 8]: Mine is very far from the best .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 20]: I will read it to you if you wish , but you must give me a happier opportunity . ''
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 4]: Agnes laughed shortly .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 3]: `` Shilly-shally !
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 9]: I ca n't understand what opportunity you want .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 32]: If it 's good , it ca n't be spoilt by being read one day instead of another ; if it 's bad , it wo n't be improved by waiting .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 11]: This is cherry-pie , and there is some tipsy cake .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 8]: Edith , which will you have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 5]: Edith would have neither .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 18]: She was still trembling with wounded indignation against her father for that cruel hit at her husband .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 31]: She sat pale and silent , vowing never to enter the house again until Jack 's fortunes were restored ; never to accept another penny from her father 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 11]: She was comparatively little interested in the discussion about poetry .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 28]: Ron was a dear boy ; she would be sorry if he were disappointed , but Jack was her life , and Jack was working for bread !
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 38]: If she had followed the moment 's impulse , she would have risen and left the room , and though better counsel prevailed , she could not control the spice of temper which made the cherry-pie abhorrent .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 38]: Jack , as a man , saw no reason why he should deny himself the mitigations of the situation ; he helped himself to cream and sifted sugar with leisurely satisfaction , and sensibly softened in spirit .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 25]: After all , there was a measure of truth in what the old man said , and his bark was worse than his bite .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 100]: If his own boy , Pat , took it into his head to go off on some scatter-brain prank when he came of age , it would be a big trouble , or if later on he came a cropper in business -- Jack waited for a convenient pause , and then deftly turned the conversation to politics , and by the time that cheese was on the table , he and his father-in-law were discussing the mysteries of the last Education Bill with the satisfaction of men who hold similar views on the inanities of the opposite party .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 48]: Later on they bade each other a friendly good-night ; but Edith went straight from the bedroom to the street , and clung tightly to her husband 's arm as they walked along the pavement opposite the Park , enjoying the quiet before entering the busy streets .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 8]: `` We 'll never come again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 4]: she cried tremulously .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 20]: `` We 'll stay at home , and have a supper of bread and cheese and love with it !
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 22]: You sha n't be taunted and sneered at by any man on earth , if he were twenty times my father !
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 21]: What an angel you were , Jack , to keep quiet , and then talk as if nothing had happened !
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 7]: I was choking with rage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 5]: `` Poor darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 5]: said Jack Martin tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 9]: `` You take things too much to heart .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 20]: It 's rough on you , but you must remember that it 's rough on the old man too .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 13]: You are his eldest child , and the beauty of the family .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 26]: He hoped great things for you , and it is wormwood and gall to his proud spirit to see you struggling along in cheap lodgings .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 9]: We ca n't wonder if he explodes occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 25]: It 's wonderful that he is as civil to me as he is ; he has put me down as a hopeless blunderer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 28]: There was a touch of bitterness in the speaker 's voice , for all his brave assumption of composure , and his wife winced at the sound .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 18]: She clung more tightly to his arm , and raised her face to his with eager comfort .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 8]: `` Do n't mind what he says !
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 8]: Do n't mind what any one says .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 5]: I believe in you .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 4]: I trust you !
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 27]: The good times will come back again , dear , and we will be happier than ever , because we shall know how to appreciate them .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 24]: Even if we were always poor , I 'd rather have you for my husband than the greatest millionaire in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 8]: `` Thank God for my wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 5]: said Jack Martin solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 4]: A MANAGING WOMAN .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 13]: Meanwhile Ronald and Margot were holding a conclave on the third floor .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 11]: `` I must get away from home at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 5]: cried the lad feverishly .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 11]: `` I ca n't write in this atmosphere of antagonism .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 7]: I breathe it in the air .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 6]: It poisons everything I do .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 37]: If I am to have only three more months of liberty , I must spend them in my own way , in the country with you , Margot , away from all this fret and turmoil .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 6]: It 's my last chance .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 19]: I might as well throw up the sponge at once , if we are to stay here . ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 23]: `` Yes , we must go away ; for father 's sake as well as our own , '' replied Margot slowly .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 19]: She leant her head against the back of her chair , and pushed the hair from her brow .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 63]: Without the smile and the sparkle she was astonishingly like her brother , -- both had oval faces , well-marked eyebrows , flexible scarlet lips , and hazel eyes , but the girl 's chin was made in a firmer mould , and the expression of dreamy abstraction which characterised the boy 's face was on hers replaced by animation and alertness .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 26]: `` Father will be miserable to-night because he flared out at supper ; but he 'll flare again unless we put him out of temptation .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 27]: He likes his own way as much as we like ours , and it 's so difficult for parents to realise that their children are grown-up .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 36]: We seem silly babies in his eyes , and he longs to be able to shut us up in the nursery until we are sorry , as he used to do in the old days .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 13]: As for our own plans , Ron , they are all settled .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 12]: I was just waiting for a quiet opportunity to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 22]: I have been busy planning and scheming for some time back , but it was only to-night that my clue arrived .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 13]: Jack , my emissary , slipped it into my hand after supper .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 4]: Read that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 28]: She held out a half sheet of paper with an air of triumph , on which were scribbled the following lines : -- `` Name , Elgood .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 7]: Great walker , climber , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 27]: Goes every June with brother to small lonely inn -LRB- Nag 's Head -RRB- -- Glenaire -- six miles ' drive from S -- , Perthshire .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 55]: Scenery fine , but wild ; accommodation limited ; landlady refuses lady visitors , which fact is supposed to be one of the chief attractions ; Elgood reported to be tough nut to crack ; chief object of holiday , quiet and seclusion ; probably dates two or three weeks from June 15 . ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 9]: Ronald read , and lifted a bewildered face .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 7]: `` What does it all mean ?
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 9]: How do this man 's plans affect ours ?
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 21]: I do n't understand what you are driving at , Margot , but I should love to go to Scotland !
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 45]: The mountains in the dawning , and the shadows at night , and the dark green of the firs against the blue of the heather -- oh , would n't it be life to see it all again , after this terrible brick city !
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 10]: How clever of you to think of Scotland ! ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 18]: `` My dear boy , if it had been Southend it would have been all the same .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 38]: We are going where Mr Elgood goes , for Mr Elgood , you must know , is the editor of _ The Loadstar _ -- the man of all others who could give you a helping hand .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 41]: Now , Ron , I am quite prepared for you to be shocked , but I know that you will agree in the end , so please give in as quickly as possible , and do n't make a fuss .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 20]: You have been sending unknown poems to unknown editors for the last two years , with practically no result .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 15]: It 's not the fault of your poems -- of that I am convinced .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 27]: In ten years ' time every one will rave about them , but you ca n't afford to wait ten years , or even ten months .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 48]: Our only hope is to interest some big literary light , whose verdict ca n't be ignored , and persuade him to plead your cause , or at least to give you such encouragement as will satisfy father that you are not deluded by your own conceit .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 64]: I 've thought and thought , and lain awake thinking , till I feel quite tired out , and then at last I hit on this plan , -- to find out where Mr Elgood is going for his holidays , and go to the same place , so that he ca n't help getting to know us , whatever he may wish .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 10]: Ordinary methods are useless at this stage of affairs .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 12]: We must try a desperate remedy for a desperate situation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 8]: `` I 'm sure I am willing .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 18]: I would try any crazy plan that had a possibility of success for the next three months .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 6]: But yours is n't possible .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 7]: The landlady wo n't take ladies .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 10]: That 's an unsurmountable objection at the start . ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 15]: But Margot only preened her head with a smile of undaunted self - confidence .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 9]: `` She 'll take _ me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 4]: she declared complacently .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 44]: `` She ca n't refuse me shelter for a night at least , after such a long , tiring journey , and I 'll be such a perfect dear , that after twenty-four hours she would n't be bribed to do without me !
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 10]: You can leave Mrs McNab to me , Ron .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 5]: I 'll manage her .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 51]: Very well then , there we shall be , away from the madding crowd , shut up in that lonely Highland glen , in the quaint little inn ; two nice , amiable , attractive young people with nothing to do but make ourselves amiable and useful to our companions .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 32]: Mr Elgood ca n't be young ; he is certainly middle-aged , perhaps quite old ; he will be very tired after his year 's work , and perhaps even ill .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 14]: Very well then , we will wait upon him and save him trouble !
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 24]: You shall bicycle to the village for his tobacco and papers , and I 'll read aloud and bring him cups of tea .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 22]: We wo n't worry him , but we 'll be there all the time , waiting and watching for an opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 10]: One never knows what may happen in the country .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 16]: He might slip into the river some day , and you could drag him out .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 16]: Ronald , would n't it be perfectly lovely if you could save his life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 25]: The two youthful faces confronted each other breathlessly for a moment , and then simultaneously boy and girl burst into a peal of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 25]: They laughed and laughed again , till the tear-drops shone on Margot 's lashes , and Ronald 's pale face was flushed with colour .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 5]: `` You silly girl !
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 5]: What nonsense you talk !
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 15]: I 'm afraid Mr Elgood wo n't give me a chance of rescuing him .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 42]: He wo n't want to be bothered with literary aspirants on his summer holiday , and he will guess that I want his help -- '' `` He must n't guess anything of the kind until the end of the time .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 9]: You must even never mention the word poetry .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 13]: It would neither be fair to him , nor wise for ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 36]: What we have to do is to make ourselves so charming and interesting that at the end of the three weeks he will want to help us as much as we want to be helped .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 21]: I understand how to manage old gentlemen I 've had experience , you see , in rather a difficult school .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 3]: Poor father !
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 13]: I must run down to comfort him before I go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 21]: I feel sure he is sitting in the library , puffing away at his pipe , and feeling absolutely retched .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 10]: He always does after he has been cross . ''
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 8]: Ronald 's face hardened with youthful disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 7]: `` Why should you pity him ?
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 7]: It 's his own fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 21]: `` That makes it all the harder , for he has remorse to trouble him , as well as disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 11]: You must not be hard on the pater , Ron .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 49]: Remember he has looked forward to having you with him in business ever since you were born , and it is awfully hard on him to be disappointed just when he is beginning to feel old and tired , and would be glad of a son 's help .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 14]: It is not easy to give up the dream of twenty years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 4]: Ronald felt conscience-stricken .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 28]: He knew in his own heart that he would find it next to impossible to relinquish his own dawning ambitions , and the thought silenced his complaints .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 12]: He looked at his sister and smiled his peculiarly sweet smile .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 9]: `` You have a wide heart , Margot .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 14]: It can sympathise with both plaintiff and defendant at the same time . ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 7]: `` Why , of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 4]: asserted Margot easily .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 15]: `` I love them both , you see , and that makes things easy .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 12]: Go to bed , dear boy , and dream of Glenaire !
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 10]: Your chance is coming at the eleventh hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 35]: The light flashed in the lad 's eyes as he bent his head for the good - night kiss -- a light of hope and expectation , which was his sister 's best reward .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 29]: Ron had worked , fretted , and worried of late , and his health itself might break down under the strain , for his constitution was not strong .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 25]: During one long , anxious year there had been fear of lung trouble , and mental agitation of any kind told quickly upon him .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 36]: Margot 's thoughts flew longingly to the northern glen where the wind blew fresh and cool over the heather , with never a taint of smoke and grime to mar its God - given purity .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 17]: All that would be medicine indeed , after the year 's confinement in the murky city !
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 26]: Ron would lift up his head again , like a plant refreshed with dew ; body and mind alike would then expand in jubilant freedom .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 18]: Margot crept down the darkened staircase , treading with precaution as she passed her sister 's room .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 36]: The hall beneath was in utter darkness , for it was against Agnes 's economical instincts to leave a light burning after eleven o'clock , even for the convenience of the master of the house .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 85]: When Mr Vane demurred , she pointed out that it was the easiest thing in the world for him to put a match to the candle which was left waiting for his use , and that each electric light cost -- she had worked it all out , and mentioned a definite and substantial sum which would be wasted by the end of the year if the light were allowed to burn in hall or staircase while he enjoyed his nightly read and smoke .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 11]: `` Would you wish this money to be wasted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 19]: she asked calmly ; and thus questioned , there was no alternative but to reply in the negative .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 36]: It would never do for the head of the house to pose as an advocate of extravagance ; but all the same he was irritated by the necessity , and with Agnes for enforcing it .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 17]: Margot turned the handle of the door and stood upon the threshold looking across the room .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 7]: It was as she had imagined .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 39]: On the big leather chair beside the tireless grate sat Mr Vane , one hand supporting the pipe at which he was drearily puffing from time to time , the other hanging limp and idle by his side .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 27]: Close at hand stood his writing-table , the nearer corner piled high with books , papers , and reviews , but to-night they had remained undisturbed .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 16]: The inner tragedy of the man 's own life had precluded interest in outside happenings .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 5]: He wanted his wife !
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 31]: That was the incessant cry of his heart , which , diminished somewhat by the passage of the years , awoke to fresh intensity at each new crisis of life !
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 66]: The one love of his youth and his manhood ; the dearest , wisest , truest friend that was ever sent by God to be the helpmeet of man -- why had she been taken from him just when he needed her most , when the children were growing up , and her son , the longed-for Benjamin , was at his most susceptible age ?
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 15]: It was a mystery which could never be solved this side of the grave .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 45]: As a Christian Mr Vane hung fast to the belief that love and wisdom were behind the cloud ; but , though his friends commented on his bravery and composure , no one but himself knew at what a cost his courage was sustained .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 42]: Every now and then , when the longing was like an ache in his soul , and when he felt weary and dispirited , and irritated by the self-will of the children who were children no longer , then , alas !
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 31]: he was apt to forget himself , and to utter bitter , hasty words which would have grieved _ her _ ears , if she had been near to listen .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 35]: After each of these outbreaks he suffered tortures of remorse and loneliness , realising that by his own deed he had alienated his children ; grieving because they did not , could not understand !
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 6]: Except , perhaps , Margot !
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 25]: Margot , the third little daughter , whose coming in the place of the much-desired boy had been a keen disappointment to both parents .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 50]: The mother had been doubly tender to the child , as if to compensate for that passing pang ; but Mr Vane recalled with contrition that he himself had remained indifferent and neglectful until two or three years later , when at last Ronald had made his tardy appearance .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 60]: Then ensued constant visits to the nursery , to examine the progress of the son and heir ; and after the daily questioning and inspection it was impossible to resist bestowing some little attention on the bewitching curly-headed , chubby-cheeked little damsel who clung to his trouser leg , and raised entreating eyes from the altitude of his knee .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 62]: Mr Vane felt guiltily conscious of having neglected this child , and now in the content of gratified ambition he proceeded to make good that neglect by petting her to her heart 's desire , until as time went on it became an open question whether his daily visits were not paid even more to the girl than to the boy .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 26]: Ronald remained his father 's pride , but Margot was his joy , his pet , -- in years to come his comfort and companion .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 30]: There was more of the dead mother in this last daughter than in either of the elder sisters ; she had her mother 's gift of insight and understanding .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 60]: This was not the first time of many that she had crept downstairs after the household was in bed , to play David to his Saul , and to-night , as he turned his eyes to the doorway and recognised her slight figure , it was not surprise which he felt , but rather a shamed and uneasy embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 3]: `` Margot !
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 5]: It 's very late !
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 8]: Why are you not in bed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 12]: She shut the door and crossed the room to his side .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 9]: `` I wanted to talk to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 14]: `` To remonstrate , I suppose , for what I said at supper !
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 15]: You and Ron are angry , no doubt , and feel yourselves badly used .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 12]: You have come to fight his battles , as usual . ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 9]: I do n't want to fight at all .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 16]: Just to talk to you a little while , and say I 'm sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 31]: She seated herself on the arm of his chair as she spoke , and leant her shoulder carelessly against his ; but he edged away , still sore and suspicious .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 6]: `` Sorry for what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 4]: `` For you !
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 7]: Because _ you 're _ sorry .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 16]: Because I knew you 'd be sitting alone , doing nothing else but being sorry .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 29]: So I came down to put my arms round your dear old neck , and kiss your dear old head , and tell you that I love you .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 3]: Badly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 3]: Margot understood .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 19]: In just such pretty simple words would his own Margaret have chased away the black spirit years ago .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 38]: Mr Vane puffed at his pipe , staring fixedly across the room , to conceal the sudden moistening of his eyes , but his figure sank back into its old place , no longer repulsing the caress .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 17]: `` It 's a hard task for a lonely man to manage a family of children .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 13]: He gets all the kicks , and none of the thanks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 16]: `` That 's exaggeration , dear -- which you are always protesting against in others .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 24]: We are tiresome and self-willed , but we know very well how much we owe to you , and your care for us .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 26]: It hurts us as much as it hurts you when we disagree ; but we 've got to live our own lives , father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 34]: `` And you imagine that you know better how to set about it than a man who has lived more than twice as long , and has had ten times the experience ? ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 3]: Margot hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 15]: `` In a way -- no ; in a way -- _ yes _ !
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 46]: We know ourselves , daddy , as even you can not do , and it is impossible for one person , however kind and wise he may be , to lay down the law as to what is to be the object of other lives .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 19]: We all have our own ambitions ; what could satisfy one , would leave another empty and aching .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 8]: Agnes , for instance , and me !
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 5]: How different we are !
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 43]: Her idea of happiness would be a house worked by machinery , where every hour the same things happened at precisely the same moment , and there were never any cataracts and breaks , and nobody ever came down late to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 19]: _ I _ should like to have breakfast in bed , and a new excitement every single day !
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 20]: We are not all cut out of one pattern , and we are not children any longer , dear .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 5]: Sometimes you forget that .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 20]: When _ you _ were twenty-three , you were married , and had a home of your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 7]: `` Ron is not twenty-one . ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 26]: `` When you were twenty-one , did you want your own way , or were you willing for other people to decide for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 10]: Mr Vane sighed , and moved his head impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 12]: `` Here we are back again at the same old argument !
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 8]: It 's waste of time , Margot .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 24]: I ca n't alter my ideas , but I 'll try to keep a tighter rein over myself for the next few months .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 11]: We must n't have any more scenes like to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 7]: Margot spoke as gravely as himself .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 29]: `` We must n't , daddy , for your sake as well as ours , and therefore I think it wise to remove the cause of your irritation .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 49]: You said we might go away to the country together , Ron and I , and we have decided on Scotland -- on a glen in Perthshire , six miles from the nearest station , where the landlady of a quaint little inn takes in a few boarders .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 41]: It will be very primitive , I expect , and we shall live on cream and porridge and mountain air , and grow brown and bonnie , and study Nature as we have never had a chance of doing before .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 8]: Six miles from a station , daddy !
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 9]: There 's seclusion , if you like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 13]: Mr Vane knitted his brow , uncertain whether to approve or object .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 21]: `` How did you come to hear of this place , if it is so out of the world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 21]: `` Jack heard of some people who like it so much that they have gone back again and again . ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 17]: Margot paused for a moment , and then added resolutely , `` They go to fish .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 9]: Probably they will be there again this summer .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 12]: They are two brothers -- one of them is quite old .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 9]: I do n't know anything about the other .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 24]: Of course , wherever we stay we shall meet other people -- but you do n't mind that , do you , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 19]: You can trust us not to associate with any one who is not what you would approve ? ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 4]: `` Oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 20]: I am not afraid of you in that way , and Ron is sensible enough where you are concerned .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 7]: He 'll take care of you .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 33]: I would n't allow you to stay at a big hotel without Agnes or some older woman , but you are welcome to your little inn , if it takes your fancy .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 23]: If it rains all day , in Highland fashion , Ronald may discover that there are compensations even in Regent 's Park .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 7]: How soon are you off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 26]: `` The middle of June , if all 's well , and we 'll stay on as long as we are happy and enjoying ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 11]: Then there will be your holiday to consider , dear .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 28]: I thought it would be such a good idea if you took Jack with you , while I went to the seaside with Edith and the boys .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 15]: Jack and you agree so well , and have so many tastes in common .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 11]: You would make splendid _ compagnons de voyage _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 15]: Mr Vane drew back in his chair to stare at her beneath frowning brows .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 21]: `` If there is one thing in this world more objectionable than another , it 's a managing woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 4]: he cried emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 20]: `` Do n't you develop into one , Margot , if you wish to keep any influence over me .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 22]: I 've seen danger signals once or twice lately , and I tell you plainly -- I wo n't stand it !
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 27]: Be satisfied with what you have gained , and carry Ron away to your Highland glen , but leave my holiday alone , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 16]: I 'm quite capable of choosing a companion for myself if I need one . ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 19]: `` Yes , dear , '' said Margot meekly ; but her smile showed no sign of contrition .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 22]: She had heard this terrible indictment times without number , but as yet there had come no waning of her influence .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 50]: As she felt her way carefully up the dark staircase a few minutes later , she smiled to herself with complacent satisfaction ; for not only had the Scotch trip received the parental sanction , but the first step was taken towards securing a holiday for poor tired Jack .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 37]: Mr Vane might protest , but the idea once suggested would take root in his mind , and by the time that it developed into action he would imagine that it was entirely his own inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 5]: What did it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 36]: For Jack 's sake even more than his own it was better that he should be so deluded ; and Margot was happily above the littleness of desiring to monopolise the credit for her ideas .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 20]: So long as a point was gained , she was more than content to remain inconspicuously in the background .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 2]: PREPARATIONS .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 8]: Every one said that it would rain .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 5]: It was most depressing .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 28]: You had only to mention that you intended to spend your summer holiday in a Highland glen , to set the torrent of warning in full flow .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 8]: `` It will rain all the time .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 29]: -- It always rains in Scotland ... You will be soaked ... You will be starved ... You will feel as if you have gone back to winter .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 23]: You will miss all the summer in the South ... You will get rheumatism ... You will be bored to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 38]: On and on it went , each newcomer adding volume to the chorus , until it became quite difficult to remember that one was starting on a pleasure trip , and not on a perilous Arctic exploration .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 7]: `` Take plenty of wraps ! ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 5]: urged the wise ones .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 21]: `` Do n't imagine that you will be able to wear pretty white things , as you do at home .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 25]: Take old things that do n't matter , for no one will see you , and you will never want to wear them again .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 10]: You will shiver round the fire in the evenings .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 6]: Be sure to take rugs .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 11]: You wo n't have half enough blankets on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 20]: I was in the Highlands for a month two years ago , and we had one fine day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 18]: queried Margot of this last Job 's comforter , `` and what was _ that _ like ?
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 15]: Were you glad that you were there for that one day at least ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 16]: The speaker paused , and over her face there passed a wave of illuminating recollection .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 21]: She was a prosaic , middle-aged woman , but for the moment she looked young , -- young and ardent .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 3]: she sighed .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 4]: `` That day !
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 10]: It was wonderful ; I shall never forget it .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 35]: We went to bed cold and tired , looking forward to another dark , depressing morning , and woke in a dazzle of sunlight , to see the mountains outlined against a blue sky .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 40]: We ran out into the road , and held out our hands to the sun , and the wind blew towards us , the soft , wet , heathery wind , and it tasted like -- _ nectar _ !
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 6]: We could not go indoors .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 12]: We walked about all day , and laughed , and sang .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 4]: We walked miles .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 9]: It seemed as if we could not tire .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 11]: I -- I think we were ` fey . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 18]: She paused again , and the light flickered out , leaving her cold and prosaic once more .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 10]: `` The rest of the time was most unfortunate .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 15]: I contracted a severe chill , and my sister-in-law had rheumatism in her ankles .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 48]: Now , my dear , be sure to take good strong boots -- '' Margot and Ronald listened politely to all the good advice which was lavished upon them , but , after the manner of youth , felt convinced that in their case precautions were needless .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 7]: It was going to be fine .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 23]: If it had been wet in previous years , all the more reason why this coming summer should be warm and dry .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 43]: The sun was going to shine ; the clouds were going to roll away ; Mr Elgood was going to fall in love with Ron at first sight , and prove himself all that was wise , and kind , and helpful .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 17]: Delightful optimism of youth , which is worth more than all the wisdom of maturer years !
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 16]: Margot set about her preparations unhampered by the financial troubles which befall less fortunate girls .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 18]: Her father was lavishly generous to his favourite daughter , supplementing her dress allowance by constant gifts .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 28]: It was one of his greatest pleasures in life to see his pretty Margot prettily attired , a pleasure in which the young lady herself fully concurred .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 58]: She had too much good taste to transport all the frills and fripperies of London to a Highland glen ; but , on the other hand , she set her face firmly against the mustard-coloured tweeds affected by so many women for country wear , choosing instead a soft dull blue , a hundred times more becoming .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 46]: For headgear there was a little cap of the same material , with a quill feather stuck jauntily through a fold at the side , while neat , strong little boots and a pair of doeskin gloves gave a delightfully business-like air to the costume .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 15]: In the rug-strap was a capacious golf cloak , displaying a bright plaid lining .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 66]: This was waiting in readiness for the six-mile drive at the end of the journey , and inside the large dress-box was a selection of well-chosen garments -- a white serge coat and skirt for bright weather ; cottons and lawns for the warm days that must surely come ; a velveteen dress for chilly evenings , blouses galore , and even a fur-lined cloak .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 41]: Margot felt a thrill of wondering satisfaction in her own prudence , as she packed this latter garment , on a hot June day , with the scent of roses filling the room from the vase on the toilet table .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 44]: She packed sketching materials also , plenty of fancy-work destined to provide presents for the coming Christmas , a selection of sixpenny novels , and one or two pet classics from her own library , which travelled about with her wherever she went .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 20]: Ronald 's preparations were more easy , for surely no stock-in-trade is so simple as that of an author !
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 23]: His favourite stylographic pen , his favourite note-book , and that was an end of it so far as work was concerned .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 23]: He took his half-plate camera with him , however ; and the two handsome free-wheel bicycles were carefully swathed for the journey .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 59]: `` I ca n't understand why you could n't be content to go to some nice south-country place , instead of travelling to the other end of the country in this dusty weather , '' Agnes opined , as she assiduously fixed the label to every separate piece of the luggage which was piled together in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 18]: `` It 's so foolish to waste time and money when there are nice places at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 43]: Now , there 's Cromer -- '' `` You do n't get heather-clad mountains at Cromer , Agnes , and we sha n't have promenades at Glenaire , nor bands , nor crowds of fashionable people quizzing each other all day long .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 11]: We prefer the real , true , genuine country . ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 14]: `` Oh , well , you 'll be tired of it soon enough !
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 5]: Margot will hate it .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 17]: We shall have you hurrying back at the end of a fortnight , bored to death .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 14]: I do n't think that lock of yours is quite safe , Margot .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 14]: I should n't wonder if you found some things missing when you arrive .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 16]: The guards have a splendid chance on these all-night journeys , '' prophesied Agnes cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 22]: She stared in surprise when Margot burst into a peal of laughter , and repeated , `` Poor old Agnes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 26]: as if she , secure and comfortable at home , were the one to be pitied , instead of the careless travellers into the unknown !
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 68]: The sisters kissed each other in perfunctory manner , Ron shook hands , and nodded vaguely in response to half a dozen injunctions and reminders ; then the travellers took their places in the cab , bending forward to wave their adieux , looking extraordinarily alike the while -- young and eager and handsome , with the light of the summer sun reflected in their happy eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 18]: Agnes felt a little chill as she shut the door and walked back into the quiet house .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 44]: All the morning she had looked forward to the hours of peace and quietness which would follow the departure of the two children of the household ; but now that the time had arrived she was conscious of an unwonted feeling of depression .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 13]: The sound of that last pitying , `` Poor old Agnes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 5]: rang in her ears .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 5]: Why `` poor '' ?
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 13]: Why should Margot speak of her as some one to be pitied ?
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 25]: As her father 's eldest unmarried daughter and the mistress of the house , she was surely a person to be approved and envied .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 33]: And yet , recalling those two vivid , radiant faces , Agnes dimly felt that there was something in life which Margot and Ron had found , and she herself had missed .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 7]: `` I do n't understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 8]: she repeated to herself with wrinkled brows .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 37]: A vague depression hung over her spirits ; she thought uneasily of her years , and wondered if she were growing old , unconscious of the fact that she had never yet succeeded in being young .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 2]: GLENAIRE .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 54]: Margot and Ronald slept through their long journey with the fortitude of youth , enjoyed a delicious breakfast at Perth , took train again for a couple of hours , and finally set out on the last and most enjoyable stage of their journey -- the six-mile drive to the head of Glenaire .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 31]: The first portion of the road gave little promise of beauty , but with every mile that was traversed the scenery began to assume a wilder and a sterner aspect .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 25]: The mountains were high and bare , with few trees upon their banks , except here and there a patch of dark green firs .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 43]: When the sun retired behind a cloud they looked somewhat grim and forbidding , but as it emerged from the shelter they became in a moment a soft , blooming purple ; a wonder of beauty against the high , blue sky .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 38]: In the valley were rolling plains of meadowland , of richest , most verdant green , with here and there a blaze of golden gorse or of thickly-growing rushes , to mark the presence of hidden water .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 63]: At long intervals was seen a little white cottage , set back from the road , where some lonely shepherd tended his sheep ; and , at the sound of wheels , little linty-headed children would rush out to the gate , and stand gazing at the strangers with big round eyes , which looked light against the tan of their faces .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 35]: What a life for young and old to live all the year round , looking out on the grim bare hills ; alone with God and Nature , and the dumb , patient animals !
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 59]: Day after day alone , in a little niche between grey rocks ; alone in the summer-time , when the winds blew soft , and the buttercups made splashes of gold across the green ; alone in the winter , when the mountains seemed to shut out the light , and the snow lay deep on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 17]: Margot looked with a shudder at the tall poles set here and there along the road .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 60]: She had inquired as to their purpose , and had been informed that they were so placed to act as landmarks ; for when the drifts lay deep , the ends of the poles served to point out the direction of the road , whereas without their aid the traveller would of a certainty be lost on the moors .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 15]: Poor little linty-locked ones , imprisoned in the tiny cot in those bitter days !
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 50]: Margot 's thoughts flew homeward , to the well-kept roads near her own home ; to the grumbling and indignation of the family , if perchance a recent fall of snow had not been swept away as speedily as might be : `` The road was thick with mud .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 9]: Impossible to cross without splashing one 's shoes .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 13]: The snow was left to melt on the pavement -- disgraceful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 26]: The Southerner railed at the discomfort of a greasy roadway ; the Northerner was thankful to escape death by the aid of a warning pole !
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 29]: Suddenly and unexpectedly the road took a quick swerve to the right , and lo , a narrow glen leading apparently into the very heart of the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 5]: Glenaire village at last !
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 142]: A little group of cottages , two whitewashed kirks , a schoolhouse , a post office , a crowded emporium where everything was to be purchased , from a bale of wincey to a red herring or a coil of rope ; a baker 's shop , sending forth a warm and appetising odour ; a smithy , through the open door of which came out a glare of heat , astonishingly welcome after the long , chill drive ; bare-footed children playing at tares by the wayside ; an old man in a plaid , smoking a pipe and turning on the new arrivals a kindly , weather-beaten face , -- these were the impressions left on Margot 's mind as the horses put on an extra spurt , knowing full well that rest and food were near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 43]: After the little group of houses there came another stretch of road for perhaps three-quarters of a mile ; a road which wound along between moorland on the right , and on the left a straggling tarn , thickly surrounded by rushes .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 31]: The cone-shaped mountain at the head of the glen towered ever nearer and nearer , until it seemed as if it must be impossible to drive a hundred yards farther .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 42]: Seen in the broad light of a summer afternoon it was wonderfully beautiful ; but it was a wild and lonesome spot , and , given cloud or rain , its very grandeur and isolation would increase the sense of gloom .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 18]: Margot had time to shiver at an imaginary picture before an exclamation from Ron attracted her attention .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 4]: There it stood !
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 36]: the little white inn , nestled beneath the shelter of a rock , so near to the head of the glen that the road came to an abrupt ending but a few yards farther on .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 41]: A door in the middle ; two small-paned windows on either side ; a row of five windows overhead ; to the right a garden stocked with vegetables and a tangle of bright-coloured flowers ; to the left the stable-yard .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 28]: This was the Nag 's Head , and in the doorway stood the redoubtable Mrs McNab herself , staring with steely eyes at the daring feminine intruder .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 11]: The one overpowering impression made by Mrs McNab was cleanliness !
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 27]: She was so obtrusively , aggressively , immaculately clean , that the like of her had never before dazzled the eyes of the benighted Southern visitors .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 43]: Her lilac print gown was glossy from the press of the iron ; the hands folded across the snowy apron were puffed and lined from recent parboiling ; her face shone like a mirror from a generous use of good yellow soap .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 40]: White stockings showed above her black felt slippers ; her hair -- red streaked with grey -- was plastered down on each side of her head , and , for greater security , tied with a broad black ribbon .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 25]: A stiff white collar was fastened by a slab of pebble rimmed in silver , which proudly imagined itself to be an ornamental brooch .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 38]: There was not a single feminine curve in her body ; stiff and square she stood , like a sentinel on guard , her lips pressed into a thin line ; in her eyes a smouldering flame .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 23]: Margot took her in , with one swift comprehensive glance , as the driver reined up his tired horses before the door .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 18]: A temper ; a quick temper , a temper easily provoked , but a kindly woman nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 56]: No country bumpkin , but a shrewd , capable business woman , with two light blue eyes fixed stolidly on the main chance ; a woman , moreover , blessed with a sense of humour ; else why those deep lines stretching from nose to chin ; that radiating nest of wrinkles round the eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 8]: Margot 's courage revived at the sight .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 20]: She sprang down lightly from her perch and advanced towards the house , smiling in her most fascinating manner .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 9]: `` How do you do , Mrs McNab ?
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 7]: We have arrived , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 9]: So glad to be here at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 13]: The mistress of the inn stared into her face , stolidly unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 9]: `` It was two brithers I was expecting .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 8]: I 'm no caring for leddies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 6]: `` You like gentlemen better ?
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 11]: Oh , so do I -- _ Much _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 6]: cried Margot with a gush .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 14]: `` But they need us to look after them , do n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 8]: My brother is not at all strong .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 14]: The drive has been delightful , but rather cold , all the same .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 9]: I am afraid he may be chilled . ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 18]: She stretched out a little ungloved hand , and laid it lightly on the hard red fist .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 3]: `` Feel !
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 9]: We _ should _ love some tea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 45]: Mrs McNab looked down at the delicate little hand , up into the pleading eyes , and over her set square face there passed a contortion , -- there is really no other word to describe it , -- a contortion of unwilling amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 21]: The chin dropped , the lips twitched , the red lines which did duty for eyebrows wrinkled towards the nose .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 61]: Similarly affected , an Irishwoman would have invoked all the saints in her calendar , and rained welcomes and blessings in a breath ; an Englishwoman would have smiled a gracious welcome ; but Mrs McNab drew away from the beguiling touch , turned a broad back on her guests , and with a curt `` Come yer ways ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 7]: led the way into the house .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 12]: Behind her back Margot beamed and grimaced triumphantly to her confederate .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 6]: Victory was in the air !
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 60]: Mrs McNab could not refuse to grant a night 's shelter to a tired and chilly traveller , and by to - morrow -- Margot smiled to herself , recalling the contortion of the dour Scotch face , -- by to-morrow she was complacently satisfied that Mrs McNab would no longer wish to be rid of her unexpected guest !
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 4]: THE BROTHERS ELGOOD .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 11]: Inside the inn a mingling of odours greeted the nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 52]: Furniture polish , soft soap , various whiffs from the bar , which by good fortune opened into the stable-yard , and was distinct from the house itself ; a sweet , heavy odour of milk from the dairy ; a smell of musk from the plants ranged along the window-sills .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 19]: In the dining-room the tablecloth was laid , with a large home-cured ham in the place of honour .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 14]: The floor was covered with oilcloth ; the furniture was covered with horsehair .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 17]: On the mantelpiece stood two large specimens of granite , and a last year 's almanac .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 23]: Red rep curtains were draped across the window , so as to conceal all the view except a glimpse of the road .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 28]: The walls were hung with a fearsome paper , in which bouquets of deep blue flowers were grouped on a background of lozenges of an orange hue .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 42]: Over the mantelpiece hung a coloured print of Queen Victoria ; over the sideboard a print entitled `` Deerstalking , '' representing two Highlanders in plaids and bonnets standing over the prostrate form of a `` monarch of the waste . ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 37]: In the corner by the window were massed together quite an imposing collection of `` burial cards , '' memorialising McNab connections dead and gone , all framed to match in black bands with silver beadings .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 23]: Anything less homelike and inviting can hardly be imagined to welcome tired travellers at the end of a long and chilly journey .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 26]: Margot shivered as she crossed the portals , and rubbed her hands together in disconsolate fashion , even her cheery optimism failing at the sight .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 10]: `` It 's so -- _ slippery _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 5]: was the mental comment .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 9]: `` What an appalling room to sit in !
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 9]: What must it be like in bad weather !
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 4]: And no fire !
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 13]: We 'd die of cold if we sat here all the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 15]: If the worst comes to the worst , I 'll hug my hot bottle .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 10]: What a mercy I remembered to bring it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 44]: Mrs McNab was speaking in hard , aloof accents , after the manner of one who , having been interrupted in her work by unwelcome intruders , is still determined to perform her duty toward them , as a matter of distasteful necessity .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 9]: Shades of the obsequious landladies of the South !
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 12]: The tired guests quailed before the severity of this Northern welcome .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 16]: `` If it 's tea you 're wanting , the kettle 's on the hob .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 13]: It will be waiting for you before ye 're ready for it .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 12]: Ye 'll be wanting a wash , I 'm thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 151]: It was a statement , not a question , and , in response to it , brother and sister meekly ascended the staircase to the rooms allotted to their use in the front of the house -- two whitewashed cribs , provided with nothing which was not absolutely necessary ; a small , white-covered bed ; a wooden chest of drawers , made to do duty for a dressing-table also , by the presence of a small mirror set fair and square in the middle of a coarse-grained mat ; a few pegs on the wall , a deal washstand , and a couple of chairs -- that was all ; but everything was exquisitely clean and orderly , and what did one want with luxurious upholstery when a peep through the open windows revealed a view which sent the blood racing through the veins in very ecstasy of delight ?
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 38]: Purple mountains and a blue sky ; golden yellow of gorse -- a silver sheet of water , reflecting the dark fringe of the pines -- it was wonderfully , incredibly beautiful in the clear afternoon light .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 15]: Margot thrust her head out of the window , forgetful of cold and fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 18]: What joy to think of waking up every morning for a month to a scene like this !
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 22]: Thirty mornings , and on every one of them the sun would shine , and the air blow clear and sweet .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 62]: She would put on her thick , nailed boots , and clamber up the glen , to see what lay at the other side of the pass ; she would take her sketching materials , and sit on that sunny knoll , trying to make some sort of a picture to send home to the poor father in his smoky prison-house .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 37]: On hot days she would wade in the cool grey tarn ... The little maid was knocking at the door , and announcing that tea was ready , while Margot was still weaving her rose-coloured dreams .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 30]: It was a cold douche in more ways than one , to return to the depressing atmosphere of the dining-room , but the meal itself was tempting and plentiful .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 29]: Scones and toast , eggs and strawberry-jam , besides the solid flank of ham , and , better than all , plenty of delicious cream and fresh butter .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 28]: Margot poured out tea for herself and Ron , and , taking the hot-water-jug on her knee , warmed her numbed hands on it as she ate .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 33]: For the first five or ten minutes no time was wasted in talking ; then , the first pangs of hunger being appeased , the two young people began to compare impressions .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 10]: `` Do you suppose this is the only sitting-room ?
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 17]: Do you suppose we shall have to sit here in the evenings and when it rains ?
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 26]: Fancy a long wet day , Ron , shining on horsehair chairs , with your feet on an oil-clothed floor , gazing at funeral cards !
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 7]: I should go to bed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 9]: `` It would n't be a bad idea .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 6]: Rest cure , you know !
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 25]: If we are very energetic in fine weather , we may be glad of a rest ; but there _ is _ another room .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 23]: I caught sight of a sanctuary filled with woollen mats and wax flowers , with a real live piano in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 19]: ` The best parlour , ' I should say , and the pride of Mrs McNab 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 13]: I do n't know if she will allow you to enter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 12]: `` She will ; but she wo n't have a fire .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 23]: It has been spring-cleaned , and has a waterfall of green paper in the grate -- I can see it all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 7]: Margot declared , with a shudder .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 11]: She hugged the hot-water-jug still closer , and shivered expressively .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 18]: `` I shall be obliged to raid the kitchen -- there 's nothing else for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 6]: `` You dare n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 24]: Margot laughed derisively , but her answer was checked by the sudden appearance of a man 's figure pacing slowly past the window .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 25]: Brother and sister sprang from their chairs , with a simultaneous impulse , rushed across the room , and crouched behind the moreen curtains .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 5]: `` Is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 11]: they queried breathlessly of each other -- `` Mr Elgood ?
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 5]: Can it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 19]: If it were Mr Elgood , he was certainly not imposing , so far as looks were concerned .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 29]: A dumpy little man , of forty years or more , dressed in a baggy suit of grey tweed , with carpet slippers on his dumpy little feet .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 30]: He had evidently started out of the inn to enjoy a smoke in the open air , sublimely unconscious of the scrutiny that was levelled upon him the while .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 19]: His uncovered head showed a large bald patch , his face was round and of a cherubic serenity .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 11]: `` I could twist him round like a teetotum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 13]: whispered Margot , holding up a pert first finger and peering complacently .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 7]: `` He looks terribly commonplace ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 4]: sighed Ronald disconsolately .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 13]: `` Not in the least the sort of man I expected . ''
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 26]: Together they peered and peeped , ducking behind the curtains as the stranger approached , and gazing out again the moment his back was turned .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 32]: Every now and then he halted in his promenade , stuck his hands inside his baggy pockets , and tilted slowly to and fro on the points of his carpeted toes .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 28]: Anon he took his pipe from his mouth , and blew out big whiffs of smoke , glancing around the while with an expression of beatific contentment .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 36]: The whole appearance of the man was an embodiment of the holiday spirit , the unrestrained enjoyment of one who has escaped from work , and sees before him a pageant of golden idle hours .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 11]: Margot and Ronald smiled in sympathy even as they looked .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 38]: He was a plain little man , a fat little man , a middle-aged little man , but they recognised in him the spirit of abiding youth , and recognising , felt their hearts warm towards him .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 10]: `` He is nice , Ron , after all !
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 5]: I like him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 5]: `` So do I .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 4]: A capital chap .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 14]: But he ca n't possibly be Elgood of the _ Loadstar _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 26]: Even as he spoke the last word the door was thrown suddenly open , and Mrs McNab entered , carrying a plate of hot scones .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 31]: She stopped short to stare in surprise , while the two new arrivals hurried back to the table , obviously discomposed at being discovered playing the part of Peeping Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 44]: Seated once more before the tea-tray , Margot made an effort at composure ; decided that honesty was the best policy , and said in her most charming manner -- `` We were looking at the gentleman who is walking up and down !
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 8]: Another of your guests , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 15]: It is interesting to see people who are staying in the same house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 23]: Mrs McNab planted the scones in the centre of the table , and gathered together the soiled plates with a wooden stolidity .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 15]: To all appearances she might not have heard a word that had been said .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 35]: Margot seized the hot-water-jug , and shivered ostentatiously , trusting to pity to prevail where guile had failed ; and sure enough the pale blue eye turned on her like a flash of steel .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 10]: `` What 's ailing ye with the water-jug ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 7]: `` I 'm ailing myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 4]: returned Margot meekly .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 4]: `` So cold !
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 6]: I ca n't get warm .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 8]: Tired out after the long journey . ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 32]: She tried her best to look delicate and fragile , but the healthy bloom on her cheeks contradicted her words , and the landlady 's reply showed no softening of heart .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 6]: `` Cramped , more like !
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 20]: Better go ye 're ways for a guid sharp trot , to bring the blood back to your veins .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 28]: Ye 'll be in time for the afternoon 's post ; but unless ye 're expecting news of your own , ye needna fash for the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 9]: Mr Elgood 's gane to fetch them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 5]: `` Mr Elgood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 13]: Information had come at last , and in the most unexpected fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 9]: `` The gentleman we have been watching ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 10]: The thin lips lifted with a suspicion of scorn .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 5]: `` Oh , him !
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 6]: That 's just the brither .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 10]: The real Mr Elgood 's away till the village .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 8]: You passed it on the road . ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 27]: She disappeared into the `` lobby , '' and brother and sister nodded at each other solemnly , the while they munched the hot buttered scones .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 5]: `` We 'll go !
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 7]: As soon as we have finished .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 9]: I long to see what he is like .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 31]: I 'm glad it is not -- '' Margot nodded towards the window , and Ron assented with a lofty superiority -- `` Yes -- he is not the type !
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 13]: A good sort , no doubt , but hardly an intellectual leader .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 11]: One could not imagine him writing those grand articles . ''
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 39]: `` He may be useful , though , for he looks a friendly little soul , and if we get intimate with him we must know his brother , too ... These scones are the most delectable things !
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 13]: Do you think She will be shocked if we eat them all ?
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 30]: I feel a conviction that I shall get into the way of calling her ` She ' -- with a capital S. ` She who must be obeyed ! '
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 31]: I thought She would be softened by the sight of me hugging the jug , and offer to light a fire at once ; but not a bit of it !
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 7]: Her cure was much more drastic .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 24]: I 'll accept it this time , as it suits my purpose , but when to-morrow comes , -- we 'll see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 29]: Margot nodded her head meaningly , pushed her chair back from the table , and picked up the golf cape which lay over the back of a chair .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 12]: `` After all , I believe ` She ' is right !
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 21]: It will do us good to have a scamper , and the unpacking can wait until the light goes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 14]: She peered discreetly through the window , and held up a detaining hand .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 16]: `` Wait a moment until the ` Brither ' has turned back towards the village .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 16]: Then we 'll sally out of the door and meet him face to face . ''
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 38]: Ron picked up his grey cap , -- a coat he disdained , though he also was far from warm , -- and followed his sister into the bare entrance-hall , with its pungent mingling of odours .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 59]: From the back of the house could be heard the jangling of milk-pails , and a feminine voice raised in shrill invective ; but no one was in sight , and the conspirators emerged unseen from the door of the inn , and turned to the left , endeavouring somewhat unsuccessfully to appear unconscious of the approaching figure .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 4]: `` Good afternoon !
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 4]: Good afternoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 10]: cried the stranger , in a full genial voice .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 5]: `` Good afternoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 40]: cried the confederates , in eager response ; then they passed by , and were conscious , by the cessation of the crunching footsteps , that the `` Brither '' had halted to look after them as they went .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 6]: `` He likes our looks !
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 13]: He is going to be friendly ... I do n't wonder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 29]: soliloquised Margot , looking with fond eyes at the tall figure of the youth by her side ; at the clean-cut , sensitive face beneath the deerstalker cap .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 8]: `` He was pleased to see us .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 58]: All men admire Margot , '' said Ron to himself , noting with an artist 's appreciation the picture made by the graceful figure of the girl , with her vivid , healthful colouring , the little cap set jauntily on her chestnut locks , the breeze showing glimpses of the bright tartan lining of her cloak .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 25]: Starting under such promising auspices , brother and sister merrily continued their way along the winding road which skirted the border of the tarn .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 18]: Fresh from London smoke and grime , the clear mountain air tasted almost incredibly pure and fresh .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 33]: One wanted to open the mouth wide and drink it in in deep gulps ; to send it down to the poor clogged lungs , -- most marvellous and reviving of tonics !
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 11]: `` It makes me feel -- _ clean _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 29]: gasped Margot , at the end of a deep respiration , and Ron 's eyes lighted with the inward glow which showed that imagination was perfecting the idea .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 50]: Margot loved to watch the lad at moments like these , when he strode along , forgetful of her presence , oblivious of everything but his own thoughts ; his face set , save for those glowing eyes , and now and then an involuntary twitch of the lips .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 22]: In her own poor way she could grasp the trend of his mind , could toil after him as he flew .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 10]: That word `` clean '' had suggested wonderful thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 28]: God 's wind , blowing fresh over the ageless hills , untainted by the soil of the city ; the wind of the moorland and the heights !
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 18]: Must not a man 's soul perforce be clean who lived alone in the solitude with God ?
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 15]: Dare he remain alone in that awful companionship with a taint upon his life ?
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 36]: ... Ronald dreamt , and Margot pondered , making no excuses for the silence which is a sign of truest understanding , until the scattered village came in sight , and curiosity awakened once more .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 11]: `` Why did they have two churches , I wonder ?
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 20]: There ca n't be enough people to fill even one , and every one is Presbyterian in the Highlands .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 9]: Why do n't they all meet together ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 7]: cried Margot , in her ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 18]: At the door of the outlying cottages the fair-haired matrons stood to stare at the new arrivals .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 77]: They all seemed fresh and rosy , and of an exquisite cleanliness ; they each bore a linty-haired infant in their arms , or held by the hand a toddling mite of two or three summers ; but they made no sign of welcome , and , when Margot smiled and nodded in her friendly fashion , either retreated hastily into the shadow , or responded in a manner painfully suggestive of Mrs McNab 's contortion .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 30]: Then came the scattered shops ; the baker 's , the draper 's , -LRB- fancy being condemned to purchase your whole wardrobe in that dreary little cell ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 25]: the grocer and general emporium in the middle of the row ; last of all , the post office and stationer 's shop combined .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 32]: Brother and sister cast a swift glance down the road , but there was no male figure in sight which could by any possibility belong to a visitor from the South .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 14]: `` You go in , and I 'll mount guard at the door .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 8]: Buy some postcards to send home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 21]: suggested Ron ; and , nothing loath , Margot entered the little shop , glancing round with a curious air .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 26]: There was no other customer but herself ; but a queer little figure of a man stood behind the counter , sorting packets of stationery .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 22]: He turned his head at her approach , and displayed a face thickly powdered with freckles of extraordinary size and darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 35]: Margot was irresistibly reminded of an advertisement of `` The Spotted Man , '' which she had once seen in a travelling circus , and had some ado to restrain a start of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 36]: The eyes looking out between the hairless lids , looked like nothing so much as a pair of larger and more animated freckles , and the hair was of the same washed -- out brown .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 55]: Whether the curious-looking specimen was fourteen or forty was at first sight a problem to decide , but a closer inspection proved the latter age to be the more likely , and when Margot smiled and wished him a cheery good afternoon , he responded with unusual cordiality for an inhabitant of the glen .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 8]: `` Good efternoun to ye , mem !
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 10]: What may ye be seeking , the day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 16]: Margot took refuge in the picture postcards , which afforded a good excuse for deliberation .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 80]: The great object was to dally in the post office as long as possible , in the hope of meeting the real Mr Elgood ; and to this end she turned over several packets of views , making the while many inquiries ; and the spotted man was delighted to expatiate on the beauties of his native land , the more so , as , presumably , it was not often that so lavish a purchaser came his way .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 52]: They were in the middle of the fourth packet of views , and the selected pile of cards had reached quite a formidable height , when a familiar whistle from the doorway started Margot into vivid attention , and a minute later a tall dark man stepped hastily into the shop .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 8]: What a marvellous thing is family likeness !
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 49]: In height , in complexion , and feature alike this man appeared diametrically the opposite of the stout little person encountered outside the inn ; yet in his thin , cadaverous face there was an intangible something which marked him out as a child of the same parents .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 30]: The brother on whom Margot was now gazing was considerably the younger of the two , and might have been handsome , given a trifle more flesh and animation .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 26]: As it was , he looked gaunt and livid , and his shoulders were rounded , as with much stooping over a scholar 's desk .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 13]: `` A fine big bundle for ye the day , Mister Elgood !
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 29]: I 'm thinking the whole of London is coming down upon ye , '' the postmaster declared affably , as he handed over a formidable packet of letters .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 23]: Envelopes white and envelopes blue , long manuscript envelopes , which Margot recognised with a reminiscent pang ; rolled-up bundles of papers .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 33]: The stranger took them over with a thin hand , thrust them into the pockets of his coat , with a muttered word of acknowledgment , and turned back to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 32]: Now for the first time Margot stood directly in his path , and waited with a thrill of curiosity and excitement to see whether he would echo his brother 's welcome .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 47]: In this Highland glen the ordinary forms and ceremonies of society were hopelessly out of place , and it seemed as if perforce there must be an atmosphere of _ camaraderie _ between the few visitors whom Fate had thrown together in the spirit of holiday-making .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 29]: Margot 's prettiest smile and bow were in waiting to greet the faintest flicker of animation on the grave , dark face , but it did not come .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 28]: Mr Elgood 's deep-set eyes stared at her with an unseeing gaze -- stared as it were straight through her , without being conscious of her presence .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 40]: She might have been a chair , a table , a post of wood by the wayside , for all the notice bestowed upon her by the man whose favour she had travelled some hundreds of miles to obtain .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 29]: Another moment and he had left the shop , leaving Margot to draw out her purse and pay for her purchases in a tingling of pique and disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 22]: `` That gentleman will be staying up at the Nag 's Head with yourself , '' vouchsafed the spotted postmaster affably .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 10]: `` A fine gentleman -- a ferry fine gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 13]: They say he will be a ferry great man up in London .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 11]: I suppose you will be hearing of his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 9]: Margot 's response was somewhat depressed in tone .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 22]: She had heard of Mr Elgood ... She would take four , not five , postcards of the Nag 's Head .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 10]: No ; there was nothing else she was needing .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 33]: The two penny packets of notepaper were certainly very cheap , the coloured tints and scalloped borders quite wonderful to behold ; but she did not require any to-day , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 4]: Perhaps another time .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 4]: Good morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 21]: Outside in the road Ronald was pacing up and down , twirling his stick , and looking bright and animated .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 19]: He came hurrying back to meet Margot , hardly waiting to reach her side before breaking into speech .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 5]: `` Well -- well !
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 4]: You saw him ?
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 9]: Did you notice the shape of his head ?
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 18]: You can see it all in his face -- the force and the insight , the imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 17]: The face of a scholar , and the body of a sportsman , A magnificent combination !
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 7]: Did you notice his walk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 9]: `` Oh , I noticed him well enough .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 8]: I noticed all there was to see .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 11]: I have no complaints to make about his appearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 9]: `` What have you to complain of then ?
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 6]: What has gone wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 7]: `` He never noticed me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 10]: Ron laughed ; a loud boyish laugh of amusement !
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 5]: `` Poor old Margot !
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 7]: That was it , was it ?
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 4]: An unforgivable offence .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 26]: He lives up in the clouds , my dear ; compared with him , you and I are miserable little earth-worms crawling about the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 14]: It will take some time before he is even aware of our presence .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 22]: We will have to make friends with the brother , and trust by degrees to make him conscious of our existence .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 7]: It 's worth waiting for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 20]: Ronald was plainly afire with enthusiastic admiration of his hero ; but for once Margot refused to be infected .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 8]: `` I 'm not a worm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 4]: she murmured resentfully .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 5]: `` Worm , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 10]: I 'm every bit as good as he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 16]: For twenty yards she walked on in silence , tilting her chin in petulant scorn .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 15]: Then -- `` Do you remember the old story of Johnny-head-in-air , Ron ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 4]: she asked mischievously .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 6]: `` He had a fall .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 6]: A fall and a dousing !
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 19]: If he is n't very careful , the same sad fate may await your wonderful Mr Elgood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 4]: AN EXCELLENT BEGINNING .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 30]: Dinner was served at seven o'clock at the Nag 's Head , and was a substantial meal , consisting of spiced salt beef , gooseberry pie , and cheese .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 30]: Mrs McNab carved the joint at the sideboard , and directed the movements of the maid by a series of glares which appeared to be fraught with wondrous significance .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 35]: `` Brither Elgood '' took the head of the table , and beamed upon his companions with cherubic good-nature , while his brother sat on his left , immersed in thought and his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 19]: An elderly man with a strong Glasgow accent came next , accompanied by a homely , kindly-looking wife .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 21]: -LRB- Margot sighed with relief to find that after all she was not the only lady of the company -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 29]: Across from them sat a bowed old man , wearing a clerical collar with his tweed coat , and a thin , weedy-looking youth , evidently his son .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 13]: An eminently staid and respectable company , but hardly of thrilling interest !
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 27]: Ronald 's handsome , clear-cut face stood out like a cameo among them , while Margot 's fluffy net blouse looked a garment of superfine smartness .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 24]: There was no opportunity of talking to either of the brothers Elgood , separated as they were by the length of the table .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 22]: The clergyman , Mr Moffat , remarked that it had been a fine day , an ex - ceptionally fine day !
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 38]: Mrs Macalister , the Glasgow lady , handed the mustard with the suggestion that it was always an improvement to a boiled round ; but with these thrilling exceptions the newcomers were left to their own devices .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 24]: Conversation even among the older residents was spasmodic and intermittent , and in no sense could the meal be termed sociable or cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 44]: As soon as it was over `` the real Mr Elgood '' darted upstairs to his own room , the remaining gentlemen strolled out of doors to smoke their pipes , and Mrs Macalister escorted Margot to the best parlour across the landing .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 22]: It was a chill , yet fusty little apartment , the shrine of the accumulated treasures of Mrs McNab 's lifetime .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 22]: Time was when she had been cook to a family in Edinburgh , before McNab won her reluctant consent to matrimony .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 23]: Photographs of different members of `` The Family '' were displayed in plush frames on the mantelpiece , table , and piano-top .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 40]: Mr Moncrieff in Sheriff 's attire , `` The Mistress '' in black satin ; Master Percy in cap and gown , Miss Isabel reclining in a hammock , Master Bunting and Miss Poppet in various stages of development .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 99]: There was also a framed picture of `` The House '' ; a tambourine painted with purple iris by Miss Isabel 's own hands ; an old bannerette in cross-stitch pendent from the mantelpiece , a collection of paper mats , shaded from orange to white , the glass-covered vase of wax flowers which had attracted Ron 's notice , one or two cheap china vases , a pot of musk placed diametrically in the centre of a wicker table , a sofa , and two `` occasional chairs '' gorgeously upholstered in red satin and green plush .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 24]: Mrs Macalister seated herself in the larger of the chairs , Margot took possession of the smaller , and heroically stifled a yawn .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 38]: Another evening she would wrap herself in her golf cape and go out into the clear cool evening air ; but now at last fatigue overpowered her ; fatigue and a little chill of disappointment and doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 36]: How would it be possible to become intimate with a man who sat at the opposite end of the table , shut himself in his own room , and was apparently oblivious of his surroundings ?
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 40]: With characteristic recklessness Margot had put on her very prettiest blouse , hoping to make a good impression on this first evening , but for all the attention it had received it might as well have been black delaine !
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 14]: She sighed and yawned again , whereupon Mrs Macalister manifested a kindly concern .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 9]: `` You 're tired out , poor lassie !
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 9]: Ye 've had a weary journey of it .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 6]: From London , I believe ?
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 9]: I have a daughter married in Notting Hill .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 9]: Will that be anywhere near where you stay ?
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 22]: I 'm hoping she 'll be up to visit us in the New Year , and bring the baby with her .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 5]: I have five children .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 8]: The eldest girl is settled in Glasgow .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 19]: I say , that 's something to be thankful for , to have a married daughter near by .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 15]: There was a young lawyer paying her attention who 's away to the Cape .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 13]: If it had been him , I 'd have broken my heart !
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 89]: It 's bad enough to have Lizzie in London , where , if the worst comes to the worst , ye can get to her for thirty - three shillings , but I could n't bear one of my girls to go abroad ... '' `` But the men have to go -- it 's their duty to the Empire ; and somebody must marry the poor things , '' Margot declared , still stifling yawns , but roused to a sleepy interest in Lizzie and her sisters .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 35]: She foresaw that Mrs Macalister would need but the slightest encouragement to divulge her entire family history , and wondered whether time would prove her to be more of a solace or a bore .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 34]: As a rule , she herself preferred to monopolise the larger share of a conversation , but to-night she was too tired to do more than offer the necessary remarks by the way .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 9]: `` Oh ay , that 's right enough .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 19]: I do n't object to their marrying , so long as it is n't one of my girls .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 19]: I sent Isabel off on a visit to a school friend when young Bailey began to grow particular .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 25]: A mother can manage these things , if she 's any gumption , without letting the young people suspect that there is any interference .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 19]: They like their own way , young people do , and Isabel is obstinate , like her father .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 13]: Mr Macalister can be led , but he 'll never be driven .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 14]: Ye have to ca ' canny to get the better of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 30]: Margot murmured a few words of polite but somewhat vague import , being rather puzzled to decide in what light she was expected to view Mr Macalister 's characteristics .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 37]: It occurred to her that as the good lady was determined to talk , the conversation might be carefully directed into more interesting channels , and valuable information gleaned concerning the other guests of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 8]: `` Have you been staying here long ?
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 10]: Are you going to make a long visit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 12]: she inquired ; whereupon her companion began again with increased vigour .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 20]: `` We 've been a matter of a week , and as for the future , it just depends !
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 10]: Mr Macalister 's been failing for the past year .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 29]: He 's just unduly set on his business , and his nerves , '' -LRB- she pronounced it `` nearves '' -RRB- `` are in a terrible condition .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 19]: The doctor warned him he would have a collapse if he did n't get a rest at once .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 23]: ` Take him away where he ca n't get letters and telegrams every hour of the day , ' he told me .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 22]: ` Take him to the quietest place you can find , and keep him there as long as ye can ! '
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 20]: So here we are ; but how long he 'll put up with it , is past my knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 23]: He begins to weary already , and of course no man will ever believe that any one else will take his place .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 8]: They 're conceited creatures , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 15]: Mr Macalister -- '' `` It is nice for him having so many companions .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 11]: I suppose you know the other visitors quite well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 31]: Margot felt that for one evening she had heard as much as she cared for about Mr Macalister , and headed the subject in the desired direction with unflinching determination .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 16]: `` The Mr Elgood who took the head of the table seems very agreeable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 12]: `` Oh ay , he 's a friendly wee body ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 6]: Mrs Macalister allowed , patronisingly .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 36]: `` There 's no harm in him , nor in his brother neither , though he keeps himself to himself , and is always busy with his fishing , or writing , or what not .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 19]: My husband went fishing with him one day , but they did n't seem to hit it exactly .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 23]: Mr Macalister is very genial-like when he 's in health , and he ca n't do with any one who 's stand-off .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 16]: He always says -- '' `` But Mrs McNab seems to prefer the younger brother .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 28]: He must be nice , or she would not like him so much , '' interrupted Margot once more ; and Mrs Macalister smiled with unruffled good-humour .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 22]: `` Oh ay , they 're just two dour , silent bodies who understand each other and each other 's ways .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 42]: He goes and has a crack with her now and then , and I 've even heard them laugh , '' -- her voice took an awed and incredulous tone -- `` but at the table he never raises his voice .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 8]: Mr Macalister says he is very close .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 38]: He could n't get anything out of him at all , and all his friends say Mr Macalister ought to have been a lawyer , for he 's just wonderful for getting to the bottom of things .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 15]: Of course when a man 's run down , he isna at his best .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 26]: Ye ca n't judge him , as I say , as you can when he 's in his usual -- '' Margot groaned in spirit !
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 14]: To keep Mr Macalister out of the conversation was evidently a hopeless feat .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 30]: She saw before her a long succession of interviews when she would sit caged up in this little room , listening to the expressions of his virtues and failings !
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 61]: To - night she felt a moral conviction that she would soon fall asleep under the strain , and making an excuse of writing home , escaped to her own room , scribbled a few words on the back of a postcard , wrapped herself in her golf cape , and went out into the road in search of Ron .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 23]: It was still broad daylight , but now the sky was grey and colourless , and the mountains had ceased to smile .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 24]: Like grim watching sentinels they stood on either side , closing in the Glen in a solitude that was almost awesome to behold .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 27]: It seemed impossible to believe that twenty - four hours earlier one had been in the great city , and had considered Regent 's Park countrified !
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 25]: Margot hurried forward to meet Ron , who was strolling along by himself , the other men of the party being out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 24]: He looked at her with some anxiety , as she approached , and asked an eager question -- `` What 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 5]: Are n't you well ?
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 8]: I thought you were not coming out .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 6]: You look quite white ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 11]: `` I 'm cold and tired , and -- scarey !
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 16]: The beauty seems to have disappeared , and it 's all so grim and grey .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 32]: I made an excuse and came out to you with a card to post -- but we need n't take it to-night , it 's too far to the village . ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 3]: `` Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 8]: the walk is just what you need .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 22]: You are tired with sitting still , and a sharp trot will warm you up , and help you to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 3]: Come along .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 22]: I 'll give you a start to the bend of the road , and race you to the nearest tree . ''
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 53]: Margot was not in the least in the mood for running races , but as a means of getting warm it was not to be despised , so she started promptly , running with swift , easy steps , and gradually quickening pace , as Ron gained upon her from the rear .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 34]: She had not been educated at a girls ' public school and been captain of the sports committee for nothing , and , given a short handicap , could often come off best .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 32]: As the following footsteps grew nearer and nearer she spurted bravely forward , the ends of her cape streaming wildly in the breeze , her uncovered hair ruffled into curling ends .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 61]: The tree was but a few yards distant ; she was laughing and panting , dodging from right and left , to prevent Ron from passing by from behind , when round a bend in the road a figure appeared directly in her path , the figure of Brither Elgood himself , his round eyes bulging with surprise and curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 40]: He came to an abrupt standstill in the middle of the road , and the racers followed his example , looking , if the truth were told , a trifle abashed to be discovered in so childish an amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 3]: `` Halloa !
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 5]: What is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 7]: Is the Inn on fire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 4]: Margot laughed merrily .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 26]: The voice , the tone , the manner , were those of a friend of a lifetime , rather than an acquaintance of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 18]: It was impossible to answer formally ; moreover , the humour of the idea made its appeal .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 5]: `` No , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 6]: On ice , more likely !
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 15]: We were so cold that a race seemed the only chance of getting warm !
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 11]: I hope we did n't startle you too much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 12]: `` I like being startled , '' returned Mr Elgood complacently .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 19]: He stood still , swinging his cane , looking from brother to sister with bright , approving eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 24]: `` I was afraid you were feeling tired after your journey , but evidently you have not yet reached the age of fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 4]: That 's right !
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 4]: Thats quite right !
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 14]: I am glad that you have joined us at the Nag 's Head .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 16]: We are a respectable and harmonious party , but we need life -- young life !
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 15]: We may weary _ you _ , but you will refresh and enliven us .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 16]: In the name of our little company , I welcome you to the Glen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 23]: `` Thank you , sir , '' said Ron simply , while Margot , as usual , hastened to amplify his words .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 8]: `` I hope we shall be friends .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 8]: I hope we shall all be friends .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 28]: I was dreadfully tired really , but I felt worse staying in the house , and in that little parlour after dinner I nearly fell asleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 12]: Mr Elgood 's eyes lit up with a flash of humour .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 14]: `` But when a man 's out of health you canna judge him !
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 16]: When he 's in his usual , Mr Macalister 's a verra interesting character ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 4]: he said solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 25]: Then , meeting Margot 's start and smile , he began to laugh again , and to shake in his happy , jelly-like fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 8]: `` Ah -- ha , I know !
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 16]: I guessed what was in store for you , as I saw you led away .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 15]: She 's a good woman that ; a good , kind , womanly woman .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 6]: Her devotion does her credit .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 25]: When you and I get a wife , sir , we shall do well if we find one half so loyal and devoted . ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 28]: He looked at Ron as he spoke , bringing his eyebrows together in a quick , scrutinising glance ; but Ron 's face was blank and unresponsive .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 46]: Enshrined in his heart was a dim figure , half goddess , half fairy , a creature of thistledown , of snow , of blossom tossed before the wind ; a lovely illusive vision who in due time was to appear and complete his life .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 13]: It was a violation of the shrine to suggest a Mrs Macalister !
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 19]: He stood still , his brows knitted , his lips pressed together in a thin , warning line .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 62]: Margot was impatient at his lack of response , but all the same he looked wonderfully handsome and interesting , and she could see that Mr Elgood regarded him with awakened interest , conscious that here was a character cut out of a pattern of its own , not made in the same mould as the vast majority of his fellows .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 10]: They turned and walked together along the winding road .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 32]: Evidently friendship progressed quickly in this quiet glen , and guests living beneath the same roof accepted each other in simple , natural fashion , as members of a common household .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 29]: Margot felt a sense of protection in the presence of this little man , so much older than herself , so friendly , so absolutely unsentimental in manner .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 34]: His head was on a level with her own , and she read a frank admiration in his eyes , but it was an admiration of which Agnes herself could not have disapproved .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 30]: He was the kind of man one would have chosen for an uncle -- an indulgent bachelor uncle with plenty of money , and a partiality for standing treat !
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 10]: `` Tell me about the people in the Inn !
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 9]: I am always so interested in people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 4]: she cried eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 22]: `` My brother likes other things better -- books and pictures and mountains -- but I like the living things best .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 32]: I know a good deal about Mr Macalister 's health , and about Lizzie , and Isabel , and their husbands and babies , and their lovers before they were married .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 16]: They come from Glasgow -- and the old clergyman is Scotch too , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 9]: Is every one Scotch except ourselves and you ?
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 13]: We come from London -- '' Mr Elgood 's face shadowed quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 6]: but do n't mention it .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 5]: Never mention it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 4]: he cried quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 18]: `` I live there , too , or as nearly live as is possible in the surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 23]: Now for three or four weeks I 've escaped , and my one endeavour is to forget that such a place exists .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 19]: I ask every one as a favour never to mention as much as the name in my hearing .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 16]: You 'll remember , wo n't you , and be good enough to indulge me ?
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 26]: For the moment Miss -- Miss Vane , I am a Heelander , born and bred , a strapping young chieftain of five-and - twenty .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 25]: The Elgood of Elgood , an it please you , in bonnet and kilt , and my foot is on my native heather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 39]: He tilted his cap on one side , and threw a swagger into his walk , cleverly remindful of the swirl of tartan skirts , then turning upon Margot , queried quickly -- `` Why do you laugh ?
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 6]: It 's rude to laugh !
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 13]: Is it so impossible to think of me in the character ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 15]: `` I laugh because I 'm pleased , '' Margot answered , truthfully enough .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 7]: `` I do love to pretend !
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 19]: Let 's bury London and our lives there , and pretend that we are _ all _ Highlanders !
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 47]: We will be your guests up in your mountain fastness , and you will take us about , and show us the scenes of your historic feuds with neighbouring clans , and we will swear to help you , if any new trouble should arise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 5]: `` Right oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 6]: cried Mr Elgood , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 8]: `` I shall be only too proud .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 20]: I 'm a sociable beggar -- during holiday time -- and want to do nothing but smoke and talk .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 7]: To talk nonsense , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 6]: Nothing dull or improving . ''
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 13]: He cast a sudden , suspicious look at the girl 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 12]: `` You are not clever by any chance , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 10]: I ca n't stand cleverness in the country . ''
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 4]: Margot laughed gaily .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 9]: `` I think I am -- rather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 4]: she declared audaciously .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 25]: `` I could n't confess to being stupid , even to please a Highland chief , but it 's in a very feminine way .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 36]: I do n't know anything about politics or science , and I 've forgotten almost all that I learnt at school , but I take an interest in things , and understand people pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 12]: I am generally clever enough to get my own way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 20]: She laughed again , remembering the purpose of the moment , and its close connection with this newly-made acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 53]: Instinctively she turned towards Ron , and the two pairs of brown eyes met , and flashed a message of mischief , affection , and secret understanding -- a glance which made the watcher sigh with a sudden realisation of his own lost youth , his bald head , and increasing bulk .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 31]: They were only a pair of children , these newcomers ; kindly , affectionate , light-hearted children , whose companionship would be a tonic to a lonely , tired man .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 40]: The broad cherubic countenance showed a passing shadow of wistfulness , as he slacked his pace and said in hesitating tones -- `` I am afraid I have tacked myself on to you , without waiting for an invitation .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 21]: I will say good evening now , unless I can act as guide , or help you in any way .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 10]: Have you any special object in your walk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 9]: `` Only the post office in the village .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 9]: Do please come with us if you will !
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 9]: We should be delighted to have you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 40]: cried Margot eagerly ; and Ron looked down into the little man 's face with his beautiful dreamy eyes , and said simply , `` Please come , sir , '' with a sincerity which there was no denying .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 6]: Mr Elgood beamed with satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 11]: `` Come awa , then , ma bonnie men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 12]: he cried jauntily , and waved his stick in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 18]: For the very first evening Margot could not help thinking that they had made an excellent beginning !
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 4]: AN AWKWARD MEETING .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 29]: Being a prudent damsel , and wise in her day and generation , Margot set before herself the subjugation of Mrs McNab as her first duty in Glenaire .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 61]: To this end she repaired to her bedroom after breakfast on the morning after her arrival , made her bed , carefully put away every article of clothing , and tidied the oddments on the dressing-table ; went through the same performance in Ron 's little crib adjoining her own , and sailed downstairs in a glow of virtuous satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 66]: Mrs McNab had apparently only one maid to help her to attend to her eight guests and to keep the inn in its present condition of immaculate order and cleanliness , though a shaggy-headed man -- presumably the master of the house -- could be seen through the staircase window , meekly brushing boots , and cleaning knives in a corner of the flagged yard .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 30]: He had a small , wizened face , to which the unkempt hair , tufted eyebrows , and straggling whiskers gave a strong resemblance to a Skye terrier dog .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 47]: Margot watched him now and then for a minute or two as she passed up and down , and heard him speaking once or twice , but he `` had the Gaelic , '' and the sing-song voice and mysterious words sounded weirdly in her ears .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 36]: Sometimes , as he put the final polish on the boots , he would break into song , -- a strange , tuneless song which quavered up and down , and ended on long-sustained notes .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 42]: Once even she saw the slippered feet move in jaunty dance-step to and fro , but at the sound of a clatter of saucepans from the kitchen close at hand he retired into his corner , and polished with redoubled energy .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 16]: Mrs McNab evidently kept her husband in order , even as she did her house !
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 46]: Elspeth , the maid , was a girl of eighteen or twenty , with a thin figure encased in a lavender print gown , and flaxen hair pulled so tightly back from her forehead that her eyebrows seemed to be permanently elevated by the process .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 17]: Her face shone from the effects of constant soaping , and was absolutely void of expression .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 32]: From morn till night she rushed breathlessly from one duty to another , rated continuously by Mrs McNab 's strident voice , with never so much as a bleat of protest .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 35]: When waiting at table , she snored loudly from nervousness , and the big red fist trembled as she carried the dishes to and fro , but her face remained blankly expressionless as before .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 27]: Margot smiled at her radiantly every time that they met , and mentally decided to bequeath to her half her own wardrobe before leaving the Glen .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 20]: In comparison with such a lot of drudgery , her own life seemed inexcusably idle and self - indulgent !
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 69]: It took a considerable amount of courage to beard in her own den a woman of whom the members of her own household stood in such evident awe , but there was at least no nervousness apparent in Margot 's manner as she tapped at the kitchen door at eleven o'clock that first morning , and thrust her pretty face round the opening to request permission to enter .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 26]: Mrs McNab had descended from her work upstairs , and surely her heart must be softened by the spectacle of those two immaculately tidy rooms !
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 8]: `` Mrs McNab , I 'm cold !
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 12]: May I come in and warm myself by your fire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 48]: The mistress of the inn turned a stonily surprised face from the table , before which she stood chopping suet with a short-handled knife ; she did not suspend her work , but simply heightened her voice to make it heard above the harsh , monotonous noise .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 6]: `` Cold , are ye ?
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 2]: Havers !
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 7]: It 's a fine June day .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 22]: There 's no call for any one to feel cold , if they do n't sit about idling away their time .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 14]: Put on yer cloak , and go a turn down the Glen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 12]: Margot suppressed a thrill of indignation at that accusation of idleness .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 19]: Had she not made two whole beds , and even stooped to pick stray pins off the carpet ?
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 10]: She pushed the door open and walked boldly forward .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 12]: `` I 'll go out as soon as I 'm warm .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 25]: If I caught a chill , I should give a lot of trouble , and you have enough to do without fussing over me .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 17]: I know you would be a good nurse , Mrs McNab -- good housekeepers always are .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 31]: I know without being told that you have a cupboard chock full of medicines and mixtures , and plasters and liniments , and neat little rolls of lint and oilskins .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 6]: Is it this one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 19]: She laid her hand on a closed door , drawing the while nearer and nearer to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 8]: `` What a perfectly beautiful oak chest !
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 4]: That 's genuine !
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 8]: One can see it at a glance .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 9]: The lovely elbow-grease polish can never be imitated .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 18]: So different from the faked-up , over-carved things glittering with varnish that one sees so often nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 13]: What a shame to keep it hidden away in the kitchen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 9]: Mrs McNab pounded stolidly away at the suet .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 11]: `` I dinna ken where the shame can be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 4]: she responded drily .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 29]: `` It 's my own chest , and my mither 's before me , and it 's a pity if I mayna keep it where it pleases meself .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 28]: There 's no call that I know of to turn out my things , so that ither folks can have the fun of staring at them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 38]: Mrs McNab 's manner was certainly the reverse of gracious , but , remembering the momentary softening of the grim face which she had witnessed the night before , Margot was determined not to be easily discouraged .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 16]: Having gone so far , one could not retreat without irrevocably burning one 's boats .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 11]: Now or never victory must be wrested from the enemy !
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 48]: With a charming little air of domesticity she seated herself upon the polished fender-stool at the side of the open grate , catching up her skirt so that it should not be caught by the blaze , and smiling across the room in her most confiding fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 9]: `` Please let me stay , Mrs McNab !
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 20]: It 's such a lovely cosy kitchen , and my brother is out , and I feel so lost !
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 8]: Could n't I do something to help ?
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 7]: Are those gooseberries in that basket ?
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 5]: Do they need picking ?
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 15]: I ca n't cook , but I can pick gooseberries with any man living .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 4]: Do let me !
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 9]: You said I was idling away my time .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 8]: Give me a chance to work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 5]: Mrs McNab grunted sourly .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 14]: `` There 's no call for you to do anything of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 14]: I never was one to take work upon myself that I couldna perform .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 22]: The girl would have picked them before now , if she didna go about making more work than she gets through .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 10]: She can do them when she gets downstairs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 7]: Poor , struggling , machine-like Elspeth !
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 27]: Margot felt a pang of pity for her unappreciated efforts , and the determination to spare her one task at least brought with it renewed courage .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 11]: `` Let me do them as a pleasure to myself !
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 33]: I should feel so proud when the pie came to table , if I had helped to prepare it , and it would be an excuse to sit by this lovely fire .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 3]: Please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 11]: `` Kitchen work is no for the likes of you .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 13]: Ye wouldna like it if ye soiled yer fine new gown ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 17]: `` If I asked you very nicely , perhaps you would lend me an apron ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 18]: Mrs McNab threw down her chopper , and turned to wipe her hands on a roller towel .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 53]: Perhaps she had come to the conclusion that as a pure saving of time it would be wise to give in without further demur ; perhaps the twinkling appeal of the brown eyes touched a vulnerable spot in her heart ; perhaps the service itself was of some value at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 21]: Margot did not concern herself as to causes , but was content to realise that she had won the victory .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 27]: She meekly allowed herself to be tied into a coarse white apron , and set to work on the big basket of berries with nimble fingers .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 45]: Picking gooseberries is not a task which requires much skill or experience ; perhaps quickness is the criterion by which it can best be tested , and Mrs McNab 's sharp glances soon discovered that her new apprentice was no laggard at the work .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 17]: The little green balls fell from Margot 's fingers into the basin with quite extraordinary quickness .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 13]: She kept her eyes on her work , but her tongue wagged .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 18]: Margot talked , and Mrs McNab grunted , but the grunts grew ever softer and less repellent .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 30]: The first attempt at a joke was met with a sniff of disdain , but a second effort produced a dry cackle , and that was a triumph indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 44]: When the suet had been reduced to shreds , there was bread to sift , and eggs to beat ; and then Mrs McNab washed her hands and dropped her working apron preparatory to going upstairs to see after `` the girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 28]: She made no demur at leaving Margot alone in the kitchen , for , having undertaken a task , she was plainly expected to carry it through .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 11]: It was astonishing how much fruit one basket could hold !
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 37]: One wide - lipped basin had already been filled , and another pressed into the service , yet even a vigorous tilt to the side failed to show any signs of the bottom of the basket .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 57]: Margot had achieved her double purpose of warming herself and breaking the ice of her hostess 's reserve , and now was in a fidget to be off to join Ron on the hillside ; but the fear of Mrs McNab was strong upon her , and she dare not move until her task was complete .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 90]: There she sat upon the low fender-stool , the big white apron concealing the blue tweed dress , her pretty , flushed face bent over her work , to all appearances the most industrious of Cinderellas , while the pendulum of the old oak clock clicked noisily to and fro , and through the open door came a whiff of clean cool air , laden with the scent of flowers and sweet-briar , with the pungent aromatic odour of growing herbs , with the heavy sweetness of the dairy .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 29]: Margot thought with a shudder of the gloomy underground regions in Regent 's Park , where the servants of the house spent the greater part of their lives .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 46]: In her own future spells of authority she determined to be very , very indulgent to pleas for `` outings '' ; nay , even to make it a matter of duty to plan days of sunshine and liberty for the patient , uncomplaining workers .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 32]: The sun was beginning to peep forth from behind the clouds , and its rays dancing across the kitchen floor were an almost irresistible temptation to one newly escaped from town .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 27]: Margot gave the basket an impatient shake , and , as another means to the desired end , popped a couple of berries into her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 28]: So sweet did they taste , so fresh and ripe , that another two soon followed suit , and henceforth she ate as steadily as she worked .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 29]: There could be no hesitation in so doing , for in fruit - picking it is an unwritten law that the worker is free to take his toll .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 45]: It was while Margot 's hand was raised to her mouth for the eighth or ninth time that a footstep sounded on the flagged floor of the scullery behind her back , and a man 's voice and laugh startled her into vivid attention .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 50]: In both was a note which immediately recalled her companion of the night before , -- the cheery , warm-hearted pseudo-chieftain of the Glen -- yet in both rang a difference which told that the newcomer was not he , but probably one closely connected by birth and association .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 17]: _ The _ Mr Elgood ; the Editor ; the all-powerful dispenser of Ronald 's fortunes !
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 35]: Margot felt convinced that it could be no one else , and experienced a moment of keen anticipation , followed by a shock of disgust , as she grasped the meaning of his words .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 3]: `` Ah-ha !
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 8]: So I 've caught you pilfering again .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 16]: What will Mrs McNab say when she finds all her good fruit disappearing like this ?
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 11]: You 'll have to bribe me not to carry tales .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 9]: Better turn me into a confederate -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 5]: Are they ripe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 23]: A long thin hand descended over Margot 's shoulder , the fingers deliberately feeling after the plumpest and yellowest of the berries .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 9]: _ He had mistaken her for Elspeth _ !
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 10]: Stupefaction mingled with wrath , -- _ Elspeth _ !
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 25]: A vision of the square-built , flat-headed , hopelessly graceless figure rose before Margot 's outraged vision , and resentment lighted into a blaze .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 20]: Could any apron in the world be large enough to cause a resemblance between two such diametrically different figures !
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 38]: Margot appreciated her own beauty in an honest , unaffected fashion , as one of the good gifts which had been showered upon her , and for the moment the sense of injury eclipsed that of embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 46]: With an impetuous movement she turned her face over her shoulder -- that vivid pink and white face which made such a startling contrast to Elspeth 's stolidity -- and stared with widely-opened hazel eyes into that other pair of eyes so near her own .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 33]: It was the younger Mr Elgood sure enough , -- but seen close at hand , with that mischievous smile curling his lips , he had an extraordinary youthful and boyish appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 22]: Margot received an instantaneous impression of kindliness and strength , of a glinting sense of humour , before the change came .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 4]: Such a change !
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 25]: If she had been a wild animal prepared to spring , horror and dismay could not have been more eloquently depicted upon his face .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 20]: The eyes widened , the features stiffened into a mask , the outstretched hand fell limply to his side .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 35]: He opened his lips to say something , several things , but the words were unintelligible ; a mere broken stammer of apology , as he wheeled round and walked hastily from the room .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 15]: The door slammed behind him ; she heard his footsteps over the flagged hall .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 3]: Poor Margot !
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 23]: Never before in her life had she so keenly desired to make a good impression ; never had she so signally failed .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 10]: It was indeed an unpromising beginning to the campaign !
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 4]: A MOORLAND WALK .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 15]: A second time that day Margot came into close contact with Mr George Elgood .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 63]: She was strolling slowly up and down the road with `` the Chieftain , '' waiting for Ron to make his appearance before starting for a ramble over the countryside , when through the doorway of the inn out dashed the `` Editor , '' making in the same direction , in the headlong , unseeing fashion which was plainly a characteristic .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 47]: When about twenty yards distant , he lifted his eyes from the ground , became suddenly conscious of the two figures slowly strolling towards him , stopped short in the middle of the path , and , wheeling round , darted quickly in the opposite direction .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 9]: The cut was too glaring to be ignored .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 23]: Margot 's cheeks flamed with annoyance , which the sound of a low chuckle by her side did not help to subdue .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 16]: She reared her little head to its haughtiest angle , and spoke in frosty accents .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 10]: `` I am afraid I am in the way .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 10]: Pray do n't let me interfere with your plans .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 12]: Wo n't you join your brother before he goes too far ?
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 25]: He is walking very fast -- '' There was a note of satire in the last words which made the Chieftain chuckle once more .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 9]: `` Not I , '' he replied easily .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 11]: `` I can have his society any time I like .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 6]: Yours is infinitely more refreshing .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 11]: Keeps up a pretty good pace , do n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 5]: Scared , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 4]: Scared to death !
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 9]: Running to cover like a frightened hare ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 6]: `` Scared of what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 5]: `` Of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 24]: Margot had known the answer to the question before she had put it , but , woman-like , was none the less affronted .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 35]: Accustomed to be sought after and admired by mankind in general , it was a disagreeable experience to find herself repelled by the man of all others whom she was most anxious to ingratiate .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 23]: Her face stiffened , and her rounded little chin projected itself proudly , the while her companion looked on with twinkling amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 13]: `` That makes you feel pretty mad , do n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 4]: he inquired genially .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 11]: `` You are not accustomed to that sort of treatment .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 12]: Most of 'em run the other way , do n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 7]: I should , in their place !
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 10]: But you must n't be hard on old George .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 27]: When I said ` you , ' I used the word as a plural , not as applying with any special significance to your charming self .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 11]: It is womankind as a whole which he finds terrifying .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 14]: Run a mile any day rather than meet a woman face to face !
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 15]: You must not imagine that there is anything unusual in his avoidance of yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 8]: It 's always the same tale . ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 39]: Margot paused a moment , to reflect dismally that in this case there was small hope for the fulfilment of her scheme , then ventured the natural feminine question -- `` Has he been crossed in love ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 3]: `` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 3]: George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 20]: George 's brother appeared to find something mysteriously ludicrous in the suggestion , for he shook with delighted laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 4]: `` Rather not !
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 14]: Never had enough to do with a woman to give himself a chance .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 31]: He 's an old hermit of a bachelor , Miss Vane , absorbed in his work , and becoming more of a slave to it every year of his life .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 14]: Even on a holiday he ca n't take it easy like other folks .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 44]: He has some writing on hand just now -- a paper of sorts which he has undertaken to have ready by a certain time , and it appears to his benighted intellect that a holiday is an excellent opportunity of getting it through .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 18]: Mad , you see ; stark , staring mad , but an excellent fellow all the same .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 6]: One of the very best .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 26]: I have a large experience of men , but I 've never met one to compare with him for all-round goodness and simplicity of heart .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 18]: We all have our failings , and there are worse things than a little shyness and reserve .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 25]: If he avoids you like the plague , try to pity him for the loss it entails upon himself , and take no offence !
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 12]: As I said before , it 's not a personal matter .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 30]: He knows that you are a stranger and a woman , but I do n't suppose he has the most glimmering idea of what you are really like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 7]: `` Oh yes , he has .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 24]: I was sitting in the kitchen this morning , and he came and spoke to me under the impression that I was Elspeth !
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 9]: The impression lasted until he got quite near .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 15]: I was wearing an apron , but still , -- I was n't pleased !
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 15]: When he saw my face instead of hers , he fled for his life .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 8]: But he _ did _ see it !
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 10]: He knows quite well what I am like . ''
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 26]: `` And in the depths of your little girl heart you think he is a strange fellow , not to want to see you again !
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 26]: You ca n't understand why he should go out of his way to be kind to Elspeth , and avoid some one infinitely more attractive .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 17]: Do n't be offended , but that 's a wrong view to take of the case .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 34]: In my brother 's eyes Elspeth is more attractive than yourself , for she is poor , you see , and ugly , and leads a life of all work and no play .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 11]: He might be able to do her a good turn .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 25]: Besides , he has known her for several years , and has had time to become reconciled to her existence , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 9]: Custom goes a long way with shy people .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 48]: George would rather beard a den of lions than face the company in the inn parlour on a wet evening , but he is a welcome guest in the kitchen , and Mrs McNab adores him to the extent of submitting to muddy boots without a murmur .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 22]: He cracks jokes with her in a free-and - easy manner which strikes awe into the heart of tremblers like myself .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 22]: It 's my first visit to the Nag 's Head , and I 'm still in the stage of abject submission .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 7]: She 's a wonderful woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 6]: Margot smiled with returning composure .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 22]: She divined her companion 's desire to change the subject of conversation , and was quite willing to further his efforts .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 14]: What she had already heard concerning George Elgood supplied ample food for meditation .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 31]: Viewed in dispassionate light , it was not wholly disconcerting , for if the citadel could but once be stormed , there seemed a certainty of gaining sympathy and consideration .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 35]: She must be content to wait in patience , until the hermit had become reconciled to her existence ; but Ron , as a fellow-man , could venture on advances on his own account .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 22]: She must talk to Ron in private , and try to instil into him some of her own energy and enterprise .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 14]: He was a dear , wonderful fellow , but absolutely wanting in initiative .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 35]: Poets , she supposed , were always dreamy , impracticable creatures , unfitted to attend to practical interests , and dependent upon the good offices of some adoring woman working meekly in the background .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 16]: Her eyes brightened eloquently as she watched her brother 's approach along the winding path .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 42]: What a handsome young figure of manhood he made in his Norfolk jacket and knickerbockers , the close-fitting deerstalker cap showing the light chestnut hair , from which no barber 's shears could succeed in banishing the natural kink and curl .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 16]: No one would suspect , to look at him , that he cherished poetical ambitions !
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 17]: Margot was English enough to be thankful for this fact , illogical as it may appear .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 31]: She was proud to realise that he looked a thorough sportsman , and in absolute harmony with his surroundings , and instinctively her pride and affection voiced themselves in words .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 34]: The Chieftain might not be the rose , but he was at least near the rose , and it would be well to enlist his interest as well as that of his brother .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 8]: `` Does n't he look splendid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 27]: Mr Elgood started , and for a moment his round face expressed the blankest bewilderment , then his eyes lit upon Ron , and comprehension dawned .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 14]: `` Ah , yes , '' he returned indifferently , `` nice-looking lad !
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 10]: Pity he has n't more to say for himself .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 7]: What 's he supposed to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 5]: Business or profession ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 6]: `` It 's not decided .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 9]: He has not long come down from Cambridge .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 14]: He is quiet , but he is very clever , all the same .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 10]: Much cleverer than most boys of his age . ''
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 8]: The Chieftain 's tone was distinctly sceptical .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 4]: Good degree ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 7]: Margot 's colour heightened in embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 4]: `` Nothing special .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 4]: Only a pass .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 14]: It is n't in _ that _ way that his cleverness shows . ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 4]: `` Just so !
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 3]: Just so !
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 8]: I 've met men like that before .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 11]: Well , do n't spoil him , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 12]: Worship him in your heart , but not to his face .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 10]: Looks to me as if he needed hardening up .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 6]: A bit moony and sentimental .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 11]: Do n't mind my saying so , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 6]: `` Not a bit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 27]: returned Margot proudly ; but she cared horribly , all the same , and for the moment her liking for her companion suffered a distinct eclipse .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 17]: `` I know him , you see , and understand him as no stranger can do .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 23]: He needs appreciation , for he is too apt to lose faith in himself , and he is not sentimental at all .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 14]: He has plenty of sentiment , but that 's a different thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 6]: `` Yes -- Um ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 22]: responded the Chieftain mischievously , his little eyes twinkling with amusement as they scanned the girl 's flushed , injured face .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 4]: `` Quite so !
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 4]: Sorry I spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 13]: He is , without doubt , an unusually gifted young man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 26]: He bowed towards Margot , with an inference too transparent to be mistaken , and at which she was obliged to laugh , despite herself .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 21]: Ronald joined them at this moment , and looked from one to the other with his big , dreamy eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 27]: Margot was irritated to see that he looked even more absent-minded than usual , just when she was anxious that he should show to most advantage .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 23]: He asked no questions in words , however , but Mr Elgood hastened to reply to the unspoken query in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 11]: `` Your sister and I have been having an argument .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 9]: I do n't know how it came about .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 9]: Hate arguments myself , especially on a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 9]: Besides , it 's a waste of time .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 9]: Whoever knew any one converted by an argument ?
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 30]: Each one goes away more satisfied than ever that he is in the right , and that his opponent is talking rubbish ; present company excluded , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 12]: So far as I can remember , we were discussing cleverness .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 17]: If you were asked for a definition of a clever man , what would you say ?
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 7]: How would you describe him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 22]: Ronald stood in the centre of the road , his hands clasped behind his back , his brows knitted in thought .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 33]: Ninety-nine people out of a hundred would have answered such a question off-hand with a few light words ; Ron bent the weight of his mind to it , with whole-hearted earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 4]: `` Cleverness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 4]: he repeated slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 7]: `` It 's a poor word !
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 7]: There 's no depth in it .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 28]: When a man is called clever , it means , I think , more an ability to display a superficial knowledge than any real , stored-up wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 9]: It may even be a double-edged compliment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 4]: `` Scored ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 24]: cried the Chieftain gaily , as he waved his stick in the air , and led the way forward with a jaunty tread .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 17]: `` Proposed , seconded , and carried that cleverness is a delusion to be sedulously avoided !
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 6]: Just what I always said .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 18]: I 've known clever people in my day -- squillions of them , and , my hat !
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 5]: how stupid they were !
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 15]: That little lass dabbling in the lake is wiser than the whole crowd . ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 14]: He pointed to a fair-haired child wading by the side of the tarn .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 12]: `` The spirit of childhood -- that 's what we want !
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 15]: the spirit of joy in present blessings , and untroubled trust for the future .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 18]: That little lass has a life of hardship and toil ahead -- but what does she care ?
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 23]: The sun shines to-day , and the funny wee mannie fra the inn is going to gie her a bawbee for goodies .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 25]: It 's a bad habit which he has fallen into ; a shocking bad habit , but he canna cure himself of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 33]: He threw a penny to the smiling , expectant child , then turning sharply to the left , led the way across the low-lying ground towards the base of the nearest hill .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 39]: Margot noticed that , as he went , he turned from time to time quick , scrutinising glances at Ron 's face , as though trying to satisfy a doubt , and classify him in his own mind .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 36]: Evidently the lad 's serious , somewhat pedantic manner of replying had invested him with a new interest , but when he spoke again it was only in reference to the afternoon 's expedition itself .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 14]: `` I am not going to take you far , '' he announced .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 9]: `` I object to walking , on principle .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 13]: What I maintain is , that we were never intended to walk !
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 16]: If we had been , we should have had four legs , instead of two .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 14]: I never walk if I can possibly induce something else to carry me .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 6]: And climbing is another mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 9]: What is it that one admires about mountains ?
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 5]: Their height and grandeur !
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 17]: Very well , then , where is the point of vantage from which to view them ?
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 6]: The base , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 23]: Climb up to the top , and you lose the whole effect , to say nothing of chucking away your valuable breath .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 9]: See that little path winding up the slope ?
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 55]: That leads to the moors , and when you are once on the moors you can walk about on the level all day long , if you are so disposed , and the air goes to the head of even a lazy old fellow like myself , and makes me quite gay and frisky .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 21]: You two youngsters can go on ahead and engage in light conversation , while I puff along in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 16]: At my age and bulk even the most witty conversation palls when climbing a hillside .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 29]: When you get to the end of the footpath sit down and wait till I arrive , and take no notice of me till I get my wind .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 6]: Then we 'll start fair .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 5]: Off with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 21]: Margot ran forward , laughing , and she and Ron were soon scrambling up the hillside , side by side .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 7]: `` That 's a good fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 4]: I like him !
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 18]: He will be very interesting when one gets beneath the surface , '' pronounced the boy thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 4]: Margot nodded emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 8]: `` I 'm going to love him !
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 24]: I feel it in my bones , and he is going to love me too , but unfortunately he 's the wrong man .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 30]: He says that his brother hates women , and will do all he can to avoid me , so you must take things into your own hands , Ron !
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 12]: I ca n't help you , so you must help yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 27]: You will have to cultivate his acquaintance , and get him to take you about , and talk to him , and try to get intimate .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 7]: You will , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 7]: Promise me that you will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 54]: She looked with anxiety into the lad 's face as she spoke , for previous experience had proved that Ron possessed the full share of those failings which are most characteristic of his temperament : a sudden cooling of interest at critical moments ; a shirking of responsibility , an inclination to drift .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 19]: It was a part of the artistic nature , which had an irritating effect on more practical mortals .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 26]: Now , as she feared , he remained as placidly unmoved by the intelligence as if it had no bearing whatever on his own prospects .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 6]: `` Oh , all right .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 4]: I 'll see !
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 15]: You ca n't rush things , if a fellow keeps out of your way .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 18]: Our opening will come in time , if we leave it to chance and do n't worry .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 14]: I believe I am going to do really good work here , Margot !
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 24]: I had an idea last night , after you had gone to bed , and I was watching the stars through the pines .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 27]: I wo n't read it to you yet , for it wants working up , but it 's good -- I am sure it is good !
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 28]: And that little stream along from the house ; I found a song motif in that , -- ` _ Clear babbling over amber bed _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 9]: How 's that for a word - picture ?
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 9]: Shows the whole thing , does n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 21]: The crystal clearness of the water ; the music of its flow , the curious golden colour of the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 15]: I 'm always pleased when I can hit off a description in a line .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 8]: I 'm glad we came , Margot !
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 8]: There 's inspiration in this place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 9]: But for once Margot refused to be sympathetic .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 34]: `` You did not come for inspiration , you came for a definite , practical purpose ; and if you write a hundred poems , it wo n't make up for neglecting it .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 7]: Now , Ron , wake up !
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 17]: I shall be angry with you if you do n't do all you can for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 8]: Promise me that you will try ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 4]: `` All right !
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 3]: All right !
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 13]: Do let us be happy while we have the chance , Margot .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 13]: We had enough worry at home , and this place is perfect .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 14]: Let us be wise children , and take no thought for the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 21]: What would Elgood think of you , beginning to worry about the future , the moment his back was turned ?
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 10]: She was a pretty illustration , was n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 6]: -- that little bare-headed child .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 6]: Did you notice her hair ?
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 10]: Almost white against the russet of her skin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 4]: Margot grunted unsympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 30]: She was out of breath with scrambling up the hillside , a trifle out of temper also , and consequently not in the mood to enthuse over artistic contrasts .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 29]: She did not speak again until the summit was reached , and she threw herself on the ground to rest , and wait the arrival of the Chieftain .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 51]: His gasps and grunts could already be heard in the distance , for , notwithstanding his various handicaps , he was surprisingly nimble , and in a few moments a round scarlet face hove into sight , and a round grey body rolled over on the ground by her side .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 3]: `` Piff !
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 2]: piff !
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 2]: whew-w !
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 27]: Do n't look at me , please -- I do n't like -- being stared at by ladies -- when my -- complexion is flushed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 13]: he gasped brokenly , mopping his face with a large silk handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 37]: `` Every time -- I -- come up here -- I vow I 'll -- never come again ; but when _ I 'm _ once up , I -- never want to go down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 42]: He flourished his handkerchief to the left , pointing out the wide moorland , beautiful in colouring with its bright rank greens , and the bloomy purple of heather undulating gently up and down like the waves of an inland sea .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 24]: The pure rarefied air fanned the heated faces of the climbers , and with every moment seemed to instil fresh life and vigour .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 45]: It was easy to believe that , once started , one would wander on and on over this wonderful moorland , feeling no fatigue , possessed with the desire to go farther and farther , to see what surprise lay beyond the next hillock .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 13]: After all , it was Mr Elgood who made the first start .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 60]: One moment he lay still , puffing and blowing , bemoaning past youth , and bewailing loss of strength ; the next , like an indiarubber ball , he had bounced to his feet , and was strutting forward , waving his short arms in the air , the white silk handkerchief streaming behind him like a flag . ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 7]: _ Allons , mes enfants _ !
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 7]: No lolling allowed on the moors .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 21]: Keep your eye on that green peak to the right , and make for it as straight as a die .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 36]: A few hundred yards away is a cottage where , if we are very polite and ask prettily , the guid-wife will give us a cup of buttermilk , the Gaelic substitute for afternoon tea .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 33]: In a certain spot , which shall be nameless , I should as soon think of drinking poison in glassfuls , but after a stretch on the moors it tastes like nectar !
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 10]: Take my word for it , and try ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 31]: That was the first walk which Ron and Margot had ever taken over a Scotch moor , and to the last day of their lives they remembered it with joy .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 42]: The air went to their heads so that they grew `` fey , '' and sang , and laughed , and teased each other like a couple of merry-hearted children , while the Chieftain was the biggest child of the three .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 40]: At times he declared that he was tired out and must turn back , but hardly were the words out of his mouth , than , lo , he was dancing an impromptu hornpipe with astonishing nimbleness and dexterity !
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 53]: He took a lively interest in all that his companions did and said , and did not hesitate to put question after question in order to arrive at a fuller understanding of any case in point ; but London , and all that took place in London , remained a forbidden topic .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 26]: He was the Elgood of Elgood , and they were `` his bonnie men , '' and life outside the Highlands had ceased to exist .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 49]: Margot was delighted that the little man should have a chance of seeing Ronald in one of his lightest , most boyish moods , for from the expression of his face she feared that he had not so far previously been favourably impressed by the lad 's personality .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 41]: Now it was impossible not to admire and laugh as Ron played imaginary bagpipes on the end of his walking-stick , or droned out lugubrious ballads in imitation of a strolling minstrel who had visited the inn the night before .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 37]: The ballad dramatised the circumstances of the moment : the perilous ascent , the wandering of three strangers across the moor , the flowing bowl which was to refresh and strengthen them for the return journey .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 38]: Ron 's knowledge of the native dialect was so slight that he fell back upon the more stately phraseology of the early English poets , introducing a strange Scotch term now and again with irresistibly comic effect .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 37]: The two listeners cheered him on with bursts of delighted laughter , while at an unexpected clever turn , or apt stringing together of words , the Chieftain would clap his hands and caper with delight .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 3]: `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 3]: good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 4]: he would cry .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 3]: `` Neat !
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 3]: neat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 11]: while his twinkling eyes surveyed the boy with increasing respect .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 7]: `` Do you often improvise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 34]: he asked , when the ballad came to an end , and when Ron replied truthfully enough in the negative , `` Well , I have heard many fellows do it worse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 5]: was his flattering comment .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 71]: Margot had expected more , and felt that more was deserved , for the ballad had been quite a brilliant effort to be rattled off on the spur of the moment , but she could only hope that , in conclave with his brother , the Chieftain might be more enthusiastic , and manage to impress upon that absent-minded genius that the boy was worthy of his notice and study .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 40]: In due time -- a very short time , as it appeared -- the cottage was reached owned by the `` guid-wife , '' who was ready to give -- not sell -- draughts of buttermilk to the passers-by .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 31]: Margot was a little chary of the first taste , but the keen moorland air had done its work , and she too found it as nectar to the palate .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 37]: The guid-wife `` had no English , '' but the two women conversed eloquently with the language of the eyes , concerning the sleeping baby in its cradle , and the toddling urchins around the door .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 57]: Here in the solitude this brave woman of the people reared her family , made their garments , tended them when they were sick , cooked for them , baked for them , washed for them , mended for them , and kept the three - roomed cot as exquisitely clean as hands could make it .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 34]: The girl who dusted the drawing-room and arranged a few vases of flowers as her duty in life , gazed at her with awe , and felt ashamed of her own idle existence !
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 49]: The buttermilk quaffed , Mr Elgood led the way to a thick patch of heather some few hundred yards nearer home , came to a standstill , and , spreading his handkerchief under his head , lay down with great deliberation and crossed his arms in beatific content .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 29]: `` Now , if you want to discover what comfort means , find a soft patch for yourselves , and take a nap before we start for home .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 15]: No upholsterer on earth ever manufactured a mattress to equal a bed of heather .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 40]: If you do n't want to sleep , kindly keep your distance , and enjoy yourselves with discretion , for if I 'm awakened in the middle of my siesta , nothing short of murder will appease me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 18]: He shut his eyes even as he spoke , and composed himself with a sigh of content .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 25]: Margot , nothing loath , took off her cap , and , spreading her cape over the bushes , nestled contentedly into its folds .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 51]: Ron scorned the idea of sleep , but as he was curious to test the comforts of the heather , down he lay in his turn ; and so soft , so springy , so eminently luxurious did the new bed appear , that he felt no desire to rise .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 16]: Presently his eyes dropped , rose heavily once or twice , and rose no more .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 10]: Margot 's head burrowed more deeply into her cape .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 12]: Deep regular snores sounded from the bush where Mr Elgood reposed .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 6]: All three were fast asleep !
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 28]: The sun shone on them ; the hum of a thousand insects rose from the grass ; high in the air a lark trilled his triumphant song .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 12]: It was rest indeed to sleep and dream in such surroundings !
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 4]: THE TRUE CHURCH .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 18]: Life flowed on very quietly and uneventfully at the Nag 's Head during the next few days .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 37]: The clergyman and his son were determined walkers , who set out each morning on a new expedition over the countryside , and at the evening dinner boasted of the number of miles they had traversed .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 33]: What they had seen appeared to be of secondary importance , and they were correspondingly depressed or elated according as they had fallen short of , or surpassed previous records of distance .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 58]: Mr Macalister sat in the garden , reading day-old editions of the '' _ Glasga He-rald _ '' from the front page to the last , while his wife made pilgrimages to the village shop to buy infinitesimal articles of drapery , and exchange details of domestic history with the good lady in charge of the emporium .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 29]: Mr George Elgood went out fishing in a river two or three miles distant , accompanied sometimes by his brother , but for the most part by himself .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 34]: He also sat at his bedroom window , writing by the hour together , and always and at all times he avoided his fellow-guests with a quiet persistence which could not be gainsaid .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 58]: By the time that Margot had been in the inn for four days , he had advanced to the point of bidding her good-night and good morning , staring steadily at a point about a yard above her head , while on one historic occasion he even brought himself to remark that it was a fine day .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 62]: Once also , looking up suddenly at dinner , she met his eyes fixed upon her with an expression of intent scrutiny ; but he turned aside in evident perturbation at being discovered , and though the little puss thereafter wore her prettiest dresses , and took special pains with the arrangement of her hair , the incident was never repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 40]: Goaded thereto by his sister 's entreaties , Ronald had proposed himself as the companion of a morning 's fishing expedition , but he returned home bored and irritated , and could not be persuaded to repeat the experiment .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 46]: As Mr Elgood had left him at one point in the stream , and himself repaired to another some two hundred yards distant , the opportunities for conversation had been limited , while not even a twitch of the line had rewarded his amateur efforts .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 14]: Margot coaxed , reasoned , and finally stormed , but to no avail .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 27]: In a quiet , amiable fashion , Ronald could be as obstinate as a mule , and he was plainly determined to go his own way .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 41]: The sun shone ; the surroundings were magnificent ; he was free from the jarring dissensions of home ; in easy , light-hearted manner he was content to live for the moment , and shut his eyes to troubles ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 16]: `` Remember what the Chieftain said to as the first day we were here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 4]: he protested vigorously .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 34]: `` We ought to cultivate the spirit of children ; to rejoice in the present , and trust for the future ; whereas you want me to begin worrying the very first thing .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 11]: I do call it stupid of you , Margot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 10]: `` But , my dear boy -- remember September !
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 36]: September is coming , and if you do n't bestir yourself to take advantage of this last chance , you will be bemoaning your hard fate , and calling out that your life is ruined !
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 17]: Do , for goodness ' sake , descend from the clouds and be practical for once !
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 24]: I 'd help you if I could , but how can I , when the man refuses even to look at me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 14]: Margot 's voice took a plaintive tone as she uttered those last words .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 18]: She was so unaccustomed to be ignored , that the editor 's avoidance rankled in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 55]: She found her thoughts persistently returning to him in every period of leisure ; when he was near , she was acutely conscious of his presence ; when he was absent , her mind followed after him , wondering where he was , what he was doing , and of what he was thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 83]: Having once seen a glimpse of the real man when , in the character of Elspeth , she had looked into his face , sparkling with youth , kindliness , and humour , she understood that the abstracted figure which sat at the table at meal-times was but the shell of the real George Elgood , and that , if the barriers of shyness and reserve could once be overcome , he would prove an even more fascinating companion than his brother .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 30]: The desire to know him grew daily in intensity , while , unconsciously to herself , the personal element slowly predominated the thought of Ron and Ron 's future .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 45]: Now , as the brother and sister argued together , they were hurrying along by the edge of the tarn on their way to service at the kirk , for this was Sunday morning , the fifth day after their arrival at the Glen .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 33]: Ron , as usual , had been late in starting , and before the village was reached his watch showed that it was already five minutes past the time when service began .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 61]: They had been sternly directed by Mrs McNab to go to the kirk at the far end of the village , and inquire for the inn pew , but as it would take several minutes longer to traverse the length of the straggling street , Margot suggested that it would be wise to attend the nearer of the two churches .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 7]: `` There can be no difference .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 45]: They are both Presbyterian , '' quoth she , in her ignorance ; so in they went , to be met in the doorway by an elder in his Sabbath `` blacks , '' his solemn face surrounded by a fringe of sandy whisker .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 61]: The pews were very narrow and very high , shut in a box-like seclusion by wooden doors ; the minister , in his pulpit , was just giving out the number of the psalm , and the precentor , after tapping his tuning-fork and holding it to his ear , burst forth into wailing notes of surprising strength and volume .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 23]: Margot rose automatically to her feet , to subside in confusion , as the seated congregation gazed at her in stolid rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 30]: In this kirk it was the custom to sit while singing , and stand during prayers -- a seemly and decorous habit which benighted Southerners had difficulty in understanding .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 12]: The singing of the metrical psalm sounded strangely in unaccustomed ears .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 8]: Of melody there seemed little or none .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 34]: The notes ascended and fell , and quavered into odd , unexpected trills and shakes , but it was sung with an earnestness and an intensity which could not fail to be impressive .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 60]: The women , clean and tidy in their Sabbath bravery , sat with eyes fixed unwaveringly on their books ; the children piped lustily by their sides ; at the door of the pews the heads of the different families peered over their spectacles at the printed words , their solemn , whiskered faces drawn out to abnormal length .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 29]: In a corner by himself sat a weather-beaten old shepherd , singing with closed eyes , his shaggy head waving to and fro in time with the strain .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 19]: Up in this lonesome glen those words had been his stay and comfort during a life of hardship .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 30]: Like David of old , he had sung them on the mountainside , and they had been as a guide unto his feet , a lamp unto his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 18]: He needed no book and no spectacles to enable him to join his note to the strain .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 12]: Margot looked at him with a thrill of understanding and reverence .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 28]: A saint of God , a lowly dweller on earth , for whom was waiting one of the `` higher '' places in the kingdom of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 79]: The sermon was long and rambling , and somewhat difficult for Southern ears to follow ; there was a solemn collection taken in small boxes secured to long wooden handles , thrust in turns down the various pews with somewhat comical effect ; then the service was over , and Margot and Ron came out into the village street , to find themselves face to face with a stream of worshippers who were returning from the farther kirk .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 28]: Foremost among the number was Mrs McNab , large and imposing to behold in her Sabbath best , with her small husband ambling meekly by her side .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 21]: Margot smiled at her in friendly fashion , and was dismayed to receive in return a glare of incredulous anger .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 7]: What had she done to offend ?
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 35]: She could not imagine what was wrong , and continued to stare blankly after the unbending figure , until presently her eye encountered another well - known face bent upon her with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 23]: The Chieftain and his brother were close behind ; so close that even the Editor 's shyness could not attempt an escape .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 27]: In another moment they were walking together , Margot between the two men , Ron on the outside , a few paces apart from the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 11]: Margot glanced from one to the other with puzzled eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 7]: The Chieftain beamed upon her frankly .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 14]: The Editor looked , and looked away , knitting his brows in embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 7]: `` What have I done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 4]: she cried eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 8]: `` Why is Mrs McNab so cross ?
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 11]: All was peace and joy when we left the inn .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 19]: I had done my very best to help her , and now -- you saw how she scowled !
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 13]: How can I possibly have offended her in this short time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 5]: The Chieftain chuckled softly .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 9]: `` A good deal , I 'm afraid !
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 13]: I 'm sorry for you , after all your efforts at conciliation .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 14]: It 's bad luck that you should have stumbled upon an unforgivable offence .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 22]: I 'm afraid that there is no doubt that you will be turned out of the inn , neck and crop .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 20]: Not to-day , perhaps , as she wo n't send out the trap , but certainly to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 7]: `` I sha n't go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 4]: protested Margot defiantly .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 43]: If eviction had been probable , she did not believe that the Chieftain would have taken it in so unperturbed a fashion ; but it was evident that she had committed some offence , and that he was aware of its nature .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 8]: `` But what have I done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 4]: she continued urgently .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 9]: `` That 's what I want to discover .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 12]: There ca n't be any harm in going to church ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 9]: `` Oh , ca n't there , just ?
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 9]: That 's the whole crux of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 8]: You went to the wrong church ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 20]: There was a pause of stunned surprise while Margot gasped , and Ron 's sleepy eyes brightened with curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 5]: `` The wrong church !
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 5]: How can that be ?
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 6]: They are both Scotch Presbyterians ?
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 8]: There is no difference between them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 23]: `` Only this difference , that the members of one kirk are hardly on speaking terms with the members of the other !
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 65]: That their leaders are at law together in the Courts , and that feeling runs so high , even in this sleepy hollow , that Mrs McNab , being a Free , refuses to sell milk to the ` Wees , ' and is shamed to the heart to think that a guest living under her house-roof should have condescended to attend their service .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 38]: It will be all over the Glen this afternoon that the bonny lady fra the inn chose to give her offering of siller to the ` Wees , ' and they will bear themselves haughtily in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 17]: Mrs McNab feels that she has been humiliated the day in the eyes of the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 9]: No wonder she looks coldly upon you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 18]: Margot flushed with resentment and indignation , but before she could speak Ron burst into impetuous speech .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 4]: `` They quarrel ?
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 3]: Up here ?
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 11]: A handful of men and women among the great mountains ?
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 6]: How can they do it ?
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 6]: How can they harbour ill-feeling ?
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 8]: `` And what can they quarrel about ?
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 9]: There must be such tiny , trivial differences .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 10]: I am thankful I am not a Dissenter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 4]: cried Margot proudly .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 27]: `` There are so many sects that one gets muddled among them all , and even in the same one it appears that there are differences !
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 11]: I am thankful that I belong to the Church . ''
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 7]: The Chieftain looked at her quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 6]: `` To which Church ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 10]: `` The Church of England , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 7]: He elevated his light eyebrows expressively .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 12]: `` Because its members have no quarrels with one another ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 4]: Margot frowned uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 10]: `` Oh , well -- I suppose they have .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 15]: But at the worst there are two parties , as compared to a dozen .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 11]: You can not deny that we are more united ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 31]: `` I should not boast too much about the unity of a Church in which civil war is permanently in progress ; and what about charity and humility of mind ?
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 35]: Suppose now , suppose for a moment that a family of strangers come to live in the house next your own in town , and you discover among other things that they are Dissenters .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 10]: How does it influence your attitude towards them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 12]: He thrust his ruddy face nearer , staring fixedly into hers .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 5]: `` Answer me that !
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 5]: Feel just the same ?
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 4]: Exactly the same ?
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 9]: No cooling off in the intention to call ?
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 15]: _ Quite _ sure you never used the expression , ` only Dissenters ! '
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 9]: and passed by on the other side ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 5]: Margot 's cheeks blazed .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 15]: Her lids dropped , and the corners of her mouth drooped in self-conscious shame .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 45]: There was a moment 's silence , then a low murmur sounded on her ear , and , looking up quickly , she saw the Editor 's dark face turned upon his brother , with reproach written large in frowning brow and flashing eye .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 22]: He was taking up the cudgels in her defence ; reproaching his own brother for forcing her into an awkward position .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 39]: Margot 's heart gave a leap of joy at the discovery ; in the flash of an eye her mood , her outlook on life , the very scene itself , seemed transfused with new radiance and joy .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 28]: The sun seemed to peep out through the grey clouds , the underlying anxiety and worry of the past days took to itself wings , and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 30]: Her brown eyes thanked him with a glance more eloquent than she was aware ; she laughed softly , and her laugh was sweet as a chime of bells .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 6]: `` Yes , I have !
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 4]: I confess it .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 14]: I 've been narrow-minded and uncharitable , and a snob into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 19]: I 've no right to throw stones ... What Church do you belong to , Mr Elgood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 26]: The little man stood still in the middle of the road , throwing out his arms on either side , with a gesture wonderfully eloquent .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 11]: His round , chubby face shone with earnestness and exaltation .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 7]: `` To the Church of Christ !
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 14]: The Church of loyalty , and obedience , and love towards the brethren !
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 11]: To the Church of Christ , wherever I find it !
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 21]: When will Christians learn to remember the points on which they agree , rather than those on which they differ ?
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 39]: The questions of form and ceremony ; of Church government and ritual ; how small they are , how unutterably trivial , compared to the great facts of the Fatherhood of God , and the sacrifice of Christ !
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 24]: Did the Power who made every one of us with different faces and different forms , expect us all to think mathematically alike ?
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 6]: I can not believe it !
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 34]: It is our duty to trust in God and love our brethren ; to live together in peace , seeing the best in each other , acknowledging the best , thinking no evil !
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 28]: To see men who make a profession of religion quarrelling and persecuting each other for trivial differences , is a ghastly spectacle -- a ghastly spectacle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 26]: He walked on , swinging his short arms to and fro , then suddenly looked up with a keen glance into Ron 's eager face .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 60]: There were no traces of dreaminess in the brown eyes at this moment ; the dilated pupil gave to them an appearance of extraordinary depth and intensity ; it was easy to see that the lad had been swept off his feet by the rugged force of the speaker 's words , and was kindled into a like enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 40]: Lads of nineteen and twenty make it so much a matter of principle to suppress all exhibition of feeling , that it is almost startling to come across one who is not ashamed to betray a little human emotion .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 35]: Mr Elgood evidently found it so , for he continued to cast those quick peering glances until the inn was reached , and the little party separated , to prepare for the midday dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 25]: Margot walked slowly up the steep staircase leading to her room , and sat herself down on the bed to think out the problem .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 29]: More and more did she long to pierce through the armour by which the strange , silent man was enveloped ; but how was it to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 40]: Opportunities were few and far between , and now , for the first time in her life , confidence in her own powers deserted her , and she was overcome by a strange new feeling of humility and doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 39]: Who and what was she , that such a man should stoop to accept her friendship ; poor , unlettered girl that she was , while he was acknowledged as one of the leading intellects of the day ?
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 37]: Yet deep in her heart the thought lingered that between this man and herself existed a certain affinity , which , given an opportunity , might bridge over greater gaps than that of intellect and learning .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 8]: How was that opportunity to be gained ?
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 32]: She might be willing to sacrifice much to attain it , but there was one thing that could never be thrown on one side -- her natural maidenly pride and dignity !
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 39]: Not even for Ron 's sake could she bring herself to make advances to a man who , so far from exhibiting any desire for her company , had gone markedly out of his way to avoid it .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 31]: Ron himself was useless in such circumstances , a creature of moods , living for the moment only , content to forget the future in the enjoyment of present good .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 44]: To drive him into the Editor 's company against his will could do no good , since he would certainly reveal himself in his worst light , and in aggravating , topsy-turvy fashion he had taken a violent fancy for the wrong brother .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 38]: The Chieftain 's geniality and candour , his boy-like lightness of heart on the one hand , his passion for right on the other , were fast developing a species of hero-worship in the lad 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 33]: Margot foresaw that , as time passed by , the two would grow closer together , and that any chance of intimacy with the other brother would retreat helplessly into the background .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 3]: Unless -- !
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 16]: Her face flamed as a possible solution of the difficulty darted suddenly into her mind .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 3]: Could she ?
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 5]: Dared she risk it ?
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 5]: Yes , she could .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 32]: It would be difficult , but she could bring herself to face it , if after a few days ' consideration it still seemed the only way out of the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 14]: Margot rose from the bed , and began quietly to prepare for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 17]: Her face looked grave and anxious , but it had lost its troubled , fretted expression .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 21]: She had made up her mind what to do , and with the decision came rest and ease of mind .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 4]: MUSIC HATH CHARMS .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 61]: For the next two days it rained incessantly , and Margot sat in the little parlour of the inn talking to Mrs Macalister , or rather listening while Mrs Macalister talked , and playing draughts with Mr Macalister , who had relapsed into hopeless gloom of mind , and was with difficulty prevented from rushing home by the first train .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 31]: `` The doctor said we were to keep him from the office for a good month at least , and there 's not three weeks of the time gone by .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 25]: If he goes back now , what will be the use of spending all this money on travelling and keep , and what not ?
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 14]: It will be all clean waste , '' sighed the poor dame sadly .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 28]: `` He 's a bit fratchety and irritable , I 'm free to admit , but you should not judge a man when his nerves are upset .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 17]: There 's not a better man on earth than Mr Macalister when he has his health .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 32]: It 's dull for a man-body to be shut up in an inn , without the comforts of home , and feeling all the time that there 's money going out .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 17]: It is different when he can be out and about with his fishing and what not .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 17]: -- If you could just manage to amuse him a bit , like a good lassie !
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 14]: ... '' The good lassie nodded reassuringly into the troubled , kindly face .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 7]: `` I 'll do my best .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 22]: I have an old father of my own , who has nerves too , and I am used to amusing him .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 13]: I 'll take Mr Macalister in hand till the weather clears . ''
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 52]: It was not a congenial task , for , truth to tell , Mr Macalister was not a beguiling object , with his lugubrious face , lack-lustre eyes , and sandy , outstanding whiskers ; nor did he in the first instance betray any gratitude for the attention bestowed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 45]: A stolid glance over his spectacles was his first response to Margot 's overtures ; his next , a series of grunts and sniffs , and when at last he condescended to words it was invariably to deride or throw doubt on her statements .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 5]: `` Tut , nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 5]: Who told you that ?
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 8]: I would think so , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 14]: followed by another and more determined retreat behind the _ Glasgow Herald _ .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 47]: In the corner of the room Mrs Macalister sat meekly knitting , never venturing a look upwards so long as her spouse was in view , but urging Margot onward by nods and winks and noiseless mouthings , the moment that she was safe from observation .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 13]: It had its comic side , but it was also somewhat pathetic .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 36]: These two good commonplace souls had travelled through life together side by side for over thirty years , and , despite age , infirmity , and `` nearves '' , were still lovers at heart .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 43]: Before the wife 's eyes the figure of `` Mr Macalister '' loomed so large that it blocked out the entire world ; to him , even in this hour of depression , `` the wife '' was the one supreme authority .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 29]: Fortunately for herself and her friends , Margot was gifted with sufficient insight to grasp the poetry behind the prose , and it gave her patience to persevere .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 28]: Solution came at last , in the shape of the wheezy old piano in the corner , opened in a moment of aimless wandering to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 39]: Margot was no great performer , but what she could play she played by heart , and Nature had provided her with a sweet , thrush-like voice , with that true musical thrill which no teaching can impart .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 21]: At the first few bars of a Chopin nocturne Mr Macalister 's newspaper wavered , and fell to his knee .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 27]: Margot heard the rustle of it , slid gradually into a simpler melody , and was conscious of a heavy hand waving steadily to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 4]: `` Ha-ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 11]: murmured Mr Macalister , at the end of the strain .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 3]: `` Hum-hum !
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 10]: The piano wants tuning , I 'm thinking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 37]: It was foreign to his nature to express any gratification , but that he had deigned to speak at all was a distinct advance , and equal to a whole volume of compliments from another man .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 27]: `` Maybe , '' he added , after a pause , `` if ye were to sing us a ballad it would be less obsearved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 36]: So Margot sang , and , finding a book of Scotch selections , could gratify the old man by selecting his favourite airs , and providing him with an excuse to hum a gentle accompaniment .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 13]: Music , it appeared , was Mr Macalister 's passion in life .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 47]: As a young man he had been quite a celebrated performer at Penny Readings and Church Soirees , and had been told by a lady who had heard Sims Reeves that she preferred his rendering of `` Tom Bowling '' to that of the famous tenor .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 19]: This anecdote was proudly related by his wife , and though Mr Macalister cried , `` Hoots ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 20]: and rustled his paper in protest , it was easy to see that he was gratified by the remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 56]: Margot essayed one Scotch air after another , and was instructed in the proper pronunciation of the words ; feigning , it is to be feared , an extra amount of incapacity to pronounce the soft `` ch , '' for the sake of giving her patient a better opportunity of displaying his superior adroitness .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 43]: Comparatively speaking , Mr Macalister became quite genial and agreeable in the course of that musical hour , and when Margot finished her performance by singing `` The Oak and the Ash , '' he waxed , for him , positively enthusiastic .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 18]: `` It 's a small organ , '' he pronounced judicially , `` a ve-ry small organ .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 28]: Ye would make a poor show on a concert platform , but for all that , I 'm not saying that it might not have been worse .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 13]: Ye can keep in tune , and that 's a mearcy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 12]: `` Indeed , Alexander , I call it a bonnie voice !
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 17]: There 's no call for squallings and squakings in a bit of a room like this .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 30]: I love to hear a lassie 's voice sound sweet and clear , and happy like herself , and that 's just the truth about Miss Vane 's singing .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 6]: Thank ye , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 10]: It 's been a treat to hear you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 53]: The broad , beaming smile , the sly little nod behind Mr Macalister 's back , proclaiming triumph and delighted gratitude -- these sent Margot up to her room heartened and revived in spirits , for there is nothing on earth so invigorating as to feel that we have helped a fellow-creature .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 22]: The sunshine came back to her own heart , even as it was slowly breaking its way through the clouds overhead .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 38]: She thrust her head out of the window , and opening her mouth , drank in great gulps of the fresh damp air , so sweet and reviving after the mouldy atmosphere of `` the parlour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 28]: Over the mountain tops in the direction from which the wind was blowing the clouds were slowly drifting aside , leaving broader and broader patches of blue .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 2]: Blue !
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 10]: After the long grey hours of rain and mist .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 9]: The rapture of it was almost beyond belief !
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 14]: A few minutes more , and the glen would be alight with sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 21]: She would put on boots , cap , and cape , and hurry out to enjoy every moment that remained .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 41]: The strong-soled little boots were lifted from their corner behind the door , and down sat Margot on the floor , school-girl fashion , and began to thread the laces in and out , and tie them securely into place .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 27]: Then the deerstalker cap was pinned on top of the chestnut locks , and the straps of the grey cape crossed over the white flannel blouse .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 30]: Now she was ready , and the sunshine was already calling to her from without , dancing across the floor , and bringing a delicious warmth into the atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 25]: Margot threw open the door and was about to descend the narrow staircase , when she stopped short , arrested by an unexpected sound .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 27]: Some one was singing softly in a room near at hand , repeating the refrain of the ballad which she had taken last on her list .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 28]: The deep bass tones lingered softly on the words -- `` And the lad who marries me , Must carry me hame to my North Coun-tree ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 14]: George Elgood was echoing her song in the seclusion of his own room !
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 17]: He had been indoors all the time , then , listening to her while she sang !
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 33]: Margot 's cheeks grew hot with embarrassment , yet in the repeated strain there was a suggestion of appreciation , of lingering enjoyment which did away with the idea of adverse criticism .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 25]: `` Oh , the Oak and the Ash , '' -- the strain seemed to swell in volume , growing ever nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 44]: `` And the lad who marries me -- '' The door flew open , and they stood facing one another , each framed as in a picture in the lintel of the doorways , divided only by a few yards of boarded passage .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 20]: The strain came to an abrupt conclusion , frozen upon his lips by the shock of surprise and embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 61]: For the third time in their short acquaintance Margot looked straight into his eyes ; for the third time recognised in their depths something that in mysterious fashion seemed to respond to a want in her own nature ; for the third time saw the lids drop , heard an unintelligible murmur of apology , and watched a hasty retreat .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 47]: For a moment Margot stood motionless , an expression of wounded pride clouding the young rounded face , then very slowly descended the staircase , traversed the length of the `` lobby , '' and stood outside the door , looking anxiously to right and left .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 55]: There he was , a strong , well-built figure in knickerbockers and Norfolk coat striding rapidly up the hill path to the right , -- trying , no doubt , to put as much distance as possible between himself and the objectionable girl who seemed ever to be appearing when she was not wanted .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 35]: For a long minute Margot stood gazing miserably ahead , then turning resolutely to the left , came face to face with the Chieftain returning from the village with his pockets bulging with papers .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 18]: His sudden appearance at this moment of depression had a peculiar significance to the girl 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 37]: Doubt crystallised into resolution ; with a rapid beating of the heart she determined to grasp her courage in both hands , and boldly make the plunge which she had been meditating for some days past .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 2]: REVELATIONS .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 22]: At sight of Margot the Chieftain first beamed delight , and then screwed his chubby face into an expression of concern .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 3]: `` Halloa !
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 4]: What 's up ?
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 7]: You look pretty middling doleful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 26]: cried he , casting an eloquent glance towards the inn windows , then lowering his voice to a stage whisper , `` Macalisteritis , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 8]: Too much stuffy parlour and domestic reminiscences ?
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 3]: Never mind !
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 8]: Pack clouds away , and welcome day !
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 27]: The sun is shining , and I have a packet of bull 's eyes for you in one pocket and a budget of letters in another .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 6]: No , you do n't !
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 32]: Not one single one of them to read in the house -- come and sit on a stone by the tarn , and we 'll suck peppermints and read 'em together .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 18]: Wonderful how much better you 'll feel when you 've had a good blow of fresh air .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 22]: I was prancing mad when I went out this afternoon , but now -- a child might play with me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 59]: He threw out his short arms with his favourite sweeping gesture , his coat flapped to and fro in the breeze , he stepped out with such a jaunty tread on his short broad feet , that at sight of him Margot 's depression vanished like smoke , and she trotted along by his side with willing footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 5]: `` That 's better !
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 4]: That 's better !
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 19]: Never saw you look melancholy before , and never want to again ... ` Shocking disappearance of dimples !
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 8]: A young lady robbed of her treasures !
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 5]: Thief still at large !
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 6]: Consternation in the neighbourhood ! '
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 2]: Eh !
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 4]: How 's that ?
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 15]: Young women who have been endowed with dimples should never indulge in low spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 9]: It 's a criminal offence against their neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 6]: Where 's your brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 9]: Margot laughed at the suddenness of the question .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 25]: It was one of the Chieftain 's peculiarities to leap upon one like this , taking one unawares , and surprising thereby involuntary revelations .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 11]: `` I do n't know , '' she answered truthfully .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 18]: `` Over the hills and far away , I suppose -- studying them in a new aspect .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 26]: He loved them yesterday in the rain ; to-day he felt sure that it would clear , and he wanted to see the mists rise .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 9]: He does so intensely love studying Nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 4]: `` Humph ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 14]: Margot looked at him sharply , her head involuntarily assuming a defensive tilt .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 11]: `` What does ` Humph ' mean , pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 10]: `` Just exactly and precisely what it says ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 12]: `` It does n't sound at all flattering or nice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 4]: `` Probably not .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 8]: It was n't intended to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 8]: `` Mr Elgood , how can you !
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 15]: What can you have to say about Ron that is n't to his credit ?
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 6]: I thought you liked him !
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 6]: I thought you admired him !
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 20]: You must see -- you _ must _ -- that he is different from other boys of his age .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 12]: So much more clever , and thoughtful , and appreciative ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 9]: `` That 's where the pity comes in !
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 32]: It 's pitiful to see a lad like that mooning away his time , when he ought to be busy at football or cricket , or playing tricks on his betters .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 8]: What business has he to appreciate Nature ?
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 4]: Tell me that !
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 10]: At twenty -- is it , or only nineteen ?
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 30]: -- he ought to be too much engrossed in exercising his muscles , and letting off steam generally , to bother his head about effects of sun and mist .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 6]: Sun and mist , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 28]: A good wholesome ordinary English lad does n't care a toss about sun or mist , except as they help or hinder his enjoyment of sport ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 12]: `` Ronald is not an ` ordinary English boy ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 3]: `` Hoity-toity !
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 6]: Now she 's offended ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 24]: The Chieftain looked at his companion 's flushed cheeks with twinkling eyes , not one whit daunted by her airs of dignified displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 15]: `` Do n't want me to say what is n't true , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 29]: He 's a nice lad -- a very nice lad , and a clever one into the bargain , though by no means the paragon you think him .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 23]: That 's why I 'm sorry to see him frittering away his youth , instead of making hay while the sun shines .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 7]: He 'll be old soon enough .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 16]: Wake up some fine morning to find himself with a bald head and stiff joints .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 6]: Then he 'll be sorry !
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 15]: Would n't bother my head about him if I did n't like the lad .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 4]: Have a peppermint ?
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 7]: It will soothe your feelings . ''
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 16]: The parcel of round black bull 's eyes was held towards Margot in ingratiating fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 33]: It was impossible to refuse , impossible to cherish angry feelings , impossible to do anything but laugh and be happy in the presence of this kindest and most cheery of men .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 22]: Margot took the peppermint , and sucked it with frank enjoyment the while she sat by the tarn reading her letters .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 37]: Having received nothing from home for several days , the same post had now brought letters from her father , Edith , and Agnes , to say nothing of illustrated missives from the two small nephews .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 24]: Mr Vane 's note was short , and more an echo of her own last letter than a record of his own doings .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 31]: `` Glad to know that you like your surroundings -- pleased to hear that the weather keeps fine -- hope you will enjoy your excursion , '' etcetera , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 21]: Just at the end came a few sentences which to the reader 's quick wits were full of hidden meaning .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 16]: `` Agnes is taking the opportunity of your absence to organise a second spring cleaning .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 12]: It seems only the other day since we were upset before .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 8]: I dined at the club last night .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 16]: It is difficult to know what to do with oneself on these long light evenings .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 27]: -- I would run away over Sunday , if I could think of any place I cared to go to ... Town seems very empty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 6]: `` Poor dear darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 21]: murmured Margot sympathetically , at which the Chieftain lifted his eyes to flash upon her a glance of twinkling amusement .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 29]: He made no spoken comment , however , but returned to the perusal of his own correspondence , while Margot broke open the envelope of Agnes 's letter .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 38]: Two sheets of handwriting , with immense spaces between both words and lines -- `` My dear Margot , '' as a beginning -- `` Your affectionate sister , Agnes Mary Vane , '' as a conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 13]: Thrilling information to the effect that the charwoman was coming on Friday .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 9]: Complaints of the late arrival of the sweep .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 14]: Information requested concerning a missing mat which was required to complete a set .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 9]: Mild disapproval of the Nag 's Head Inn .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 16]: `` I can not understand what you find to rave about in such quarters . ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 42]: A sigh of impatience and resignation was the tribute paid to this letter , and then Margot settled herself more comfortably on the stone , and prepared to enjoy a treat -- a real heart-to-heart talk with her beloved eldest sister .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 7]: Edith had the gift of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 28]: Just as Agnes never understood , Edith always seemed able to put herself in another 's place , and enter into that person 's joys and griefs .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 34]: She herself might be sad and downcast , but in her darkest hour she could always rejoice in another 's good fortune , and forget her own woes in eager interest and sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 38]: Now , sitting alone in the dreary lodging-house sitting-room in Oxford Terrace , she was able mentally to project herself into the far-off Highland glen , and to feel an ungrudging joy in the pleasure of others .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 10]: Never a hint of `` How I envy you !
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 8]: How I wish I were there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 72]: Not a mention of `` I '' in obtruding , shadow-like fashion from first to last , but instead , tender little anecdotes about the boys ; motherly solicitude for their benefit , and humble asking of advice from one younger and less experienced than herself ; an outpouring of tenderness for her husband , and of a beautiful and unbroken trust and belief , which failure was powerless to shake .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 18]: `` Jack is working like a slave trying to build up the ruins of the old business .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 21]: It is difficult , discouraging work , and so far the results are practically nil , but they will come .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 4]: Something will come !
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 30]: More and more I feel the conviction in my heart that all this trouble and upheaval have been because God has some better thing in store for us both .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 15]: We have only to wait and be patient , and the way will open .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 21]: -- I do n't want to be rich , only just to have enough money to live simply and quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 18]: We are so rich in each other 's companionship that we can afford to do without luxuries .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 57]: Last night we had a dinner of herbs -- literally herbs -- a vegetarian feast costing about sixpence halfpenny , but with such lots of love to sweeten it , and afterwards we went out for a stroll into the Park , and I wore the hat you trimmed , and Jack made love to me .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 6]: We _ were _ happy !
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 10]: I saw people looking at us with envious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 47]: They thought we were a pair of lovers building castles in the air , instead of an old married couple with two bouncing boys , having the workhouse in much nearer proximity than any castle -- but they were right to envy us all the same .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 7]: We have the best thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 31]: The letter dropped on to Margot 's knee , and she sat silent , gazing before her with shining eyes , her face softened into a beautiful tenderness of expression .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 65]: For some time she was unconscious that her companion had returned his own letters to his coat pocket , and was lying along the ground , his head resting upon his hand , watching her with a very intent scrutiny ; but when at last her eyes were unconsciously drawn towards him , she spoke at once , as if answering an unspoken question .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 9]: `` What a wonderful thing love is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 10]: The Chieftain 's light eyebrows were elevated in interrogation .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 18]: `` In connection with the ` dear darling ' previously mentioned , if one may ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 6]: `` That was my father .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 18]: I love him dearly , but just now I was thinking of the other sort of love .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 8]: This letter is from my eldest sister .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 47]: She was a beautiful girl , and could have married half a dozen rich men if she had wished , but she chose the poorest of them all , a dear , good , splendid man , who has been persistently unsuccessful all the way through .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 14]: Everything -- financially speaking , I mean , -- has been against him .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 25]: They have had continual anxiety and curtailment , until at last they have had to let their pretty house and go into dingy lodgings .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 8]: My father is very down on Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 31]: He is a successful man himself , and do n't you think it needs a very fine nature to keep up faith in a person who seems persistently to fail ?
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 6]: But my sister never doubts .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 20]: She loves her husband more , and idealises him more , than on the day they were married . ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 9]: `` And you call that man unsuccessful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 32]: Margot hardly recognised the low , earnest tones : her quick glance downward surprised a spasm of pain on the chubby face , which she had always associated with unruffled complacency .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 19]: It appeared that here also lay a hidden trouble , a secret grief carefully concealed from the world .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 11]: `` Is n't that rather a misuse of the word ?
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 27]: A man who has gained and kept such a love can never be called a failure by any one who understands the true proportions of life .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 21]: With all his monetary losses he is rich ... And she is rich also ... Richer than she knows . ''
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 15]: Margot 's hand closed impulsively on Edith 's letter and held it towards him .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 7]: `` Yes , you are right .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 12]: Read that , and you will see how right you are .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 30]: There are no secrets in it -- its just a word-photograph of Edith herself , and I 'd like you to see her , as you understand so well .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 17]: She 's my dearest sister , whom I admire more than anybody in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 28]: Mr Elgood took the letter without a word , and read over its contents slowly once , and then , even more slowly , a second time .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 24]: When at last he had finished he still held the sheet in his hands , smoothing it out with gentle , reverent fingers .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 4]: he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 6]: `` I can see her .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 6]: She is a beautiful creature .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 10]: I should like to know her in the flesh .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 10]: You must introduce us to one another some day .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 14]: I have n't come across too many women like that in my life .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 19]: It would be an honour to know her , to help her , if that were possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 16]: He sighed , and stretching out his hand laid the letter on Margot 's knee .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 16]: `` You are right , Miss Bright Eyes , love is a wonderful thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 25]: Margot glanced at him with involuntary , girlish curiosity , the inevitable question springing to her lips before Prudence had time to order silence .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 17]: `` Do you -- have you -- did you ever -- '' The Chieftain laughed softly .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 12]: `` Have I ever been in love , you would ask !
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 9]: What do you take me for , pray ?
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 24]: Am I such a blind , cold-hearted clod that I could go through the world for forty-five years and keep my heart untouched ?
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 6]: Of course I have loved .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 4]: I do love !
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 20]: It was once and for ever with me -- '' `` But you are not -- '' `` Married ?
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 17]: She died long ago ; but even if she had lived she was not for me .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 22]: She would have been the wife of another man ; a good fellow ; I think she would have been happy .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 9]: As it is , we remember her together .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 31]: She was a bright , sunshiny creature who carried happiness with her wherever she went ... To have known her is the comfort of our lives -- not the grief .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 33]: We have lived through the deep waters , and can now rejoice in her gain ... Do you know there is something about yourself which has reminded me of her several times !
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 18]: That is one reason why I like being with you , and am interested in your life .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 32]: I should like you to think of me as a friend , and come to me for help if you were ever in need of anything that I could give . ''
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 16]: The colour rushed into Margot 's cheeks , and her heart beat with suffocating quickness .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 24]: Here was the opportunity for which she had longed , offered to her without any preliminary effort or contriving on her own part !
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 18]: The place , the time , the person were all in readiness , waiting for her convenience .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 22]: If through cowardice or wavering she allowed the moment to pass , she could never again hope for another such opening .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 26]: Already the Chieftain was watching her with surprise and curiosity , the softness of the last few minutes giving place to the usual alert good-humour .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 3]: `` Hey ?
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 5]: What 's the trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 4]: Out with it !
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 6]: Anything I can do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 25]: `` Mr Elgood , '' said Margot faintly , `` you are very good , very kind ; I am most grateful to you .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 30]: I hope you _ will _ help me , but first there is something I must say ... I -- I have been deceiving you from the beginning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 13]: The Chieftain sat up suddenly and stared at her beneath frowning brows .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 4]: `` Deceiving me ?
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 4]: _ You _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 9]: I do n't believe a word of it !
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 10]: What is there to deceive me about , pray ?
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 12]: You are not masquerading under a false name , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 19]: Not married , for instance , and passing yourself off as single for some silly school-girl freak ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 4]: `` Oh no !
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 3]: Oh no !
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 15]: Everything that I have told you about myself is true , absolutely true . ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 5]: `` I knew it .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 11]: You are not the sort that could act a lie .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 10]: What 's all the fuss about , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 23]: `` What I have told you is true , but -- but -- I have not told you _ all _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 8]: `` I should think not , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 6]: Who expected that you should ?
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 14]: I am not at all sure that I care to hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 12]: `` Oh , but -- I want to tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 6]: The Chieftain chuckled with amusement .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 27]: He was evidently comfortably convinced of the non-importance of the forthcoming revelations , and Margot 's courage suffered another ebb as she returned his unsuspicious glance .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 18]: `` I -- we -- we knew that you were staying at the Nag 's Head ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 11]: The Chieftain cocked a surprised eyebrow , startled but unresentful .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 19]: `` You knew that we were here , before you arrived , and met us in the flesh ?
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 4]: Is that so ?
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 6]: I wonder how you heard !
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 41]: I make it a rule to keep my holiday plans as secret as possible , for the very good reason that a holiday _ is _ a holiday , and one wants a change of companionship as well as scene .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 14]: How in the world did you hear that we were bound for Glenaire ?
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 5]: I 'm curious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 66]: Margot 's eyelids fell guiltily , but Nature had generously endowed these same lids with long black lashes , the points of which curled up in a manner distractingly apparent when shown in contrast with a flushed pink cheek ; so it happened that instead of being hardened by the sight , the Chieftain drew a few inches nearer , and smiled with genial approval .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 7]: `` Well , out with it !
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 8]: _ How _ did you hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 6]: `` I -- asked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 4]: `` Asked ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 9]: The brow became a network of astonished wrinkling .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 4]: `` You asked ?
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 5]: Whom did you ask ?
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 3]: And why ?
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 17]: What did you know about us , to give you interest in our comings or goings ?
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 6]: This grows curiouser and curiouser !
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 17]: I imagined that we were as absolute strangers to you as you were to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 18]: `` It -- it -- there was the magazine -- it was because of the magazine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 5]: `` Oh , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 8]: You knew the name through the magazine !
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 4]: I understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 14]: The Chieftain straightened himself , and the laugh died out of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 52]: For the first time in the history of their short acquaintance Margot saw his face set in firm , hard lines , the business face which had been left at home , together with the black coats and silk hats of City wear , and seeing it , trembled with fear .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 26]: But it was too late to retreat ; for better or worse she was bound to go forward and complete her half - finished revelations .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 63]: `` I wanted to get to know your brother , because he is the editor of the _ Loadstar _ , and I had heard people say that he was the most powerful literary man in London ; that if he chose to take up any one who was beginning to write he could do more to help than any one else .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 13]: We know no literary people at home , and I wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 3]: Badly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 4]: `` I see !
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 3]: Just so .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 19]: Written a novel , and want help to get it into print , '' returned the Chieftain slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 20]: He had drawn down his lips into an expression of preternatural gravity , but the hard look had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 29]: The murder was out , and he was not angry ; he might pretend to be , but Margot was too sharp-witted to be frightened by a pretence .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 15]: She drew a sigh of relief as she replied -- `` No , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 7]: Could n't to save my life .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 5]: It 's -- Ron !
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 10]: I was thinking of him , not of myself .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 6]: He is a poet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 10]: The Chieftain groaned aloud , as if in pain .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 15]: `` Oh , I know you wo n't believe it , but he is !
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 5]: He writes wonderful poems .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 14]: Not rhymes , but poems ; beautiful poems that live in your mind .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 15]: He will be another Tennyson or Browning when he is a little older . ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 12]: The Chieftain groaned again , a trifle more loudly than before .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 5]: `` It 's true !
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 5]: It really is true .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 16]: You must have seen yourself that he is different from other boys of his age .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 19]: You heard him reeling off those impromptu lines the other day , and said how clever they were !
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 17]: I have seen you looking at his face when he has been thinking out some idea .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 24]: I knew what he was doing , and you did n't ; but you guessed that he was different from ordinary people . ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 20]: `` I saw that he was mooning about something , and wondered if he was right in the head !
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 30]: If he 'd been my boy , I should have taken care to keep his nose so close to the grindstone that he would have no time to moon !
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 4]: Poet , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 14]: Did n't you tell me that your father was a successful business man ?
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 11]: What is he about , to countenance such nonsense ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 6]: `` He does n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 4]: replied Margot sadly .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 16]: `` No one does but me , and that 's why I had to act .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 5]: Father agrees with you .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 28]: He does n't care for books , and looks down upon literary men as poor , effeminate sort of creatures , who know nothing of the world .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 10]: He is ashamed that his only son writes verses .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 38]: Ron detests the idea of business , but he has had to promise father that he would go into his office if at the end of a year he had had no encouragement to persevere in literature .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 12]: But how is a young unknown poet to make himself known ?
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 33]: The magazines announce that they can accept no unsolicited poetical contributions ; the publishers laugh at the idea of bringing out a book by a man of whom no one has heard .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 28]: A boy might be a second Shakespeare , but no one would believe in him until they had first broken his heart by their ridicule and unbelief .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 23]: The year is out in September , so matters were getting desperate , when at last I -- thought of this plan !
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 42]: I felt sure that if a man who was a real judge of literary power met Ron face to face , and got to know him , he would realise his gifts , and be willing to give him a chance .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 25]: It was no use trying in London in the midst of the full pressure of work , but in the country everything is different .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 50]: I knew a man who knew a man in the office of the _ Loadstar _ , and asked him to find out your brother 's plans -- '' As she was speaking Margot was conscious of a succession of stifled chuckles which her companion vainly tried to suppress .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 40]: The Chieftain 's amusement had evidently overmastered his threatened displeasure , and when at length she paused , he burst into an irresistible guffaw of laughter , rubbed his hands together , and cried gleefully -- `` Stalked him !
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 3]: Stalked him !
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 4]: Poor old George !
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 7]: Big game , and no mistake .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 9]: Ran him to earth ... Eh , what ?
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 8]: Bravo , bravo , Miss Bright Eyes !
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 7]: You are a first-class conspirator . ''
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 29]: He laughed again and again , with ever-increasing merriment , laughed till his eyes disappeared in wrinkles of fat , till the tears streamed helplessly down his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 22]: His portly form shook with the violence of his merriment ; he kicked the air with his short , fat feet .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 67]: Margot stared at this strange exhibition in an amazement , which gradually changed into annoyance and outraged dignity ; so that when at last the Chieftain sat up to mop his eyes with a large silk pocket - handkerchief , he beheld a very dignified young lady sitting by his side in a position of poker-like rigidity , with her head tilted to an expressive angle .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 4]: `` Sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 4]: he panted hastily .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 5]: `` Sorry I smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 16]: A compliment , you know , if you look at it in the right light .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 12]: It 's such an uncommonly good idea , and so original .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 10]: ` The Stalking of the Editor ' -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 22]: Well , now that you have made such a rattling good beginning , why do n't you go on and prosper ?
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 14]: Here you are ; there he is ; the field is your own .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 10]: Why do n't you go in and win ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 27]: Margot 's face fell , and her haughty airs vanished , as she turned towards him a pair of widely-opened eyes , eloquent with plaintive surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 6]: `` But I ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 13]: How can I , when he runs away the moment I appear ?
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 29]: I made Ron go fishing with him one day , but he went off and left him alone , and now it 's no use persuading any more .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 9]: Ron says it is only waste of time !
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 51]: As for me , I have hardly spoken a word to him all this time , though I feel that if I did really know him , I -- '' she hesitated , knitting her brows , and pursing her soft red lips -- `` I could make him understand !
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 33]: I decided at last to confide in you , because you have been so kind and friendly to us from the first that I felt sure you would be willing to help .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 7]: You will , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 27]: Even if personally you do n't approve of a literary career , will you give Ron a chance of living his life in his own way ?
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 34]: If your brother approved of his writings , and helped him to a beginning , even the very smallest beginning , father would be satisfied that he was not wasting his time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 18]: The Chieftain clasped his hands around his knees , and sat staring at her with thoughtful gaze .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 40]: His eyes rested upon the clear childlike eyes , the sweet lips , the broad , honest brow , as though studying them in a new light , and with regard to some problem suddenly presented to the mind .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 36]: Whatever was the question waiting to be decided , the answer was self - evidently favourable , for his eyes lightened , he stretched out an impetuous hand , and laid it upon her arm .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 4]: `` Right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 4]: he cried heartily .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 3]: `` Right !
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 5]: I 'll help you !
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 25]: The lad 's a good lad , and a clever lad ; but what I do will be for your sake , not his !
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 6]: You are a dear girl !
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 11]: The dearest girl I have ever met -- save one !
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 20]: For the sake of the bit of her that lives again in you , I am at your service .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 6]: You shall have your chance .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 20]: From to-day forward I will see to it that George makes a member of our party wherever we go .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 15]: He has done enough writing ; it is time that he began to play .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 7]: Make him play , Miss Vane !
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 14]: He has been old all his life ; teach him to be young !
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 15]: He is the best fellow in the world , but he is fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 4]: Wake him up !
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 24]: There is just one condition , and that is , that you leave your brother and his scribblings alone for the time being !
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 37]: Do n't mention them , or any question of the sort , but be content just to show yourself to George , your own bright , natural girl-self , as you have shown it to me .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 13]: Learn to know one another , and forget all about the boy .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 7]: His turn will come later on !
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 4]: You promise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 4]: `` Ye-es ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 4]: faltered Margot shyly .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 44]: `` Yes , I do ; but you must promise too -- that you will , that you wo n't , wo n't let your brother think -- '' The Chieftain touched her arm once more , with a gesture of kindly reassurement .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 9]: `` Do n't you worry , little girl !
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 15]: He shall have no thoughts about you that are not altogether chivalrous and true .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 15]: It 's not you who are going to move in this matter , remember !
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 19]: You 've given it over into my hands ; it is I who am to pull the strings .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 8]: No , you need n't thank me .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 16]: It strikes me that we are going to work out pretty even over this business .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 17]: If you want help for your brother , I need it just as badly for mine .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 19]: I have realised for a long time that he needed a medicine which no doctor could supply . ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 11]: He looked into her face with a sudden radiant smile .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 25]: `` It strikes me I might have searched a very long time before finding any one so eminently fitted to undertake his cure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 2]: RASPBERRY-PICKING .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 30]: Margot awoke the next morning with the pleasant feeling that something was going to happen , and as she dressed , curiosity added an additional savour to the anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 4]: What would happen ?
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 8]: How would the Chieftain set to work ?
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 15]: Would the Editor consider himself a victim , or yield readily to the temptation ?
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 81]: Certainly he had so far manifested no anxiety to enjoy her society , had , indeed , seemed to avoid her at all points ; and yet , and yet -- Margot possessed her full share of a woman 's divination , and , despite appearances , the inward conviction lingered that if the first natural shyness could be overcome , he would soon become reconciled to her companionship , and might even -- she blushed at her own audacity !
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 11]: -- _ enjoy _ the change from his usual solitude .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 65]: Like a true daughter of Eve , Margot did her best to help on this happy _ denouement _ by taking special pains with her toilette , putting on one of her prettiest washing frocks , and coiling her chestnut locks in the most becoming fashion , and the consciousness of looking her best sent her down to breakfast in the happiest of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 33]: Other countries may carry off the palm for the cooking of the more elaborate meals of the day , but surely no breakfast can touch that served in a well-ordered Scottish household .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 70]: The smoothly boiled porridge , with its accompaniment of thick yellow cream ; the new-laid eggs ; the grilled trout , fresh from the stream ; the freshly baked `` baps '' and `` scones , '' the crisp rolls of oatcake ; and last , but not least , the delectable , home-made marmalade , which is as much a part of the meal as the coffee itself .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 31]: He must be difficult to please who does not appreciate such a meal as Mrs McNab served each morning to her guests in the dining-room of the Nag 's Head !
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 39]: It was when Margot had reached the marmalade stage , and George Elgood , a persistent late-comer , was setting to work on his ham and eggs , that the Chieftain fired the first gun of the assault .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 25]: `` When are you going to invite us all to come up and have tea with you in your fairy dell , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 4]: he demanded suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 28]: `` What do you think of this fellow , Mrs Macalister , finding a veritable little heaven below , and keeping it to himself all this time ?
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 40]: There 's an easy ascent by the head of the glen for those who object to the steeper climb ; there 's shade , and water and everything that the most exacting person could want for an ideal picnic .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 34]: To be in the country on a day like this , and not to go for a picnic seems to me a deliberate waste of opportunity , What about this afternoon , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 15]: That will suit you as well as any other time , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 24]: To say that the Editor appeared surprised by this sudden threatening of his solitude , would be to state the case too mildly .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 37]: He looked absolutely stunned with astonishment , and his predicament was all the more enhanced by the fact that already murmurs of assent and anticipation welcomed the idea from his neighbours to right and to left .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 20]: He stared incredulously into his brother 's face , wrinkled his brow , and stammered out a laboured excuse .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 40]: `` I 'm afraid I -- The dell is in no sense my property -- No doubt it would make a capital site for a picnic , but I -- I have no right to pose as host ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 6]: `` Rubbish , my boy !
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 14]: You are not going to get out of it so easily as that .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 24]: We expect you to act as master of the ceremonies , and show us the beauties you have kept to yourself so long .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 12]: Yes , and to catch some trout for us , too !
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 10]: What do you say to that , Mrs Macalister ?
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 14]: How does freshly grilled trout strike you as an accessory to a picnic ?
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 35]: We 'll have two fires , with the kettle on one , and the gridiron on the other , and Mrs McNab will send up a hamper of good things to complete the feast .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 36]: We 'll leave George to manage that , as he knows how to get round her ; only do the thing well when you are about it ; that 's all I have to say !
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 15]: We shall bring rattling big appetites , sha n't we , Miss Vane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 18]: Margot 's glance passed by his to dwell with remorseful commiseration on the Editor 's perturbed face .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 17]: This was her own doing ; a direct consequence of her appeal of the day before !
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 24]: The expression of the brown eyes was wonderfully eloquent , and meeting them the Editor bestirred himself to smile back a grateful recognition .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 73]: By this time , however , the murmur had grown into definite speech ; Mrs Macalister was stating at length her life 's experience as to picnics , and laying down the law as to what was necessary for their success ; the clergyman and his son were debating how to reach the dell from the farthest point of the day 's expedition ; Mr Macalister was slowly repeating -- `` Trout !
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 3]: Grilled trout !
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 13]: It 's a strange-like idea to have fish at a picnic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 22]: It was plainly too late in the day for the Editor to refuse an invitation which had already been practically accepted !
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 33]: With a better grace than might have been expected he resigned himself to his fate , and the smile which he sent round the table was very charming in its shy cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 31]: `` I shall be delighted if you will honour me by coming so far ; and no doubt with Mrs McNab 's help I shall be able to provide refreshments .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 7]: Shall we say half-past four ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 7]: `` Four o'clock would be better .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 50]: We want plenty of time to linger over tea , and ramble about afterwards , '' said the Chieftain firmly ; and there being no dissent from this amendment , the Editor nodded assent , and , gathering his papers in his hand , hurried out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 7]: Margot followed on the first opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 42]: She felt the eyes of the Chieftain fixed on her face from across the room , and could imagine the twinkle of humorous meaning with which they would be alight but she felt too self-conscious and ill at ease to respond .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 46]: Like a frightened little rabbit she scuttled upstairs to her own room and remained there , busying herself with odd pieces of work until the inmates of the inn had taken themselves off for their morning 's excursions , and quiet reigned throughout the house .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 22]: Then , and not till then , she opened her door and peered cautiously at that other door across the landing .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 41]: It was closely shut , and taking for granted that within its portals the bewildered scholar was making the most of his free hours , Margot crept quietly down the staircase , and turned to the right towards the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 32]: It occurred to her that she might be able to help Mrs McNab in her preparations for the afternoon , and by doing so relieve the pangs of her own conscience .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 21]: All this work , and worry , and bewilderment , on her account -- as a response to her appeal !
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 46]: She blushed guiltily , hardly knowing whether to feel more gratified or annoyed with the Chieftain for so speedy a demonstration of his power ; dreading the moment when they should meet again , and she must perforce brave the mischievous messages of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 7]: The kitchen door was closely shut .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 69]: Mrs McNab was too capable a housewife to allow the noise and odour of culinary preparations to invade the rest of the house ; but by this time Margot was sure of her welcome , for scarcely a day had passed by that she had not offered her services , and been condescendingly permitted to shell peas , stone fruit , or whip up snowy masses of cream .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 44]: Mrs McNab always accorded permission with the air of an empress conferring an order upon some humble suppliant , but none the less Margot felt assured that she appreciated the help , and would have missed it , had it not been forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 32]: This morning she tapped on the door , opened it , and thrust her head round the corner , to behold a tableau which remained fixed irrevocably in heart and memory .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 74]: In the middle of the floor stood the mistress of the inn , arms akimbo , engaged in laying down the law in characteristic , downright fashion to some one who sat perched upon the dresser with hands thrust deep into knickerbocker pockets , and feet in rough climbing boots swinging nonchalantly to and fro ; some one with a bright , almost boyish face alight with fun , laughter , and defiance .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 25]: For the second time Margot beheld the real George Elgood denuded of his mask of shyness and reserve , and thrilled at the recognition .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 15]: This sunny , stone-flagged kitchen seemed fated to be the scene of unexpected meetings !
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 30]: She would have retreated in haste , but at the sound of her entrance Mr Elgood jumped hastily to the floor , and Mrs McNab authoritatively waved her forward .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 9]: `` Here she is to speak for herself !
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 7]: Come yer ways , Miss Vane .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 22]: I was saying to Mr Elgood that maybe he 'd listen to your advice , as he willna tak ' mine .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 85]: You 're a leddy , and ken how such things should be done , and if there 's any call to waste the morning , and run into daft-like expense , when everything a reasonable body need want is lying ready to hand -- '' Margot looked from one to the other in bewilderment , her spirits rising with the discovery that for the first time in their short acquaintance the Editor met her glance with an expression of relief rather than of dread .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 33]: He was smiling still , and the boyish look lingered on his face , making him appear an absolutely different creature from the grave , formidable hermit to whom she was accustomed .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 20]: Margot 's eyes danced , and she answered as naturally as if she had been speaking to Ron himself .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 41]: `` I do n't know in the least what I am giving an opinion about -- but I am not a ` reasonable body , ' and as a rule the result of ` daft-like expense ' is very nice !
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 22]: I 'm afraid that is n't what you wanted me to say , Mrs McNab , but I must be honest .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 15]: Perhaps I may feel differently when I know what I am talking about . ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 5]: `` Your picnic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 4]: cried Mrs McNab .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 5]: `` My picnic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 4]: corrected the Editor .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 16]: `` I never gave a picnic before , and I 'm weighed down by responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 22]: My brother refuses to help me , and Mrs McNab is a Spartan , and nips my suggestions in the bud .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 57]: She thinks we ought to be satisfied with bread and butter ; I want cakes and fruit ; I want her to bake , and she says she has no time to bake ; I want to send over to Rew on the chance of getting strawberries ; she says she has no one to send .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 29]: If you agree with me , Miss Vane , perhaps she will make time ; I know by experience that she is always better than her word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 5]: Mrs McNab sniffed ironically .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 18]: `` There 's scones for ye , and good fresh butter -- what do ye want forbye ?
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 26]: Ye 'd get nae mair if ye were at hame , and it 's not going to kill ye , walking a couple of miles .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 23]: I 've something else to do on a Thursday morning than waste my time messing over things that are n't needed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 17]: Mr Elgood leant against the dresser , and surveyed her more in sorrow than in anger .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 9]: `` Now what have you to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 25]: `` It 's absurd to pretend that there is anything to clean , because you never give a thing a chance to become dirty .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 21]: There is cold meat for lunch , as you yourself informed me , so there 's no cooking on hand .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 15]: This house goes by machinery , with Elspeth to stoke up the motive power .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 7]: What can be left for you ?
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 10]: I ca n't think of a single thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 4]: `` Maybe not .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 25]: A man-body never kens what goes on under his nose , though he 'd be keen enough to find out if anything went wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 11]: It 's the day I clean my candlesticks and brasses .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 15]: They do n't go on shining by themselves , whatever ye may think . ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 6]: `` Candlesticks and brasses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 16]: George Elgood repeated the words with gloomy emphasis , fixing the speaker with reproachful eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 5]: `` Candlesticks and brasses !
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 27]: And you put such things as those before _ me _ , and the first -- one of the first , favours I have ever asked !
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 27]: ... A big plum cake , with almonds at the top , and a round of shortbread ; it seems to me a most moderate request .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 40]: There 's not a soul in the inn who will notice a shade of extra polish on the candlesticks to-night , but they will all bear me a lifelong grudge if I do n't give them enough to eat .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 23]: Have you ever been to a picnic where you were expected to be satisfied with bread and butter , Miss Vane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 12]: Margot 's shake of the head was tragic in its solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 3]: `` Never !
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 8]: and I do n't intend to begin .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 31]: I know where we can get some fruit , at any rate , for I heard the woman at the grocer 's shop saying that she had raspberries to sell .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 27]: That is far easier than sending over to Rew , and I 'd be delighted to take a basket and bring back all I can get .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 8]: While Mrs McNab makes the cakes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 11]: Mrs McNab sniffed again , but vouchsafed no further answer .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 18]: Mr Elgood 's face brightened , and he cried eagerly -- `` That is kind of you !
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 22]: Raspberries are very nearly as good as strawberries , and it would be splendid to get them so near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 40]: I -- er -- '' he frowned , with a momentary return to his old embarrassment -- `` I will come too , and carry the basket , for we must hope to have a fairly heavy load . ''
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 32]: Margot could hardly believe in the reality of this sudden change of position , as she set out for the village ten minutes later , with George Elgood by her side .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 34]: He carried the basket lent by Mrs McNab , and swung along with big easy strides , while she trotted by his side , a pretty girlish figure in her cool white frock .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 57]: It was left to her to do the greatest share of the talking ; but one reassuring fact was quickly discovered , namely , that her companion 's shyness seemed to consist mainly in the dread of breaking strange ground , for once the first plunge over he showed none of the expected embarrassment or distress .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 45]: If he could not be called talkative , he was at least an appreciative listener ; not a single point of her conversation missed its due share of interest ; while his deep , quiet laugh proved an incentive to fresh flights of fancy .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 31]: For a whole ten days had Margot been waiting for her opportunity , and now that it had come she was keen to turn it to the best possible advantage .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 61]: Had the Chieftain been at hand to watch her with his quizzical glance , she might have been tongue-tied and ill at ease ; even Ronald 's presence would have brought with it a feeling of self-consciousness ; but in the kindly solitude of the mountain road she could be herself , without thought of any one but her companion .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 46]: Remembering the warning which she had received , she kept the conversation on strictly impersonal topics , avoiding even the mention of Ron 's name , but never had ordinary topics seemed so interesting , or the way to the village so extraordinarily quickly traversed !
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 70]: Inside the fusty grocer 's shop the good Mrs Forsyth manifested none of a Southerner 's delight at the advent of a customer for her superfluous fruit ; she appeared , indeed , to receive Margot 's first inquiry in a somewhat flisty and off-hand manner , as though advantage were being taken of a careless word , which she had not expected to have taken in serious earnest .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 32]: George Elgood , distinctly rebuffed , muttered unintelligible words of apology , but already Margot was beginning to understand the dour Northern manner , and pressed the attack with undiminished eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 41]: Thus coerced , Mrs Forsyth was forced to acknowledge that she wouldna deny that she had raspberries in the garden ; and that it seemed a pity they should waste , as she hadna the time to `` presarve . ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 32]: There was no telling -- maybe when the children came hame from school in the afternoon they wouldna be above picking a basketful , and taking it down to the inn .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 7]: `` But we want them now !
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 23]: We want as many as you can possibly spare , but we must have them to take back with us now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 15]: `` And who 's to pick them for ye , I would ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 7]: demanded Mrs Forsyth with scathing directness .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 41]: `` I 've the shop to mind , and the dinner to cook ; it 's not likely I can be out picking fruit at the same time , and there 's not anither soul in the house forbye mysel !
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 14]: I 'm thinking you 'll have to wait , or do without ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 8]: `` We could pick them ourselves ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 5]: pleaded the Editor eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 23]: `` You would have no trouble except to measure the fruit after it is gathered , and tell us what we owe !
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 9]: I do n't care how much I pay .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 25]: I want some fruit this morning , and if I ca n't get it from you I shall have to drive over to Rew .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 32]: That would cost five or six shillings for the trap alone , so you see I shall get off well , even if you charge me twice the usual price . ''
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 39]: But here again the benighted Southerner found himself brought up sharply against an unexpected phase of Scottish character , for Mrs Forsyth was distinctly on her high horse at the thought of being offered more than her due .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 20]: She had her price ; a fair-like price , she informed him loftily , and she stuck to it .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 13]: She wasna the woman to make differences between one person and anither .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 24]: Justice was justice , and she would like to meet the man who could say she had ever stooped to accept a bribe .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 24]: So on and so on , while once again George Elgood hung his head abashed , and glanced in distress at his companion .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 25]: In the delight afforded by that appeal Margot felt equal to dealing with ten Mrs Forsyths , each equally unreasonable and `` kamstary . ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 17]: `` We will leave the price to you ; we will leave everything to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 4]: she cried gaily .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 50]: `` I know it 's asking a great deal to be allowed to come into your garden and pick for ourselves , but we are rather in a difficulty , for this gentleman is giving a picnic this afternoon , and Mrs McNab has no fruit to give us .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 21]: It would be a favour not only to us , but to the whole party if you would say Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 5]: _ Please _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 10]: The way in which Margot said `` Please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 24]: with head on one side , and upraised , beseeching _ eyes _ , was one of the most fatal of her blandishments .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 21]: Even the redoubtable Mrs McNab had succumbed at the sight , and in her turn Mrs Forsyth also was overcome .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 33]: She made no further objections , but led the way through the house into a long stretch of vegetable garden , the end portion of which was thickly planted with raspberry bushes .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 5]: `` Help yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 4]: she said briefly .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 13]: `` You 're welcome to all that 's fit to eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 43]: So the two who had been strangers , and had suddenly developed into a kind of partnership of aim , set to work to fill the basket , which for better convenience was slung over a branch of one of the bushes .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 26]: The sun shone down on them ; the life-giving breeze blew round them ; they were alone together among the flowers and the scented herbs .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 39]: They worked side by side , laughing over their efforts , comparing their takings , gloating over the quickly-filling basket like a couple of children recognising each other as playmates , and disdaining the ordinary preliminaries of acquaintanceship .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 12]: `` It 's so kind of you to help me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 4]: said the man .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 12]: `` It 's so kind of you to let me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 4]: returned the maid .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 16]: `` I -- I have noticed that you seem always to be helping people . ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 12]: `` I did n't think you noticed anything at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 9]: He had not intended to say so much .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 11]: She did not stop to consider what she was implying .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 34]: Both blushed , relapsed into silence , and picked fruit assiduously for several moments , before beginning again -- `` I am afraid this picnic will be a great bore to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 13]: `` Indeed , I think it is going to be a pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 20]: I should have thought of it before , but that sort of thing does not come easily to me .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 8]: I have lived too much alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 15]: `` You have your work -- you have been absorbed in your work . ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 4]: `` Have I ?
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 10]: I 'm afraid that is not altogether true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 19]: Margot glanced up surprised , met the dark eyes fixed full upon her , and looked hurriedly away .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 17]: `` I have been finding it increasingly difficult to be absorbed , '' he continued dreamily .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 18]: `` I have heard you all laughing and talking together downstairs , and my thoughts have wandered .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 14]: Once you sang ... Do you remember that wet afternoon when you sang ?
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 13]: I did not seem able to write at all that afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 24]: The basket was full of fruit by now ; Margot lifted it by one handle ; George Elgood lifted it by the other .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 10]: They walked down the sunlit garden into the house .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 3]: TROUT FISHING .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 46]: There was a short , somewhat embarrassed silence while Margot kept her eyes fixed on the scene of the late meal , the two smouldering fires , the piled-up hampers and baskets , and the Editor drummed with his fingers , and chewed his moustache .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 10]: `` Er -- '' he began haltingly at last .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 10]: `` How do you think it has gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 9]: `` You mean the -- '' `` Picnic !
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 4]: My first entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 4]: I feel responsible .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 8]: Think they enjoyed it at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 7]: `` I 'm sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 2]: Immensely !
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 4]: They thawed wonderfully .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 5]: Think of the duet !
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 9]: To hear Mr Macalister singing was a revelation .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 11]: It has been a delightful change from the ordinary routine .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 4]: And the trout !
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 7]: The trout was a huge success .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 13]: How amiable of it to let itself be caught so conveniently ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 13]: The Editor smiled , with the conscious pride of the experienced fisherman .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 11]: `` There was not much ` let ' about it .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 25]: He led me a pretty dance before he gave up the struggle , but I was on my mettle , and bound to win .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 11]: Do you know anything about fishing , Miss Vane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 4]: `` I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 4]: Margot laughed happily .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 20]: `` Just as much as I have gleaned from watching little boys fish for minnows in Regent 's Park !
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 13]: I do n't think I have ever particularly wanted to know more .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 28]: It seems so dull to stand waiting for hours for what may never come , not daring to speak , in case you may scare it away !
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 10]: What do you think about all the time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 15]: He turned and looked at her at that , his lips twitching with amusement .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 36]: Seated on the ground as they were , the two faces were very near together , and each regarded the other with the feeling of advancing a step further in the history of their acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 9]: `` He really _ is _ young ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 9]: decided Margot , with a sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 23]: `` It 's only the frown and the stoop and the eyeglasses which make him look as if he were old . ''
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 32]: George Elgood looked into the pink and white face , and his thoughts turned instinctively to a bush of briar roses which he had seen and admired earlier in the day .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 9]: So fresh , and fair , and innocent !
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 11]: Were all young girls so fragrant and flower-like as this ?
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 32]: Then he thought of the little prickles which had stung his hand as he had picked a bud from the same bush for his buttonhole , and smiled with latent mischief .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 11]: After all , the remembrance did not lessen the likeness .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 20]: Miss Margot looked as if she might -- under provocation -- display a prickle or two of her own !
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 8]: `` What do I think about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 4]: he repeated slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 31]: `` That is rather a difficult question to answer ; but this good little river , I am thankful to say , does not leave one much time for thought .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 18]: There 's a little channel just beyond the bridge that is a favourite place for sea trout .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 8]: Would you like to see it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 4]: `` Might I ?
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 2]: Really ?
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 5]: Oh , please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 8]: cried Margot , all in a breath .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 23]: Her very prettiest `` please , '' accompanied by a quick rise to her feet which emphasised the eagerness of her words .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 43]: George Elgood lost no time in following her example , and together they walked briskly away towards the head of the dell ; that is to say , in the opposite direction to that taken by the other members of the party .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 31]: George Elgood had picked up his fishing-tackle as he went -- by an almost unconscious impulse , as it seemed -- and unconsciously his conversation drifted to the all-absorbing topic .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 22]: `` If we take a sharp cut across this hill -- I 'll give you a hand down the steep bits !
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 10]: -- we hit the river at the best spot .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 27]: You have been grumbling at the wet weather , but you will see the good effects of rain , from a fisherman 's point of view .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 15]: The river is full from bank to bank , rushing down to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 11]: It is a fine sight , a river in flood !
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 17]: I do n't know anything in Nature which gives the same impression of power and joy .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 8]: That 's where Norway has the pull .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 20]: Her mountains ca n't compare with the Swiss giants , but everywhere there is a glorious wealth of water .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 34]: No calm sleeping lakes , but leaping cataracts of rivers filling whole valleys , as my little stream here fills its small banks ; roaring and dashing , and sparkling in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 24]: Norway is perfection , from a fisherman 's point of view ; but there is plenty of sport to be found nearer home .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 12]: I have had no cause to complain for the last fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 7]: This way -- to the right !
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 18]: It 's just a little rough going at first , but it cuts off a good mile .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 9]: You are sure you do n't mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 7]: Margot 's laugh rang out jubilantly .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 46]: She scrambled up the steep mountain path with nimble feet , easily out-distancing her guide , until the hilltop was reached , and she stood silhouetted against the sky , while the wind blew out her white skirts , and loosened curling tendrils of hair .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 30]: Below could be traced the course of the river , winding in and out in deep curves , and growing ever broader and fuller with every mile it traversed .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 51]: The sunlight which played on it , making it look like a silver ribbon , played also on the yellow gorse and purple heather ; on the long grey stretch of country in the distance ; on that softer blue plain joining the skyline , which was the sea itself .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 21]: A breath of salt seemed to mingle with the aromatic odour of the heather , adding tenfold to its exhilaration .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 45]: As Margot stood holding on to her hat , and waiting for her companion 's approach , she felt such a glorious sense of youth and well-being , such an assurance of happiness to come , as is seldom given to mortals to enjoy .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 33]: It was written in her face , her radiant , lovely young face , and the light in the eyes which she turned upon him made the shy scholar catch his breath .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 6]: `` You did that well !
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 4]: Magnificently well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 4]: he cried approvingly .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 11]: `` But you must take the descent carefully , please .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 17]: There are one or two sudden dips which might be awkward if you were not prepared .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 5]: I know them all .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 15]: Shall I , -- would you , -- will you take my hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 5]: `` Thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 23]: said Margot , and laid her hand in his with an acceptance as simple as if he had been her own brother .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 35]: It was a very pretty little hand , in which its owner felt a justifiable pride , and it lay like a white snowflake in the strong brown palm stretched out to meet it .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 40]: For just a moment George Elgood kept his fingers straight and unclasped , while he gazed downward at it with kindling eyes , then they closed in a tight , protecting clasp , and together they began the descent .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 36]: For the most part it was easy enough , but the awkward places came so often and unexpectedly that it did not seem worth while to unloose that grasp until the bottom was safely reached .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 39]: Margot had a dream-like sensation of having wandered along for hours , but in reality it was a bare ten minutes before she and her guide were standing on level ground by the side of the rushing river .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 4]: `` Thank you !
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 11]: That was a great help , '' she said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 20]: George Elgood , with a sudden access of shyness , made no reply , but busied himself with preparation .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 17]: `` I 'll just make another cast , to show you how one sets to work .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 12]: I take a pretty big fly -- the trout like that .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 12]: These are the flies -- all sizes , as you see .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 27]: I am rather proud of them , for I make them myself in the winter months , when one can enjoy only the pleasures of anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 11]: It 's a good occupation for a leisure hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 7]: `` You make them yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 27]: Margot repeated incredulously , stretching out her hand to receive one of the hairy morsels on her palm , and bending over it in unaffected admiration .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 7]: `` But how clever of you !
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 7]: How can you have the patience ?
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 8]: It must be dreadfully finicky work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 13]: `` It is a trifle ` finicky , ' no doubt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 9]: He laughed over the repetition of the word .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 21]: `` But it 's a refreshing change to work with one 's hands sometimes , instead of one 's brain .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 12]: Now shall I give you your first lesson in the art ?
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 31]: Do n't imagine for a moment that fishing means standing still for the hour together , with nothing more exciting than the pulling-in of your fish the moment he bites .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 26]: That 's the idea of the outsider who does not know what adventure he is losing , what hope and suspense , what glorious triumph !
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 20]: Like most things , it 's the struggle that 's the glory of the thing , not the prize .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 16]: Shall I soak this cast for you , and give you your first lesson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 5]: `` Oh , please !
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 5]: I 'd love it !
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 9]: It would be too kind of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 4]: cried Margot eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 49]: She had not the faintest idea what `` soaking a cast '' might mean , and listened in bewilderment to a score of unfamiliar expressions ; but it is safe to affirm that she would have assented with equal fervour to almost any proposition which her companion made .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 42]: There and then followed the first lesson on the seemingly easy , but in reality difficult , task of `` casting , '' the Editor illustrating his lesson by easy , graceful throws , which Margot tried in vain to imitate .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 31]: She grew impatient , stamping her feet , and frowning fiercely with her dark eyebrows , while he looked on with the amused indulgence which one accords to a child .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 16]: `` Are you always in such a hurry to accomplish a thing at once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 5]: `` Yes , always !
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 16]: It 's only when you do n't care that you can afford to wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 14]: `` It sometimes saves time in the end to make haste slowly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 11]: `` Oh , do n't confound me with proverbs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 15]: cried Margot , turning a flushed , petulant face at him over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 20]: `` I know I am impetuous and imprudent , but -- the horrid thing _ will _ twist up !
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 12]: Do n't you think I might have a demonstration this time ?
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 9]: Let me watch , and pick up hints .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 20]: I 'm sure I should learn more quickly that way , and it would be less boring for you .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 3]: Please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 47]: At that he took the rod , nothing loth , and Margot seated herself on the ground , a trifle short of breath after her exertions , and not at all sorry to have the chance of looking on while some one else did the work .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 36]: She was intently conscious of her companion 's presence , but he seemed to forget all about her , as wading slightly forward into the stream he cast his fly in slow , unerring circuit .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 21]: How big he looked , how strong and masterful ; how graceful were the lines of his tall lean figure !
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 28]: From where she sat Margot could see the dark profile beneath the deerstalker cap , the long straight nose , the firmly-closed lips , the steady eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 15]: It was the face of a man whom above all things one could trust .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 54]: `` A poor dumb body , '' Mrs Macalister had dubbed him , scornfully ; but Margot had discovered that he was by no means dumb , and that once the first barriers were broken , he could talk with the best , and bring into his conversation the added eloquence of expression .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 25]: She recalled the lighting of his absorbed eyes as he had looked down at her own white hand , and flushed at the remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 34]: Margot had often pitied the wives and sisters of enthusiastic fishermen who had perforce to sit mum-chance in the background , but to-day she was conscious of no dissatisfaction with her own position .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 46]: She possessed her full share of the girl 's gift of building castles , and it would not be safe to say how high the airy structure had risen before suddenly the rod bent , and the Editor 's intent face lit up with elation .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 32]: The fish was hooked ; it now remained to `` play '' with him , in professional parlance , till he could be landed with credit to himself and his captor .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 18]: For the next half-hour Margot was keenly , vividly interested in studying the tactics of the game .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 85]: The reel screamed out , as the captive made a gallant dash for liberty ; the Editor splashed after him , running hastily by the side of the river , now reeling in his line , now allowing it full play ; and at the distance of a few yards she ran with him , now holding her breath with suspense , now clasping her hands in triumph , until at last , his struggles over , the captive floated heavily upon the stream .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 38]: It was the end for which she had longed throughout thirty of the most exciting moments that she had ever known ; but now that victory was secured , woman -- like she began to feel remorse .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 7]: `` Oh , is it dead ?
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 5]: Have you killed it ?
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 11]: But it 's horrid , you know -- quite horrible !
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 20]: A big strong man like you , and that poor little fish -- '' `` Not little at all !
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 19]: It 's a good six-pounder , '' protested the fisherman , quick to defend his sport against depreciation .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 15]: `` No -- he 's not dead yet , but he soon will be .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 8]: I will just -- '' `` Wait !
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 2]: Wait !
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 9]: Let me get out of the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 21]: Margot flew with her fingers in her ears , then pulled them out to cry -- `` Is it done ?
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 4]: Is it over ?
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 6]: Can I come back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 8]: `` Yes ; it is all right .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 8]: I 've put him in my bag .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 10]: You will appreciate him better in his table guise .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 18]: I 'll take him back as a peace-offering to Mrs McNab , for her own evening meal .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 36]: We have already had our share at the pic -- '' Suddenly his hands fell to his sides , he straightened himself , and turned his eyes upon her , filled with puzzle and dismay .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 10]: `` The pic -- '' '' -- Nic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 4]: concluded Margot faintly .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 26]: Rosy red were her cheeks ; a weight as of lead pressed on her eyelids , dragging them down , down , beneath his gaze .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 9]: `` I -- I -- _ forgot _ !
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 9]: We were to have gone to find them !
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 10]: Do you suppose they are -- hiding still ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 11]: He laughed at that , though in somewhat discomfited fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 4]: `` Rather not !
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 6]: Given us up long ago .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 9]: It must be getting on for an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 21]: I ca n't think how I came to forget -- '' Margot glanced at him shyly beneath her curling lashes .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 6]: `` It was the fish !
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 17]: A fisherman ca n't be expected to remember anything when he is landing a trout ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 4]: she suggested soothingly .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 26]: Nevertheless she remembered with a thrill of joy that his forgetfulness had dated back to a time when there had been no fish in prospect .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 10]: `` Do you suppose they have gone home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 7]: `` We will go and see .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 14]: From that mound over there we can overlook the path to the inn .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 11]: Perhaps we had better keep a little in the background !
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 63]: It would be as well that they should not see us , if they happened to look up -- '' If it were possible to feel a degree hotter , Margot felt it at that moment , as she followed George Elgood up the little hillock to the right , and , pausing just short of the top , peered stealthily around .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 24]: A simultaneous exclamation broke from both lips ; simultaneously they drew back , and crouched on their knees to peer over the heather .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 4]: There they went !
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 23]: -- straggling in a row in the direction of the inn , the party of revellers who had been so basely deserted .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 78]: First , the clergyman , with his hands clasped behind his back , his head bent in thought ; a pensive reveller , this , already beginning to repent a heavy , indigestible meal ; next , Mrs Macalister , holding her skirts in characteristic fashion well up in front and sweeping the ground behind ; a pace or two in the rear , her spouse , showing depression and weariness in every line of his body .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 65]: Yet farther along the two young men carrying the empty hampers ; last of all , at quite a little distance from the rest , the figure of the Chieftain stepping out with a tread even more conspicuously jaunty than usual , his hands thrust deep into his pockets , his head turned from side to side , as if curiously scanning the hillsides .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 26]: At one and the same moment Margot and the Editor ducked their heads , and scrambled backwards for a distance of two or three yards .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 13]: There was a moment 's silence , then instinctively their eyes met .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 56]: Margot pressed her lips tightly together , George Elgood frowned , but it was all in vain ; no power on earth could prevent the mischievous dimples from dipping in her cheeks ; no effort could hide the twinkle in his eyes -- they buried their heads in their hands , and shook with laughter !
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 39]: When at last composure was regained , George Elgood pulled his watch from his pocket , glanced at the time , and cried eagerly -- `` There is still an hour before we need be back for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 11]: As well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 16]: Let us go back to the river , and try our luck once more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 3]: A TELEGRAM .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 35]: It was a very shamefaced Margot who made her appearance at the dinner - table that evening ; but , to her unspeakable relief , she found that there was no cause for embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 33]: Instead of the meaning glances and joking remarks which she had dreaded , she was greeted with the ordinary kindly prosaic welcome , and not even Mrs Macalister herself ventured an innuendo .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 32]: The Chieftain was the only one who alluded to the non - appearance of the searchers , and the manner in which he did so was a triumph of the commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 12]: `` Muddled up that hide-and-seek finely , did n't we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 4]: he cried cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 10]: `` Afraid you had all your trouble for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 32]: I happened to catch a glimpse of you heading off in the wrong direction , so turned into ` It ' myself , and rooted them all out of their lairs .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 22]: Then we played some sensible , middle-aged , sitting-down games , and strolled home in time for a siesta before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 8]: Very good picnic , I call it .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 3]: Great success !
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 13]: We 'll have another , one of these fine days . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 9]: ` Deed yes , and we will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 5]: assented Mrs Macalister genially .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 14]: `` It stirs a body up to have an outing now and then .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 23]: I was thinking , why should n't we drive over to B -- and see the old castle and all the sights ?
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 22]: I 've been hankering to go ever since we arrived ; but it mounts up when you drive about by yourselves .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 34]: If we shared two carriages between us , it would make all the difference , and it seems foolish-like to be in a neighbourhood and not see what there is to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 22]: You can get carriages from Rew , they tell me , if you order them a day or two before . ''
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 21]: To the amazement of the company , it was George Elgood of all others who hastened to second the proposal .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 6]: `` A capital idea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 13]: `` B -- is one of the finest old ruins in Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 19]: Of course we must go ; it would be worse than foolish to go home without seeing it .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 32]: I have been before , so I could act as guide , and those who possess cameras had better take them also , as the place is rich in subjects . ''
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 71]: The clergyman and his son pricked up their ears at this , photography being with them only a degree less absorbing a pastime than that of walking ; Ron awoke suddenly to the remembrance that his half-plate camera had never been unpacked since his arrival ; and the three vied with each other in asking questions about the proposed excursion , and in urging that a date should be fixed .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 52]: Before the meal had come to a conclusion , plans were mapped out , and a division of labour made , by which one person was held responsible for the hiring of carriages , another for the promised food , while George Elgood was left to arrange the plan of campaign .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 17]: `` We are a happy family , we are , we are , we are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 34]: hummed the Chieftain , under his breath , as he cast a twinkling glance across the table to where Margot sat , as demure to outward seeming as she was excited at heart .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 8]: `` Why do you avoid me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 29]: he demanded of her plumply , the next morning , when , after several unsuccessful attempts , he ran her to earth by the side of the tarn .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 15]: `` Scurry out of my way like a frightened bunny whenever I come along .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 7]: Wo n't do , you know !
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 28]: Not going to trouble myself to do you good turns , if you round on me afterwards , and avoid me as if I were the plague .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 7]: What 's it all about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 8]: `` Nothing , '' stammered Margot confusedly .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 34]: `` I only felt rather -- You _ do _ tease , you know , and your eyes twinkle so mischievously that I felt that discretion was the better part of valour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 24]: `` Well , do n't do it again then , that 's all , or I may turn rusty and upset the apple-cart .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 20]: No reason that I know of why I should be ostracised , because I try to help my fellow-creatures .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 7]: What are you doing over here ?
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 2]: Reading ?
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 6]: What a waste of time !
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 13]: Much better come and chuck stones into the lake with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 8]: Margot 's brown eyes widened in reproof .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 8]: `` Do n't you like books ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 7]: `` Hate the sight of 'em !
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 5]: Especially on a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 23]: Never want to see as much as a line of print from the time I leave home to the time I return .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 23]: Especially , '' -- his eyes twinkled in the mischievous manner to which exception had just been taken -- `` especially poetry !
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 11]: Do n't mind my saying so , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 29]: `` Not a bit , '' returned Margot promptly , tossing her first stone into the lake with a vehemence which held more than a suspicion of temper .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 18]: `` Of course I never -- one would never -- _ expect _ you to like it .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 16]: It would be the last thing one would expect -- '' `` Too fat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 15]: She blushed at that , and had the grace to look a trifle distressed .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 7]: `` Oh , not that altogether .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 17]: It 's a ` _ Je ne sais quoi _ , ' do n't you know .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 15]: One could tell at a glance that you were not a literary man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 22]: The Chieftain chuckled , bent down to gather a handful of stones , and raised a red smiling face to hers .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 15]: `` Well , well , we ca n't all be geniuses , you know !
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 19]: One in a glen is about as much as you can expect to meet in these hard times .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 11]: But I can chuck stones with the best of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 12]: That one was a good dozen yards beyond your last throw .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 13]: Put your back into it , and see what you can do .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 11]: It 's a capital way of letting off steam . ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 30]: Margot was tempted to protest against the accusation , but reflection prompted silence , since after all she _ was _ cross , and there was no denying it .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 50]: She took the little man 's advice , and `` let off steam '' by the vigour and determination with which she hurled pebbles into the lake , making them skim along the surface in professional manner for an ever longer and longer space before finally disappearing from sight .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 30]: The Chieftain cheered her on with example and precept , and , as usual , irritation died a speedy death in the presence of his bright , cheery personality .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 42]: While they were still laughing and cheering each other on to fresh exploits , a lad from the post office passed along the road , and the Chieftain wheeled round to call out the usual question -- `` Anything for me ?
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 7]: Is the post in already ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 6]: The lad shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 23]: He was a red-headed sociable-looking creature who seemed only too glad to enliven his walk by a chat _ en route _ .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 23]: His teeth showed in a cheerful smile as he replied -- `` The post willna be here for an hour or mair .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 7]: It 's just a telegram ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 3]: A telegram !
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 27]: It said much for the peaceful seclusion of the Glen that the very sound of the word brought a chill of apprehension to the listening ears .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 10]: No one received telegrams at the Nag 's Head .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 41]: One and all the visitors had sojourned thither with the aim of getting away as far as possible from the world of telegrams , and electric trams , and tube railways , and all the nerve-shattering inventions of modern life .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 28]: Their ambition was to outlive the sense of hurry ; to forget that such a thing as hurry existed , and browse along in peaceful uninterrupted ease .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 49]: To-day , however , in that far-away world beyond the heather-clad mountains something must have happened of such importance to some member of the little party that it could not wait for the leisurely medium of the post , but for good or ill had demanded instant attention .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 17]: Margot and the Chieftain stood in silence for a moment before he asked the second question .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 6]: `` Who is it for ?
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 7]: -- What 's the name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 4]: `` Macalister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 16]: The name was pronounced with the lengthy drawl to which the hearers were growing familiar .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 15]: They looked at each other with sighs of relief , followed swiftly by contrition .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 7]: `` I hope nothing is wrong !
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 8]: I hope it 's not bad news .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 9]: Poor Mr Macalister 's ` nearves ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 5]: `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 5]: Nothing of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 4]: Why imagine evil ?
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 12]: Always look at the bright side as long as you can .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 21]: Take for granted that it is good news , splendid news -- the news he would like most to hear .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 5]: Cut along , laddie !
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 18]: People pay for telegrams with the intention of getting them to their destination as quickly as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 15]: We 'll defer the pleasure of a conversation to our next merry meeting . ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 16]: The red-headed one grinned complacently and continued on his way , whistling as he went .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 73]: There was about him no suggestion of a harbinger of bad tidings ; the sun shone from a cloudless sky , and awoke sparkling reflections in the water ; the scene was one of unbroken peace and happiness , and yet , and yet , -- some shadow seemed to have fallen on Margot 's soul , so that she could no longer take any interest in the mere throwing of stones .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 22]: Her heart followed the footsteps of the messenger down the winding path , and stood still as he entered the inn .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 8]: `` What is it , little girl ?
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 11]: You look as if you had seen a ghost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 41]: The Chieftain stood observing her with an expression of kindly concern , for the pretty face had turned white beneath its tan , and the brown eyes were wide and tense , as if beholding something hidden from ordinary gaze .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 20]: She gazed fixedly , not back in his face , but past him down the lane towards the inn .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 6]: `` I 'm -- afraid !
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 10]: I _ feel _ it is not good news .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 7]: It means trouble -- big trouble !
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 10]: It is hanging over me like a cloud ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 11]: He looked at her swiftly , and his face changed .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 15]: `` Come then , '' he said quietly , `` we will go back .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 12]: If it is trouble , we may be able to help .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 29]: I never ignore presentiments ; they are sent to us all from time to time , and if we are faithful we obey them , like a summons .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 7]: One came to me years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 46]: It was late at night , and I was just off to bed , when suddenly it came -- the remembrance of a friend far off ; the insistent remembrance ; the certainty that he needed me , and that I must hasten to help .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 37]: By all the laws of common sense I should have shrugged my shoulders and gone to sleep ; but what are we , to judge by our own poor knowledge the great unknown forces of God ?
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 23]: I went out there and then , caught a midnight train , and was at his house by seven in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 17]: His wife met me on the stair and said , ` How did you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 19]: ... He lay dying in his bed , and all that night he had been calling for me .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 15]: There was something I could do for him , better than any one else .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 20]: He wished to place it in my hands before he went , and God had mercifully provided the opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 13]: Never say that anything is impossible in this world , little girl !
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 12]: According to your faith so shall it be unto you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 12]: Margot did not answer except by a faint , strained smile .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 34]: Her eyes were fixed upon the doorway of the inn , waiting for the reappearance of the messenger , but he did not come , and the delay lent weight to her apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 36]: They spoke no more , but walked silently side by side , until they drew near to the inn , when suddenly the silence of the Glen was broken by a strange , unaccustomed sound .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 4]: What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 5]: Whence did it come ?
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 18]: From some animal surely ; some animal in pain or fear , piteously making known its needs !
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 10]: It could not be the moan of human woe !
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 31]: Yet even as she passionately denied the thought , Margot recognised in her heart that it was true , and darting quickly forward made her way into the inn parlour .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 36]: The messenger still stood outside the door , waiting in stolid patience for instructions , and by his side was Mrs McNab , wiping floury hands in her apron , in evident perturbation of spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 46]: On the plush-bedecked sofa in the corner of the parlour the half - inanimate form of Mrs Macalister swayed helplessly to and fro , while on either side stood two men -- her husband and George Elgood -- looking on in helpless , masculine fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 33]: Her cap had fallen back from her head , her ruddy face was bleached to a livid grey , from her lips came from time to time that pitiful , hopeless wail .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 35]: At first it seemed to have no definite sound , but as one listened it took to itself words , -- always the same words , repeated again and again -- `` My lassie !
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 3]: My Lizzie !
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 6]: Oh , my lassie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 7]: `` Nay , dearie , nay !
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 5]: You mustna give way .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 5]: She 's better off .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 5]: You must be strong .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 7]: We 'll bear it together . ''
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 36]: It was Mr Macalister who spoke ; but Margot hardly recognised the voice , hardly recognised the face , which , for all its pallor and quiver of pain , was yet strong and calm .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 43]: All trace of the peevish discontent that had hung like a cloud over the man had vanished like a mist ; his bowed back seemed to have straightened itself and grown erect ; the whining voice was composed and full of courage .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 34]: He had forgotten his nerves in the presence of a great calamity ; nay , more than that -- he had forgotten himself ; his one care and anxiety was for his wife !
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 39]: The tears smarted in Margot 's eyes ; she ran forward , dropped on her knees before the chair , and clasped her strong young arms round the swaying figure , steadying it with loving , gentle pressure .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 32]: The wan eyes stared at her unrecognisingly for a moment , then , at the sight of her girlish beauty , old memories returned , and the tears began to rain .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 5]: `` Lizzie 's gone !
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 4]: Lizzie 's gone !
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 7]: I 'll never see her again .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 11]: All in a moment , and me so far away .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 4]: My little Lizzie !
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 6]: ... I canna bear it !
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 9]: ... '' `` She never suffered , mother .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 6]: She knew nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 12]: It 's better for her than a long , painful illness .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 9]: You must be thankful for her sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 13]: Mr Macalister looked down at Margot , and bravely essayed an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 6]: `` It was an accident .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 5]: We 've just heard .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 5]: Instantaneous , they say .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 13]: The mother 's sore upset , but she 's a brave woman .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 10]: She 'll bear it bravely for all our sakes .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 10]: We 'll need to get back to Glasgow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 4]: I 'll help !
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 6]: I 'll pack for her .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 6]: Do n't trouble about anything .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 9]: I 'll see that it is all right .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 14]: You 'll let me help you , dear , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 45]: Margot put up a tender hand , to straighten the cap on the poor , dishevelled head ; and something in the simple , daughterly action seemed to reach the poor woman 's heart , and bring with it the first touch of calmness .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 11]: She sat up and looked blankly from side to side .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 7]: `` I -- I 'm sorry !
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 5]: I shouldna give way .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 20]: I never lost a child before , you see , and Lizzie was such a one for her mother .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 8]: I wrote to her only last night .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 14]: She leaves two bairnies of her own , but they are so young .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 7]: They 'll never remember her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 32]: The pitiful trembling began again , whereupon George Elgood 's hand held out a glass of water , and Margot took it from him to lift it to the quivering lips .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 18]: `` They will need you all the more , and you must be strong for their sakes .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 12]: That 's what she would wish , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 5]: `` Yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 8]: I must take care of the children .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 6]: And Fred -- poor Fred !
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 15]: but he has n't loved her as I have done for nearly thirty years .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 9]: Father , when can we get back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 8]: `` I 'll see , my dearie .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 4]: I 'll see !
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 5]: Leave all to me .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 15]: I 'll settle it all , and this good lassie will pack your things .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 17]: Ye need trouble for nothing , my lass , -- ye need trouble for nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 42]: He laid his broad hand on his wife 's shoulder with a gesture infinitely tender , then turned and went stumbling out of the room , while Margot 's eyes met the tear-drenched ones above her with a flash of enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 9]: `` He is -- _ splendid _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 13]: Even at that moment Mrs Macalister showed a faint kindling of response .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 7]: `` Did n't I tell ye ?
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 11]: When a man 's out of health ye canna judge .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 17]: When he 's in his usual , there 's no one to touch Mr Macalister . ''
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 26]: With an instinctive movement Margot turned her head upward till her eyes met those of George Elgood , and exchanged a flash of mutual understanding .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 45]: It heartened her like a drink of water in a thirsty land , for underlying the pity and the kindliness she recognised something else ; something that existed for herself alone , and which seemed to bring with it an electric thrill of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 45]: Outside in the `` lobby '' the Chieftain was looking up trains in his own _ Bradshaw _ , and arranging with Mrs McNab for the long drive to the station , while Mr Macalister was writing out a return message with trembling fingers .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 9]: `` Come upstairs with me , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 4]: said Margot gently .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 13]: `` You shall lie on the bed while I do the packing .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 18]: It 's a long journey , and you must be as fresh as possible when you arrive .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 17]: They will be waiting for you , you know , and expecting you to comfort them .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 11]: You have told me how they all rely upon you .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 14]: You would n't like to fail just when they need you most ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 16]: Mrs Macalister raised herself feebly from her chair , but her poor face quivered helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 13]: `` I 'm a broken reed for any one to lean on .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 9]: I can only remember that Lizzie 's gone .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 8]: There 's no strength left in me .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 8]: She was the flower of the flock .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 7]: And me so far away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 71]: For the next hour the poor woman lay on the bed in her room , now sobbing in helpless paroxysms of grief , now relating pitiful , commonplace anecdotes of the dead daughter so dearly beloved , a dazed helpless creature , unable to do a hand 's turn for herself , while her husband crept in and out , quiet , resourceful , comforting , full of unselfish compassion .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 41]: Margot had hard work to keep back her own tears , as he clumsily pressed his own services upon her , picking up odd garments , folding them carefully in the wrong way , and rummaging awkwardly through the drawers .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 53]: The trap was to be ready to start by twelve o'clock , and ten minutes before the time Margot carried a sponge and basin of water to the bedside , bathed the poor , tear-stained face , brushed the straggling locks of grey hair , and helped to fasten bonnet and cloak .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 18]: It was pathetic to see the helplessness into which grief had stricken this capable , bustling woman .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 31]: She lifted her chin , to allow the strings of her bonnet to be tied by Margot 's hands , and sat meekly while the `` dolman '' was hooked .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 31]: It was like dressing a big docile baby ; like a child , too , the manner in which she clung to her husband 's arm down the narrow stair .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 18]: Mrs McNab was standing below in the lobby , her hard face flushed to an unnatural red .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 20]: She held a basket in her hand filled with dainty paper packages containing fruit , sandwiches , and cakes .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 24]: Unable to voice her sympathy , she had put it into deeds , striving to ensure some comfort for the long journey ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 24]: Mrs Macalister smiled a pitiful travesty of a smile in acknowledgment , and her friends pressed her hand , mercifully refraining from speech .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 16]: When it came to parting from Margot , however , that was a different matter .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 19]: Mrs Macalister stooped from the seat of the trap to kiss the girl 's cheek once and again .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 13]: `` You 're a guid lassie , '' she said , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 9]: `` I would have been lost without you !
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 9]: The Lord bless you , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 9]: and she _ shall _ be blessed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 8]: added Mr Macalister 's voice , deeply .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 25]: Margot thrilled at the sound of those words , and stood back on the path watching the departing wheels through a mist of tears .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 51]: They had gone , those two good , loving , simple creatures , and in all likelihood she would never see them again ; for a moment their lives had touched , but the currents had swept them apart ; they were as ships that had passed in the night .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 35]: To the end of time , however , she must be the better for the meeting , for in their need they had leant upon her , and she had been able to help .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 27]: They had blessed her in patriarchal fashion , and the sound of their words still rang in her ears -- `` The Lord bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 9]: and she _ shall _ be blessed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 2]: CRITICISM .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 48]: Out of sympathy and respect for Mr and Mrs Macalister , nothing more was said about the next picnic party for several days after their tragic departure from the Glen , but the intervening time was , to Margot at least , full of interest and excitement .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 76]: One morning , for instance , as she strolled from the breakfast-room to the road , as was the easy custom of the hour , a hurried step followed in the same direction , and George Elgood , staring hard in an opposite direction , advanced an opinion that one lesson in fishing was mere waste of time , whereas two , or perhaps three , might possibly convey some real knowledge of the art .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 15]: Er -- did Miss Vane feel inclined to pay another visit to the river ?
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 19]: Miss Vane , poking the gravel with the points of her shoes , was -- er -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 48]: quite inclined , if Mr Elgood was sure she would not interrupt his sport Mr Elgood , with equal eagerness and incoherence , assured Miss Vane that she would do nothing of the kind , and hurried back to the inn , murmuring vaguely concerning eleven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 33]: In the quiet of the riverside , however , he regained his self-possession , and once more proved himself to be the most interesting of companions , the most patient of instructors .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 27]: Margot thought fishing a delightful and absorbing pursuit , which was the more remarkable as she was rather stupid than otherwise in mastering the initial movements .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 30]: Mr Elgood encouraged her , however , by saying that some of the cleverest `` rods '' of his acquaintance had been the slowest in picking up the knack .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 10]: The great thing was to have plenty of practice !
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 41]: She ought to come up every morning for as much time as she could spare ; meantime , as she had been standing so long , would she not like to sit down , and rest awhile before walking home ?
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 48]: Then they sat down side by side on the grassy bank , and talked together as a man and a maid love to talk in the summer of their youth , exchanging innocent confidences , comparing thoughts and opinions , marvelling that they are so much alike .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 55]: Margot faithfully observed her promise to make no references to her ambitions on her brother 's behalf , and , truth to tell , her silence involved little effort , for she was guiltily conscious of being so much engrossed in her own affairs that even Ron 's ambitions had faded into the background .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 50]: As for the lad himself , he was happy enough , wandering about by himself studying `` effects '' to transcribe to paper , or scouring the countryside with the Chieftain , whom he frankly adored , despite the many exceedingly plain-spoken criticisms and exhortations received from his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 23]: `` Your sister has been telling me about that rhyming craze of yours , '' the little man said suddenly one day .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 16]: `` Likewise about her own very pretty little scheme for the subjugation of my brother .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 10]: Told you that she 'd told me , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 4]: Expect she did !
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 38]: She is pleased to believe she is a designing little adventuress , whereas as a matter of fact she 's as clear as crystal , and any one with half an eye could see through her schemes .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 41]: I laid down the law that neither she nor you are to worry my brother about business matters during his holiday , for , to tell you the truth , he has had his full share of worry of late .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 5]: But what about me ?
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 26]: I 'm a plain , common-sense , steady-going old fellow , who might perhaps be able to give you a word or two of advice !
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 38]: What 's all this nonsense about throwing aside a post that 's waiting for you , and which means an income for life , in order to live in an attic , and scribble verses for magazines ?
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 40]: If you knew the world , young man , you would understand that you are blessedly well off , to have your way made smooth , and would not be in such a hurry to meet disappointments half way .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 6]: They will come soon enough !
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 15]: At the best of it , you will have a hard row to hoe .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 6]: Why make it worse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 33]: Ronald flushed in sensitive fashion , but there was no hint of offence in his manner , as he replied -- `` It is hardly a question of an attic , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 13]: My father would not disinherit me because I preferred literature to business .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 19]: I might have a pittance instead of a fortune , but I should not have to fear want .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 10]: And why should I not live my own life ?
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 29]: If I am bound to meet troubles , surely it is only right to provide what compensations I can , and my best compensation would be congenial work !
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 8]: I do n't want to be rich .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 24]: Let some other fellow take the post , and get his happiness out of it ; it would be slavery to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 3]: `` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 13]: No boy likes the idea of putting his nose to the grindstone .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 28]: They all kick a bit at the thought of an office desk , but nine out of ten enjoy the life when they get into the swing .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 26]: It 's a great secret of happiness in this world , to be kept so busy that we have not time to think of ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 23]: We need work for its own sake , even more than for what it brings ; but our work must be worthy .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 14]: There 's no real success away from that ... About those verses now !
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 35]: It 's a pleasant occupation for you to sling them together -- I have n't a word to say against it as a recreation -- but that 's a different thing from serious work .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 48]: There 's only one thing which justifies a man in cutting himself adrift from the world , in opposition to the wishes of those who have his interests most at heart , and that is , a strong and solemn conviction of a special mission in life .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 4]: Very well then !
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 17]: If you agree so far , let us proceed to consider the mission of a poet .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 46]: There 's only one justification for his existence -- only one thing that distinguishes him from the professional rhymester whom nobody wants , and who is the bane and terror of society , and that is -- _ that he has something to say _ !
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 42]: Now take your own case -- a lad without as much as a moustache on his face ; the son of a rich father , who has lain soft all his life , and had the bumps rolled flat before him .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 13]: What do you imagine that you are going to teach the world ?
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 27]: Do you fondly believe that you have anything to say that has not been said before , and a thousand times better into the bargain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 8]: Ronald looked up and gazed dreamily ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 45]: He had taken off his cap , as his custom was in these moorland tramps , which were becoming of daily occurrence , and his hair was ruffled on his forehead , giving an air of even more than ordinary youth to his face .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 62]: The hazel eyes were dark , and the curved lips trembled with emotion ; he was searching his soul for the reply to a question on which more than life seemed to depend , and while he gazed at the purple mountains with unseeing eyes the Chieftain gazed at his illumined face , and felt that he had received his answer .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 29]: The words of Wordsworth 's immortal ode rushed into his brain , and he recognised that this ignorant lad possessed a knowledge which was hidden from the world .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 22]: Heaven , with its clouds of glory , lay close around him , ignorant of worldly wisdom though he might be .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 13]: God forbid that the one should ever be exchanged for the other !
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 12]: The Chieftain was answered , but like Ron he remained silent .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 23]: They walked on over the short , springy grass , breathed the clear , fresh breeze , and thought their own thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 38]: It was not until nearly a mile had been traversed that Ron turned his head and said simply , as if answering a question put but a moment before -- `` I sing , because I must !
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 5]: It is my life .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 24]: I have not thought of other people , except in so far as their approval would justify me in my father 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 19]: You could no doubt judge better than I if what I have to say has value or not .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 9]: Will you read some of my lines ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 20]: A curious sound broke from the Chieftain 's lips , a sound something between a groan and a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 33]: He frowned , pursed his lips , swung his short arms vigorously to and fro , shook his head with an air of determined opposition , then suddenly softened into a smile .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 10]: `` It 's a strange world , my masters !
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 4]: A strange world !
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 6]: You never know your luck !
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 15]: In the middle of my holiday , and a Scotch moor into the bargain !
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 7]: I 'll try Timbuctoo another year !
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 5]: Nothing else for it .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 12]: Where does my brain-rest come in , I want to know !
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 13]: You and your verses -- be plagued to the pair of you !
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 9]: Got some about you now , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 28]: Hand them over , then , -- the first that come to the surface -- and let me get through with it as soon as possible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 34]: He plumped down on the grass as he spoke , took out a large bandana handkerchief and mopped his brow with an air of resignation , while Ronald fumbled awkwardly in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 7]: `` I have several pencil copies .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 8]: I think you can make them out .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 5]: This is the latest .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 10]: A Madrigal -- ` To my Lady . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 4]: `` Love-song ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 7]: `` Ever been in love ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 17]: `` What a pity when charming -- poets -- sing of things they do n't understand !
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 8]: Well , well , hand it over !
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 20]: I 'll bear it as bravely as I may -- '' Ron winced , and bit his lower lip .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 34]: It was agony to sit by and watch the cool , supercilious expression on the critic 's face , the indifferent flick of the fingers with which the sheet was closed and returned .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 5]: `` Anything more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 10]: `` You do n't care for that one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 4]: `` Pretty platitudes !
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 14]: Read them before a score of times -- and somewhat more happily expressed .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 14]: If I were a poet -- which I 'm not , thank goodness !
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 10]: -- I could turn 'em out by the score .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 10]: Ten shillings each , reduction upon taking a dozen .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 9]: Suitable for amateur tenors , or the fashion-magazines .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 13]: Alterations made if required ... Anything else in the lucky bag ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 6]: `` There 's my note-book .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 20]: They are all in there -- the new ones , I mean , written since I came up here .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 8]: You can read which you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 32]: Ron took the precious leather book from his pocket , and handed it over with an effort as painful as that of submitting a live nerve to the dentist 's tool .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 30]: As he sat on the ground beside his critic he dug his heels into the grass , and the knuckles of his clenched hands showed white through the tan .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 28]: The beginning had not been propitious , and he knew well that no consideration for his feelings would seal the lips of this most honest of critics .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 30]: For a few moments he had not courage to look at his companion 's face , but even without that eloquent guide it was easy to follow his impressions .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 40]: A grunt , a groan , a long incredulous whistle , a sharp intake of breath -- these were but too readily translated as adverse criticisms , but between these explosions came intervals of silence less easy to explain .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 24]: Ron deliberately rolled over on his side , turning his back on his companion , thereby making it impossible to see his face .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 31]: Those who have never trusted their inmost thoughts to paper can hardly imagine the acute suffering of the moment when they are submitted to the cold criticism of an outsider .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 33]: Life and death themselves seemed to hang in the balance for the young poet during the half-hour when he lay on the heather listening to each sound and movement of his critic .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 11]: At the end of half an hour the interruption came .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 16]: A yawn , a groan , the pressure of a heavy hand on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 10]: `` Now then , wake up , over there !
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 6]: Time to move on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 2]: Awake !
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 11]: As if it were possible that he could be asleep !
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 16]: Never in his life had he been more acutely , painfully conscious of his surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 18]: Ron rose to his feet , casting the while a tense glance at his companion 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 19]: What verdict would he see written on eye and mouth as the result of that half-hour 's study ?
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 43]: He met a smile of bland good - humour ; the cheery , carelessly complacent smile of the breakfast-table , the smoke-room , the after-dinner game ; with not one trace of emotion , of kindled feeling , or even ordinary appreciation !
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 28]: The black note-book was tossed into his hands , as carelessly as if it had been a ball ; even a commonplace word of comment was denied .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 22]: It was a bitter moment , but , to the lad 's credit be it said , he met it bravely .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 50]: A gulp to a tiresome lump in the throat , a slight quivering of the sensitive lips , and he was master of himself again , hastily stuffing the precious note-book out of sight , and striving to display the right amount of interest in his companion 's conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 24]: It was not until the inn was within sight that Mr Elgood made the slightest allusion to the verses which he had read .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 8]: `` Ah -- about those rhymes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 4]: he began casually .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 11]: `` Do n't take yourself too seriously , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 37]: It 's a strange thing that young people constitute themselves the pessimists of the world , while the old ones , who know what real trouble is , are left to do the optimism by themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 10]: If you are bound to sing , sing cheerfully !
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 26]: Try to forget that ` sad ' rhymes with ` glad , ' and do n't feel it necessary to end in the minor key .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 10]: That rhyming business has a lot to answer for .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 17]: I like you best when you are content to be your natural , cheerful self ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 18]: `` You think , then -- you do think -- some of them a little good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 12]: Ron 's wistful voice would have melted a heart of stone .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 14]: The Chieftain laid a hand on his arm with a very kindly pressure .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 21]: `` There are some of 'em , '' he said cheerfully , `` which are a lot better than others .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 32]: I 'm not partial to amateur verses myself , but I do n't mind telling you for your comfort that I 've seen worse , before now -- considerably worse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 3]: Poor Ron !
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 5]: It was bitter comfort .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 47]: In the blessed privacy of his own room he sat himself down to read over the pages of the little black book with painful criticism , asking himself miserably if it were really true that they were feeble amateur efforts , tinged with pretence and unreality .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 72]: Here and there a flush and a wince proved that the accusation had gone home , when a vigorous pencil mark on the side of the page marked the necessity for correction , but on the whole he could honestly refute the charge ; could declare , with the bold yet humble conviction of the true craftsman , that it was good work ; work well done ; work worth doing !
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 11]: The dreamy brown eyes sent out a flash of determination .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 7]: `` I _ can _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 5]: said Ron to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 8]: `` And I _ will _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 4]: A MOUNTAIN MIST .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 23]: Three days later a wagonette was chartered from Rew , to drive the diminished party to the scene of the haunted castle .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 35]: Margot felt rather shy in the position of the only lady , but a mild proposition that she should stay at home had been so vigorously vetoed that she had nothing more to say .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 33]: `` If one clergyman , plus one brother , plus one bald-headed veteran , are n't sufficient chaperons for one small girl , things are coming to a pretty pass indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 5]: protested the Chieftain vigorously .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 29]: `` If you stay at home , we _ all _ stay , so that 's settled , and the disappointment and upset will be on your head .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 11]: Why all this fuss , I should like to know ?
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 8]: One might think you were shy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 12]: Margot pouted , and wriggled her shoulders inside her white blouse .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 8]: `` I _ am _ shy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 7]: `` You are , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 6]: Had n't noticed it before .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 9]: Of whom , if one may ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 24]: She turned at that , and walked back to the inn , nose in air , but thereafter there were no more demurs .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 27]: It was indeed a very decorous little party which sat in two rows of three , facing each other in the wagonette during the eight-mile drive .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 43]: The clergyman and the Chieftain , with Margot between them ; and opposite , the three dreamers : the Editor , Ron , and young Mr Menzies , -- each apparently too much immersed in his own thoughts to care for conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 42]: Margot was quite thankful when the drive came to an end , outside castle walls , grim and grey , but imposing as ever , though they were in reality but a shell , surrounding a plot of innocent green grass .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 38]: There were isolated towers still standing , however , approached by winding stone stairways , and short lengths of walks along the ramparts , and quaint little barred windows through which one could view the surrounding country .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 56]: When Margot thrust her pretty laughing face through one of these latter to greet her friends below , every photographer among them insisted upon snap-shotting her then and there , and for a good half-hour she was kept busy , posing in various attitudes , to give the desired touch of life to the pictures .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 82]: Photography over , the next duties were to partake of lunch and to wander round the small , and it must be confessed somewhat uninteresting little village ; then , -- since the return home counted as one of the chief attractions in the programme -- the little party broke up into two , the clergyman and his son preferring the longer route , round by the roads , the other four to take the short -- cut across the moors .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 7]: A five-mile walk across the moors !
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 58]: Given health , settled skies , and congenial society , it would be difficult to name a more exhilarating occupation for a summer afternoon ; but , truth to tell , the weather had taken a decided turn for the worse since midday , and it needed some optimism to set forth on a long exposed walk .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 67]: The subject had been discussed at lunch with special reference to Margot , as the only lady of the party ; but , as she aptly observed , she was bound to get back somehow , and , as a choice of evils , preferred to walk through rain , rather than sit still to be soaked through and through on the seat of the wagonette .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 34]: It was therefore decided to make an early start , and allow no loitering by the way ; but when the village had been left about a mile behind an unexpected delay occurred .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 25]: The Chieftain thrust his hands into his pockets , and stopped short in the middle of the road , with an expression of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 5]: `` Eh , what !
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 8]: Here 's a fine kettle of fish !
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 7]: Where 's my bunch of keys ?
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 13]: They were here as safe as houses , a few minutes back .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 12]: I was jingling tunes on them as we passed the school .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 6]: You heard me jingling 'em !
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 17]: Dropped them on the road , I suppose , and walked on like a blind bat .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 12]: Serves me right to have to turn back to find 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 9]: Ca n't lose my keys , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 15]: Got to find them somehow , or there 'll be the mischief to pay .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 16]: You 'll have to go on , George , and take Miss Vane with you .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 16]: There 's no time for conundrums , if you want to get home dry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 8]: He looked towards Ron with questioning eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 8]: `` Feel inclined to keep me company ?
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 11]: I do n't fancy that walk by my lonesome . ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 6]: `` Of course I do .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 18]: I should not think of leaving you behind by yourself , sir , '' returned Ron eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 26]: `` We ca n't have far to go , and we can soon catch up the others , if we make a sprint for it .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 5]: Go on , Margot .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 10]: We 'll be after you in no time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 48]: In the circumstances there was nothing else to be done , nor indeed , after a long morning spent in wandering about as a party , was Margot inclined to quarrel with the fate which provided an interesting _ tete-a - tete _ for the walk home .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 46]: She contented herself with expressing profuse sympathy for the Chieftain 's loss , and with prophesying cheerfully that the keys were certain to be found , then promptly dismissed the subject from her mind , and gave herself up to the enjoyment of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 28]: `` I really think we are wise not to wait about , '' George Elgood said , in accents of self-vindication , as they moved on together .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 33]: `` The glass is high , but I do n't like the look of things , all the same , and for your sake shall be glad when we are nearer home .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 14]: Are you pretty warmly dressed , if the rain should come on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 7]: `` Do n't I look it ?
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 15]: I could n't possibly have anything more suitable than this tweed coat and skirt .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 9]: It does n't matter how wet it gets .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 6]: It wo n't spoil . ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 14]: `` I was thinking about your own comfort , not of the clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 12]: You never carry an umbrella with you , I notice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 7]: `` I ca n't be bothered !
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 17]: Showers are such an everyday occurrence up here , that one would be doing nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 30]: I rather like the feel of the rain on my face , and besides , '' -- she laughed mischievously , `` it 's good for the complexion ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 6]: `` Is that so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 25]: he asked gravely , his dark eyes dwelling on the soft , rounded cheeks , which grew a shade more pink beneath his gaze .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 19]: Suddenly his lips twitched , with the one-sided , humorous smile which brought the youth into his face .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 27]: `` I do n't think the need in that direction is so pressing that it could not be postponed with advantage , for to-day at least .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 7]: Do you mind walking fairly quickly ?
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 12]: I shall feel more comfortable when we are nearer home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 41]: Margot was serenely indifferent whether it rained or not , but none the less she appreciated the Editor 's care for her welfare , which showed itself in a dozen little graceful acts during the first part of their walk .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 29]: For one unaccustomed to women 's society he was marvellously observant , and Margot felt a sweeter satisfaction in being so protected than in all her former independence .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 46]: They climbed the hillside which led to the moor and set out radiantly to traverse the grey expanse ; grey and cheerless to-day in very deed , with a thick , blanket-like dampness in the atmosphere of which dwellers in southern climes are happily ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 32]: George Elgood turned up the collar of his coat , and Margot thrust her hands into her pockets , shivering slightly the while , but neither made any complaint in words .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 44]: As usual , it was left to Margot to do most of the talking ; but though her companion 's responses were short , they were yet so sympathetic and appreciative , that there was never any difficulty in finding a fresh subject .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 63]: Like most couples with whom friendship is fast making way for a warmer emotion , personal topics were the most appreciated , and what was happening in the world -- the discoveries of science , the works of the great writers -- palled in interest before sentences beginning with , `` I think , '' and , `` Do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 13]: `` I wish -- '' `` Have you ever wished -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 34]: They looked at each other as they spoke , with bright , questioning glances , which seemed ever to hail some precious new discovery of mind , drawing them closer and closer together .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 22]: The hour of enchantment had come , when they moved in a world of their own , unconscious of external accidents .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 28]: The moisture hung in dewdrops on the Editor 's cap , Margot 's hair curled damply on her forehead ; but they felt neither cold nor discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 48]: It was unusually dark for the time of day , and had grown mysteriously darker during the last half-hour ; but visitors to the Highlands become philosophically resigned to sudden and unpleasant atmospheric changes , and fall into the way of ignoring them as far as possible .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 76]: It was only when they reached a point in the moor from whence the ground sloped sharply downward towards the Glen that they awoke to the consciousness of danger , for instead of a rolling stretch of green surrounded by purple hills , they seemed to be looking down into a cauldron of floating mist and steam , blocking out the view , confusing the eyes , and slowly but surely concealing the familiar landmarks .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 23]: Margot and the Editor stopped short with simultaneous exclamations of dismay , then wheeled quickly round , to see what lay behind .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 30]: Here indeed the fog was much less dense , but the distance was already obliterated , while long , smoke-like tendrils of mist were closing in on every hand .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 35]: The signs which they had noted had portended something worse than rain ; something which the dwellers in moorland regions learn to fear and dread above all other phenomena , -- a mountain mist !
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 9]: George Elgood 's face was eloquent with self-reproach .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 6]: `` This is my fault !
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 14]: Where were my eyes , that I did not see what was happening ?
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 9]: The darkness should have warned me long ago .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 11]: I am horribly ashamed of myself , Miss Vane ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 6]: `` You need n't be .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 9]: It 's as much my fault as yours .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 16]: I did notice the damp on my face , but I thought it was rain .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 7]: What are we to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 12]: It was a simple question , but terribly difficult to answer .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 16]: With every moment those rolling masses of mist settled down more densely over the hillsides .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 33]: To walk forward was to walk blindfold over a treacherous country ; to return seemed hardly more propitious , though as a choice of evils it was the one to be preferred .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 6]: `` We must go back .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 12]: We ca n't have come more than two or three miles .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 12]: We must get back , and drive round by the road .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 14]: Probably we shall meet Geoffrey and your brother _ en route _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 26]: Even as he spoke the Editor turned and led the way towards the little village which had been left behind less than an hour before .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 26]: There was no time to waste , for the darkness was increasing , and the clammy dankness of the air struck to the very marrow .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 12]: `` I shall never forgive myself if you suffer through this .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 9]: It was my business to look after you .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 25]: There 's only this slight excuse -- that we were mounting towards the highest part of the moor , which was naturally the clearest .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 11]: The mist seems to have gathered from all around . ''
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 12]: Margaret looked and shivered , but hastened to appease his anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 22]: `` I think we _ did _ notice , but as we were expecting rain , a little mistiness was natural .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 13]: We could not tell that it was going to spread like this .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 3]: Never mind !
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 16]: It will be quite an adventure to brag about when we are back in town .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 7]: ` Lost on the Scotch moors !
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 7]: Tourists disappear in a mist ! '
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 12]: It would make a thrilling headline , would n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 15]: She laughed as she spoke , but the laugh had rather a forced tone .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 24]: Suddenly she became conscious that she was tired and chilled , that her coat was soaked , and her boots heavy with damp .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 41]: Though only a few paces away , the figure of her companion was wreathed with tendrils of mist ; they were floating round her also ; blinding her eyes , catching her breath , sending fresh shivers down her back .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 16]: A pang of fear shot through her at the thought of what might lie ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 11]: Like two grey ghosts they struggled onward through the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 5]: LOST ON THE MOOR .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 27]: George Elgood 's haste to reach the end of the moor gave wings to his feet , so that Margot had much ado to keep pace .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 47]: Contrary to expectation , the fog did not lessen as they advanced , but closed in upon them thicker and thicker , so that the ground beneath their feet became invisible , and progress was broken by sundry trips and stumbles over projecting mounds of heather .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 32]: The air seemed to reek with moisture , and a deadly feeling of oppression , almost of suffocation , affected the lungs , as the curling wreath of mist closed overhead .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 45]: Half an hour earlier Margot had felt that any sort of adventure -LRB- if experienced in George Elgood 's company -RRB- must of necessity be enjoyable , but during that swift silent retreat she was conscious of a dawning of something perilously like fear .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 24]: Her breath came in quickened pants , she kept her eyes fixed in a straining eagerness on the tall figure looming darkly ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 14]: If she once lost sight of him , what would become of her ?
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 15]: It made her shudder to think of being left alone upon that shrouded moor !
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 57]: Every now and then as he walked , the Editor gave voice to a loud `` coo - ee , '' in hope that the echoes might reach the ears of his brother and Ronald , who should by now be approaching in the same direction ; but no reply floated back to his anxious ears .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 15]: `` Perhaps they have gone round by the road , '' he suggested tentatively .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 31]: `` If they were some time in following , they may have seen the fog , and come to the conclusion that discretion was the better part of valour . ''
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 15]: `` Ron would n't go another way if he thought I was in danger !
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 9]: He promised father to take care of me .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 7]: I know he will come . ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 17]: `` Then we are bound to meet ; unless -- '' George Elgood stopped short hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 39]: It was not for him to open his companion 's eyes to the fact that the direction which they were taking had become a matter of speculation , as one after another the familiar landmarks faded from view .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 29]: The two brothers might pass by within a few yards , or their paths might diverge by miles , but in either case they would be equally invisible .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 21]: The only hope was to go on sending out the familiar cry , which would at once prove their identity .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 15]: `` Not that we should be any better off with them than without ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 5]: he told himself dolefully .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 22]: Margot did not ask for a completion of the unfinished sentence , perhaps because she guessed only too truly its import .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 37]: A few steps farther on her foot came in contact with a stone hidden beneath a clump of furze ; she stumbled , tried in vain to recover herself , and fell forward on her knees .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 27]: The shock and the severe pricking which ensued forced a cry of dismay , and the Editor turned back hurriedly , and uttered a startled inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 9]: `` Miss Vane , where are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 6]: `` I 'm here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 14]: replied a doleful voice , and a dark form stirred at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 7]: `` I -- _ fell _ !
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 5]: On a horrid bush !
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 8]: My hands are full of prickles . ''
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 12]: `` I 'll light a match while you get them out .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 5]: It 's my fault .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 8]: I might have guessed what would happen .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 12]: I 'd like to kick myself for being so thoughtless . ''
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 5]: `` Please do n't !
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 8]: We do n't want any more tribulations .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 9]: I -- I 'm quite all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 7]: cried Margot , with tremulous bravery .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 20]: The flicker of a match showed a pale face , and two little hands grimed with dust and earth .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 13]: She brushed them hastily together , and peered up into his face .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 11]: `` It 's pretty thick , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 4]: `` Abominably thick !
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 24]: I have heard of the sudden way in which these mountain mists come on , but I 've never been in one before .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 13]: I could kick myself once more for not having noticed it sooner .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 12]: I suppose I was too much absorbed in our conversation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 26]: The match died out , and there was a moment 's silence , in which Margot seemed to hear the beating of her own heart .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 20]: Then in the darkness a hand lifted hers , and placed it against an arm which felt reassuringly solid .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 9]: `` You must let me help you along .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 16]: A moor is not the easiest place in the world to cross in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 7]: You wo n't mind my shouts ?
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 19]: I want to let the other fellows know where we are , if they are within hearing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 8]: `` Oh , I do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 6]: I 'll shout , too !
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 5]: They must be near .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 12]: It seems ridiculous that we ca n't see each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 29]: But still no answering cry came back , and Margot 's sense of comfort in the supporting arm gradually gave place to a revival of her first dread .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 16]: She shivered , and swallowed a lump in her throat before daring a fateful question .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 19]: `` Mr Elgood , do you know -- have you the faintest idea where we are going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 15]: His arm tightened over her hand , but he made no attempt at prevarication .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 7]: `` No , I have n't !
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 14]: For the last five or ten minutes it has been purely guess-work . ''
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 19]: `` We may be going in the wrong direction , or round and round in a circle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 13]: `` We may -- I am afraid it is more than probable .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 15]: I have been thinking that it might be better to stay where we are .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 29]: We ca n't have strayed very far out of the course as yet , but -- '' Again he stopped , and this time Margot completed the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 4]: `` I know !
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 16]: It 's not safe to wander about when we ca n't see what is ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 8]: I 've been thinking the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 8]: We had better sit down and wait .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 8]: They will come to look for us .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 22]: I 'm sure they will come , and there 's a cottage somewhere near , where we have been for milk .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 5]: That 's another chance .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 13]: If we keep calling the people , they may hear us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 6]: `` Oh yes , yes !
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 16]: Some one will hear , or the mist will rise as suddenly as it fell .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 15]: It will be only for a short time , '' returned the Editor sturdily .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 21]: `` Now look here -- the ground is soaking -- you ca n't possibly sit on it without something underneath .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 28]: If you could spare your cape it would serve us both as a rug , and I 'm going to wrap you up in my coat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 27]: He loosened his arm , as if to take off the said coat forthwith , but Margot 's fingers tightened their grasp in very determined fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 5]: `` You are not !
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 6]: I wo n't wear it .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 9]: I absolutely refuse to do any such thing .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 23]: How can you suggest such a horridly selfish arrangement -- I to wear your coat , while you sit shivering in shirt-sleeves ?
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 2]: Never !
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 6]: I 'd rather freeze ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 7]: `` Put it the other way .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 21]: Am I , a man , to hug my coat , and let a girl sit on the soaking grass ?
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 8]: How do you suppose I should feel ?
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 8]: I 'd rather freeze , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 7]: Margot gave a quavering little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 20]: `` It seems to me we have a pretty good chance of doing it -- coat or no coat .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 19]: If I am a girl , I 'm a healthy one , and I must take my chance .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 13]: Did you happen to put your newspaper in your pocket this morning ?
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 8]: That would be better than nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 6]: `` Of course I did !
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 5]: That will do capitally .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 8]: What a blessing you thought of it !
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 15]: Sit down quickly , and I 'll pull a bit down under your feet .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 11]: Ca n't I wrap that cape more tightly round you ?
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 4]: And the hood ?
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 10]: Had n't you better have the hood up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 5]: `` Yes , please !
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 6]: I had forgotten the hood .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 6]: That will be cosy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 33]: Margot 's cold cheeks flamed with sudden colour as she felt the touch of careful fingers settling the hood round head and face , and fumbling for the hook under the chin .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 12]: At that moment at least cold was not the predominant sensation !
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 20]: There was a short silence while the Editor seated himself by her side , and felt in his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 10]: `` You wo n't mind if I smoke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 12]: `` I shall like it , especially if you have fusees .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 7]: I love the smell of fusees !
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 24]: You do n't ask me to have a cigarette , I notice , and yet it is fashionable for girls to smoke nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 10]: How did you know that I did n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 7]: `` I _ did _ know !
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 17]: I can hardly tell why , but I am thankful for it , all the same .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 10]: I am too old-fashioned to care for smoking women .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 14]: A girl loses her charm when she apes a man 's habits . ''
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 3]: I agree .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 40]: I am sorry I am not a man , but as I 'm a girl I prefer to be a real one , and have my clothes smelling sweet and violety , instead of like a fusty railway carriage .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 10]: But men seem to find smoke soothing at times .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 12]: I wish I had a feminine equivalent of it just now .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 17]: It 's a little bit frightening to sit still and stare into this blank white wall .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 13]: Could n't you tell me something interesting to pass the time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 14]: `` It 's a little difficult to be ` interesting ' to order .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 11]: What particular kind of narrative would distract you best ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 7]: `` Oh -- something about yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 14]: Something you have done , or felt , or planned for another day .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 8]: I 'm so interested in people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 25]: returned Margot , wrapping the folds of her cloak more closely round her , and slipping her hands deep down into the inside pockets .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 17]: `` Have you had any thrilling experiences or adventures that you do n't mind speaking about ?
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 18]: The more thrilling the better , please , for my feet _ are _ so cold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 14]: She shivered , in involuntary childish fashion , and George Elgood sighed profoundly .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 11]: `` This is about the biggest adventure I 've had .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 44]: I was once snowed up for a night in a rest-house on one of the Swiss mountains , but we had every ordinary comfort , and knew exactly where we were , so that it did n't amount to much , after all .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 50]: I was going up with my guide , and met another party of two brothers and a sister coming down , and we all took shelter together , while one of the guides returned to the village , to let the people in the hotel know of our safety .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 27]: When the door was open the prospect was sufficiently eerie , but we made a fire and brewed tea , and passed the time pleasantly enough .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 32]: The worst part of it was that I had to give up the ascent next day , as there was too much snow to make it prudent to go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 5]: Was she pretty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 12]: She felt , rather than saw , his start of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 4]: `` The sister .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 12]: You said there was a girl in the other party . ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 11]: `` I 'm _ sure _ I do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 6]: I did n't notice . ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 10]: `` Do n't you care how people look ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 16]: `` It does n't interest me , unless I am already attracted in other ways .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 8]: At least -- '' he hesitated conscientiously .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 9]: `` I _ used _ not to be .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 8]: I think I am growing more noticing .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 14]: Geoff always said I needed to be awakened to the claims of beauty .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 13]: I understand now that it may be a great additional charm . ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 5]: How did he understand ?
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 10]: Who or what had increased his power of observation ?
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 17]: Margot hoped that she knew ; longed to be certain , yet dreaded the definite information .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 24]: In a little flurry of nervousness she began to talk volubly on her own account , hoping thereby to ward off embarrassing explanations .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 10]: `` I seem fated to come in for adventures .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 31]: I went over to Norway one summer , and the engines broke down half-way across the North Sea , and at the same time all the electric lights went out .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 22]: It was terribly rough , and we rolled for a couple of hours -- the longest hours I have ever known !
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 25]: The partitions of the cabins did not quite reach to the roof , and you could hear the different conversations going on all round .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 24]: In a dreary kind of way I realised that they were very funny , and that I should laugh over them another day .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 43]: Quite near us were two jolly English schoolboys , who kept ordering meals all the next day , and shouting out details to a poor sister who was lying terribly ill in the next cabin ` Monica , we are having bacon !
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 10]: Have a bit of bread soaked in fat ? '
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 15]: Then Monica would groan -- a heartrending groan , and they would start afresh .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 11]: ` Buck up , Monica -- try a muffin ! '
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 19]: At lunch-time they pressed roast beef and Yorkshire pudding upon her , and she groaned louder than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 9]: She _ was _ ill , poor girl .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 32]: In Norway there was an alarm of fire in one of those terrible wooden hotels , and we all jumped on each other 's balconies to get to the outside staircases .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 13]: It was soon extinguished , but it was a very bad scare .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 7]: And now this is the third .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 7]: Mr Elgood , do coo-ee again !
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 14]: Ron must be looking for me , unless he is lost himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 44]: The Editor put his hands to his mouth and sent forth a succession of long-drawn-out calls , which seemed as though they must surely be heard for miles around , but in the silence which followed no note of reply could be heard .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 40]: In the face of such continued disappointment , Margot had not the courage to go on making conversation , but relapsed into a dreary silence , which was broken only by the gentle puff-puff of the Editor 's pipe .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 18]: In the darkness and silence neither took note of time , or realised how it sped along .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 16]: Only by physical sensations could it be checked , but gradually these became disagreeably pressing .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 36]: Margot 's feet were like ice , her fingers so cold as to be almost powerless ; but as the minutes passed slowly by the active discomfort was replaced by a feeling of drowsy indifference .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 27]: She seemed to have been sitting for years staring into a blank white wall , and had no longer any desire to move from her position .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 12]: It was easier to sit still , and wait upon Fate .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 19]: Beneath the veil of darkness her head drooped forward , and she swayed gently from side to side .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 51]: For some time these movements were so slight as to pass unnoticed by her companion , but as the drowsiness increased the muscles seemed to lose control , the swayings became momentarily more pronounced , until she tilted violently over , to recover herself with a jerk and a groan .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 10]: Then indeed George Elgood was startled into anxious attention .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 5]: `` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 5]: What is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 6]: Are you in pain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 16]: The inarticulate murmur which did duty for reply seemed only to whet anxiety still further .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 8]: `` Miss Vane , are you ill ?
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 11]: For pity 's sake tell me what is wrong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 20]: Another murmur sounded faintly in his ear , followed by an incoherent -- `` I 'm only -- asleep !
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 7]: So -- very -- tired ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 27]: With a sharp exclamation the Editor leapt upwards , and the drowsy Margot felt herself suddenly hoisted to her feet by a pair of strong arms .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 23]: The arms retained their hold of her even after she was erect , shaking her to and fro with almost painful energy .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 9]: `` But you _ must _ not sleep !
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 6]: Margot , Margot , awake !
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 7]: I ca n't let you sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 9]: It is the worst thing you could do .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 6]: Speak to me , Margot .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 5]: Tell me you understand .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 2]: Margot !
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 2]: Darling !
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 12]: Oh , do rouse yourself , and try to understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 12]: Margot never forgot that moment , or the wonder of it .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 35]: She seemed to herself to be wandering in a strange country , far , far away from the solid tangible earth -- a land of darkness and dreams , of strange , numbing unreality .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 33]: Her eyes were open , yet saw nothing : impalpable chains fettered her limbs , so that they grew stiff and refused to move ; an icy coldness crept around her heart .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 29]: Hearing , like the other senses , was dulled , yet through the throbbing silence a sound had penetrated , bringing with it a thrill of returning life .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 18]: Some one had called '' _ Margot _ '' in a tone she had never heard before .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 11]: Some one had said , '' _ Darling _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 16]: Back through the fast-closing mists of unconsciousness Margot 's soul struggled to meet her mate .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 15]: Her fingers tightened feebly on his , and her cold lips breathed a reply .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 7]: `` Yes -- I am here !
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 6]: Do you want me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 11]: Something like a sob sounded in the Editor 's throat .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 6]: `` Do I want you ?
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 4]: My little Margot !
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 7]: Did I ever want anything before ?
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 10]: Come , I will warm your little cold hands .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 10]: I will lead you every step of the way .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 12]: You ca n't sit here any longer to perish of cold .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 13]: We will walk on , and ask God to guide our feet .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 4]: Lean on me .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 6]: Do n't be afraid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 34]: Then the dream became a moving one , in which she was borne forward encircled by protecting arms ; on and on ; unceasingly onward , with ever - increasing difficulty and pain .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 25]: George Elgood never knew whether he hit , as he supposed , a straight road forward , or wandered aimlessly over the same ground .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 65]: His one care was to support his companion , and to test each footstep before he took it ; for the rest , he had put himself in God 's hands , with a simple faith which expected a reply ; and when at last the light of the cottage windows shone feebly through the mist his thankfulness was as great as his relief .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 55]: As for Margot , she was too completely exhausted to realise relief ; she knew only a shrinking from the light , from the strange watching face ; a deathly sensation as of falling from a towering height , before darkness and oblivion overpowered her , and she lay stretched unconscious upon the bed .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 2]: PARTINGS .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 48]: It was six days later when Margot opened her eyes , and found herself lying on the little white bed in the bedroom of the Nag 's Head , with some one by the window whose profile as outlined against the light seemed strangely and sweetly familiar .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 12]: She stared dumbly , with a confused wonder in her brain .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 4]: _ Edith _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 7]: It could not possibly be Edith !
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 14]: What should bring Edith up to Glenaire in this sudden and unexpected fashion ?
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 22]: And why was she herself so weak and languid that to speak and ask the question seemed an almost impossible exertion ?
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 4]: What had happened ?
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 35]: Was she only dreaming that her head ached , and her hands seemed too heavy to move , and that Edith sat by the window near a table covered with medicine bottles and glasses ?
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 10]: Margot blinked her eyes , and stared curiously around .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 25]: it was no dream ; she was certainly awake , and through the dull torpor of her brain a remembrance began slowly to work .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 4]: Something had happened !
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 25]: She had been tired and cold ; oh , cold , cold , cold ; so cold that it had seemed impossible to live .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 22]: She had wandered on and on , through an eternity of darkness , which had ended in the blackness of night .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 21]: Her head throbbed with the effort of thinking ; she shut her eyes and lay quietly , waiting upon remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 4]: Suddenly it came .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 22]: A faint flush of colour showed itself in the white cheek , and a tingle of warmth ran through the veins .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 33]: She remembered now upon whose arm she had hung , whose voice it was which had cheered her onward ; in trembling , incredulous fashion she remembered what that voice had said !
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 20]: A faint exclamation sounded through the stillness , whereupon Edith looked round quickly , and hurried to the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 3]: `` Margot !
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 3]: My darling !
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 8]: Do you know me at last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 4]: Margot smiled wanly .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 25]: The smooth rounded face had fallen away sadly in that week of fever and unconsciousness , and a little hand was pushed feebly forward .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 5]: I 'm so glad !
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 8]: Edie , have I been ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 11]: `` Yes , darling ; but you are better now .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 12]: After a few days ' rest you will be well again .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 11]: You must not be nervous about your dear self . ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 6]: `` And you came ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 17]: `` Yes , darling ; Ron telegraphed , and father and I came up at once .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 9]: Agnes is taking care of the boys . ''
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 4]: `` So kind !
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 8]: I remember -- it was the mist .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 7]: Was -- Ron -- safe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 8]: `` Yes , darling , quite safe .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 23]: He and Mr Elgood arrived at the cottage very soon after you , and were so thankful to find you there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 10]: `` Is -- is _ everybody _ well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 38]: Again that faint flush showed on the cheeks ; but Edie was mercifully blind , and answered with direct simplicity -- `` Every one , dear , and you are going to be quite well , too .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 19]: You must not talk any more just now , for you are rather a weak little girl still .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 15]: Drink this cup of milk , and roll over , and have another nap .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 12]: It is good to see you sleeping quietly and peacefully again .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 10]: Shut your eyes , like a good girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 45]: Then once more Margot floated off into unconsciousness ; but this time it was the blessed , health-restoring unconsciousness of sleep , such sleep as she had not known for days past , and from which she awoke with rested body and clearer brain .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 49]: When the dear father came in to kiss and greet her , a thin white hand crept up to stroke his hair , and pull his ear in the way he loved , whereupon he blinked away tears of thankfulness , and essayed to be fierce and reproachful .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 24]: `` So you could n't be satisfied until you had dragged the whole family after you , to the ends of the earth !
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 7]: There 's no pleasing some people .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 20]: This is my reward for being such a fool as to think you could take care of yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 5]: `` Ducky Doodles ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 4]: murmured Margot fondly .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 38]: As of yore , she manifested not the faintest alarm at his pretence of severity , but twitched his ear with complacent composure , and once more Mr Vane blinked and swallowed a lump in his throat .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 36]: There had been hours during those last days when he had feared that he might never again hear himself called `` Ducky Doodles , '' and what a sad grey world that would have meant !
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 41]: Then came Ron , a little embarrassed , as was natural in a lad of his years , but truly loving and tender all the same , and Margot 's brown _ eyes _ searched his face with wistful questioning .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 24]: There was so much that she wanted to ask and to hear , and concerning which no one had as yet vouchsafed information .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 42]: Ron could tell her all that was to be told , which it was impossible to pass another night without knowing , yet there he sat , sublimely unconscious that she wanted to be assured of anything but his own safety .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 14]: With the energy of despair , Margot forced herself to put a question .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 9]: `` How are all -- the others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 4]: `` The Elgoods ?
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 5]: They are all right .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 14]: Awfully worried about you , you know , and that sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 10]: Afraid the governor might think they were to blame .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 16]: The idea of your going down with pneumonia , and frightening us all into fits !
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 24]: I thought you were too healthy to be bowled over so soon , but a London life does n't fit one for exposure .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 14]: The governor was furious with me for bringing you to the North . ''
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 13]: But for once Margot was not interested in her father 's feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 13]: She turned her head on the pillow and put yet another question .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 10]: `` They did not catch colds , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 6]: `` Oh , colds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 4]: Ron laughed lightly .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 15]: `` Of course , we all had colds ; what else could you expect ?
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 9]: We were lucky to get off so easily .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 22]: The Elgoods put off leaving until you were safely round the corner , but they are off first thing to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 11]: At this there was a quick rustle of the bedclothes .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 3]: `` Going ?
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 5]: _ Where _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 14]: asked a startled voice , in which sounded an uncontrollable quiver of apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 7]: `` Not away for altogether ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 8]: Their time was up three days ago .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 14]: It is awfully decent of them to have stayed on for so long .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 21]: We shall meet in town , I suppose ; but your Editor man is no use to me , Margot .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 7]: That little scheme has fallen flat .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 26]: From first to last he has never troubled to show the faintest interest in my existence , and has avoided the governor all he knew .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 9]: The Chieftain is worth a dozen of him .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 26]: He has kept the whole thing going this last week , amused the governor , looked after Edith , been a perfect brick to me .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 39]: I 'm glad we came , if it were only for the sake of making his acquaintance , for he is the grandest man I 've ever known ; but your scheme has failed , old girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 14]: From Margot 's expression it would appear that everything on earth had failed .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 23]: Her face looked as white as the pillow against which she rested , and her eyes were tragic in her despairing sadness .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 16]: Ron bestirred himself to comfort her , full of gratitude for so heartfelt an interest .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 4]: `` Never mind !
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 19]: You did your best , and it 's nobody 's fault that he turned out such a Diogenes .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 22]: The governor has been awfully decent since he came up , and I do n't despair of getting the time extended .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 84]: He is much more amenable , apart from Agnes , and I fancy the Chieftain puts in a good word for me now and then -- not on the score of literature , of course -- but after they have been talking together , the governor always seems to look upon me with more -- more _ respect _ , do n't you know , and less as if I were a hopeless failure , of whom he was more or less ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 13]: That 's a gain in itself , is n't it ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 4]: ` Um ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 4]: assented Margot vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 12]: `` I suppose they drive over to catch the evening express ?
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 11]: Did he -- they -- say anything about me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 5]: Ron started in surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 21]: `` My dear girl , we have talked of nothing else _ but _ you , for the last week !
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 19]: Pulse , temperature , sleep ; sleep , temperature , pulse ; every hour the same old tale .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 21]: You have given us all a rare old fright ; but thank goodness you are on the mend at last .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 12]: The doctor says it is only a matter of time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 10]: `` Did -- they -- send any message ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 9]: Edie said you were not to be excited .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 24]: Awfully sorry to miss saying good-bye , and that sort of thing , but hope to meet you another day in town . ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 18]: Margot shut her eyes , and the line of curling lashes looked astonishingly black against her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 4]: `` I see .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 3]: Very kind !
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 7]: I 'm -- tired , Ron .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 8]: I ca n't talk any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 17]: Ron rose from his seat with , it must be confessed , a sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 27]: He was ill at ease in the atmosphere of the sick-room , and hardly recognised his jaunty , self-confident companion in this wan and languid invalid .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 37]: He dropped a light kiss on Margot 's forehead , and hurried downstairs , to be encountered on the threshold of the inn by George Elgood , who for once seemed anxious to enter into conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 9]: `` You have been to see your sister .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 18]: Did she -- er -- was she well enough to send any message before we go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 26]: `` Oh , she 's all right -- quite quiet and sensible again , but does n't bother herself much about what is going on .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 17]: I told her you were off , but she did n't seem to take much notice .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 20]: Expect she 's so jolly thankful to feel comfortable again that she does n't care for anything else . ''
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 10]: `` Er -- quite so , quite so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 43]: repeated the Editor hastily ; and Ron passed on his way , satisfied that he had been all that was tactful and considerate , and serenely unconscious that he had eclipsed the sun of that summer 's day for two anxious hearts !
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 35]: There was little sleep for poor Margot that night , and in the morning Edith noticed with alarm the flushed cheeks and shining eyes which seemed to predict a return of the feverish symptoms .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 22]: She drew down the blind and seated herself by the bedside , determined to guard the door and allow no visitors .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 20]: The child had evidently had too much excitement the day before , and must now be kept absolutely quiet .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 34]: But Margot tossed and fidgeted , and threw the clothes restlessly about , refusing to shut her eyes , and allow herself to be tucked up , as the elder sister lovingly advised .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 24]: Her eyes were strained , and every now and then she lifted her head from the pillow with an anxious , listening movement .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 43]: At last it came , the sound for which she had been waiting -- the rumble of wheels , the clatter of horses ' hoofs , the grunts and groans of the ostler as he lifted the heavy bags to their place .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 11]: Margot 's brown eyes looked up with a piteous entreaty .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 5]: `` They are going !
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 7]: You must be quick , Edie .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 8]: Run down quickly and say good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 8]: `` It is n't necessary , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 7]: I saw them before coming upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 8]: Ron is there , and father . ''
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 5]: `` But you must !
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 6]: I want you to go .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 8]: Quickly , before it is too late .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 8]: Edie , you _ must _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 9]: There was no denying so vehement a command .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 21]: Edith turned silently away , confirmed in a growing suspicion , and yearning tenderly over the little sister 's suffering .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 9]: It was the younger brother , of course !
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 41]: -- the tall , silent man , whose lips had been so dumb , whose eyes so eloquent , during the critical days of Margot 's illness , and who had been the girl 's companion on the misty moor .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 11]: What had happened during those hours of suspense and danger ?
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 12]: What barriers had been swept aside ; what new vistas opened ?
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 58]: Edith 's own love was too sweet and sacred a thing to allow her to pry and question into the heart-secrets of another , as is the objectionable fashion of many so-called friends , but with her keen woman-senses she took in George Elgood 's every word , look , and movement during the brief parting scene .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 50]: He stood aside , leaving his brother to utter the conventional farewells ; his lips were set , and his brows drawn together ; but ever and anon , as if against his will , his eyes shot anxious glances towards the window of the room where Margot lay .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 30]: Edith moved a few steps nearer , to give the chance of a few quiet words , if it was in his heart to speak , but none came .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 27]: A moment later he had swung himself up beside his brother on the high seat of the cart , and the wheels were beginning to move .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 34]: Edith went slowly back to her post , dreading to meet the gaze of those dear brown eyes , which had lost their sparkle , and become so pathetic in their dumb questioning .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 21]: She had no reassuring message to give , and could only affect a confidence which she was far from feeling .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 33]: `` Well , dear , they are off , but it is not good-bye -- only _ au revoir _ , as you are sure to meet again in town before long .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 11]: Mr Elgood asked permission to call upon me in town .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 4]: Nice little man !
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 9]: He has been so wonderfully kind and considerate .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 16]: I ca n't think why he should trouble himself so much for a complete stranger .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 8]: The tall one looked sorry to go !
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 8]: He kept looking up at your window .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 10]: He has a fine face -- strong and clever .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 8]: He must be an interesting companion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 24]: Margot did not answer ; but five minutes later she asked to have the curtain drawn , as the light hurt her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 71]: They had a somewhat red and inflamed appearance for the rest of the day ; but when Mr Vane commented on the fact , the dear , wise Edie assured him that it was a common phenomenon after illness , and laid a supply of fresh handkerchiefs on the bed -- table in such a quiet and unobtrusive fashion , that they might have grown there of their own accord .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 21]: `` Some day , '' thought Margot dismally to herself , `` some day I shall laugh over this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 25]: For the present , however , her sense of humour was strangely blunted , and the handkerchiefs were needed for a very different purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 4]: A PROUD MOMENT .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 32]: Margot 's recovery was somewhat tedious , so that it was quite three weeks after the departure of the brothers Elgood before she was strong enough to face the journey home .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 42]: In the meantime Edith remained in charge as nurse , while Mr Vane and Ron varied the monotony of life in the Glen by making short excursions of two or three days ' duration to places of interest in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 53]: Notwithstanding the unchanged position of affairs , they appeared to be on unusually good terms , a fact which would have delighted Margot if she had been in her usual health and spirits ; but she had become of late so languid and preoccupied as to appear almost unconscious of her surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 51]: Once a day she did , indeed , rouse herself sufficiently to show some interest in passing events , that is to say , when the post arrived in the morning ; but the revival was but momentary , and on each occasion was followed by a still deeper depression .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 27]: The elder sister was very tender during those days of waiting ; very tactful and patient with little outbursts of temper and unreasonable changes of mind .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 35]: She knew that it was not so much physical as mental suffering which was retarding the girl 's progress , and yearned over her with a sympathy that was almost maternal in its depth .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 49]: The little sister had proved herself such a true friend during the trials of the last few years , that she would have gone through fire and water to save her from pain ; but there are some things which even the most devoted relative can not do .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 56]: Edith could not , for instance , write to George Elgood and question him concerning his silence : could not ask how it came to pass that while his brother had written to Margot , to Ronald , even to herself , he remained silent , content to send commonplace messages through a third person .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 42]: As for Margot herself , she never mentioned the younger of the two brothers , but was always ready to talk about the elder , and seemed unaffectedly pleased at her sister 's appreciation of the kindly , genial little man .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 11]: `` But why was he so sweet to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 8]: Edith would ask , with puzzled wonderment .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 20]: `` From the moment I arrived he seemed to be on the outlook to see how he could help .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 17]: And he took an interest in Jack , and asked all about him and his affairs .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 11]: The astonishing thing is that I told him , too !
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 29]: Though he was a stranger , his interest was so _ real _ and deep that I could confide in him more easily than in many old friends .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 14]: Had you been talking about us to him , by any chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 23]: Margot turned her head on the pillow , and stared out of the window to the ridge of hills against the skyline .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 15]: Her cheeks had sunk , making the brown eyes appear pathetically large and worn .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 23]: There was a listlessness in her expression which was strangely different from the vivacious , self-confident Margot of a few weeks ago .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 10]: `` Yes , I spoke about you one day .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 12]: He liked you , because you were so fond of Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 21]: He was in love himself , and the girl died , but he loves her still , just the same .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 10]: He tries to help other girls for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 8]: He said he wanted to know you .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 25]: If it were ever in his power to help you and Jack , he would do it ; but sometimes no one can help .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 8]: It makes things worse when they try .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 11]: You might just as well give up at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 3]: `` Margot !
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 5]: What heresy , dear !
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 13]: From you , too , who are always preaching courage and perseverance !
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 14]: That 's pneumonia croaking , not the gallant little champion of the family !
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 19]: What would Ron and I have done without you this last year , I should like to know ?
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 15]: Is n't it nice to see father and the boy on such good terms ?
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 16]: I believe that also is in a great degree due to Mr Elgood 's influence .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 23]: The pater told me that he congratulated him on having such a son , and seemed to think Ron quite unusually gifted .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 14]: It is wonderful how much one man thinks of another man 's judgment !
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 36]: We have said the same thing for years past , and it has had no effect ; but when a calm , level-headed man of business drops a word , it is accepted as gospel .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 20]: You will be happy , wo n't you , darling , if Ron 's future is harmoniously arranged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 7]: `` Ron will be happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 4]: said Margot shortly .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 19]: At the moment it seemed to her as if such good fortune could never again be her own .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 27]: She must always be miserable , since George Elgood cared so little for her that he could disappear into space and leave her without a word .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 28]: Formal messages sent through another person did not count , when one recalled the tone of the voice which had said , '' _ Margot _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 13]: and blushed at the remembrance of that other word which had followed .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 41]: Sometimes , during those long days of convalescence , Margot almost came to the conclusion that what she had heard had been the effect of imagination only ; as unreal and dream-like as the other events of that fateful afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 36]: At other times , as if in contradiction of these theories , every intonation of the Editor 's voice would ring in her ears , and once again she would flush and tremble with happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 16]: At last the day arrived when the return to town need no longer be delayed .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 38]: Mr Vane was anxious to return to his work , Edith to her husband and children ; and the doctor pronounced Margot strong enough to bear the journey in the comfortable invalid carriage which had been provided .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 33]: Preparations were therefore made for an early start , and poor Elspeth made happy by such a wholesale legacy of garments as composed a very trousseau in the estimation of the Glen .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 37]: No one was bold enough to offer a gift to Mrs McNab , but when the last moment arrived Margot lifted her white face with lips slightly pursed , like a child asking for a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 32]: As on the occasion of her first appearance , a contortion of suppressed emotion passed over the dour Scotch face , and something suspiciously like moisture trembled in the cold eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 12]: `` When ye come back again , come back twa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 28]: was the enigmatical sentence with which the landlady made her adieu , and a faint colour flickered in Margot 's cheek as she pondered over its significance .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 25]: The journey home was broken by a night spent in Perth , and London was reached on the afternoon of a warm July day .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 52]: The trees in the Park looked grey with dust , the air felt close and heavy after the exhilaration of the mountain breezes to which the travellers had become accustomed ; even the house itself had a heavy , stuffy smell , despite the immaculate cleanliness of its _ regime _ .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 36]: Jack Martin was waiting to take his wife back to Oxford Terrace , the children having already preceded her , and Margot felt a sinking of loneliness at being left to Agnes 's tender mercies .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 12]: `` Dear me , child , what a wreck you look !
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 12]: Your Highland holiday has been a fine upset for us all .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 9]: What did I tell you before you started ?
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 14]: Perhaps another time you may condescend to listen to what I say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 39]: Such was the ingratiating welcome bestowed upon the weary girl on her arrival ; yet when Margot turned aside in silence , and made no response to the accompanying kiss of welcome , Agnes felt hurt and aggrieved .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 35]: From morning to night she had bustled about the house , assuring herself that everything was in apple-pie order ; arranging flowers , putting out treasures of fancy-work , providing comforts for the invalid .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 13]: `` And she never notices , nor says one word of thanks .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 7]: I ca n't understand Margot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 23]: said poor Agnes to herself for the hundredth time , as she seated herself at the head of the table for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 11]: `` Are there any letters for me , Agnes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 4]: queried Margot anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 17]: `` One or two , I believe , and a paper or something of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 8]: You can see them after dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 7]: `` I want them now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 4]: said Margot obstinately .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 33]: She pushed back her chair from the table , and walked across the room to the desk where newly - arrived letters were laid out to await the coming of their owners .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 16]: Three white envelopes lay there , and a rolled-up magazine , all addressed to herself .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 12]: She flushed expectantly as she bent to examine the different handwritings .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 40]: Two were uninterestingly familiar , belonging to faithful girl friends who had hastened to welcome her home ; the third was unmistakably a man 's hand , -- small and compact , the letters fine , and accurately formed .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 31]: A blessed intuition told Margot that her waiting was at an end , and that this was the message for which she had longed ever since her return to consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 38]: With a swift movement she slipped the envelope into her pocket , to be opened later on in the privacy of her room , and returned to the table , bearing the other communications in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 38]: `` I should have thought that after six weeks ' absence from home you might have been willing to talk to _ me _ , instead of wanting to read letters at your very first meal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 13]: said Agnes severely ; and Margot laughed in good - natured assent .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 7]: `` I wo n't open them !
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 10]: It was only curiosity to see what they were .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 13]: I 'll talk as much as you like , Aggie dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 16]: It was , all of a sudden , so easy to be amiable and unselfish !
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 38]: The nervous irritation which had made it difficult to be patient , even with dear , tactful Edie during the last weeks , had taken wing and departed with the first sight of that square white envelope .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 36]: The light came back to Margot 's eyes ; she held her head erect , the very hollows in her cheeks seemed miraculously to disappear , and to be replaced by the old dimpling smile .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 22]: Mr Vane and Ron exchanged glances of delight at the marvellous manner in which their invalid had stood the journey home .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 40]: The letters and parcel lay unnoticed on the table until the conclusion of the meal , but as Margot picked them up preparatory to carrying them upstairs to her own room , she gave a sudden start of astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 10]: `` Ron , it 's the _ Loadstar _ !
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 13]: Some one has sent me a copy of the _ Loadstar _ .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 16]: From the office , I think , for the name is printed on the cover .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 6]: Who could it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 17]: `` The Editor , of course -- as a mark of attention on your return home .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 3]: Lazy beggar !
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 57]: It was easier than writing a letter , '' laughed Ron easily , stretching out his hand as he spoke to take forcible possession , for the magazine was of more interest to himself than to Margot , and he felt that a new copy was just what was needed to occupy the hours before bedtime .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 22]: Margot made no demur , but stood watching quietly while Ron tore off the wrapper , and flattened the curled paper .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 34]: She was not in a reading mood , but the suggestion that George Elgood might have sent the magazine made it precious in her sight , and she waited anxiously for its return .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 7]: `` It 's mine , Ron .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 6]: It was sent to me !
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 8]: I want to take it upstairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 17]: `` Let me look at the index first , to see who is writing this month !
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 21]: You do n't generally care for such stiff reading ; I say , there 's a fine collection of names !
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 8]: It 's stronger than ever this month .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 35]: I do n't believe there is another paper in the world which has such splendid fellows for contribu -- '' Ron stopped short , his voice failing suddenly in the middle of the word .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 14]: His jaw dropped , and a wave of colour surged in his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 9]: `` It -- it ca n't be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 4]: he gasped incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 7]: `` It _ ca n't _ !
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 10]: There must be another man of the same name .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 11]: It ca n't possibly be meant for _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 5]: ... '' `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 4]: Let me see ?
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 7]: What are you talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 25]: cried Margot , peering eagerly over his shoulder , while Ron pointed with a trembling finger to the end of the table of contents .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 15]: Somehow the words seemed to be printed in a larger type than the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 18]: They grew larger and larger until they seemed to fill the whole page -- '' _ Solitude .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 3]: A Fragment .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 6]: By Ronald Vane _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 9]: `` Oh , Ron , it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 7]: shrieked Margot , in happy excitement .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 12]: `` It _ is _ you , and no one else !
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 20]: I _ told _ you it was beautiful when you read it to me that day in the Glen !
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 11]: Oh , when did you send it to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 3]: `` Never !
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 12]: I never so much as mentioned my verses in his hearing .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 17]: That was part of the bargain -- that we should not worry him on his holiday .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 6]: Margot , it was you !
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 11]: You are only pretending that you know nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 7]: It must be your doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 6]: `` Indeed it is n't !
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 10]: I never even spoke of you to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 54]: Margot had the grace to blush at the confession ; but by this time Ron had turned over the pages until he had come to the one on which his own words faced him in the beautiful distinct typing of the magazine , and the rapture of the moment precluded every other sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 22]: He did not hear what Margot said , so absorbed was he in re-reading the lines in their delightful new setting .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 14]: `` It _ is _ good ; but it is only a fragment .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 5]: It is n't finished .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 13]: Why was this chosen , instead of one of the others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 14]: `` I told you you would ruin it if you made it longer .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 14]: It is perfect as it is , and anything more would be padding .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 17]: It is a little gem , worthy even of a place in the _ Loadstar _ .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 6]: Father , do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 4]: Do you understand ?
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 12]: Look at your son 's name among all those great men !
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 5]: Are n't you glad ?
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 7]: Are n't you _ proud _ !
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 12]: Are n't you going to congratulate us _ both _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 30]: Mr Vane growled a little , for the sake of appearances ; but though his eyebrows frowned , the corners of his lips relaxed in a manner distinctly complacent .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 35]: Even recognising as he did the herald of defeat , it was impossible to resist a thrill of pride as his eye glanced down the imposing list of names held open for his inspection .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 42]: A great scientist ; a great statesman ; a leading author ; an astronomer known throughout the world ; a soldier veteran , and near the end that other name , so dearly familiar -- the name of his own son !
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 11]: The voice in which he spoke was gruff with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 3]: `` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 9]: You are in good company , at least .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 7]: Let me see the verses themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 20]: There must be something in them , I suppose , but I am no judge of these things . ''
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 5]: `` IN CORN . ''
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 47]: Meantime Margot had returned to the far end of the room , and adroitly slipped the third letter out of her pocket , feeling that it would be selfish to delay reading the contents , as they must certainly cast some light upon the present situation .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 59]: Her heart sank a little as she recognised that the attention was less personal than she had imagined , but even so , it was to herself that the magazine had been directed , and that was an evidence of the fact that in publishing the poem her pleasure had been considered even more than Ronald 's advancement .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 68]: She tore open the stiff white envelope and read as follows : -- `` Dear Miss Vane , -- `` I hear that you are to arrive home this afternoon , and intend to take the liberty of calling upon you after dinner , in the hope that you may be able to give me a few minutes of uninterrupted conversation on a subject of great importance .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 58]: If you are too much fatigued after your journey , pray have no scruples in refusing me admission , in which case I shall take an early opportunity of calling again ; but after the strain of the past few weeks I do not find myself able to wait longer than is absolutely necessary for an interview .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 10]: `` Yours faithfully , -- `` George Elgood . ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 6]: `` Is that from Elgood ?
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 5]: What does he say ?
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 5]: What does he say ?
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 8]: Let us see what he says ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 19]: petitioned Ron eagerly ; but Margot returned the letter to her pocket , resolutely ignoring his outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 12]: `` He gives no explanation , but he is coming to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 30]: Coming to call after dinner , and he asks me to see him alone , so I 'll find out all about it , and tell you afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 4]: `` Alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 15]: Ron 's face was eloquent with surprise , disappointment , and a dawning suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 4]: `` Why alone ?
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 8]: It 's more my affair than yours .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 11]: I _ must _ thank him before he goes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 9]: `` I 'll send for you , then .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 10]: I suppose he wants to explain to me first .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 10]: I 'll be sure to send for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 11]: reiterated Margot hurriedly , as she disappeared through the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 57]: Her first impulse was , girl-like , to make for her own room , to give those final touches to hair and dress , which are so all-important in effect , and that done , to sit alone , listening for the expected knock at the door , the sound of footsteps ascending to the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 6]: To meet George Elgood here !
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 32]: To see his tall dark figure outlined against the familiar background of home , -- Margot gasped at the thought , and felt her heart leap painfully at every fresh sound .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 64]: The postman , the parcels delivery , a van from the Stores , had all claimed the tribute of a blush , a gasp , and a fresh rush to the glass , before at last slow footsteps were heard mounting the stairs , and Mary 's voice at the door announced , `` A gentleman to see you , Miss Margot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 21]: and in another minute , as it seemed , she was facing George Elgood across the length of the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 32]: The roles of invalid and anxious inquirer seemed for the moment to be reversed , for while she was pink and smiling , he was grave and of a ghastly pallor .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 23]: Nervous also ; for the first words of greeting were an unintelligible murmur , and they seated themselves in an embarrassed silence .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 11]: `` You -- er -- you received my letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 16]: Margot gazed at the tips of her dainty slippers , and smiled softly to herself .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 25]: In the interval which had passed since they last met , the Editor had evidently suffered a relapse into his old shyness and reserve .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 26]: She had guessed as much from the somewhat stilted phraseology of his letter , and was prepared to reassure him by her own outspoken gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 9]: `` Yes ; I was so pleased ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 18]: He gave a little start of astonishment , and stared at her with bright , incredulous eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 3]: `` Pleased ?
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 4]: You mean it ?
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 15]: You did not think it a liberty -- '' `` Indeed I did not .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 17]: I guessed what you had to tell me , and it made me so happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 11]: He leaned forward impetuously , the blood flushing his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 6]: `` You had guessed before ?
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 7]: You knew it was coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 14]: `` Not exactly , but I hoped -- '' '' _ Hoped _ !
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 13]: -- Margot , is it possible that you have cared , too ?
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 8]: It seems too wonderful to be true .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 9]: -- I never dreamt of such amazing happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 17]: At the best it seemed possible that you would be willing to give me a hearing .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 70]: I did not dare to write , but this time of waiting has seemed as if it would never end ... '' As he began to speak Margot faced him with candid eyes , but at the sound of his voice , and at sight of the answering flash of his eyes , her lids quivered and fell , and she shrank back against the cushions of her chair .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 20]: Astonishment overwhelmed her ; but the relief , the thankfulness , the rapture of the moment obliterated everything else .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 24]: She gave a strangled sob of emotion and said faintly -- `` It -- it has seemed long to me , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 24]: At that he was on his knees before her , clasping her hands and gazing at her with an expression of rapturous relief .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 16]: `` Oh , Margot , my darling , was it because I was not there ?
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 5]: Have you missed me ?
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 27]: Not as I have missed you -- that is not possible , but enough to remember me sometimes , and to be glad to meet again .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 11]: Have you thought of me at all , Margot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 11]: `` I -- I have thought of nothing else ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 3]: sighed Margot .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 34]: She was generous with her assurance , knowing the nature of the man with whom she had to deal , and her reward was the sight of the illumined face turned upon her .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 38]: There , in a corner of a modern drawing-room , with a glimpse of a London street between the curtain folds , Margot and George Elgood found the Eden which is discovered afresh by all true lovers .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 19]: Such moments are too sacred for intrusion ; they live enshrined in memory until the end of life .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 36]: It was not until a considerable time had flown by that Margot recalled the events of the earlier evening , and with them still another claim held by her lover upon her gratitude and devotion .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 56]: Drawing back , so as to lift her charming face to his -- a rosy , sparkling face , unrecognisable as the same white and weary visage of a few hours back , she laid her hand on his , and said sweetly -- `` We went off at a tangent , did n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 25]: I do n't know how we went off , and forgot the real business of the evening ; but I never finished thanking you !
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 8]: You must think me terribly ungrateful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 10]: George Elgood regarded her with puzzled , adoring eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 19]: `` I have n't the least idea what you are talking about , but what does it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 20]: What does anything matter , except that we love each other , and are the happiest creatures on earth ?
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 4]: Business , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 10]: Why need we trouble ourselves to talk about business ?
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 17]: Margot , do you know that you have a dimple in the middle of your cheek ?
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 9]: The most beautiful dimple in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 28]: Margot shook her head at him with a pretence of disapproval , smiling the while , so as to show off the dimple to the best advantage .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 8]: `` You must n't make me conceited .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 22]: I am vain enough already to know that you love me , and have taken so much trouble to please me .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 9]: It _ was _ kind of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 7]: `` What was kind , sweetheart ?
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 8]: There is no kindness in loving you .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 17]: I had no choice in the matter , for I simply could not help myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 10]: `` Ah , but you know what I mean !
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 9]: You have given me my two greatest desires !
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 15]: I ca n't tell you how happy I was when I saw it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 12]: He stared at her for a moment , then smiled complacently .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 8]: `` You mean -- my note ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 10]: `` No , I did n't mean your note .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 4]: Not this time .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 6]: I meant the magazine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 4]: `` Magazine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 16]: The accent of bewilderment was unmistakably genuine , and Margot hastened to explain still further .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 17]: `` The new number of the _ Loadstar _ with Ron 's poem in it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 6]: `` Ron 's poem ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 12]: The note of bewilderment was accentuated to one of positive incredulity .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 12]: `` A poem by your brother in the _ Loadstar _ !
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 11]: I did not know that he wrote at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 11]: Now it was Margot 's turn to stare and frown .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 6]: `` You did n't know !
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 8]: But you _ must _ have known .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 7]: How else could it get in ?
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 7]: You must have given permission . ''
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 20]: `` My sweetheart , what have I to do with the _ Loadstar _ , or any other magazine ?
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 10]: What has my permission to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 6]: `` Everything in the world !
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 9]: Oh , I know exactly what has happened .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 28]: Your brother has told you about Ron , and showed you his verses , and you put them in for his sake -- _ and mine _ !
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 23]: Because you knew I should be pleased , and because they are good too , and you were glad to help him .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 11]: He is longing to come in to thank you himself .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 10]: We shall both thank you all our lives ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 12]: George Elgood 's face of stupefaction was a sight to behold .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 17]: His forehead was corrugated with lines of bewilderment ; he stared at her in blankest dismay .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 11]: `` What _ are _ you talking about , sweetheart ?
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 6]: What does it all mean ?
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 16]: Your brother has no need to thank me for any success which he has gained .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 32]: I should have been only too delighted to help him in any way that was in my power , but I have no influence with the _ Loadstar Magazine _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 4]: `` No influence !
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 11]: How can that be when you are the Editor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 9]: `` I am the _ What _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 3]: `` Editor !
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 5]: You have every influence .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 8]: You _ are _ the magazine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 13]: George Elgood rose to his feet with a gesture of strongest astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 8]: `` I the Editor of a magazine !
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 11]: My dearest little girl , what are you dreaming about ?
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 11]: There never was a man less suited to the position .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 13]: I know nothing whatever of magazines -- of any sort of literature .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 6]: I am in corn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 4]: A corn merchant !
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 5]: Margot 's brain reeled .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 27]: She lay back in her chair , staring at him with wide , stunned eyes , too utterly prostrated by surprise to be capable of speech !
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 6]: AN INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 19]: Could it be believed that it was the _ Chieftain _ who was the Editor , after all !
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 11]: That short , fat , undignified , commonplace little man !
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 34]: `` Not in the least the type , '' -- so Ron had pronounced , in his youthful arrogance , `` No one would ever suspect _ you _ of being literary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 9]: so saucy Margot had declared to his face .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 26]: She blushed at the remembrance of the words , blushed afresh , as , one after another , a dozen memories rushed through her brain .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 34]: That afternoon by the tarn , for example , when she had summoned courage to confess her scheme , and he had lain prone on the grass , helpless and shaken with laughter !
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 7]: No wonder that he had laughed !
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 35]: but oh , the wickedness , the duplicity of the wretch , to breathe no word of her mistake , but promptly set to work to weave a fresh plot on his own account !
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 47]: This was the reason why he had extracted a promise that George was not to be told of Ron 's ambition during his holiday , feigning an anxiety for his brother 's peace of mind , which he was in reality doing his best to destroy !
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 13]: This was the explanation of everything that had seemed mysterious and contradictory .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 16]: He had been laughing in his sleeve all the time he had pretended to help !
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 23]: George Elgood listened with a mingling of amaze , amusement , and tenderness to the hidden history of the weeks at Glenaire .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 31]: Being in the frame of mind when everything that Margot did seemed perfect in his eyes , he felt nothing but admiration for her efforts on her brother 's behalf .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 28]: It was an ingenious , unselfish little scheme , and the manner in which she had laid it bare to the person most concerned was delightfully unsophisticated .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 70]: He laughed at her tenderly , stroking her soft , pretty hair with his big man 's hand , the while he explained that he was a business man pure and simple , and had made no excursions whatever into literature ; that the `` writing '' with which he had been occupied was connected with proposed changes in his firm , and a report of a technical character .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 41]: Margot flamed with indignation , but before the angry words had time to form themselves on her lips , the thought occurred that after all the help vouchsafed to her had been no pretence , but a very substantial reality .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 46]: Ron 's foot _ had _ been placed on the first rung of the ladder , while as for herself , what greater good could she have found to desire than that which , through the Chieftain 's machinations , had already come to pass ?
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 29]: She lifted her face to meet the anxious , adoring gaze bent upon her , and cried hurriedly -- `` He -- he meant it all the time !
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 9]: He _ meant _ it to happen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 8]: `` Meant what , darling ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 5]: _ This _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 16]: Margot waved her hand with a gesture sufficiently expressive , whereat her lover laughed happily .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 4]: `` Bless him !
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 5]: of course he did .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 37]: He has been badgering me for years past to look out for a wife ; and when we met you he was clever enough to realise that you were the one woman to fill the post .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 47]: If he had said as much to me at that stage of affairs , I should have packed up and made off within the hour ; if he had said it to you , you would have felt it incumbent upon you to do the same .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 25]: Instead , he let you go on in your illusion , while he designed the means of throwing us into each other 's society .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 4]: Good old Geoff !
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 9]: I 'm not at all angry with him .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 4]: Are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 13]: Margot considered the point , her head tilted to a thoughtful angle .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 8]: `` I 'm -- not -- sure !
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 18]: I think I am , just a little bit , for I hate to be taken in .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 10]: He was laughing at me all the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 12]: `` But after all , he has done what you wished !
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 26]: I envy him for being able to give you such pleasure ; but perhaps I may be able to do as much in another way .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 28]: Geoff tells me that Mr Martin has had financial troubles , and there is nothing I would not do to help any one who belongs to you .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 33]: I 'm out of my depths in poetry , but in business matters I can count , and in this case I shall not be satisfied until I _ do _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 8]: Margot drew a long breath of contentment .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 21]: `` Oh , if Jack is happy , and Ron is successful , and I have -- _ You _ !
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 14]: -- there will be nothing left to wish for in all the world .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 3]: Poor Ron !
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 28]: he is waiting eagerly to come in to thank you for publishing his verse , and wondering why in the world you wanted to see me alone .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 21]: Do n't you think you ought just to read it , to be able to say it is nice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 7]: `` No , I do n't !
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 47]: You are all the poetry I can attend to to-night , and for goodness ' sake keep him away ; I shall have to interview your father later on , but after waiting all these weeks I must have you to myself a little longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 10]: `` Oh , I wo n't send for him .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 20]: I do n't want him a bit , '' cried Margot naively , `` but he will come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 4]: And he did !
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 35]: Waiting downstairs in the study , an hour seemed an absurd length of time , and when no summons came Ron determined to take the law in his own hands and join the conference .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 28]: The tableau which was revealed to him on opening the drawing-room door struck him dumb with amazement , and the explanations which ensued appeared still more extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 21]: George Elgood speedily beat a retreat to the study , where Mr Vane listened to his request with quiet resignation .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 45]: Elderly , grey-haired fathers have a way of seeing more than their children suspect , and Margot 's father had recognised certain well-known signs in the manner in which he had been questioned concerning his daughter 's progress during those anxious days at Glenaire .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 72]: His heart sank as he listened to the lover 's protestations , but he told himself that he ought to be thankful to know that his little Margot had chosen a man of unblemished character , who was of an age to appreciate his responsibility , possessed an income sufficient to keep her in comfort , and , last but not least , a home within easy distance of his own .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 46]: Late that evening , when her lover had taken his departure , Margot stole down to the study and sat silently for a time on her old perch on the arm of her father 's chair , with her head resting lovingly against his own .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 47]: He was thankful to feel her dear presence , and to know that she wished to be near him on this night of all others , but his heart was too full to speak , and it was she who at last spoke the first words .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 25]: `` I never knew , '' she said softly , `` I never knew that it was possible to be as happy as this .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 5]: It 's so wonderful !
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 7]: One ca n't realise it all .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 10]: Father dear , I 've been thinking of you !
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 19]: ... I never realised before what it meant to you when mother died -- all that you lost !
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 23]: You have been good , and brave , and unselfish , dear , and we must have tried you sorely many times .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 23]: We did n't understand , but I understand a little bit now , daddy , and it makes me love you more .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 25]: You 'll remember , wo n't you , that this is going to draw us closer together , not separate us one little bit ?
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 10]: You 'll be _ sure _ to remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 7]: `` Bless you , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 11]: he said , and stroked her hand with tender fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 13]: `` It is sweet to hear you say so , at least .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 58]: I 'm glad you are going to be happy , and if I am to give you away at all , I am glad it is to a strong , sensible man whom I can trust and respect ; but it will be a sad day for me when you leave the old home , Margot . ''
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 8]: Margot purred over him with tenderest affection .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 9]: `` How I wish Agnes would marry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 12]: `` What has that to do with it , pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 11]: `` Then you could live with me , of course !
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 46]: I should love it , '' said Margot warmly ; and though her father had no intention of accepting such an invitation , it remained through life a solace to him to remember that it had been in the girl 's heart to wish it .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 26]: Next morning at twelve o'clock a daintily attired damsel ascended a dusty staircase in Fleet Street and desired to see the Editor in his den .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 37]: The dragon who guarded the fastness inquired of her if she had an appointment , and , unsoftened by the charm of her appearance , volunteered the information that Mr Elgood would see no stray callers .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 9]: `` He will see _ me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 40]: returned Margot arrogantly ; and she was right , for , to the surprise of the messenger , the sight of the little printed card was followed by an order to `` Show the lady in at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 49]: A moment later Margot made her first entrance into an Editor 's den , and round the corner of a big desk caught a glimpse of a decorous , black - coated figure whom at first sight it was difficult to associate with the light-hearted Chieftain of Glenaire .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 26]: As they confronted each other , however , the round face twinkled into a smile , which served as fuel to the girl 's indignation .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 33]: She stopped short , ostentatiously disregarding the outstretched hand , drew her brows together , and proclaimed haughtily -- `` I have come to let you know that you are found out .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 7]: I know all about it now .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 11]: You have been laughing at me all the time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 8]: `` Well , -- very nearly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 4]: he assented smilingly .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 23]: `` You are such a nice little girl to laugh at , you see , and it was an uncommonly good joke !
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 29]: Do you remember the day when you confided to me solemnly that you had journeyed to Scotland on purpose to stalk me , and run me to earth ?
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 23]: You 'd have been a bit embarrassed if I 'd told you the truth then and there , would n't you now ?
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 15]: And besides -- I see quite enough of literary aspirants all the year round .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 14]: It was a bit hard to be hunted down on one 's holidays .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 14]: I felt bound to prevaricate , for the sake of my own peace .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 6]: Then again there was George !
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 7]: Where would George have come in ?
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 29]: If I had confessed my identity , should I have been kept awake , as I was last night , listening to his rhapsodies by the hour together ?
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 12]: By the way , we are going to be near relatives .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 9]: Do n't you want to shake hands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 8]: `` I 'm very angry indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 19]: maintained Margot stubbornly -- nevertheless her hand was in his , and her fingers involuntarily returned his pressure .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 8]: `` Are you -- _ glad _ !
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 8]: Do you think I shall -- do ?
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 9]: Does he seem _ really _ happy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 7]: `` Ah , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 40]: he sighed , and over the plump features there passed once more the expression of infinite longing which Margot had seen once before , when , in a moment of confidence , he had spoken of his dead love .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 11]: `` Ah , my dear , how happy he is !
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 9]: There is no word to express such happiness !
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 25]: George has not frittered away his affections on a number of silly flirtations -- his heart is whole , and it is wholly yours .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 11]: Do you owe me no thanks for bringing you together ?
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 27]: You wanted to help your brother ; I wanted to help mine ; so we are equally guilty or praiseworthy , as the case may be .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 12]: For myself I am very well satisfied with the result ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 9]: Margot blushed , and cast down her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 8]: `` I 'm satisfied , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 4]: she said shyly .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 11]: `` Much more than satisfied -- and Ron is enraptured .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 5]: Have you seen him ?
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 14]: He said he was coming to see you first thing this morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 8]: `` Have I seen him , indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 6]: I should think I had !
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 11]: I thought I should never get rid of the boy .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 23]: I told him straight that the magazine comes first to me , and that not even a prospective sister-in-law -- with dimples !
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 17]: -- could induce me to accept a line for publication otherwise than on its own merits .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 6]: But the boy has power .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 17]: I ca n't tell yet how far it may go , but it 's worth encouraging .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 32]: When he gave me his manuscript book to read I was struck by one fragment , and wrote it out in shorthand , to publish as a surprise to you both .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 21]: I like the lad , and will be glad to help him so far as it is in my power .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 30]: I can give him a small post in this office , where at least he will be in the atmosphere ; but after that his future rests with himself .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 31]: What he writes that is worth publishing , I will publish , but it will be judged on its merits alone , and without any remembrance of his private associations .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 7]: He will have his chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 24]: He put out his hands and held her gently by the elbows , smiling at her the while with the kindliest of smiles .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 9]: `` Now are you satisfied , little girl ?
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 30]: From the moment that you looked at me with _ her _ eyes , and asked my help , I have had no better wish than to give it .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 21]: I did not set about it quite in your own way , perhaps , but the end is the same .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 26]: Do n't trouble any more about the lad , but let me smooth the way with your father , while you devote yourself to George .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 7]: His happiness is in your hands .
