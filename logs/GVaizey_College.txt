Parsing [sent. 1 len. 28]: A College Girl By Mrs George de Horne Vaizey Here is a book about the young girl and her awakening to the world by this talented author .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 23]: Darsie , the heroine , is selected by an old aunt to come and spend a year or so as her companion .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 14]: The old woman tries to coach Darsie in matters of deportment and behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 42]: This would be pretty odious if it were not for the presence locally of a young family of boys and girls of Darsie 's age , whom , being rich and living rather grandly , the aunt allows Darsie to know .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 12]: The first half of the book describes the times they had .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 31]: The old aunt promises Darsie that she will make available the funds needed for Darsie to go up to Cambridge as a student at Newnham , a girls ' college .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 32]: When the second half of the book begins the old aunt has just died , and Darsie feels glad that the poor old lady will be relieved of all her pains .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 21]: The years of studentship are well described , and the friends that Darsie made come and go through the story .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 7]: Finally we reach the last exams .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 13]: Darsie does quite well , but is not in the First Class .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 24]: She has a Second , which will be enough for her to be able to go and teach at some less distinguished school .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 39]: But her friend Dan , one of those whom we met in the first half of the book , has obtained a First Class Honours degree , and the book ends with him asking her to marry him .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 44]: What he does n't know , and I suppose the author did n't either , is that young men going to teach at a top-rate boys ' school are expected to spend their spare time coaching sports , and not to be married .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 22]: In fact they would be better to have achieved a `` Blue '' at Oxford or Cambridge than a good degree .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 23]: I have had to make a slightly strange and annoying change to the name of one of the girls in the story .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 8]: I changed Vi Vernon to Vie Vernon .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 18]: The reason was that otherwise the speech generator always read her name as `` Six Vernon '' .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 22]: What we have now sounds correct , but if you read the book you will see this mis-spelling two dozen times .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 15]: My apologies for doing this , but you will understand why I did it .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 25]: It is a good read , and as always I recommend making an audiobook of it , so that you can listen to it .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 13]: NH A COLLEGE GIRL BY MRS GEORGE DE HORNE VAIZEY CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 4]: BOYS AND GIRLS .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 37]: This is the tale of two terraces , of two families who lived therein , of several boys and many girls , and especially of one Darsie , her education , adventures , and ultimate romance .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 41]: Darsie was the second daughter in a family of six , and by reason of her upsetting nature had won for herself that privilege of priority which by all approved traditions should have belonged to Clemence , the elder sister .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 32]: Clemence was serene and blonde ; in virtue of her seventeen years her pigtail was now worn doubled up , and her skirts had reached the discreet level of her ankles .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 54]: She had a soft pink and white face , and a pretty red mouth , the lips of which permanently fell apart , disclosing two small white teeth in the centre of the upper gum , because of which peculiarity her affectionate family had bestowed upon her the nickname of `` Bunnie . ''
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 12]: Perhaps the cognomen had something to do with her subordinate position .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 40]: It was impossible to imagine any one with the name of `` Bunnie '' queening it over that will-o ' - the-wisp , that electric flash , that tantalising , audacious creature who is the heroine of these pages .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 4]: Darsie at fifteen !
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 17]: How shall one describe her to the unfortunates who have never beheld her in the flesh ?
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 32]: It is for most girls an awkward age , an age of angles , of ungainly bulk , of awkward ways , self-conscious speech , crass ignorance , and sublime conceit .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 63]: Clemence had passed through this stage with much suffering of spirits on her own part and that of her relations ; Lavender , the third daughter , showed at thirteen preliminary symptoms of appalling violence ; but Darsie remained as ever that fascinating combination of a child and a woman of the world , which had been her characteristic from earliest youth .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 28]: Always graceful and alert , she sailed triumphant through the trying years , with straight back , graceful gait , and eyes a-shine with a happy self-confidence .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 6]: `` I am here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 9]: announced Darsie 's eyes to an admiring world .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 8]: `` Let the band strike up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 38]: Some inherent quality in Darsie -- some grace , some charm , some spell -- which she wove over the eyes of beholders , caused them to credit her with a beauty which she did not possess .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 36]: Even her family shared in this delusion , and set her up as the superlative in degree , so that `` as pretty as Darsie '' had come to be regarded a climax of praise .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 53]: The glint of her chestnut hair , the wide , bright eyes , the little oval face set on a long , slim throat smote the onlooker with instant delight , and so blinded him that he had no sight left with which to behold the blemishes which walked hand in hand .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 35]: Photographs valiantly strove to demonstrate the truth ; pointed out with cruel truth the stretching mouth , the small , inadequate nose , but even the testimony of sunlight could not convince the blind .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 11]: They sniffed , and said : `` What a travesty !
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 8]: Never again to _ that _ photographer !
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 24]: Next time we 'll try the man in C -- Street , '' and Darsie 's beauty lived on , an uncontroverted legend .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 31]: By a triumph of bad management , which the Garnett girls never ceased to deplore , their three brothers came at the end instead of the beginning of the family .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 66]: Three grown-up brothers would have been a grand asset ; big boys who would have shown a manly tenderness towards the weaknesses of little sisters ; who would have helped and amused ; big boys going to school , young men going to college , coming home in the vacations , bringing their friends , acting as squires and escorts to the girls at home .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 37]: Later on brothers at business , wealthy brothers , generous brothers ; brothers who understood how _ long _ quarter-day was in coming round , and how astonishingly quickly a girl 's allowance vanishes into space !
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 56]: Clemence , Darsie , and Lavender had read of such brothers in books , and would have gladly welcomed their good offices in the flesh , but three noisy , quarrelsome , more or less grimy schoolboys , superbly indifferent to `` those girls '' -- this was another , and a very different tale !
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 34]: Harry was twelve -- a fair , blunt-featured lad with a yawning cavity in the front of his mouth , the result of one of the many accidents which had punctuated his life .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 34]: On the top story of the Garnett house there ran a narrow passage , halfway along which , for want of a better site , a swing depended from two great iron hooks .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 43]: Harry , as champion swinger , ever striving after fresh flights , had one day in a frenzy of enthusiasm swung the rings free from their hold , and descended , swing and all , in a crash on the oil-clothed floor .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 46]: The crash , the shrieks of the victim and his attendant sprites , smote upon Mrs Garnett 's ears as she sat wrestling with the `` stocking basket '' in a room below , and as she credibly avowed , took years from her life .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 40]: Almost the first objects which met her eye , when , in one bound , as it seemed , she reached the scene of the disaster , was a selection of small white teeth scattered over the oil-clothed floor .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 35]: Henceforth for years Harry pursued his way minus front teeth , and the nursery legend darkly hinted that so injured had been the gums by his fall that no second supply could be expected .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 12]: Harry avowed a sincere aspiration that this should be the case .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 59]: `` I can eat as much without them , '' he declared , `` and when I grow up I 'll have them false , and be an explorer , and scare savages like the man in Rider Haggard , '' so that teeth , or no teeth , would appear to hold the secret of his destiny .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 7]: Russell had adenoids , and snored .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 38]: His peculiarities included a faculty for breaking his bones , at frequent and inconvenient occasions , an insatiable curiosity about matters with which he had no concern , and a most engaging and delusive silkiness of manner .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 45]: `` Gentleman Russell , '' a title bestowed by his elders , had an irritating effect on an elder brother conscious of being condemned by the contrast , and when quoted downstairs brought an unfailing echo of thumps in the seclusion of the playroom .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 82]: Tim played on his privileges as `` littlest , '' and his mother 's barely concealed partiality , and was as irritating to his elders as a small person can be , who is always present when he is not wanted , absent when he is , in peace adopts the airs of a conqueror , and in warfare promptly cries , and collapses into a curly-headed baby boy , whom the authorities declare it is `` cr-uel '' to bully !
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 37]: For the rest , the house was of the high and narrow order common to town terraces , inconveniently crowded by its many inmates , and viewed from without , of a dark and grimy appearance .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 54]: Sandon Terrace had no boast to make either from an architectural or a luxurious point of view , and was so obviously inferior to its neighbour , Napier Terrace , that it was lacerating to the Garnett pride to feel that their sworn friends the Vernons were so much better domiciled than themselves .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 39]: Napier Terrace had a strip of garden between itself and the rough outer world ; big gateways stood at either end , and what Vie Vernon grandiloquently spoke of as `` a carriage sweep '' curved broadly between .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 63]: Divided accurately among the houses in the terrace , the space of ground apportioned to each was limited to a few square yards , but the Vernons were chronically superior on the subject of `` the grounds , '' and in springtime when three hawthorns , a lilac , and one spindly laburnum-tree struggled into bloom , their airs were beyond endurance .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 47]: The Vernons had also a second claim to superiority over the Garnetts , inasmuch as they were the proud possessors of an elder brother , a remote and learned person who gained scholarships , and was going to be Prime Minister when he was grown up .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 25]: Dan at eighteen , coaching with a tutor preparatory to going up to Cambridge , was removed by continents of superiority from day-school juniors .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 29]: Occasionally in their disguise of the deadly jealousy which in truth consumed them , the Garnett family endeavoured to make light of the personality of this envied person .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 7]: To begin with , his name !
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 7]: `` Dan '' was well enough .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 40]: `` Dan '' sounded a boy-like boy , a manly man ; of a `` Dan '' much might be expected in the way of sport and mischief , but -- oh , my goodness -- _ Daniel _ !
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 10]: The Garnetts discussed the cognomen over the play-room fire .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 15]: `` It must be so _ embarrassing _ to have a Bible name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 3]: Lavender opined .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 5]: `` Think of church !
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 24]: When they read about me I should be covered with confusion , and imagine that every one was staring at our pew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 6]: Clemence stared thoughtfully into space .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 17]: `` I , Clemence , take thee Daniel , '' she recited slowly , and shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 10]: `` No -- really , I could n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 8]: `` He would n't have you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 44]: the three boys piped ; even Tim , who plainly was talking of matters he could not understand , added his note to the chorus , but Darsie cocked her little head , and added eagerly -- `` Could n't you , really ?
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 11]: What _ could _ you , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 9]: Clemence stared again , more rapt than ever .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 13]: `` Lancelot , perhaps , '' she opined , `` or Sigismund .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 14]: Everard 's nice too , or Ronald or Guy -- '' `` Bah !
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 2]: Sugary .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 6]: _ I _ could n't !
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 16]: Daniel is _ ugly _ , '' Darsie admitted , `` but it 's strong .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 33]: Dan Vernon will fight lions like the Bible one ; they 'll roar about him , and his enemies will cast him in , but they 'll not manage to kill him .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 19]: He 'll trample them under foot , and leave them behind , like milestones on the road . ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 35]: Darsie was nothing if not inaccurate , but in the bosom of one 's own family romantic flights are not allowed to atone for discrepancies , and the elder sister was quick to correct .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 8]: `` Daniel did n't fight the lions !
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 18]: What 's the use of being high falutin ' and making similes that are n't correct ? ''
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 12]: `` Dear Clemence , you _ are _ so literal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 32]: Darsie tilted her head with an air of superiority which reduced the elder to silence , the while she cogitated painfully why such a charge should be cast as a reproach .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 8]: To be literal was to be correct .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 9]: Daniel had _ not _ fought the lions !
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 22]: Darsie had muddled up the fact in her usual scatterbrain fashion , and by good right should have deplored her error .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 35]: Darsie , however , was seldom known to do anything so dull ; she preferred by a nimble change of front to put others in the wrong , and keep the honours to herself .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 18]: Now , after a momentary pause , she skimmed lightly on to another phase of the subject .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 45]: `` What should you say was the character and life history of a woman who could call her eldest child ` Daniel , ' the second ` Viola Imogen , ' and the third and fourth ` Hannah ' and ` John ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 8]: Clemence had no inspiration on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 10]: She said : `` Do n't be silly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 14]: sharply , and left it to Lavender to supply the necessary stimulus . ''
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 10]: _ Tell _ us , Darsie , tell us !
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 18]: You make it up -- '' `` My dear , it is evident to the meanest intellect .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 76]: She was the child of a simple country household , who , on her marriage , went to live in a town ; and when her first-born son was born , she pined to have him christened by her father 's name in the grey old church beneath the ivy tower ; so they travelled there , and the white-haired sire held the infant at the font , while the tears furrowed his aged cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 86]: _ But _ -- by slow degrees the insidious effects of the great capital invaded the mind of the sweet young wife , and the simple tastes of her girlhood turned to vanity , so that when the second babe was born , and her husband wished to call her Hannah after her sainted grandmother , she wept , and made an awful fuss , and would not be consoled until he gave in to Viola Imogen , and a christening cloak trimmed with plush .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 41]: And she was christened in a city church , and the organ pealed , and the godmothers wore rich array , and the poor old father stayed at home and had a slice of christening cake sent by the post .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 6]: But the years passed on .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 42]: Saddened and sobered by the discipline of life , aged and worn , her thoughts turned once more to her quiet youth , and when at last a third child -- '' `` There 's only two years between them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 44]: Darsie frowned , but continued her narrative in a heightened voice -- '' -- Was laid in her arms , and her husband suggested ` Ermyntrude ' ; she shuddered , and murmured softly , ` Hannah -- _ plain _ Hannah ! '
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 10]: and plain Hannah she has been ever since ! ''
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 39]: A splutter of laughter greeted this _ denouement _ , for in truth Hannah Vernon was not distinguished for her beauty , being one of the plainest , and at the same time the most good-natured of girls .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 8]: Lavender cried eagerly -- `` Go on !
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 30]: Make up some more , '' but Clemence from the dignity of seventeen years felt bound to protest -- `` I do n't think you -- _ ought _ !
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 6]: It 's not your business .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 13]: Mrs Vernon 's a friend , and she would n't be pleased .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 16]: To talk behind her back -- '' `` All right , '' agreed Darsie swiftly .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 7]: `` Let 's crack nuts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 6]: Positively she left one breathless !
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 65]: One moment poised on imaginary flights , weaving stories from the baldest materials , drawing allegories of the lives of her friends , the next -- an irresponsible wisp , with no thought in the world but the moment 's frolic ; but whatever might be the fancy of the moment she drew her companions after her with the magnetism of a born leader .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 52]: In the twinkling of an eye the scene was changed , the Vernons with their peculiarities were consigned to the limbo of forgotten things , while boys and girls squatted on the rug scrambling for nuts out of a paper bag , and cracking them with their teeth with monkey-like agility .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 10]: `` How many can you crack at a time ?
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 10]: Bet you I can crack more than you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 4]: cried Darsie loudly .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 4]: THE TELEGRAPH STATION .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 24]: The Garnetts ' house stood at the corner of Sandon Terrace , and possessed at once the advantages and drawbacks of its position .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 27]: The advantages were represented by three bay windows , belonging severally to the drawing-room , mother 's bedroom , and the play-room on the third floor .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 31]: The bay windows at either end of the Terrace bestowed an architectural finish to its flattened length , and from within allowed of extended views up and down the street .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 38]: The drawback lay in the position of the front door , which stood round the corner in a side street , on which abutted the gardens of the houses of its more aristocratic neighbour , Napier Terrace .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 45]: Once , in a moment of unbridled temper , Vie Vernon had alluded to the Garnett residence as being located `` at our back door , '' and though she had speedily repented , and apologised , even with tears , the sting remained .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 15]: Apart from the point of inferiority , however , the position had its charm .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 43]: From the eerie of the top landing window one could get a bird 's - eye view of the Napier Terrace gardens with their miniature grass plots , their smutty flower-beds , and the dividing walls with their clothing of blackened ivy .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 52]: Some people were ambitious , and lavished unrequited affection on struggling rose-trees in a centre bed , others contented themselves with a blaze of homely nasturtiums ; others , again , abandoned the effort after beauty , hoisted wooden poles , and on Monday mornings floated the week 's washing unashamed .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 31]: In Number Two the tenant kept pigeons ; Number Four owned a real Persian cat , who basked majestic on the top of the wall , scorning his tortoiseshell neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 38]: When the lamps were lit , it was possible also to obtain glimpses into the dining-rooms of the two end houses , if the maids were not in too great a hurry to draw down the blinds .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 32]: A newly married couple had recently come to live in the corner house -- a couple who wore evening clothes every night , and dined in incredible splendour at half-past seven .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 38]: It was thrilling to behold them seated at opposite sides of the gay little table , all a-sparkle with glass and silver , to watch course after course being handed round , the final dallying over dessert .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 30]: On one never-to-be-forgotten occasion , suddenly and without the slightest warning , bride and bridegroom had leaped from their seats and begun chasing each other wildly round the table .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 21]: She flew , he flew ; he dodged , she screamed -LRB- one could _ see _ her scream ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 11]: dodged again , and flew wildly in an opposite direction .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 29]: The chase continued for several breathless moments , then , to the desolation of the beholders , swept out of sight into the fastnesses of the front hall .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 15]: Never -- no , never -- could the bitterness of that disappointment be outlived .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 19]: To have been shut out from beholding the _ denouement _ -- it was _ too _ piteous !
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 50]: In vain Darsie expended herself on flights of imagination , in vain rendered in detail the conversation which had led up to the thrilling chase -- the provocation , the threat , the defiance -- nothing but the reality could have satisfied the thirst of curiosity of the beholders .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 5]: Would he kiss her ?
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 5]: Would he beat her ?
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 4]: Would she triumph ?
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 4]: Would she cry ?
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 9]: Was it a frolic , or a fight ?
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 29]: Would the morrow find them smiling and happy as of yore , or driving off in separate cabs to take refuge in the bosoms of their separate families ?
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 50]: Darsie opined that all would _ seem _ the same on the surface , but darkly hinted at the little rift within the lute , and somehow after that night the glamour seemed to have departed from this honeymoon pair , and the fair seeming was regarded with suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 54]: As regards the matter of distance , it took an easy two minutes to cover the space between the front doors of the two houses , and there seemed an endless number of reasons why the members of the different families should fly round to consult each other a dozen times a day .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 62]: Darsie and Lavender , Vie and plain Hannah attended the same High School ; the Garnett boys and John Vernon the same Royal Institute , but the fact that they walked to and from school together , and spent the intervening hours in the same class-rooms , by no means mitigated the necessity of meeting again during luncheon and tea hours .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 20]: In holiday times the necessity naturally increased , and bells pealed incessantly in response to tugs from youthful hands .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 11]: Then came the time of the great servants ' strike .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 17]: That bell was a perfect nuisance ; ring , ring , ring the whole day long .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 17]: Something else to do than run about to open the door for a pack of children !
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 11]: The two mistresses , thus coerced , issued a fiat .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 8]: Once a day , and no oftener !
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 30]: All arrangements for the afternoon to be made in the morning _ seance _ , the rendezvous to be _ outside _ , not _ inside _ the house .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 40]: After this came on the age of signals ; whistlings outside the windows , rattling of the railings , comes through letter-boxes and ventilation grids , even -- on occasions of special deafness -- pebbles thrown against the panes !
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 71]: A broken window , and a succession of whoops making the air hideous during the progress of an extra special tea party , evoked the displeasure of the mistresses in turns , and a second verdict went forth against signals in all forms , whereupon the Garnetts and Vernons in conclave deplored the hard-heartedness of grown-ups , and set their wits to work to evolve a fresh means of communication .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 20]: `` S'pose , '' said Russell , snoring thoughtfully , `` s ` pose we had a telegraph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 7]: `` S'pose we had an airship !
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 9]: One 's just as easy as the other .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 7]: Do n't be a juggins . ''
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 6]: But Russell snored on unperturbed .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 20]: `` I do n't mean a _ real _ telegraph , only a sort -- of _ pretend _ !
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 11]: There 's our side window , and your back windows .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 9]: If we could run a line across . ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 9]: `` A line of _ what _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 3]: `` String .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 2]: Wire .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 5]: Anything we like . ''
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 13]: `` S'pose we _ did _ fix it , what then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 5]: `` Send messages ! ''
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 4]: Russell pondered deeply .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 56]: He was the member of the family who had a natural aptitude for mechanism ; the one who mended toys , and on occasion was even consulted about mother 's sewing-machine and escapes of gas , therefore he filled the place of engineer-royal and was expected to take all structural difficulties upon his own shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 9]: He pondered , blinking his pale blue eyes .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 13]: `` Ca n't send messages in the usual way -- too difficult .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 17]: If the cord were double , we might have a bag and switch it across . ''
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 71]: the audience pricked its ears and sat alert , seeing in imagination the tiny cord swung high in space above the dividing ground , stretching from window to window , fastened securely on the sills , `` somehow , '' according to the girls , the boys critically debating the question of ways and means , strong iron hoops , for choice , clamped into the framework of the windows .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 9]: `` How would the messages be sent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 8]: `` In a bag , of course .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 31]: Put the letter in the bag ; then we 'd pull and pull , and it would work round and round , till it arrived at the opposite end . ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 56]: A stealthy exchange of glances testified to the general realisation of the fact that it would take a _ long _ time to pull , a much longer time , for instance , than to run round by the road , and deposit the missive in the letter-box , a still unforbidden means of communication .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 16]: Every one realised the fact , but every one scorned to put it into words .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 27]: What was a mere matter of time , compared with the glory and _ eclat _ of owning a real live telegraph of one 's own ?
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 27]: The first stage of the proceedings was to obtain the parental consent , and this was secured with an ease and celerity which was positively disconcerting .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 19]: When mothers said , `` Oh , yes , dears , certainly -- certainly you may try ! ''
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 40]: with a smile in their eyes , a twist on their lips , and a barely concealed incredulity oozing out of every pore , it put the youngsters on their mettle to succeed , or perish in the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 27]: The mothers obviously congratulated themselves on a project which would provide innocent amusement for holiday afternoons , while they inwardly derided the idea of permanent success .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 7]: `` We 'll show 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 4]: cried Harry darkly .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 8]: `` We 'll let 'em see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 19]: The next point was to decide on the window in each house which should act as telegraph station .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 60]: In the case of the Vernons there was obviously no alternative , for the third-floor landing window possessed qualifications far in excess of any other , but with the Garnetts two rival factions fought a wordy combat in favour of the boys ' room and the little eerie inhabited by Lavender , each of which occupied equally good sites .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 5]: `` Stick to it !
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 5]: Stick to it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 9]: were Harry 's instructions to his younger brother .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 43]: `` They ca n't put the thing up without us , so they 're bound to come round in the end , and if we 've got the telegraph station , it will give us the whip hand over them for ever .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 20]: It 's our room , and they 've jolly well got to behave if they want to come in .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 25]: If they turn rusty , we 'll lock the door , and they 'll have to be civil , or do without the telegraph .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 26]: Let 'em talk till they 're tired , and then they 'll give in , and we 'll go out and buy the cord . ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 10]: And in the end the girls succumbed as predicted .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 51]: Lavender 's pride in owning the site of the great enterprise weakened before the tragic picture drawn for her warning , in which she saw herself roused from slumber at unearthly hours of the night , leaning out of an opened window to draw a frozen cord through bleeding hands .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 30]: She decided that on the whole it would be more agreeable to lie snugly in bed and receive the messages from the boys over a warm and leisurely breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 45]: These two great points arranged , nothing now remained but the erection of the line itself , and two strong iron hoops having been fixed into the outer sills of the respective windows a fine Saturday afternoon witnessed the first struggle with the cord .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 39]: Vie Vernon and plain Hannah unrolled one heavy skein , threaded it through their own hoop , and lowered the two ends into the garden , where John stood at attention ready to throw them over the wall .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 28]: Darsie and Lavender dropped their ends straight into the street , and then chased madly downstairs to join the boys and witness the junction of the lines .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 40]: Each line being long enough in itself to accomplish the double journey , the plan was to pull the connected string into the Garnett station , cut off the superfluous length , and tie the ends taut and firm .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 16]: Nothing could have seemed easier in theory , but in practice unexpected difficulties presented themselves .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 42]: The side street was as a rule singularly free from traffic , but with the usual perversity of fate , every tradesman 's cart in the neighbourhood seemed bent on exercising its horse up and down its length this Saturday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 72]: No sooner were lines knotted together in the middle of the road than the greengrocer came prancing round the corner , and they must needs be hastily untied ; secured a second time , the milkman appeared on incredibly early rounds , reined his steed on its haunches , and scowled fiercely around ; before there was time to rally from his attack a procession of coal-carts came trundling heavily past .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 58]: By this time also the frantic efforts of the two families had attracted the attention of their enemies , a body of boys , scathingly designated `` the Cads , '' who inhabited the smaller streets around and waged an incessant war against `` the Softs , '' as they in return nicknamed their more luxurious neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 40]: The Cads rushed to the scene with hoots and howls of derision ; white - capped heads peered over bedroom blinds ; even the tortoiseshell cats stalked over the dividing walls to discover the cause of the unusual excitement .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 39]: Clemence , with the sensitiveness of seventeen years , hurried round the corner , and walked hastily in an opposite direction , striving to look as if she had no connection with the scrimmage in the side street .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 20]: Darsie read the Cads a lecture on nobility of conduct , which they received with further hoots and sneers .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 24]: Plain Hannah planked herself squarely before the scene of action with intent to act as a bulwark from the attack of the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 22]: The three boys worked with feverish energy , dreading the appearance of their parents and an edict to cease operations forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 17]: The first lull in the traffic was seized upon to secure the knots , when presto !
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 27]: the line began to move , as Russell the nimble-minded hauled vigorously from the upstairs station , whence he had been dispatched a few moments before .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 56]: The Cads yelled and booed as the first glimmering knowledge of what was on foot penetrated their brains ; they grouped together and consulted as to means of frustration ; but with every moment that passed yards of line were disappearing from view , and the skeins in the streets were rapidly diminishing in size .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 29]: Presently there was not a single coil left , and a cheer of delight burst from the onlookers as they watched the cord rise slowly off the ground .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 30]: Now with good luck and the absence of vehicles for another two minutes the deed would be done , and the Garnett-Vernon telegraph an accomplished fact ; but alas !
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 33]: at this all-important moment one line of string caught in an ivy stem at the top of a garden wall , and refused to be dislodged by tuggings and pullings from below .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 43]: The Cads raised a derisive cheer , and to add to the annoyances of the moment a cab rounded the corner , the driver of which pulled up in scandalised amaze on finding the road barricaded by two stout lines of string .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 38]: His strictures were strong and to the point , and though he finally consented to drive over the hastily lowered line , he departed shaking his whip in an ominous manner , and murmuring darkly concerning police .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 8]: `` On to the wall , John .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 2]: Quick !
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 7]: Climb up and ease it over .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 19]: If we do n't get it up in a jiffy we shall have the bobbies after us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 35]: cried Harry frantically , whereupon John doubled back into his own garden , and by perilous graspings of ivy trunks and projecting bricks scaled to the top and eased the line from its grip .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 4]: `` Right-ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 11]: he cried , lifting his face to the opposite window .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 5]: `` Pull , Russell !
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 8]: _ pull _ for your life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 14]: Russell pulled ; a second time the double thread rose in the air .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 49]: Darsie jumped with excitement ; Lavender clasped her hands , all white and tense with suspense , plain Hannah ran to and fro , emitting short , staccato croaks of delight ; Harry stood in manly calm , arms akimbo , a beam of satisfaction broadening his face .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 5]: That smile , alas !
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 11]: gave the last touch of exasperation to the watching Cads .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 35]: To stand still and behold the line vanishing into space had been in itself an ordeal , but Harry 's lordly air , his strut , his smile -- these were beyond their endurance !
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 43]: With a rallying shout of battle they plunged forward , grabbed at the ascending cord , hung for a dizzy moment suspended on its length , then with a final cheer felt it snap in twain and drag limply along the ground .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 20]: Alas for Harry and for John -- what could they do , two men alone , against a dozen ?
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 22]: The girls screamed , declaimed , vowed shrill revenge , but in the matter of practical force were worse than useless .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 11]: Even with Russell 's aid the forces were hopelessly uneven .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 50]: Harry stood looking on gloomily while the Cads , chortling with triumph , galloped down the road , trailing behind them the long lengths of cord ; then , like a true Englishman , being half-beaten , he set his teeth and vowed to conquer , or to die .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 14]: `` They think we 're sold , but they 'll find their mistake !
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 25]: We 'll get up at five on Monday morning and have the thing in working trig before they have opened their silly eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 40]: This programme being duly enacted , the telegraph stations remained for years as an outward and visible sign of the only piece of work which Harry Garnett was ever known to accomplish before the hour of his belated breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 3]: AUNT MARIA .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 38]: Among the crowd of relations near and far most families possess one relation _ par excellence _ , who stands out from all the rest by reason either of generosity , aggravatingness , or strength of character .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 41]: Sometimes this relation is an uncle ; more often it is an aunt ; almost invariably he or she is unmarried or widowed , because the single state naturally allows more time and energy for interests beyond the personal household .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 31]: The Garnetts ' relation _ par excellence _ was Aunt Maria -- _ Lady _ Maria as they erroneously called her , being unsophisticated in the niceties of the peerage .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 37]: Her rightful cognomen was Lady Hayes , and she was the elderly , very elderly , widow of an estimable gentleman who had been created a Baronet in recognition of services rendered to his political party .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 37]: The Garnetts felt that it was very stylish to possess an aunt with a title , and introduced her name with an air when the Vernons grew superior on the subject of `` the grounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 62]: Lady Hayes was an eccentric individual who inhabited a beautiful old country house in the Midlands , from which base she was given to suddenly swooping down upon her relations , choosing by preference for these visits the times when carpets had been sent away to be cleaned , or the maids granted days off to visit relations in the country .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 68]: Then Lady Hayes would appear , announce her intention of staying a couple of nights , declare her unwillingness to give the slightest trouble , and proceed to request that her maid should be accommodated with a room next to her own , and that they should both be supplied with a vegetarian diet , supplemented by glasses of sterilised milk at intervals of every two hours .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 54]: Sometimes the vegetarianism gave place to a diet of minced beef , but whatever might be the diet of the moment it was invariably something which no one else wanted to eat , and which took about three times as long to prepare as the entire rations for the household dinner of ten .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 40]: It was at the close of the Midsummer term , when the Garnett family were blissfully preparing for the yearly migration to the sea , that a letter from Aunt Maria fell like a bombshell upon the peaceful scene .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 42]: This year the holiday promised to be even more blissful than usual , for the Vernons had secured a second farmhouse , not ten minutes ' walk from their own , and connected with the sea by the same fascinating field-paths .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 6]: A farm and the sea !
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 9]: Could there possibly exist a more fascinating combination ?
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 43]: The young people sniffed in advance the two dear , distinctive odours which , more than anything else , presented the scenes before them -- the soft , cowy-milky scent of the farm , the salt , sharp whiff of the brine .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 36]: From morn till night , at every available moment , they discussed the day 's programme -- feeding animals , calling the cows , bathing , picnicking on the sands , crab-hunting , mountain climbing .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 20]: Excitement grew until it really seemed impossible to exist through the intervening days , and then the bombshell fell !
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 23]: A letter arrived by an evening post , when Mr and Mrs Garnett were enjoying the one undisturbed hour of the day .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 49]: It bore the Hayes crest , and was written in Aunt Maria 's small , crabbed handwriting -- `` My dear Emily , -- `` I propose , all being well , to pay you a short visit from Tuesday to Thursday next , twelfth to fifteenth instant .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 13]: Please let me have the same rooms as on my last visit .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 35]: I am at present living on Benger 's food , and must ask you to see that it is made freshly for each meal , in a _ perfectly clean , enamelled saucepan _ .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 25]: `` The chief object of my visit is to bring back one of your three daughters to stay with me during the summer vacation .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 43]: I have been feeling somewhat lonely of late , and my doctor recommends young society , so it has occurred to me that in obeying his instructions I might at the same time afford pleasure and benefit to one of your family .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 30]: Should I become interested in the child it might be to her advantage hereafter , but it must be understood that I can make no promises on this point .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 42]: `` The eighteen months which have elapsed since my last visit have somewhat dimmed my remembrance of your girls , so that I must see them again before deciding as to which of the three I should prefer as a companion .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 29]: `` With love to William and yourself , -- `` Believe me , my dear Emily , -- `` Your affectionate Aunt , -- `` Maria Hayes . ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 24]: Mrs Garnett read this communication in silence , handed it to her husband , and watched him flush and frown over the perusal .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 14]: `` Does not even go through the form of asking our consent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 7]: That 's Aunt Maria all over .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 8]: You could hardly imagine that she would .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 18]: I 'm afraid , Will -- I 'm _ afraid _ she will have to go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 7]: `` Poor little kiddie , yes !
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 6]: How she will hate it !
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 21]: Just at this moment when they are all wild with joy at the thought of their holiday with the Vernons .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 6]: It seems positively brutal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 6]: `` Oh , it does .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 22]: I am so sorry for her -- whichever it may be -- but one must sometimes be cruel to be kind .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 33]: We ca n't afford -- I am not mercenary , as you know -- but with our means we _ ca n't _ afford to refuse any possible advantage for our girls !
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 14]: The sacrifice of a summer holiday ought not to weigh against that . ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 10]: `` No , you 're right , quite right .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 5]: So be it then .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 25]: Write and tell her to come , only I tell you plainly my holiday 's spoiled ... With Darsie gone -- '' `` Dear !
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 7]: she has not chosen yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 3]: `` Dear !
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 18]: you know perfectly well -- '' They looked at each other , smiling , rueful , half-ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 37]: It seemed like treason to the other girls , this mutual acknowledgment that Darsie was the flower of the flock , the child of the six to whom all strangers were attracted as by a magnet .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 32]: Clarence and Lavender were equally as dear to the parents ' hearts , but there was no denying the existence of a special and individual pride in the fascinations of Darsie .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 9]: Mr Garnett turned aside with an impatient shrug .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 19]: `` There 's one thing , Emily , _ you _ must tell her when it is settled !
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 7]: There 'll be a tremendous scene .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 19]: I flatly refuse -- '' `` Very well , dear , very well ; I 'll do it .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 16]: But it 's not decided yet , remember , and one can never be sure .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 23]: I 'd better break the idea to the girls before Aunt Maria comes , and let them get over the first excitement .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 7]: To-night would be a good opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 14]: You will be out late , so would be spared the scene ! ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 6]: `` Bless you , Emily !
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 16]: I 'm a coward , I know , but I _ should _ be grateful .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 18]: I ca n't answer for what I should do if Darsie cried , and begged my protection .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 12]: Women have twice the pluck of men in these affairs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 42]: Nevertheless it was with a quaking heart that Mrs Garnett broached the object of Aunt Maria 's proposition over the schoolroom tea that afternoon , and her nervousness was not decreased by the smilingly unperturbed manner in which it was received .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 24]: Never , never for a moment did it appear possible to the three girls that such a proposition could be seriously discussed . ''
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 6]: _ So _ likely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 7]: sneered Clemence with a fine disdain .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 23]: `` Give up all the fun and excitement of the sea with the Vernons , to _ browse _ with Aunt Maria .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 10]: _ So _ likely , to be sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 6]: `` Poor dear old love !
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 6]: She _ is _ deluded .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 12]: Thinks it would be a pleasure and benefit , does she .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 12]: I would n't take a thousand pounds -- '' Thus Lavender .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 9]: Darsie went a step farther in tragic declamation .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 7]: `` I 'd drown myself first !
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 34]: To sit there -- panting , in hot rooms , on Benger 's food , and know that all the others were bathing and running wild on the shore -- I 'd burst !
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 19]: I 'd run away in an hour -- '' `` Dears , it 's a beautiful old place .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 13]: There are gardens , and lawns , and horses , and dogs .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 4]: Cows , too !
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 16]: I am sure there are cows -- she used to keep a herd of Jerseys .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 8]: You could see them being milked . ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 9]: `` Welsh cows are good enough for me .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 6]: I do n't need Jerseys .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 5]: _ Or _ lawns !
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 9]: Give me the free , untrammelled countryside ! ''
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 14]: ` And to see it reflected in eyes that I love . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 28]: Darsie paraphrased a line of the sweet old ballad , singing it in a clear , bell-like voice to a pantomime of clasped hands and rolling eyes .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 29]: `` It would be bad enough in an ordinary year , but to rend us apart from the Vernons -- oh , no , it 's unthinkable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 13]: `` You have the Vernons near you all the year , dear .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 8]: Aunt Maria only asks for eight weeks .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 19]: There are occasions in life when it does not do to think only of our own pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 2]: Silence .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 30]: A note in the mother 's voice had startled her hearers into the conviction that the invitation must be regarded seriously , and not tossed aside as a joke .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 17]: A lacerating suspicion that the authorities were in favour of an acceptance pierced like a dart .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 3]: `` Mother !
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 5]: What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 21]: You could n't _ possibly _ be so cruel -- '' `` Mother , you do n't mean -- . ''
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 11]: `` Mother , what _ do _ you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 19]: `` I mean that you ought to go , dears , which ever one of you is asked .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 12]: Aunt Maria is an old lady , and she is lonely .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 7]: Her doctor has ordered cheerful companionship .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 25]: Moreover , she has been a kind friend to father in the past , and has a right to expect some consideration in return .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 29]: If you went in the right spirit , you could be of real use and comfort , and would have the satisfaction of doing a kind deed . ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 17]: Darsie set her lips in a straight line , and tilted her chin in the air .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 11]: `` Could n't pretend to go in the right spirit !
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 8]: I 'd be in a tearing rage .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 18]: Somebody else can have the ` satisfaction , ' and I 'll go to the sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 10]: `` Darsie , dear , that 's naughty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 9]: `` I _ feel _ naughty , mother .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 8]: ` Naughty ' is a mild word .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 4]: _ Savage _ !
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 4]: I feel savage .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 5]: It 's too appalling .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 5]: What does father say ?
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 52]: I 'm sure he would never -- '' `` Father feels as I do ; very disappointed for our own sakes and for yours that our happy party should be disturbed , but he never shirks a disagreeable duty himself , and he expects his children to follow his example . ''
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 6]: Lavender instantly burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 11]: `` It 's always the way -- always the way !
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 8]: It was too good to be true .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 8]: We might have known that it was .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 12]: She 'll choose me , and Hannah will go without me .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 38]: We 'd planned every day -- fishing , and bathing , and making hay , and I shall be mewed up in a close carriage , and have meals of nuts -- and n-n-nobody to talk to .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 12]: Oh , I ca n't -- I ca n't bear it !
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 27]: I wish I could die and be buried -- I _ can not _ bear it -- '' `` You wo n't have to bear it .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 5]: She 'll choose me .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 13]: I 'm the eldest , and the most of a companion . ''
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 26]: Clemence spoke with the calmness of despair , her plump cheeks whitening visibly , her pale eyes showing a flush of red around the lids .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 24]: `` Of course , if it 's my duty , I must go -- but I 'd as soon be sent to prison !
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 17]: I 'm feeling _ very _ tired , and thought the holiday would set me up .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 10]: Now , of course , I shall be worse .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 12]: Eight weeks alone with Aunt Maria would try anybody 's nerves .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 18]: I shall be a wreck all winter , and have neuralgia till I 'm nearly mad . ''
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 5]: `` Nonsense , darling !
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 53]: If you are so tired , the rest and quiet of The Towers will be just what you need ; and as we do n't know yet which one of you Aunt Maria will wish as a companion , it is a pity for you all to make yourselves miserable at once .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 12]: Why not try to forget , and hope for the best !
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 9]: Surely that would be the wiser plan . ''
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 11]: The three girls looked at each other in eloquent silence .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 4]: Easy to talk .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 4]: Forget , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 7]: As if they _ could _ !
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 9]: Mother did n't really believe what she said .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 28]: She was making the best of it , and there were occasions when making the best of it seemed just the most aggravating thing one could do .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 26]: It was a relief to the girls when Mrs Garnett was summoned from the room on household business , and they were left to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 31]: A craving for sympathy was the predominant sensation , and prompted the suggestion , `` Let 's wire to the Vernons , '' which was followed by a stampede upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 85]: The telegraph was a sufficiently new institution to appear a pleasure rather than a toil , even though a message thus dispatched was an infinitely longer and more laborious effort than a run round the terrace , so to-day a leaf was torn from the note-book , a dramatic announcement penned and placed in the hanging-bag , with its jingling bell of warning , and the three girls took it in turns to pull at the cord till the missive arrived at its destination .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 31]: Attracted by the sound of the bell , Vie and plain Hannah stood at the window awaiting the communication , read over its contents , and stood silent and dismayed .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 21]: The Garnetts , watching from afar , realised the dramatic nature of that pause , and thrilled in sympathy . ''
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 20]: _ One of us is going to be sent to prison instead of to the country _ ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 5]: _ Prison _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 57]: Vie and plain Hannah wagged their heads over the cipher , hesitated long , pencil in hand , and , finally , in a frenzy of impatience , which refused to be curbed even by loyalty to the telegraph itself , dispatched an urgent summons to speech -- '' _ Come round and talk _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 4]: The Garnetts flew .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 54]: The Vernons , waiting upon the doorstep , escorted them upstairs to the scantily furnished room which had first been a nursery , then promoted to playroom , and , ultimately , when the more juvenile name wounded the susceptibilities of its inmates , had become definitely and proudly `` the study . ''
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 23]: The bureau in the corner was Dan 's special property , and might not be touched by so much as a finger-tip .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 53]: The oak table with three sound legs and a halting fourth , supported by an ancient volume of _ Good Words _ , was Vie 's property ; John and plain Hannah shared the dining-table , covered with the shabby green baize cloth , which stood in the centre of the room .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 36]: There were a variety of uncomfortable chairs , an ink-splashed drugget , and red walls covered with pictures which had been banished from other rooms as they acquired the requisite stage of decrepitude and grime .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 28]: The five girls surged into the room , faced each other , and burst into eager speech -- '' _ Who 's _ going to prison ? ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 6]: `` We do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 5]: Wish we did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 9]: `` What do you mean by prison ? ''
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 6]: `` Aunt Maria 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 6]: `` Lady Maria 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 5]: `` Lady Maria 's !
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 23]: One of us has to go and stay with her for eight weeks instead of going with you to the sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 14]: Vie Vernon collapsed on to the nearest chair , and gasped for breath .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 4]: `` Stu-pendous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 6]: she murmured beneath her breath .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 19]: Vie had a new word each season which she used to describe every situation , good and bad .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 10]: The season before it had been `` Weird ! ''
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 22]: this season it was `` Stupendous , '' and she was thankful for the extra syllable in this moment of emotion .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 6]: `` It 's really true ?
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 6]: You mean it in earnest ?
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 5]: _ Why _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 18]: `` Thinks it would be a pleasure to us , and that we should be cheery companions .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 10]: _ So _ likely , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 14]: `` But -- but surely your mother -- What does she say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 3]: `` Preaches !
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 7]: Ought n't to think of ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 10]: Ought to show a right spirit and go . ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 4]: `` Stu-pendous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 5]: cried Vie once again .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 18]: Plain Hannah hoisted herself on to the corner of the table , and hunched herself in thought .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 6]: She really was extraordinarily plain .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 78]: Looking at her critically , it seemed that everything that should have been a line had turned into a curve , and everything that should have been a curve into a line ; she was thick-set , clumsy , awkward in gait , her eyes were small , her mouth was large , she had a meagre wisp of putty-coloured hair , and preposterously thick eyebrows several shades darker in hue , and no eyelashes at all .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 24]: Friends and relations lavished much pity on poor dear Hannah 's unfortunate looks , but never a sigh did Hannah breathe for herself .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 46]: She was strong and healthy , her sturdy limbs stood her in good stead in the various games and sports in which she delighted , and she would not have exchanged her prowess therein for all the pink cheeks and golden locks in the world .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 24]: Hannah 's manner , like her appearance , lacked grace and charm ; it was abrupt , forceful , and to the point .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 38]: She spoke now , chin sunk in her grey flannel blouse , arms wrapped round her knees -- `` Is she coming to see you before she chooses , or will it be done by post ? ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 5]: `` She 's coming !
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 5]: Two days next week .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 6]: Is n't it too awful ?
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 19]: We were so happy -- the telegraph up , and the weather jolly , and holidays nearly here .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 12]: ` All unsuspecting of their doom the little victims played . '
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 7]: And then -- _ this _ !
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 5]: Holidays with Aunt Maria !
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 12]: Even the third of a chance turns me cold with dismay .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 13]: I could n't bear -- '' `` You wo n't need to .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 6]: She wo n't have you .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 6]: She 'll choose Darsie . ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 11]: Darsie squealed in shrillest protest -- `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 5]: It 's not fair .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 4]: She wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 4]: She ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 9]: It 's always the eldest or the youngest .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 9]: I 'm the middle -- the insignificant middle .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 7]: Why should she choose me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 10]: `` You are not so modest as a rule !
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 20]: You know perfectly well that strangers always _ do _ take more notice of you than any one else .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 13]: You are always the one who is fussed over and praised . ''
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 7]: `` Because I want to be !
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 6]: This time I sha n't .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 18]: I 'll be just as sulky and horrid as I can for the whole blessed time . ''
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 16]: `` You 'll be there anyway , and you ca n't alter your face . ''
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 6]: `` My fatal beauty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 11]: wailed Darsie , and wrung her hands in impassioned fashion .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 19]: Then she looked critically from one sister to another , and proceeded to candid criticisms of their charms .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 13]: `` Clemence is not pretty , but she 's _ nice _ !
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 29]: If she did her hair better , and sat up , and had a colour , and did n't poke her chin , she 'd look quite decent .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 24]: I should think it would be interesting to take some one who _ needed _ improving , and see what you could do .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 29]: Lavender 's gawky , of course , girls _ are _ gawky at her age , but I should n't wonder if she grew quite decent-looking in time .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 8]: Rest and quiet would do wonders ! ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 6]: `` Thank you , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 7]: You _ are _ kind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 20]: The sisters bridled and tossed their heads , by no means appeased by such prognostications of their future charms .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 18]: `` Certainly if she took _ you _ , she might teach you to be modest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 22]: `` Oh , dear , oh , dear , I do n't want _ any _ of you to go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 10]: Vie , the peacemaker , rushed to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 20]: She was just sixteen , younger than Clemence , older than Darsie , attached almost equally to the two .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 45]: Lavender , of course , was quite too young for a companion , but then Lavender and Hannah paired together ; if she were absent , Hannah at a loose end would demand entrance into those three-sided conferences which made the joy of life .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 19]: The fear of such an incursion made Lavender at that moment seem even more precious than her sisters .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 21]: Vie continued her lament with bitter emphasis -- '' _ Too _ bad -- _ too _ hard -- stupendous !
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 3]: Spoil everything .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 5]: Horrid interfering old thing !
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 31]: If I were your parents I would n't -- not for all the money in the world , I would n't sacrifice a child to an old ogre like that !
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 27]: I 'd keep my own children and let them be happy while they could , but , of course , if she talks of duty ... !
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 18]: If there 's one thing more stupendous than another it 's being put on one 's honour !
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 8]: It gives one _ no _ chance .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 17]: Well , you 'll have to go , I suppose , and our holiday is spoiled .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 11]: I 've never been so disappointed in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 10]: `` Think of how _ we _ feel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 27]: croaked Clemence tragically , but this time the tragedy did not ring so true , for since plain Hannah 's verdict her spirits had risen considerably .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 18]: Hannah was the shrewdest and cleverest of all five girls , and her prophecies were proverbially correct .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 24]: Clemence felt sufficiently reassured to reflect that as the eldest in years , she would do well to show an example of resignation .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 25]: She lengthened her face , and added solemnly -- `` I do n't think you ought to talk like that about honour , Vie !
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 7]: It ought to be an incentive .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 23]: If I go , the only thing that will console me most is the feeling that I am doing my duty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 12]: Vie stared , and the younger girls coughed in derisive chorus .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 13]: `` Is n't it easy to be resigned for somebody else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 7]: demanded plain Hannah of the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 16]: `` You are _ not _ going , my dear , and you know it .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 21]: Darsie likes well enough to queen it as a rule , and now she 's got to pay the price .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 8]: That 's the cost of good looks .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 15]: Thank goodness no one will ever want to run off with _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 8]: -- not even a staid old aunt .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 17]: Tell us about your aunt , by the way -- you 've talked enough about yourselves .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 29]: Where does she live , and what is she like , and what does she do , and what will _ you _ do when you 're there ?
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 10]: Have any of you ever seen the place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 21]: `` Not since we were old enough to remember , but mother has been and told us all about it .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 29]: It 's big , with a lodge , two lodges , and a park all round , very rich , and grand , and respectable , and dull .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 48]: There are men - servants to wait at table , and the windows are never open , and she drives out every day in a closed carriage , and plays patience at night , and wears two wigs , turn about , a week at a time .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 35]: Her cheeks are red , the sort of red that is made up of little red lines , and never gets brighter or darker , and she likes to be quiet and avoid excitement .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 24]: Oh , imagine what it would be like to _ choose _ to be quiet , and deliberately run away from a fuss !
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 18]: Can you imagine if you lived a thousand years ever reaching such a pitch as that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 16]: Darsie held out both hands in dramatic appeal , and her hearers groaned with unction .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 16]: It was impossible , absolutely beyond the power of imagination to picture such a plight .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 44]: Each girl hugged to herself the conviction that with her at least would remain immortal youth ; that happen what might to the rest of mankind , no length of years could numb her own splendid vitality and _ joie de vivre _ .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 19]: Not even , and at the thought the three Garnetts sighed in concert , not even Aunt Maria !
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 4]: A DOUBLE PICNIC .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 13]: Only four days before Aunt Maria arrived to make her great decision !
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 44]: The Garnetts were living in what Darsie graphically described as `` the hush before the storm , '' adored , condoned , and indulged by parents who saw before them the pangs of separation , and by brothers shrewdly expectant of parting spoils .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 27]: Clemence , Darsie , and Lavender were acutely conscious of the rarified atmosphere by which they were surrounded , and only regretted its necessarily limited duration .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 9]: `` Let 's take advantage of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 6]: cried Darsie , the diplomat .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 16]: `` It 's our chance ; we should be noodles if we let it slip .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 10]: Anything we ask now they 'll let us have .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 19]: It 's like prisoners who can order what they like for supper the night before they 're hanged .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 17]: Let 's think what we 'd like , and go in a body and petition mother .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 10]: She wo n't have the heart to refuse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 12]: The sisters agreed enthusiastically , but were not rich in suggestions .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 53]: It is one of the curious things in life that whereas every day one is brought up sharply against a dozen longings and ambitions , without the fulfilment of which it seems impossible to live , yet if the sudden question be put , '' _ What would you have _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 15]: instantly the brain becomes a blank , and not a single suggestion is forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 10]: The Garnetts stared at one another in labouring silence .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 36]: It was too late for parties ; too early for pantomimes , a definite gift , failed to meet the case , since each girl thought with a pang , `` What 's the use ?
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 10]: I might not be here to enjoy it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 40]: Extra indulgences , such as sitting up at night , or being `` let off '' early morning practising , did not appear sufficiently important , since , with a little scheming , these might be gained in addition .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 13]: It was Lavender who at last succeeded in hitting the popular taste .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 4]: `` A picnic !
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 7]: A real whole-day one this time .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 30]: Lunch in the woods at Earley , tea in our old woman 's cottage , walk over the fields to the amphitheatre , and home by train from Oxholm .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 20]: Whoever goes with Aunt Maria will be cheated of her holiday , for the well-behaved country does n't count .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 20]: If you have to wear gloves and walk properly , you might as well be in town at once .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 17]: For the victim 's sake we ought to have one more day in the woods ! ''
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 24]: Clemence and Darsie sparkled , for the programme was an opulent one , combining as it did the two ordinary picnics into one .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 57]: The yearly programme was that -- `` if you are good '' -- the Garnett family should be taken for two half-day excursions into the country on two summer Saturday afternoons , but though the woods and the amphitheatre were only separated by three short miles , never yet had the two places been visited together .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 14]: An all-day picnic seemed a regal entertainment , worthy of the unique occasion .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 6]: `` Ourselves and the Vernons !
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 20]: Mrs Vernon to talk to mother , then they wo n't have as much time to look after us .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 20]: When they begin on carpets and curtains they forget everything else , and we can do as we like .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 8]: Do you suppose Dan would come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 7]: `` Sure he would n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 5]: `` My dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 6]: Clemence held out eloquent hands .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 6]: `` Does he ever come ?
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 18]: He 's a man , soon going to college , and you are only ` kids . '
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 24]: I 'm older than he is really ; a woman is always older than a man , but he does n't like me .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 9]: We are not _ en rapport _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 35]: Clemence tried hard to suppress a smirk of self - consciousness at the use of the French term , while the two younger sisters jeered and booed with the callous brutality of their kind .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 5]: `` Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 5]: are n't we fine ?
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 13]: Roll your r 's a little more next time , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 6]: It will sound miles better .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 8]: Your accent leaves much to be desired .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 6]: Are n't we grown-up to-day ?
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 8]: Aunt Maria _ would _ be impressed !
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 24]: A little stay in Paris just to put on the accent , and it 's wonderful to think of what you might do !
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 5]: _ En rapport _ !
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 9]: Bet you dare n't say that to Dan !
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 15]: Dare you to tell him that you are not _ en rapport _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 16]: Clemence was seized with agitation , discerning through the innocent words a thinly veiled threat .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 10]: If she did n't , Darsie _ would _ !
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 4]: `` Darsie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 4]: she cried loudly .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 12]: `` You must n't tell ; you must _ not _ !
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 4]: It 's mean .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 10]: Only sneaky children repeat what is said in private .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 12]: Promise this minute that you wo n't say a word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 27]: But Darsie , like her brothers , was keenly alive to the privilege of holding a rod in pickle over an elder member of the family .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 24]: So long as Clemence lived in fear of humiliating disclosure , so long might she herself walk in safety , free from rebuffs .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 16]: She laid her head on one side and smiled sweetly into her sister 's face .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 30]: `` I should n't like exactly , positively , to _ promise _ , do n't you know , for I _ am _ such a creature of impulse .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 19]: If it rushed over me suddenly , it might pop out , do n't you know , bang !
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 8]: before I knew what I was about !
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 31]: Of course , on the other hand , I _ might _ not -- '' `` Very well , '' snapped Clemence sharply , `` then I stay at home !
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 27]: It would be no fun for _ me _ to go for a picnic with that sort of thing hanging over my head all the time .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 32]: I know very well how you 'd behave -- rolling your eyes across the table , and beginning half-sentences , and introducing ` _ en rapport _ ' every other moment .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 16]: If I 'm going to be made miserable , I 'll be miserable at home .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 34]: You can go to our last picnic as an undivided family without me , the eldest of the family , and I only hope you 'll enjoy it ; that 's all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 6]: `` Oh , Darsie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 27]: pleaded Lavender tragically , moved almost to tears by the pathos of those last words , and Darsie shrugged her shoulders , philosophically accepting her defeat .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 7]: `` All right , I promise !
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 11]: I 'll hug the remembrance secretly in my own breast .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 10]: It will cheer me through the dullest hours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 9]: Clemence bridled , but made no further protest .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 42]: To think of Darsie chuckling in secret was not agreeable , but it was as nothing compared with the humiliation of meeting Dan 's grave stare , and seeing the curl of his lip at the repetition of her high-sounding phrase .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 35]: As the quickest way of changing the conversation she suggested an adjournment to the morning-room , where mother sat busy over the eternal mending - basket , to broach the picnic project without delay .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 22]: Mother agreed instantly , eagerly , indeed , so that there was something almost uncanny in the unusualness of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 15]: To every demand , every suggestion came the unfailing , `` Yes , darlings !
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 5]: Certainly , darlings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 21]: Even the audacity of the double programme aroused no more notice than the remark that it was an admirable idea .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 20]: Darsie , striking while the iron was hot , went a step farther and attacked the subject of lunch .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 13]: `` Could we -- for once -- have something substantialler than sandwiches ?
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 3]: Chickens ? ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 37]: She gasped at the audacity of the request , for chickens were a state dish , reserved for occasions , and in summer for some inscrutable reasons just because they were smaller cost more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 10]: `` Chickens cut up are so easy to eat .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 8]: We need n't have knives and forks .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 32]: And little cobby dinner-rolls from the confectioner 's , with crisp , browny crust , cut open and stuffed with butter and potted meat , and little green pieces of lettuce .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 18]: They had them that way at supper at the Masons ' party , and they were superb !
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 5]: And cakes and fruit !
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 16]: Do , mother , let us have a real swagger lunch just for once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 10]: And mother said , `` Yes , darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 17]: like a lamb , swallowing as it were spring chickens and cobby rolls at a gulp .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 38]: It was impossible in giving the invitation to the Vernons to refrain from a hint at the magnificence of the preparations , though good manners would , of course , have prompted silence on such a point .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 33]: The Vernons accepted with acclamation , all except Dan , who rudely declared that he `` refused with pleasure , '' when Darsie bearded him in his den and proffered the invitation .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 29]: He was seated at his desk , for the moment the only occupant of the workroom , and his manner was not expressive of welcome to the new-comer .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 24]: He was a big , heavily built youth , with a face which was oddly attractive despite irregular features and a dull complexion .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 47]: Dark eyes looked at you straight and square beneath bushy eyebrows ; thin lips curved into the oddest , most expressive of lines , the square chin had a fashion of projecting until it seemed to become one of the most eloquent features in his face .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 31]: Close observation showed that there was a shadow of his upper lip , and rumour had it that he shaved , actually _ shaved _ every morning of his life .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 23]: His huge hands had a grip of steel , but it was wonderful how deft and gentle they could be on occasion .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 35]: Every album and collection in the house was labelled by Dan , indexed by Dan , embellished with ornamental flourishes and headlines , which Dan 's big fingers alone had the power to produce .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 23]: Now he leaned an elbow on the desk , turned round on his chair , and tilted that eloquent chin in scorn .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 3]: `` Picnic ?
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 3]: Not much .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 5]: Hate 'em like poison !
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 7]: You do n't want me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 8]: `` We _ do _ want you !
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 11]: We should n't have asked you if we did n't .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 7]: Do n't be unsociable , Dan .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 18]: It 's an extra special occasion , and it would be so much jollier to be complete .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 11]: The boys will behave better if you 're there . ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 9]: Dan 's chin tilted still an inch higher .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 15]: That was of course , but -- `` I hate a family crowd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 4]: he pronounced tersely .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 16]: `` If there were only one or two , it would n't be so bad .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 12]: Usual programme , I suppose -- pick flowers and eat biscuits ?
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 12]: Not much in my line -- thank you all the same .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 9]: Hope you 'll have a good time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 28]: `` We 're going to have a _ real _ lunch -- chickens and all sorts of good things , and walk to Oxholm across the fields .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 14]: It will be much more exciting than the old picnics have been . ''
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 7]: `` It might easily be that !
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 9]: No , thank you , I 'm off .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 13]: Some other day -- '' `` But we want you , Dan !
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 9]: _ I _ want you to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 11]: `` But _ I _ do n't , you see .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 5]: There 's the difference .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 5]: Sorry to disoblige . ''
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 37]: Darsie regarded him silently , considered the point whether wrath or pathos would be the most powerful weapon , decided rapidly in favour of pathos , and sank with a sigh on to an opposite chair .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 6]: I _ quite _ understand .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 33]: We wanted you especially because this may be the last , the very last time that one of us girls has any fun this summer , so of course it feels important .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 16]: But you are so much older -- it 's natural that you should n't care .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 21]: I think you 've been very nice to be as much with us as you have been ... Dan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 10]: `` Hannah says it will be _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 12]: That Aunt Maria is sure to choose me when she comes .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 7]: Do you think she will ? ''
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 10]: `` Ten to one , I should say . ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 6]: `` Oh , but why ?
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 4]: _ Why _ ?
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 8]: How can you be so sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 39]: Dan 's dark eyes surveyed the alert little head , poised on the stem of the graceful throat , his thin lips lengthened in the long , straight line which showed that he was trying not to smile .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 23]: `` Because -- er , you appear to me the sort of girl that an erratic old fossil would naturally prefer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 4]: `` Ah-h ! ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 14]: -- Darsie 's dejection was deep -- `` Daniel , how cruel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 30]: It was a comforting retaliation to address her tormentor by the name he so cordially disliked , but she remembered her role , and looked dejected rather than irate .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 7]: `` I suppose that 's true .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 17]: I _ need _ discipline , and she would naturally choose the worst of the three .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 24]: No one wants to be disciplined instead of having a good time , but it may be good for me in the end .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 38]: All the time you are at sea , happy and free , I shall be being disciplined for my good ... Wednesday may be my last , my very last , glad day ... '' `` Bah !
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 3]: Rubbish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 18]: snapped Dan , but he looked at the curly head , and felt a pang of distaste .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 15]: The idea of Darsie Garnett sobered and disciplined out of recognition was distinctly unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 28]: He wriggled in his chair , and said tentatively : `` It will take more than one old lady to tame _ you _ , young woman !
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 19]: You 'll have lots of fun yet -- perhaps more than if you 'd stayed at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 6]: Darsie smiled with angelic resignation .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 17]: `` Perhaps so , but it wo n't be the same _ kind _ of fun .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 8]: New friends can never be like old .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 28]: If she chooses me , I must go , because of my duty to father and the rest , but it 's going to _ hurt _ !
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 27]: I feel , '' -- she waved her arms dramatically in the air -- `` like a flower that is being torn out by the roots !
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 24]: I shall not live long in a strange soil ... Well , goodbye , Dan ; I wo n't bother you any more !
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 16]: Thank you very much for all you 've done for me in the past . ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 2]: Done !
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 28]: Dan searched his memory , found therein inscribed a number of snubs , rebuffs , and teasings , but nothing worthy of the thanks so sweetly offered .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 7]: He felt a stirring of reproach .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 23]: Darsie was a decent kid -- an amusing kid ; if she went away she would leave behind her a decided blank .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 22]: Looking back over the years , Darsie seemed to have played the leading part in the historic exploits of the family .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 10]: She was growing into quite a big kid now .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 28]: He glanced at her again quickly , furtively , and drummed with his fingers on the desk -- hardly a kid at all , almost grown up !
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 19]: `` Oh , that 's all right ; do n't worry about that , '' he mumbled vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 8]: `` What a grandiloquent kid you are !
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 22]: I hope you 'll have a better time than you think , if you do go to visit your aunt . ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 50]: `` Thanks so much ; I hope I may ; and if at any time -- _ any _ time -- I can do anything to help you , or give you the least -- the _ very _ least -- pleasure , please let me know , Dan !
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 17]: I can understand now how one feels when one leaves home and faces the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 4]: said Darsie poignantly .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 4]: `` G-goodbye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 8]: `` Bye , '' said Dan coolly .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 16]: He leaned back in his chair , still thudding with his fingers on the desk .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 17]: Darsie had reached the door and held it open in her hands before he spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 15]: `` What time did you say that blessed old picnic is to start ? ''
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 3]: `` Wednesday .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 33]: Ten o'clock , '' said Darsie , and , like a true daughter of Eve , spoke not one more word , but shut the door and left him to his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 5]: `` Dan 's coming !
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 18]: You 're not to say a word till the time , but he _ is _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 32]: she announced to her sisters that evening ; but when they questioned and cross-questioned concerning the means whereby the miracle had been wrought , she steadfastly refused to satisfy their curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 6]: That was not their concern .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 20]: An inherent loyalty to Dan forbade that she should make public the wiles by which he had been beguiled .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 3]: LEFT BEHIND !
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 66]: Wednesday dawned bright and fair ; it had not seemed possible that it could be wet , and the party of twelve , with their baskets and hampers , drove economically and gaily to the ferry in a three-horse omnibus , so ostentatiously treating it as their own vehicle that the few alien passengers sat abashed , and plainly felt themselves _ de trop _ .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 27]: Darsie 's prophecy had been fulfilled , for Dan appeared at the starting-point , somewhat grim and sulky of demeanour , but obviously on picnic bent .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 71]: He was the only member of the party whose hands were free of basket or bundle , and when the omnibus trundled into sight he walked forward to meet it and swung himself up to a place on top as though anxious to convince beholders that he had no connection with the noisy crowd at the corner , whereupon the two mothers smiled at each other in amused reminiscent fashion .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 18]: The girls were dressed in white ; the boys wore flannel trousers with school blazers and caps .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 23]: Clemence had put on a veil to protect her complexion ; plain Hannah 's sailor hat left yards of forehead bleakly exposed .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 14]: Darsie wore her little Kodak swung across her shoulder in jaunty military fashion .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 38]: She invariably carried a camera on such occasions , and never by any chance used it to take any photographs ; the programme was so unalterable that it had ceased to attract any attention among her companions .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 32]: The omnibus conveyed the party to the ferry , from whence an hourly boat puffed several miles up the river to where the village of Earley stood on the opposite bank .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 51]: It was an ancient and by no means luxurious barque , impregnated from bow to stern with a hot , oily , funnelly smell from which it was impossible to escape , and as travellers to Earley were almost invariably on pleasure bent , the usual satellites were in attendance .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 76]: There was an old man in a long coat who had played the same ballads on the same old concertina with the same incredibly dirty fingers for as long as memory could recall ; there was an old woman with a clean apron and a tray of gingerbread biscuits slung pendant from her shoulders , who presented them to you for three a penny , and exclaimed , `` Bless yer little ` art ! ''
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 19]: when you paid for them yourself , because mother said it was a pity to spoil your lunch .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 3]: Deary me !
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 21]: one _ would _ have to be old to have one 's appetite -- and a picnic appetite at that !
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 7]: -- spoiled by three gingerbread biscuits !
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 19]: The sail to Earley would have been shorn of one of its chief joys without these sticky sweets .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 18]: The absence of the clean , smiling old woman would have been resented as a positive crime .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 27]: The ferry at Earley was an old-fashioned affair , sloping over the muddy shore to a little white pay-house with a clanky turnpike on either side .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 18]: Once past these turnpikes , the visitor found himself in the midst of things with delightful suddenness .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 17]: A wide green stretch of grass lay along the river bank , bordered by shady trees .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 27]: To the right stood a stone hotel with gardens of brilliant flower-beds , and an array of white-covered tables dotted down the length of the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 50]: Grand and luxurious visitors took their meals in the hotel , but such a possibility of splendour had never dawned upon the minds of the Garnetts or their friends -- as well might a wayfarer in Hyde Park think of asking for a cup of tea at Buckingham Palace !
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 20]: To-day a young girl stood in the porch of the hotel and gazed at the procession as it passed .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 22]: She was arrayed in a white serge coat and skirt , and wore a white sailor hat with a blue band .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 6]: `` Exactly like yours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 13]: said Lavender easily , but Clemence shook her head in sad denial .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 60]: _ Her _ coat and skirt had been bought ready-made at a sale , was an inch too short in the waist , and cockled at the seams ; her hat was last year 's shape , while the girl in the porch had just -- _ the _ -- very -- latest and most perfect specimen of both .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 12]: `` Horrid thing , lunching in hotels in clothes like that !
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 8]: Some people have all the luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 57]: said Clemence grudgingly , as she moved the heavy basket from one hand to the other to screen it from the gaze of the aristocratic eyes ; and the girl in the porch spied it all the same , and sighed to herself wistfully : `` They are going picnicking -- all those boys and girls !
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 8]: Oh , how lovely to be them .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 49]: How I _ wish _ I were a big family ... '' after the manner of the ungrateful people of this world , who are so much occupied in envying the possessions of others that they have no time left in which to be thankful for their own !
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 54]: The woods lay not a hundred yards from the ferry itself -- real , natural , untrammelled woods , with grand old trunks standing up tall and straight like the columns of a cathedral , and dear old gnarled roots which ran along the ground , covered with lichens and soft green moss .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 62]: To young people who spent their lives in one red-brick terrace looking out on another red-brick terrace across the road , it was like a voyage into fairyland to step within the cool , green shadow of the woods , to smell the sweet , sharp smell of the earth , and watch the dapplings of sunlight through the leaves overhead .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 97]: Even the boys succumbed to the spell , and for the first half-hour asked nothing better than to roll about on the grass , poke in the roots of trees , and speculate concerning rabbit-holes and nests ; but the half-hour over , one and all were convinced that watches were wrong and they were right in deciding that it was beyond all manner of doubt full time for lunch ; so the cloth was spread on a level piece of turf , and the good things were consumed with the lingering enjoyment which they deserved .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 97]: Every one felt that , as lunch marked what was perhaps the most enjoyable epoch of the whole day , it was his or her bounden duty to eat slowly and to go on demanding helpings so long as the supply endured ; and a certain feeling of blankness descended when there was no longer any excuse for lingering , inasmuch as nothing remained to be eaten but a dozen jam puffs , which , as mother said , had been _ meant _ to be very nice , but had somehow failed to achieve success !
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 57]: The paste , hard enough on top , was inside of a damp and doughy consistence , and cook had used gooseberry jam for the filling , thereby taking a mean advantage of absence from home , when she _ knew _ that the family detested gooseberry in tarts , and steadily plumped for apricot instead .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 13]: `` We 'll give them to the little boy at the ferry .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 10]: _ He _ wo n't be so particular ! ''
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 39]: Mrs Garnett said as she laid the rejected dainties on one side and proceeded to pack the oddments which had been required for the meal in one small basket , placing layers of paper in those left empty .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 26]: The young people looked at each other with raised eyebrows as they watched these proceedings , the meaning of which they knew only too well .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 37]: It was forbidden to gather roots from the woods , but no authority had dreamt of forbidding visitors to carry away _ soil _ , and this was just what Mrs Garnett invariably insisted upon doing .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 57]: The red-brown earth , rich with sweet fragments of leaf and twig , was too tempting to be resisted when she thought of her poor pot-bound plants at home ; therefore , instead of swinging homewards with baskets light as air , the boys were doomed to bear even heavier weights than on the outward journey .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 4]: `` Mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 9]: cried Clemence in a deep tone of protest .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 6]: `` Not _ yet _ !
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 7]: Remember the walk across the fields .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 11]: Plenty of time to get soil in the Amphitheatre ! ''
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 18]: And Mrs Garnett put down her trowel with quite a guilty air and resigned herself to wait .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 20]: Perhaps it would be best ... Mrs Vernon and I would like an hour 's rest before going on .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 11]: What are _ you _ going to do now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 14]: Every one waited for every one else , and no suggestion was forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 29]: The boys were once more beginning to roll about on the grass , poking and pulling at each other in a manner which foretold the beginning of war .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 10]: Clemence and Vie were gazing sentimentally through the branches .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 29]: Plain Hannah , stretched flat along the ground , was barricading the movements of a tiny beetle , and chuckling over its persistent efforts to outwit her schemes .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 17]: Dan sat with arms clasped around his knees , a picture of patience on a monument .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 17]: The sight of his twisted lips , his tilted , disconsolate chin fired Darsie to action .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 25]: It was her doing that he was here at all ; it was her duty to make the time pass as agreeably as possible .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 4]: `` Sports ! ''
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 4]: she cried quickly .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 4]: `` Competitive sports .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 13]: We 'll each plan an event , and take them in turns .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 18]: Dan shall be judge , and the one who gets most marks shall have a prize . ''
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 5]: `` What prize ? ''
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 5]: That was a stumper .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 10]: Darsie could suggest nothing better than a general subscription .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 18]: `` If we each paid a penny entrance -- '' `` Oh , be bothered the pennies !
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 7]: I 'll give a prize ! ''
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 4]: cried Dan loftily .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 42]: Darsie saw with joy that he had brisked up at the prospect of sports and was already beginning to cast his eye around in professional manner , taking in the lie of the land , the outstanding features of the position .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 25]: As judge and manager he was in his element , and each suggestion of an event was altered and amended with a lordly superiority .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 30]: It is somewhat difficult to introduce much variety into a programme of impromptu sports , but one or two of this afternoon 's events had the advantage of novelty .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 63]: A flower-gathering race , for instance , the object of which was to see how many varieties of wild flowers each competitor could gather in a given time , and a Roman water-carrier event , which consisted in balancing the hot-water jug on one 's head and seeing how far one could walk without spilling its tepid contents over neck and shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 33]: Plain Hannah was the only one of the girls who took part in this event , and to her joy succeeded in travelling a longer distance than any of the male competitors .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 42]: The final and most elaborate event was the obstacle race , without which no competition of the kind is ever considered complete , and the united wits of the company were put to work to devise traps for their own undoing .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 37]: Harry discovered two small trees whose trunks grew so close together that it seemed impossible that any human creature could squeeze between , and insisted upon it being done as a _ sine qua non _ .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 48]: Russell decreed that competitors should travel over a certain route without touching the ground , swinging themselves from branch to branch like so many monkeys , and as girls were plainly disqualified for this feat an alternative test was invented which should score equally to their credit .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 30]: Hopping races , races complicated by arithmetical and other such baffling problems , were also devised , and at the last moment Darsie came forward with a thrilling novelty .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 30]: `` Run to the hamper , turn round three times , seize a jam puff , eat it in two bites , and hop back to the goal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 23]: cried the judge approvingly , and after that the competitors might storm and lament as they would ; the event was fixed !
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 72]: The two mothers had retired from the scene of the fray and with backs resting against two friendly trees were peacefully discoursing on household trials ; there was no one to preach concerning indigestion , and the perils of rapid eating ; hot and gasping from their previous trials , the competitors ran , twirled , hopped and gobbled , and finally subsided in paroxysms of laughter on the mossy bank .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 90]: The sports were over ; the prize had fallen to Russell , as every one had known from the start that it must inevitably do ; he sat snoring with pride , waving aside Dan 's inquiries as to the nature of his prize in a gentlemanly manner worthy of his reputation , until the two mothers , becoming conscious that the afternoon was passing away , rose heavily from their seats and announced that it was time to start on the second half of the day 's expedition .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 57]: The three-mile walk lay for three parts of the way through fields , which to the town-livers afforded a refreshing change from noisy and dusty streets , and when the little village was reached , `` our old woman 's cottage '' was found to be as clean and neat and hospitably attractive as of yore .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 38]: It was a tiny whitewashed cottage standing back from the lane in a garden bright with old-fashioned flowers , and the stone-floored kitchen boasted an old oak dresser and table which were the envy of all beholders .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 8]: `` They 're always after it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 8]: our old woman would announce , chuckling .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 22]: `` Titled gentry I 've had , driving up in their own carriage , a-coaxing and wheedling so as never was .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 46]: ` _ No _ , ' I says , ` they was my mother 's afore me , and her mother 's afore that , and it 's a poor tale if I ca n't have the pleasure of them while _ I _ live !
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 15]: If it 's waluable to you , it 's waluable to me , too .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 16]: That 's only common sense ... ' And what 's your fancy today , lovies ?
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 11]: boiled eggs and buttered toast , same as afore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 26]: Boiled eggs and buttered toast it was , despite the protests of the mothers , who thought that really , after such a lunch -- !
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 65]: And after tea our old woman provided buttonholes for each member of the party , and hobbled to the gate to see them off , assuring them , as was her yearly custom , that `` the gamekeepers was getting very crusty of late , but you leave the roots alone and nobody ca n't say nothing about a few bits of flowers . ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 37]: That yearly threat of the gamekeeper lent a _ soupcon _ of excitement to the scramble over the sloping woods , which surrounded as an amphitheatre a deep green meadow through which meandered a tiny stream .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 35]: At any moment , as it appeared , a stalwart figure in velveteen bearing a gun over his shoulder might appear round the trunk of a tree , demanding your licence or your life .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 30]: It was interesting to discuss exactly what you would do or say under the circumstances , and the very worst thing in punishments which could possibly be your fate !
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 25]: To-day , however , no such interruption took place , and the dear old playground looked , if possible , more beautiful than ever .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 62]: The ground was carpeted with buttercups , and when one stood on the top of the steep banks and looked down on the green and the gold , and caught glimpses of the blue sky beyond -- well , it was as near an approach to fairyland as one could hope to find within twenty miles of a big manufacturing town .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 60]: Mrs Garnett packed her basket full of the soft , loamy soil ; the girls roamed up and down making up bouquets of wild roses , honeysuckle , and fragrant meadowsweet ; the boys were blissfully happy , risking life and limb in an exciting endeavour to travel from top to bottom of the bank without once touching grass .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 39]: An occasional tree-trunk was permitted as a foothold , otherwise you swung yourself from one branch to another , or took flying leaps into space , and trusted to fate to catch hold of something before you fell .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 40]: Russell 's hairbreadth escapes would have terrified his mother had she been there to see , but the boys were wise in their generation and had quietly worked their way round to the opposite bank before beginning their experiments .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 44]: It took a considerable time to call them back and rally forces in time to catch the eight o'clock train , and it was a dishevelled and by no means aristocratic-looking party which climbed over the high stone stile leading into the high-road .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 50]: It seemed hard luck that this last mile , when every one was feeling tired and a trifle flat , should have to be traversed along a dusty , uninteresting road , and the straggly line grew even farther and farther apart as the distance to the station decreased .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 25]: Dan led the way , walking in the middle of the road , his head flung back with the old proud air of detachment .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 9]: The two mothers plodded steadily in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 71]: Russell , scratched and dusty , and looking more like a street arab than a youth renowned for gentlemanly demeanour , scuffled in the gutter , kicking up the gathered dust which enveloped him as in a cloud ; Harry and John bore the big hamper slung on a stick , the ends of which they frequently released for the purpose of straightening their backs and rubbing their tired hands .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 32]: Plain Hannah limped on the sideway , being afflicted with corns which , as she expressed it , always `` came on '' at the end of a day 's pleasuring .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 12]: Vie and Clemence , arm-in-arm , were deep in sentimental conclave .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 24]: Darsie , the last of the line , hung back of intent until a curve in the road hid the others from sight .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 55]: A shadow of melancholy had descended upon her spirit during the last hour ; that fear of `` the last time '' which at times makes cowards of us all , was strong upon her ; the possibility of separation suddenly became a terror which gripped her breath and left her faint and weak .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 6]: Mother -- Father -- Home !
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 7]: The dear delights of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 13]: Could she -- could she _ bear _ to give them up ?
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 25]: Darsie whimpered miserably , and stopped short in the middle of the road to pull out her handkerchief , and wipe a threatening tear .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 28]: She really did not think she could , and yet every one seemed to take it for granted that Aunt Maria 's choice would fall upon herself .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 14]: Was there nothing , nothing that she could do to lessen the probability ?
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 18]: Nothing to make herself look ugly , unattractive , unsuited for the post of lady 's companion ?
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 45]: A stranger walking along the high-road at this moment would have been amused to see a pretty , disconsolate-looking young girl deliberately twisting her features into one grimace after another , and critically examining the effect in the back of a small silver watch .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 81]: Every new grimace necessitated a pause for inspection , so that the distance between Darsie and her companions increased more and more , until on turning the next corner of the winding road she was surprised to find no one in sight -- surprised and a trifle startled , for the early dusk was already casting its shadow over the landscape , and the solitude of a country road has in it something eerie to a lifelong dweller in towns .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 40]: Darsie forgot her grimaces and set off at a trot to make up lost ground , and even as she ran a sound came from afar which quickened the trot into a run -- the scream of an engine !
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 16]: the engine of the approaching train which was to bear the picnickers back to town .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 42]: The next turn of the road showed that the rest of the party had taken alarm also , for the flying figures of Vie and Clemence could be seen disappearing in the distance , evidently following hastily after those in front .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 47]: `` They 'll catch it -- they 'll rush down the steps just as it 's going to start , bundle in anyhow , into different carriages -- never miss me -- go off , never know I 'm not there till they get out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 16]: These thoughts rushed through Darsie 's head as she ran gaspingly along the dusty road .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 35]: It was imperative that she must catch up to her friends -- to be left behind , without a penny in her pocket to buy a ticket , would be too awful for words .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 33]: The shriek of the engine had given place to a repeated snort which was momentarily growing slower and less pronounced ; the train was slackening speed before drawing up at the platform .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 2]: Faster !
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 2]: Faster !
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 7]: One rush to reach the goal !
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 30]: Darsie set her teeth and put on a last desperate spurt , caught her foot on an outstanding stone of the roadway , and fell heavily to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 5]: DAN TO THE RESCUE .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 52]: There were no bones broken ; she was not seriously hurt ; but one has to try for oneself the experiment of running at full tilt , and while so doing to pitch forward at full length on the ground , to realise how extremely disagreeable and disconcerting it can be .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 48]: Darsie dragged herself slowly to a sitting position , and sat dazed and stupefied , a forlorn , dust-encrusted figure , with hat tilted rakishly on one side , and the palm of her right hand scratched to bleeding where it had dragged along the stony ground .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 39]: She blinked and stared , and mechanically brushed at her blackened skirts , but it was several moments before remembrance of her position returned to her brain , and with it the realisation of the consequences of delay .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 23]: She scrambled to her feet , ran forward for a few paces , and stopped short with a sharp groan of pain .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 40]: She had bruised her knees as well as her hand , and the rapid movement was quite startlingly painful ; she fell into a limp , straining her head upwards to peep over the hedgerow at the road beyond .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 25]: And then , clear and distinct after the interval of silence , came another sharp whistle , another laborious puff , puff , puff .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 13]: The train was leaving the station , and she was left behind !
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 10]: Darsie stopped short , and leaned against the hedge .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 9]: There was no longer any need to hurry .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 25]: Either her absence had been discovered or it had not , and a few minutes ' time would settle that question once for all .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 39]: It soothed her to pretend that there was a chance that she might find some one waiting her arrival on the platform , but at the bottom of her heart she had little hope of such a possibility .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 81]: As members of a large family whose parents were not rich enough to pay for the modern plethora of nurses and governesses , the Garnetts and Vernons had been brought up to be independent , and to fend for themselves , hence the two mothers would not be so anxious to count the number of their brood , to see that each member was safe and sound , as would have been the parents of smaller , more indulged families .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 58]: There would be a rush for tickets , a hurried glance around on emerging from the office , the signal of waving hands , and bobbing heads from half a dozen windows , a quick leap into the nearest seats , and off they would all steam , panting and puffing , congratulating themselves on their escape .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 60]: No , Darsie told herself , it was stupid to pretend ; certainly , quite certainly she was left behind ; nevertheless , when two or three minutes later she reached the top of the railway bridge and peered over the stone wall , it was with quite a big pang of dismay that she beheld the empty platform .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 4]: Not a soul !
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 22]: Not a single soul except a cross-looking porter sitting astride a barrow , with his hands thrust into his trousers pockets .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 24]: Anything less promising in the shape of a forlorn hope it would be difficult to imagine , but the circumstances offered no alternative .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 13]: Darsie took her courage in both hands and marched boldly towards him .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 16]: `` Please will you tell me the time of the next train from town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 34]: The porter rolled his eye sideways , surveyed her up and down , formed an evidently poor opinion , and without a change of position muttered a curt reply -- `` Ten-thirty . ''
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 4]: `` Ten-thirty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 19]: Dismay at the lateness of the hour struggled with wounded pride at the man 's lack of respect .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 31]: Half-past ten before any one could come to the rescue ; three long hours of chill and darkness , with no one to speak to , and nowhere to go !
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 12]: Darsie threw the thought aside with the impetuous incredulity of youth .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 10]: `` When 's the next train to town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 4]: `` Nine-ten . ''
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 4]: That was better !
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 2]: Nine-ten .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 30]: If she could manage to travel by that train she would arrive at the terminus in abundance of time to prevent any one starting by the next stopping train .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 21]: It was all easy -- perfectly easy , except for the want of a miserable eightpence , but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 11]: for the moment eightpence seemed as inaccessible as eighty pounds .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 12]: Darsie bent a scrutinising glance upon the porter 's downcast face .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 26]: `` He looks about as disagreeable as he can be , but he 's a human creature ; he must have _ some _ heart !
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 15]: Perhaps he 's in trouble , too , and it 's soured his disposition .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 4]: It would mine !
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 11]: I just _ hate _ it when things go wrong .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 17]: I do n't in the least see why I should n't have a ticket on account !
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 9]: I 'll see what I can do . ''
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 14]: She coughed and ventured tentatively -- `` I missed the last train . ''
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 5]: `` Did ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 5]: said the porter coldly .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 59]: It was not a question ; there was no flicker of the interest of a question in his voice , only a dreary indifference which seemed to demand what in the world you were thinking of to trouble him about a stupidity which had happened twenty times a day throughout twenty years of his service on the line .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 10]: Darsie drew herself up with a feeling of affront .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 21]: He was a rude , ill-mannered man , who ought to be taught how to speak to ladies in distress .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 11]: She would ask her father to complain to the railway !
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 13]: What were porters paid for but to make themselves useful to passengers ?
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 26]: She drew herself up in haughty fashion , then as suddenly collapsed as her eye rested on her dusty boots and blackened , bloodstained skirt .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 12]: Ridiculous to act the grand lady with such handicaps as these !
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 21]: She drew a sharp breath , and said in a voice of childlike appeal -- `` I 'm left behind !
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 6]: My friends have gone on .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 6]: It 's very awkward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 5]: `` Are ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 5]: asked the porter indifferently .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 15]: He took one hand out of his pocket and pointed woodenly to the right .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 5]: `` Waiting-room first door .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 6]: Ye can sit there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 8]: Of all the callous , cold-blooded -- !
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 59]: Darsie turned with a swing and marched forward into the bleak little cell which had the audacity to call itself a first-class waiting-room , seated herself on a leather - covered bench which seemed just the most inhospitable thing in the way of furniture which the mind of man could conceive , and gave herself up to thought .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 21]: Never , never so long as she lived would she ever again leave home without some money in her pocket !
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 22]: How in the name of all that was mysterious could she contrive to possess herself of eightpence within the next hour ?
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 39]: `` Our old woman '' would lend it with pleasure , but Darsie shrank from the idea of the darkening country road with the dread of the town-dweller who in imagination sees a tramp lurking behind every bush .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 39]: No , this first and most obvious suggestion must be put on one side , and even if she could have humbled herself to beg from the porter , Darsie felt an absolute conviction that he would refuse .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 14]: At the farther side of the station there stretched a small straggling village .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 7]: Surely somehow in that village -- !
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 16]: With a sudden inspiration Darsie leaped to her feet and approached the porter once more .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 27]: Into her mind had darted the remembrance of the manner in which poor people in books possessed themselves of money in critical moments of their history .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 16]: `` Porter , will you please tell me the way to the nearest pawnshop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 5]: `` P-p -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 23]: Now , indeed , if she had wished to rouse the porter to animation , she had succeeded beyond her wildest dreams !
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 14]: He spun round , and gaped at her with a stupefaction of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 7]: `` Pawnshop , did ye say ?
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 2]: P-awn !
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 19]: What do _ you _ want with a pawnshop , a slip of a girl like you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 7]: `` That 's my business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 4]: returned Darsie loftily .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 19]: Since he had been so unsympathetic and rude , she was certainly not going to satisfy his curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 37]: Her dear little watch would provide her with money , and somehow -- she did n't understand why -- pawnbrokers gave things back after paying for them , in the most amiable and engaging of fashions .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 6]: `` That 's my business !
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 22]: If you would kindly direct me -- '' `` We have n't got no pawnshop , '' said the porter gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 34]: He stared at her slowly up and down , down and up , appeared to awake to a suspicious interest , and opined gruffly , `` You 'd better go ` ome ! ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 16]: `` Just what I 'm trying to do , '' sighed poor Darsie to herself .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 20]: She turned and went slowly back to her leather seat , and a second disconsolate review of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 18]: In time to come this experience would rank as an adventure , and became an oft-told tale .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 22]: She would chill her listeners with hints of The Tramp , evoke shrieks of laughter at her imitation of the porter .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 14]: Darsie realised the fact , but for the moment it left her cold .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 29]: Summer evenings have a trick of turning chill and damp after the sun is set , and the vault-like waiting-room was dreary enough to damp the highest spirits .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 14]: _ How was she going to obtain that eightpence for a ticket _ ?
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 37]: The station clock struck nine ; the porter took a turn along the platform and peered curiously through the dusty window ; a luggage train rattled slowly past , an express whizzed by with thunderous din .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 19]: The station clock struck the quarter , and still the problem was as far as ever from solution .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 14]: `` Well , '' sighed Darsie miserably , `` I must just wait .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 7]: I 'm perished with cold already .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 9]: In two more hours I shall be frozen .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 10]: Rheumatic fever , I suppose , or galloping decline .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 14]: It will settle Aunt Maria , that 's _ one _ good thing !
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 15]: but it 's hard all the same , in the flower of my youth !
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 19]: To think of all that a human creature can suffer for the sake of a miserable eightpence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 12]: She got up stiffly and pressed her face against the pane .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 9]: People were beginning to assemble for the nine-ten .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 15]: An old man with a satchel of tools , two old women with baskets .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 10]: `` The poor are always generous to the poor .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 5]: Suppose I ask them ?
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 10]: Twopence three farthings each would not kill them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 19]: But when one is not used to begging , it is extraordinary how difficult it is to begin .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 20]: Darsie tried to think of the words in which she would proffer her request , and blushed in discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 6]: she _ could _ not .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 45]: Of the two disagreeables it really seemed easier to shiver two hours , and retain one 's pride intact , and then , suddenly , the door of the waiting-room opened with a bang , and Dan 's heavy figure stood on the threshold !
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 27]: The cry of delight , of breathless incredulity with which Darsie leaped to her feet , must have been heard to the end of the platform .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 18]: She rushed forward , clutched his arm , and hugged it fast in the rapture of relief .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 11]: `` Oh , Dan -- you angel -- you angel !
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 10]: Have you dropped down straight from the skies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 4]: `` Not I !
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 4]: Nothing so easy .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 9]: Scorched along bad roads on a rickety machine .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 14]: Would you be kind enough to let go my arm and stop shrieking !
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 11]: You 'll have the whole village here in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 11]: So _ you 're _ all right , I see !
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 27]: Sitting quietly here , after scaring us half out of our wits -- '' `` I think _ I 'm _ the one to be scared !
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 16]: You were all ready enough to go on , and leave me stranded by myself .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 7]: I 've gone through a martyrdom .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 2]: Dan !
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 11]: tell me , when did you miss me first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 6]: Dan gave an expressive grimace .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 16]: He looked hot and dusty , and thankful to sit down on the leather bench .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 48]: `` Well , it was too much of a scrimmage to think of anything for the first few miles , but things have a way of printing themselves on one 's brain , and when I _ did _ begin to think , there seemed something missing !
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 19]: I remembered Vie 's face -- the colour of a beetroot , and Clemence limping in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 42]: I remembered John and Russell hauling up Hannah by her arms , and the two mothers were safely in their carriage -- I 'd made sure of that , but -- I could n't remember a thing about _ you _ !
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 24]: Then I asked Vie , and she said you were a long way behind , and I began to guess what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 17]: At the first stop I did a rush round , and -- there you were n't !
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 8]: So of course I came back . ''
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 6]: `` But how -- how ?
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 5]: There was no train .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 4]: Did you cycle ?
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 8]: Where did you get your machine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 21]: `` Borrowed him from the stationmaster , and left my watch in exchange , in case I never went back .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 8]: Jolly good exchange for him , too .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 17]: It 's the worst machine I ever rode , and that 's saying a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 19]: I told your mother I 'd bring you back all right , and persuaded her to go home .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 12]: What on earth possessed you to be such a muff ? ''
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 12]: Darsie tossed her head , gratitude giving place to wounded pride .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 5]: `` Muff , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 18]: You do n't know what you are talking about , or you would n't be so unkind .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 22]: I ran like the rest , but I fell -- caught my foot on something , and fell on my face .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 6]: I believe I fainted . ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 38]: There was an irrepressible note of pride in her voice as she made this last statement , for fainting , being unknown in the healthy Garnett family , was regarded as a most interesting and aristocratic accomplishment .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 19]: `` I do believe I fainted , for for several minutes I did n't know where I was .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 13]: And I hurt myself , too ; look at my hand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 5]: Dan looked and whistled .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 9]: `` Skinned it properly , have n't you !
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 9]: Reminds me of the days of my youth .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 13]: Better sponge it clean with your handkerchief and some of that water .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 15]: And when you _ did _ remember , the train had gone -- . ''
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 35]: `` Yes -- and not another until after ten , and not a halfpenny in my pocket to buy a ticket , and no one but a callous wretch of a porter to consult .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 24]: Oh , Dan , I _ was _ wretched -- I 'll bless you all my life for coming back like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 4]: `` Rot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 4]: said Dan briskly .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 7]: `` I was the only man .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 6]: Could n't do anything else .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 33]: I say , you know , it was your doing that I came to this blessed old picnic at all , and you _ have _ let me in for a day !
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 14]: Eleven to eleven before we 've done with it -- twelve solid hours !
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 19]: I 've had about as much picnic as I want for the rest of my natural life . ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 5]: `` I 'm sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 8]: I thought it would be so nice .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 10]: I 'm sorry I bothered you , Dan . ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 22]: Darsie was tired and cold , in a condition of physical depression which made her peculiarly sensitive to a slighting mood .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 18]: She leaned her head against the ugly wall , and shut her lids over her smarting eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 5]: Her cheeks were white .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 31]: Her lips quivered like a wearied child 's , but she made a charming picture all the same , her inherent picturesqueness showing itself even in this moment of collapse .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 14]: Dan 's gaze grew first sympathetic , then thoughtful , as he looked .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 41]: In a dim , abstract way he had been conscious that Darsie Garnett was what he would have described as `` a pretty kid , '' but the charm of her personality had never appealed to him until this moment .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 49]: Now , as he looked at the dark eyelashes resting on the white cheek , the droop of the curved red lips , the long , slim throat that seemed to-night almost too frail to support the golden head , a feeling of tenderness stirred at his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 18]: She was such a tiny scrap of a thing , and she had been tired and frightened .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 12]: What a brute he was to be so gruff and ungracious !
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 6]: `` Buck up , Darsie !
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 7]: Only ten minutes more to wait .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 12]: I 'll get you a cup of coffee when we arrive .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 23]: Your mother said we were to take a cab , so all the worry 's over and nothing but luxury ahead . ''
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 30]: But Darsie , quick to note the soothing effect of her prostration , refused to `` buck up , '' and looked only more worn and pathetic than before .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 41]: The opportunity of lording it over Dan was too precious to be neglected , so she blinked at him with languid eyes , and said faintly -- `` I 'll try , but I 'm so _ very _ tired !
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 18]: Do you think you could talk to me , Dan , and amuse me a little bit ?
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 6]: That would pass the time .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 20]: Tell me about yourself , and all you are going to do when you go up to Cambridge . ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 13]: And to his own astonishment Dan found himself responding to her request .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 64]: His was one of the silent , reserved natures which find it difficult to speak of the subjects which lie nearest to the heart , but even silent people have their moments of expansion , and when once Dan had broken the ice , he found it unexpectedly easy to talk , with Darsie 's big eyes fixed on his in eloquent understanding .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 25]: She was a capital little listener ; never interrupted at the wrong moment , indulged in senseless ejaculations , or fidgety , irritating movement .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 48]: Nothing about her moved , hardly even the blue eyes , so fixed and absorbed was their gaze , while Dan spoke in low , rapid tones of the course of work which lay ahead , of the ambitions and dreams which were to crown his efforts .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 41]: He must take first-class honours at Cambridge ; nothing less than first-class honours would do -- honours so distinguished that he would have no difficulty in obtaining a good post as schoolmaster to tide him over the next few years .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 31]: `` Teaching 's the thing for me -- for it leaves four months over for my own work , the real work of my life -- scientific study and research !
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 21]: That 's the only thing worth living for from my point of view , and I shall plump for that .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 39]: I do n't care for money , I do n't want to marry , I 'd be content to make enough to keep body and soul together , if I could only help on the cause of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 11]: I am not going up to Cambridge for two years .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 16]: I can do better grinding quietly at home , and the governor does n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 26]: In fact , he is just as well pleased to think I shall have more time to run when Hannah goes up to Newnham . ''
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 6]: Darsie drew her breath sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 5]: `` Oh , Dan !
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 19]: how fortunate you are -- how fortunate Hannah is , to be able to do as you like !
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 20]: I would give my ears to go up to Newnham , too , but father says it 's impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 16]: He ca n't afford it with the boys ' education getting more expensive every year .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 33]: I shall have to stay at home , and turn into a miserable morning governess , teaching wretched little kids to read , and taking them for a walk round the park .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 4]: Oh , oh !
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 12]: it makes me _ ill _ to think about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 4]: Dan laughed shortly .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 4]: `` Excuse me !
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 5]: it makes you well .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 7]: You look quite like yourself again .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 28]: I 'll give you a bit of advice if you like : do n't believe that anything 's impossible in this world , because it is n't !
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 16]: Put the nursery governess idea out of your mind , and fire ahead for Newnham .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 30]: There 's always the chance of a scholarship , and even if that did n't come off , who can tell what may happen in three years ' time ?
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 22]: The way may clear in a dozen ways ; it probably _ will _ clear , if you get ready yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 15]: There are precious few things one ca n't gain by steady slogging ahead . ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 22]: Darsie looked at him with a kindling glance , her lips set , a spot of red showed on either cheek .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 4]: `` Right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 22]: she said briefly , and at that moment the train steamed into the station and the conference was at an end .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 5]: AUNT MARIA 'S CHOICE .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 15]: Aunt Maria arrived on Tuesday night , bringing `` my woman '' in attendance .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 34]: She was more like a parrot than ever , for her face had grown narrower , her nose bigger , and the roundness of her eyes was accentuated by gold - rimmed spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 40]: When a richly coloured Paisley shawl was drawn tightly over her sloping shoulders the resemblance was positively startling to behold , and the terrors of an eight-weeks visit loomed larger than ever before the minds of the Garnett sisters .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 29]: The extraordinary thing was that Aunt Maria seemed to take no notice of the girls , whom , as everybody was aware , she had come to inspect .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 71]: She talked to father , she talked to mother , she cross-questioned the boys as to their progress at school and expressed regret that they had not done better ; she displayed an intelligent interest in the neighbours , the servants , and the new dining-room rug , but for the three daughters of the house she had not a word , hardly , it was believed , a glance .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 38]: In the presence of such utter indifference it was impossible to keep up the various roles which each girl had privately practised with the view of concealing her charms and diverting Aunt Maria 's attention from herself .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 43]: Clemence had decided that rounded shoulders and a lurching gait were defects which at seventeen threatened a painful permanence , and had therefore lurched persistently throughout the first evening , since which time she had slowly but steadily recovered her natural gait .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 41]: After long practice before the mirror Darsie had decided that an open mouth and falling under-jaw could work marvels in the way of stupidity of expression , and had nerved herself to sit agape for the period of forty-eight hours .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 6]: Lavender had decided to sulk .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 6]: `` Every one hates sulks !
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 18]: It would be better to live alone on a desert island than with a person who sulks .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 15]: I 'll sulk , and she wo n't be paid to have me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 68]: So one sister had sulked and the other gaped the whole of that first long evening , and then , becoming increasingly freed from their fears , began to smile secretly across the table , to nod and to nudge , to telegraph messages in the silent but eloquent fashions to which members of a large family resort when visitors are present and talking is not allowed .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 28]: And Aunt Maria munched her food , and wrapped the Paisley shawl more closely round her shoulders , and cast not a glance to right or left !
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 21]: A blissful possibility was broached that she had changed her mind , and did not desire a visitor after all .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 18]: Wednesday and Thursday passed in increasing calm , but on Friday morning certain alarming symptoms became visible .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 14]: Mrs Garnett came to breakfast with unmistakable signs of agitation upon her face .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 22]: Mr Garnett was silent and distrait , hid behind his newspaper , and answered at random the remarks of his family .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 25]: Late arrivals were allowed to pass without reproach , and Tim 's raids upon the marmalade received no further protest than a flickering smile .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 5]: The die was cast !
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 45]: The girls knew it without a word ; in a stupor of misery they sat , ears cocked , hearts in their boots , waiting for a sign which should betray the truth , and decide once for all the identity of the victim .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 20]: It came at last , towards the end of the meal , in the midst of a ghastly silence .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 22]: `` Darsie , darling , '' said Mrs Garnett fondly , `` wo n't you have some more coffee ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 5]: _ Darling _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 21]: Never were Mrs Garnett 's north-country lips known to use that term except under stress of the most poignant emotion .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 54]: To be `` darling '' one was compelled to be very ill , very sad , angelically repentant , or in an extremity of fear , and Darsie , who this morning was not afflicted in any one of these three ways , realised in a flash the awful significance of the term .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 51]: She sat white and silent , too dazed for speech , and to do them justice Clemence and Lavender looked almost as perturbed as herself , relief on their own account being eclipsed for the moment by a realisation of the loss which the holiday party was about to sustain .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 30]: With a sudden and uninvited humility each sister mentally acknowledged that for the general good of the family it would have been better had the choice fallen upon herself !
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 20]: Darsie braced her feet against a leg of the table , and struggled with a lump in her throat .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 2]: Coffee ?
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 14]: she never wanted to drink any more coffee so long as she lived !
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 17]: The sight , the smell of it would be for ever associated with this ghastly moment .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 26]: She turned big , woeful eyes on her mother 's face and stammered a breathless inquiry : `` Mother , you have something to say !
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 4]: Please say it .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 15]: Do n't break it to me , please ; it 's worse to wait .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 6]: Say it bang out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 19]: `` Oh , Darsie , darling ; yes , darling , it _ is _ as you suppose !
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 6]: Aunt Maria has chosen you .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 54]: She wants you to start with her on Saturday morning , but if it 's too soon -- if you would rather stay over Sunday , I will arrange ... '' Darsie bit her lips in the desperate resolve not to cry , but to carry off the situation with a high air .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 21]: `` If I 'm to go at all , I 'd rather go at once , and get it over .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 9]: There 's nothing to be gained by delay .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 16]: ` Better to die by sudden shock than perish piecemeal on the rock . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 58]: `` But you will want to say goodbye to your friends , dear ; you will have little arrangements to make ... '' Mrs Garnett was all nervousness and anxiety to appease , but after the manner of victims Darsie felt a perverse satisfaction in rejecting overtures , even when by so doing she doubly punished herself .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 9]: `` I do n't mean to say goodbye .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 12]: I do n't wish to see any one before I go .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 5]: I hate scenes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 5]: `` Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 7]: just as you please , dear .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 11]: After all , it is for a very short time .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 7]: Eight weeks will soon pass . ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 2]: Silence .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 27]: Every youthful face at the table was set in an eloquent declaration that eight weeks was an eternity , a waste , a desert of space .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 12]: Mr Garnett put down his newspaper and hurriedly left the room .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 34]: He had the usual male horror of scenes , and , moreover , Darsie was his special pet , and his own nerves were on edge at the thought of the coming separation .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 22]: If the child cried or appealed to him for protection , he would not like to say what he might do .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 36]: Flight appeared to be his safest course , but Darsie felt a pang of disappointment and wounded love at this desertion of her cause , and the smart did not help to improve her temper .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 27]: `` Aunt Maria wishes to see you , dear , as soon as you have finished your breakfast , '' continued Mrs Garnett , elaborately conciliatory .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 35]: `` Father and I are very grateful to her for her interest in you , but you know , dear , how we feel about losing you , how we sympathise with your disappointment !
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 24]: We are convinced that in the end this chance will be for your benefit ; but in the meantime it is very hard .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 9]: We are sorry for you , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 17]: `` And I , '' declared Darsie coldly , `` am sorry for Aunt Maria ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 22]: She pushed back her chair and stalked out of the room , while her brothers and sisters stared after her agape .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 33]: Along the narrow oil - clothed hall she went , up the steep , narrow staircase to the little third-floor bedroom , the only place on earth which was her very own .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 31]: There was nothing luxurious about it , nothing of any intrinsic value or beauty , but in the eyes of its occupant every separate article was a pearl of price .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 23]: All her treasures were here -- her pictures , her ornaments , her books , mementoes of journeyings , offerings of friends .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 13]: It was a shrine , a refuge from the cold outer world .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 40]: Alone in `` my room '' one lost the insignificance of a member of a large family , and became a responsible human being face to face with personal trials and responsibilities ... Eight weeks out of a life !
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 38]: To the adult mind a sacrifice of so short a period may be a disappointment , but can hardly be deemed a trial ; to schoolgirl fifteen it may seem a catastrophe which clouds the whole horizon .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 28]: To Darsie Garnett the change of plan was the first real sorrow of her life , and these moments of reflection were full of a suffocating misery .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 9]: Anticipated joys rose before her with intolerable distinctness .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 16]: She saw her companions happily at play , and felt a stabbing dart of jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 16]: Yes , they would forget all about her and feel no loss from her absence !
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 24]: Clemence and Vie would enjoy their _ tete-a-tete _ , would be unwilling to admit a third into their conferences at her return .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 10]: Dan would take them for boating and fishing expeditions .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 10]: Dan would grow to like Clemence better than herself !
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 11]: Darsie gave a little sob of misery at the thought .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 59]: She had no sentimental feelings as regards Dan , or any one else at this period of her life , but as the one _ big _ boy , almost man , of her acquaintance Dan stood on a pedestal by himself as a lofty and superior being , whose favour was one of the prizes of life .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 23]: That Dan should become more intimate , more friendly with Clemence and Lavender than with herself was a possibility fraught with dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 26]: Darsie sobbed again , but her eyes were dry ; she was angry , too angry to cry ; her heart was seething with rebellion .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 41]: Some one knocked at the door and received no answer , knocked again and was curtly ordered to `` go away '' ; then Mr Garnett 's voice spoke , in gentle and conciliatory tones -- `` It 's father !
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 22]: Let me in , dear ; I 've just a minute ... '' It was impossible to refuse such a request .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 35]: Darsie opened the door , and there he stood , tall and thin , with the embarrassed _ boy _ look upon his face which always made him seem especially near to his children .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 35]: It was the look he wore when they were in trouble and he essayed to lecture and advise , and it seemed to say , `` I 've been there myself ; I understand !
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 26]: Now it 's my part to play the heavy father , but _ I 'm not nearly so much shocked as I pretend _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 7]: To-day his manner was frankly commiserating .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 7]: `` Well , Kiddie , dear !
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 25]: I was running off to town like a coward , but at the last moment I was obliged to come up for a word .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 25]: It 's hard lines for you , dear , and I want you to know that it 's hard lines for me , too !
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 16]: The country wo n't be half so jolly as if we 'd all been together .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 13]: I 'll miss you _ badly _ , little lass ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 5]: _ Do n't _ !
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 4]: I 'll howl .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 9]: _ Do n't _ make me howl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 26]: pleaded Darsie hastily , the tight feeling about her eyes and lips giving place to an alarming weepiness at the sound of the tender words .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 19]: `` If you really care , father , could n't you -- could n't you possibly refuse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 6]: Mr Garnett shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 4]: That 's settled .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 17]: We talked it over , mother and I , and agreed that it must be done .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 17]: It 's a duty , dear , and we ca n't shelve duties in this life .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 27]: I 'm sorry for you in your disappointment , and only wish I could help , but in this matter no one can help but yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 9]: You can do a lot if you try .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 33]: Shall I tell you , Darsie , how you could get over your regret , and turn your visit to Arden into something far more agreeable than you can now imagine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 11]: Darsie cocked an eye at him , suspicious and hesitating .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 6]: He was going to preach !
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 21]: She knew the symptoms of old , and by way of counter-action put on her most dour and sullen expression .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 4]: `` Um ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 10]: `` Very well , then , here it is !
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 20]: Turn your back on the might-have-been , and try with all your might to like what _ is _ !
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 20]: Aunt Maria will , I know , be all that is kind and indulgent -- in her own way !
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 17]: It wo n't be _ your _ way , however , and that 's the rub .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 70]: If you begin your visit in a spirit of irritation , I 'm afraid you are going to have a pretty poor time , but if you try to enjoy every little thing that comes along out of which enjoyment can be squeezed and to _ laugh _ at the rest , to laugh instead of to cry -- well , it 's astonishing how the scene will change !
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 8]: Do you think you could try ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 7]: Darsie pouted , sulky and unconvinced .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 12]: `` Were _ you _ resigned when you were fifteen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 6]: `` No , my lassie !
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 6]: I was n't , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 11]: Very far from it , I 'm sorry to say .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 31]: But when one has travelled on for many years and come many a cropper on the way one _ does _ long to show one 's children the short cuts !
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 8]: That 's _ one _ short cut .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 14]: Darsie ; I wish you 'd take it , and avoid the falls .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 16]: If you ca n't have what you like , try to like what you have .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 6]: Expect good , not evil .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 40]: Say to yourself every morning : ` This is going to be a good day , a happy day , one of the happiest days of my life , ' and then you are half-way towards making it so .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 4]: Poor little Kiddie !
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 43]: it sounds hard , but try it -- try it -- and occasionally , just for a change , forget that you are Darsie Garnett for five minutes or so at a time , and pretend instead that you are Maria Hayes !
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 34]: Pretend that you are old and lonely and ailing in health , and that there 's a young girl staying with you from whom you are hoping to enjoy some brightness and variety !
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 2]: Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 20]: The other morning in church you were beside me when we were singing ` Fight the good fight ! '
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 12]: You sang it heartily , Darsie ; I enjoyed your singing .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 13]: -- I thought you looked as if you really meant the words .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 11]: Well , here 's the battlefield for you , dear !
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 7]: Are you going to play coward ?
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 6]: I do n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 8]: I think better of my girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 12]: He laid his hand on her shoulder with a caressing touch .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 47]: Darsie wriggled and screwed up her little nose in eloquent grimace , but when the hand crept up to her chin she lifted her face for the farewell kiss , and even volunteered an extra one on her own account on the dear , thin cheek .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 12]: Mr Garnett smiled contentedly to himself as he descended the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 19]: Darsie had made no promises , but he was satisfied that his words had not been in vain .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 50]: And Darsie , left alone in her room , fell instinctively to repeating the words of the grand old hymn -- `` Run the straight race through God 's good grace , Lift up thine eyes , and seek His Face ... '' A little sob punctuated the lines .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 15]: To the blind eyes of earth the straight race appeared so very very crooked !
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 3]: FIRST DAYS .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 27]: Darsie left home on the following Thursday , and in company with Aunt Maria and `` my woman '' took train for Arden , in Buckinghamshire .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 32]: The journey was a nightmare , for Lady Hayes disliked travelling , and was in a condition of nervousness , which made her acutely susceptible to the doings of her companions .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 81]: Within an hour of starting Darsie had been admonished not to sit facing the engine because of the draught , not to look out of the window in case she got a cinder in her eye , not to read in case she strained her eyes , not to rub her fingers on the pane , not to cross her knees because it was unladylike , not to shout , not to mumble , not to say `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 17]: not to yawn without putting her finger over her mouth , etcetera , etcetera , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 24]: Being called to account so frequently was an exhausting process , and Darsie felt a thrill of joy at the announcement of lunch .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 30]: A meal in a train would be a novel and exciting experience which would go far towards making up for the dullness of the preceding hour , but alas !
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 48]: Aunt Maria refused with scorn to partake of food , cooked goodness knew how , by goodness knew whom , and had supplied herself with a few Plasmon biscuits , the which she handed round with the information that they contained more nourishment than ounces of beefsteak .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 47]: They were very dull and very dry , however , and Darsie managed to get a crumb down the wrong way , and coughed continuously for the next hour in a tickling , aggravating manner , while Aunt Maria reiterated , `` Really , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 6]: _ Most _ unpleasant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 8]: and seemed to consider herself personally aggrieved .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 35]: When Arden was reached the position improved , for stationmaster and porters alike flew to hover round the great lady of the neighbourhood , and Darsie sunned herself in the novel consciousness of importance .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 35]: Outside the station a cart was waiting for luggage , and a large , old - fashioned barouche with two fat brown horses , and with two brown - liveried servants upon the box .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 27]: The village children bobbed curtsies as the carriage bowled through the village street , and Darsie smiled benignly and bent her yellow head in gracious acknowledgment .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 20]: As niece and guest of the Lady of the Towers , these greetings were surely partly intended for herself .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 23]: She felt an exhilarating glow of complacence , and determined to describe the scene to Vie Vernon on the earliest possible opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 19]: The Towers was a large , very ugly , stucco house , surrounded by a beautiful rolling park .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 38]: Inside , the rooms were huge and square , and one and all characterised by a depressing pitch of orderliness , which made it almost impossible to believe that they could be used as ordinary human habitations !
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 36]: Darsie was escorted to a bedroom with ponderous mahogany furniture , so complete a contrast from her own shabby , cheery little den that the sight of it added the final touch to her depression .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 50]: She refreshed herself by a long splash in hot water , brushed out her tangled mane , put on her Sunday dress , and descended in state to partake of dinner , which was served an hour earlier than usual in consideration of the travellers ' hunger and fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 40]: Despite her weariness and nervous exhaustion , Lady Hayes had made what appeared to Darsie 's unsophisticated eyes a magnificent toilette for the meal , and she eyed the Sunday frock with a criticism which was anything but approving .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 53]: `` But it 's the best I 've got , except the party one , and I ca n't wear that for one old lady , '' said Darsie to herself as she followed meekly behind the _ moire antique _ train , and seated herself at the end of the dining-table .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 8]: Two men-servants stood at attention -- two !
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 41]: one for each diner , solemn , immovable-looking creatures who seemed to move on wheels and who kept their eyes glued upon every mouthful you ate , ready to pounce upon your plate and nip it swiftly and noiselessly away .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 32]: They were stricken with dumbness also , if you were to trust the evidence of your senses , but had certainly ears , and could drink in every word you said .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 27]: For the rest , it might be soothing to one 's pride to live in a big country house , but it was certainly abnormally dull .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 32]: The day 's programme never varied by a hair 's breadth , and Aunt Maria , though kind , possessed the failing of all others most trying to the youthful mind .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 5]: _ She fussed _ !
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 54]: She fussed about clothes , she fussed about food , she fussed about draughts , she fussed about manners , deportment , speech , the way you sat down , the way you got up , the way you laughed , yawned , sneezed , crossed the room , and did your hair .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 15]: From morning to night , `` My dear , _ do n't _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 10]: or `` My dear , _ do _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 15]: rang in Darsie 's ears , till she was almost beside herself with irritation .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 76]: Honestly and laboriously she tried to practise her father 's advice : to put the thought of the seaside party aside , make the most of the good points of her own position , and `` fight the good fight , '' but the effort seemed to exhaust her physically , as well as mentally , until by the end of the day she looked white and drooping , pathetically unlike her natural glowing self .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 28]: Aunt Maria noticed the change , and fussed about that , too , but with an underlying tenderness that was upsetting to the girl 's strained nerves .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 10]: `` You look very tired to-night , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 5]: Are you not well ?
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 7]: Is there anything the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 7]: `` Quite well , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 5]: Only -- lonely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 26]: replied Darsie , with a plaintive accent on that last word which brought Lady Hayes 's glance upon her in quick inquiry -- `` Lonely !
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 17]: But , my dear , you have n't been a minute alone all day long . ''
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 24]: `` No , '' agreed Darsie meekly , and said no more , but the little monosyllable was more eloquent than any disclaimer .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 11]: Lady Hayes flushed , and knitted her brows in thought .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 11]: `` I must ask some young people to meet you .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 12]: I have some nice young friends living about a mile away .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 12]: They are visiting at present , but will soon be home .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 4]: I will write .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 8]: Naturally you miss the young society . ''
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 52]: She was so kind , so considerate , that it seemed mean to feel bored and impatient ; but , oh dear , how long the days _ did _ seem , how dull and monotonous the morning drive , the afternoon needlework , the evening game of patience or bezique .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 34]: The climax came one rainy afternoon when the ordinary two-hours drive could not take place , and the hostess and her young guest had spent most of the day together in the library .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 47]: Now it is trying for an old lady as well as for a young one to be deprived of the usual exercise , and if Darsie 's impatience and rebelliousness of spirit were more acute than usual , Lady Hayes was also more nervous and exacting .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 20]: In this instance the weight of the old lady 's displeasure seemed to fall upon Darsie 's unfortunate coiffure .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 20]: Whatever turn the conversation might take , it returned with relentless certainty to `` Your hair , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 15]: When _ I _ was young , young girls wore their hair neatly braided .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 9]: I intensely dislike all this purring and elaboration .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 13]: You would look a different girl if you brushed it smoothly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 9]: `` I should , '' agreed Darsie coolly .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 7]: `` I should look a sight .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 12]: _ My _ pompadour is the best pompadour in my class .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 6]: The girls all say so .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 8]: They ask me how I do it .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 12]: I 've taught lots of them to do their own . ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 8]: `` I 'm sorry to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 17]: Time enough when you come out to wear ` pompadours , ' as you call them .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 4]: And your bow !
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 3]: Ridiculous size !
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 18]: If it were neat and small -- '' `` They wear them twice as big in America .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 4]: And in France .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 3]: Sash ribbons !
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 10]: I would , too , if I could afford .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 8]: It 's the fashion , Aunt Maria .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 7]: Every one wears them big . ''
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 24]: `` Surely that is all the more reason why a sensible girl should set a good example by being neat and moderate herself !
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 32]: I do n't approve of hair being allowed to grow long at your age , but if it _ is _ long , it ought certainly to be kept in bounds .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 11]: Yours is hanging all over your shoulders at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 3]: Most untidy !
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 9]: I am speaking for your own good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 42]: There was a moment 's chilly silence , then Darsie asked in a tone of extraordinary politeness -- `` Just exactly _ how _ would you do my hair , Aunt Maria , if you were in my place to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 6]: Lady Hayes straightened herself briskly .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 13]: `` I should _ brush _ it , '' she said emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 25]: `` It is naturally curly , no doubt , but I can not believe that a good brushing would not reduce it to order !
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 28]: I should damp it and brush it well , and then tie it back so that it would not hang loose over your shoulders like a mane .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 13]: It would be pleasant to see what a difference it would make .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 18]: A neat head is one of the things which every young gentlewoman should strive to possess . ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 26]: Darsie folded her needlework , put it neatly away in her bag , and , rising from her seat , marched slowly from the room .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 50]: It was nearing the hour for tea , when she usually went upstairs to wash and tidy-up generally , so that there was nothing unusual in her departure ; it was only when she was safe inside her room that the extraordinary nature of to-day 's preparations was revealed .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 40]: She took off the lace collar and pretty bead necklace which gave an air of lightness to her plain dark dress , wrapped a dressing-jacket round her shoulders , and dipped her head deep into a basin of water .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 41]: Then with a comb the _ wet _ hair was parted accurately in the centre , and brushed to the ears till it had the air of being painted rather than real , so smooth and plastered was the effect .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 34]: The ends , plaited with merciless tightness , were looped together with a fragment of a broken shoelace , so tightly that from the front no sign of their presence could be suspected .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 17]: When all was finished and the dressing-jacket thrown aside the effect was positively startling to behold .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 44]: It did not seem possible to believe that this prim , demure damsel could be the same brilliant-looking creature who had entered the room but ten minutes before , and Darsie herself was half-shocked , half-triumphant at the completeness of the transformation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 11]: ` Spose I had a fever and lost my hair !
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 5]: How simply awful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 7]: she said to herself in terror .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 17]: `` If they could see me at home , they 'd never call me pretty again .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 9]: I think even Aunt Maria will jump ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 42]: She skipped with delight at the possibility , and the gesture seemed so singularly out of keeping with her appearance that she laughed again , restored to good temper by the delightful experience of taking part in a prank once more .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 42]: Ten minutes later , accurately at the moment when the tea equipage would be in course of arrangement in the drawing-room , Darsie composed her face into a `` prunes and prism '' decorum , and slipped noiselessly into the room .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 11]: To a certain extent all was as she had expected .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 76]: Mason stood majestically over the tea-table ; James , his satellite , approached with a tray of cakes and sandwiches ; Aunt Maria sat waiting in her high-backed chair -- so far all was just as she had planned ; what she was all unprepared for , however , was the presence of three youthful visitors , two girls and a youth , who sat facing the door , staring at her in stunned dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 3]: The Percivals !
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 35]: By all that was ill-timed and embarrassing , the Percivals themselves , returned from their visit , choosing a wet afternoon to drive over and pay their respects to Lady Hayes 's young guest !
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 75]: Sheer horror of the situation took away Darsie 's breath ; she stood stock still in the middle of the floor , felt her lips gape apart , the crimson rush to her face , saw in a mental flash a vision of the country bumpkin she must appear -- just for a moment , then Aunt Maria 's voice said , in even , equable tones -- `` Ah , here she is !
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 13]: Darsie , these are my young friends of whom I have spoken .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 9]: I am pleased that you should become acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 6]: My niece , Darsie Garnett .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 15]: Noreen , Ida , and Ralph Percival ... Now we will have tea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 10]: The voice , the manner , were absolutely normal .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 11]: Was it possible that she had not _ seen _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 34]: Darsie shot a quick glance at the old lady 's face , met an unconcerned smile , and for the first time in the history of their acquaintance felt a thrill of admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 19]: Splendid to have such self - control , to show _ no _ sign of surprise or irritation !
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 17]: She shook hands awkwardly with the three visitors , and sat down on the nearest chair .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 9]: `` So awfully pleased to meet you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 4]: cried Noreen gushingly .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 17]: She was a smart-looking girl of sixteen , with brown eyes and a deeply dimpled chin .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 28]: Darsie knew exactly what she was thinking -- understood that the gushing manner had been adopted to disguise dismayed disappointment in the aspect of a possible companion .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 32]: Ralph was quite old -- eighteen at least , with well-cut features , thin lips , and small grey eyes , a dandy wearing a fancy waistcoat and resplendent white spats .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 13]: His whole aspect breathed a loud , `` I told you so !
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 9]: You _ would _ drag me with you .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 9]: _ Told _ you how it would be .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 5]: Lady Hayes 's grand-niece !
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 6]: What could you expect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 7]: Ida was bubbling over with curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 17]: What a fine story she would have to tell to the family party on her return !
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 40]: Conversation would have dragged pitifully if it had not been for Aunt Maria 's efforts , for the visitors seemed smitten with dumbness , and beneath no the fire of their glances Darsie 's embarrassment increased rather than diminished .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 19]: She had no spirit left ; a succession of monosyllables and an occasional `` Oh , really ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 11]: made up the sum of her contributions to the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 26]: It must have been a strong sense of duty which nerved Noreen Percival to offer the invitation which presumably was the object of her visit .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 22]: `` We want to know if you will come to lunch with us on Thursday , and stay for the afternoon ?
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 11]: If it 's fine , we can have some tennis .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 9]: We will drive you back after tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 15]: Darsie hesitated , but apparently the decision was not to be left to her .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 30]: Aunt Maria accepted with a gracious acknowledgment of Mrs Percival 's kindness , and in answer to a scowl from Ralph his sisters rose and made a hasty adieu .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 8]: `` We came in the governess cart .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 11]: The pony gets restless -- must n't keep him waiting .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 7]: Thank you _ so _ much !
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 3]: Goodbye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 12]: They were gone ; the outer door was shut behind them .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 44]: Darsie , standing by the tea-table , caught a glimpse of her own reflection in a mirror at the opposite end of the room , a stiff , Dutch-doll of a figure , with plastered hair , crimson cheeks , and plain frock .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 19]: She glanced at Aunt Maria reseating herself in her high-backed chair , and taking up the inevitable knitting .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 4]: Now for it !
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 5]: now for the lecture !
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 39]: Well , after all , she had in only done what had been suggested , a trifle _ more _ perhaps than had been suggested , but that was erring on the right side , not the wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 29]: Besides , if a naughty impulse to annoy and humiliate Aunt Maria had really existed , in the end she had been a thousand times more humiliated herself .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 18]: And now , if you please , she was to be scolded and lectured into the bargain !
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 8]: But Aunt Maria neither lectured nor scolded .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 60]: All through that next hour when pride kept Darsie chained to her place , the older lady talked in her most natural manner , and even smiled at her companion across the patience-board without a flicker of expression to betray that the figure confronting her was in any way different from the one which she was accustomed to see .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 39]: Once more admiration vanquished irritation , and Darsie roused herself to join in the problem of `` building , '' and ended in actually feeling a dawning of interest in what had hitherto appeared the dreariest of problems .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 33]: When seven o'clock struck , and the old lady closed the board , and said , in her natural , every-day voice , `` And now we must dress for dinner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 26]: Darsie walked slowly across the room , hesitated , and finally retraced her steps and knelt down on a footstool by Lady Hayes ' side .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 8]: `` Aunt Maria -- _ please _ !
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 8]: I should like to thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 7]: `` Thank me , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 4]: For what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 7]: `` For -- for saying nothing !
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 12]: For not crowing over me as you might have done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 29]: The flushed , upturned face was very sweet -- all the sweeter perhaps for the plastered hair , which gave to it so quaint and old-world an air .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 20]: Lady Hayes laid a wrinkled hand on the girl 's shoulder ; her eyes twinkled humorously through her spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 11]: `` No , I wo n't crow , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 5]: That would be ungenerous .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 9]: Circumstances have been pretty hard on you already .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 19]: This -- this little exhibition was not intended for an audience , but for my own private edification .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 17]: It was unfortunate that the Percivals should have chosen such a moment for their first call .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 8]: I was sorry for your discomfiture . ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 8]: `` You ought n't to have been !
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 8]: I _ meant _ to be naughty .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 11]: Oh , you 've scored -- scored all the way .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 26]: I apologise in dust and ashes , but please -- if you will be very noble -- _ never _ speak of it again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 32]: She reached the door once more , was about to make a bolt for the staircase , when Lady Hayes 's voice called to her to return -- `` Darsie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 7]: `` Come here , child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 20]: The thin hand was held out to meet hers , the kind old eyes looked wonderfully soft and tender .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 22]: `` I think it is only fair to tell you that ... in your own language , you have scored also !
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 16]: ... Oblige me by doing your hair in your ordinary fashion for the future ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 12]: `` Oh , Aunt Maria , you _ duck _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 28]: cried Darsie , and for the first time in her life flung her arms voluntarily around the old lady 's neck and gave her a sounding kiss .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 3]: THE PERCIVALS .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 35]: It was really rather fun dressing for the visit to the Percivals on Thursday ; trying to make oneself look one 's _ very _ best , and imagining their surprise at the transformation !
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 45]: Aunt Maria , too , seemed quite to enter into the spirit of the thing , inquired anxiously _ which _ dress , and gave special instructions that it should be ironed afresh , so that it might appear at its freshest and best .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 38]: `` My woman '' had evidently been instructed to take the young guest 's wardrobe under her care , since new ribbons and frilling now appeared with engaging frequency , giving quite an air to half-worn garments .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 73]: Darsie in a blue muslin dress , with a white straw hat wreathed with daisies , and her golden locks floating past her waist , made a charming picture of youth and happiness as she sat in the old barouche , and when the hall was reached Aunt Maria cast a keen glance around the grounds , transparently eager to discover the young people and share in the fun of the meeting .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 49]: Ralph was nowhere to be seen , that was _ not _ to be wondered at under the circumstances , but the two girls were on duty on the tennis-lawn in front of the house , ready to come forward and welcome their guest immediately upon her arrival .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 27]: The blank gapes of bewilderment with which they witnessed the alighting of the radiant blue and gold apparition afforded keen delight both to aunt and niece .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 39]: They were literally incapable of speech , and even after Aunt Maria had driven away , coughing in the most suspicious manner behind a raised hand , even then conversation was of the most jerky and spasmodic kind .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 33]: It was amusing enough for a time , but for a whole afternoon it would certainly pall , and Darsie _ did _ want to enjoy herself when she had a chance .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 29]: She decided that it was time to put matters on a right footing , and looked smilingly to right and left , at her embarrassed , tongue-tied companions .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 18]: `` I think , '' said Darsie politely , `` that I owe you an explanation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 36]: She explained , and Noreen and Ida pealed with laughter , and danced up and down on the gravel path , and slid their hands through her arm , vowing undying friendship on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 5]: `` How per-fectly killing !
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 13]: I do _ love _ a girl who is up to pranks .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 6]: _ What _ a prank !
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 14]: How you _ must _ have felt when you saw us sitting there !
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 11]: And Lady Hayes -- what _ did _ she say ?
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 6]: Was she per-fectly furious ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 12]: `` Aunt Maria behaved like an angel , a dignified angel !
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 7]: I never liked her so much .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 7]: How did _ you _ feel ?
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 16]: Tell me just exactly your sentiments when you saw me walking into that room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 16]: `` I certainly did feel upset , because we _ had _ to ask you !
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 24]: Mother said we must , and we asked each other what on _ earth _ should we do with you all day long .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 9]: Ida did say that your eyes were pretty .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 13]: She was the only one who stuck up for you at all !
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 10]: I thought you looked too appalling for words . ''
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 8]: `` What did your brother say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 50]: asked Darsie with natural feminine curiosity , whereupon Noreen answered with unabashed candour -- `` He said you were ` a rummy little frump , ' and that he would take very good care to have an engagement for to-day as many miles as possible away from home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 7]: `` Did he , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 8]: The colour rose in Darsie 's cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 10]: `` Well , I 'm very glad he did .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 16]: I like girls best , and I thought _ he _ looked conceited and proud .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 19]: My best friend has a big brother , too , but he 's not a bit like yours .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 11]: Rather shaggy , but _ so _ clever and kind !
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 20]: He promised to write to me while I was here , just because he knew I should be dull .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 15]: It 's really an honour , you know , for he is terrifically clever .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 11]: Every one says he will be Prime Minister one day .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 6]: He 's going to Cambridge .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 10]: Your brother is , too , is n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 17]: I should n't think they would be at _ all _ in the same set ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 10]: The Percival girls looked at each other and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 5]: `` Poor old Ralph !
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 5]: Is n't she blighting ?
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 11]: You do n't know anything about him , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 35]: It 's only because he called you a frump , but never mind , he has to be back to tea to look after some work for father , and then he 'll see !
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 19]: If you are going to be friends with us , you must n't begin by disliking our brother .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 27]: He may be conceited , but he is certainly not ` shaggy , ' and he is much nicer to his sisters than most big boys .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 11]: He thinks we are really nicer than other girls . ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 5]: Darsie regarded them critically .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 9]: `` Well , I think you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 4]: she conceded graciously .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 19]: `` Oh , how thankful I am that there is some one _ young _ in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 9]: I was beginning to feel so painfully middle-aged .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 7]: Let 's sit down and talk .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 5]: Tell me about yourselves .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 6]: Do you go to school ?
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 3]: Which school ?
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 7]: Do you go in for exams ?
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 8]: What subjects do you like best ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 8]: Noreen laughed , and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 6]: `` We have a governess .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 24]: We are going for a year to a finishing school in Paris , but mother does n't approve of exams , for girls .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 28]: She wants us to be able to play , and sing , and draw , and speak German and French , and she says that 's enough .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 17]: We do n't bother about Latin or mathematics or any of those dull old things . ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 6]: `` They are not dull .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 4]: They 're glorious .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 5]: I revel in them .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 15]: But you 're rich , of course , and wo n't have to work .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 17]: I shall have to earn money myself , so I want to pass all the exams .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 4]: I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 7]: The Percivals stared in solemn surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 12]: The idea was so strange it took some time to digest .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 31]: All their friends were well off like themselves ; really , when they came to think of it , they had never met a prospective _ working _ girl before !
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 10]: They regarded Darsie with a curiosity tinged with compassion .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 8]: `` Do you mean it -- really ?
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 5]: Tell us about yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 6]: Where do you live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 18]: `` In Birchester , Craven Street , Sandon terrace -- the corner house in Sandon Terrace . ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 4]: `` Craven Street .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 3]: Really ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 33]: The girls were plainly shocked , but Ida rallied bravely , and said in her most courteous air : `` It must be so _ interesting _ to live in a street !
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 5]: So much to see .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 14]: And have you _ very _ interesting people living across the road ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 3]: Rather dull .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 18]: Husbands and wives , and one old bachelor with a leg -- lame leg , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 26]: No one at all thrilling , but our friends -- our _ best _ friends -- live in a terrace at right angles with ours .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 7]: We have great times with them .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 10]: I 'll tell you about our latest craze . ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 52]: Noreen and Ida sat breathlessly listening to the history of the telegraph , till it was time to go into the house for lunch , when Darsie was introduced to Mrs Percival , a very smartly dressed lady , who looked astonishingly young to be the mother of a grown-up family .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 52]: After lunch the three girls attempted tennis , but gave it up in deference to the visitor 's lack of skill , visited stables and kennels and conservatory , and were again brought face to , face with the different points of view existing between the town and the country dweller .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 24]: `` Do all people who live in the country go and stare at their horses and dogs every day of their lives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 51]: demanded Darsie with an air of patient resignation , as Noreen and Ida patted , and whistled , and rubbed the noses of their four-footed friends , fed them with dainty morsels , and pointed out good points in technical terms which were as Greek in the listener 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 27]: `` Aunt Maria goes every single day ; it 's a part of the regular programme , like knitting in the afternoon and Patience at night .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 9]: I get -- _ so _ bored ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 19]: The shocked looks which the Percival sisters turned upon her seemed ludicrously out of proportion with the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 14]: `` Do n't you -- do n't you _ love _ animals ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 7]: `` Certainly -- in their place .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 30]: But I _ can not _ see the interest in staring in through a stable door at the same horses standing munching in the same stalls day after day .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 14]: It 's no use pretending that I can , '' declared Darsie obstinately .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 15]: `` And the dogs make such a noise , and drag at your clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 8]: I 'm always thankful to get away .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 13]: Let 's go back to the garden and look at the flowers .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 8]: I could stare at flowers for ages .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 19]: It seems too glorious to be true to be able to pick as many roses as you like .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 43]: At home mother buys a sixpenny bunch on Saturday , and cuts the stalks every day , and puts them into fresh water to make them last as long as possible , and we have nasturtiums for the rest of the week .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 10]: I love the fruit and vegetable garden , too .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 10]: It 's so amusing to see how things grow !
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 31]: Especially , '' -- she laughed mischievously , showing a whole nest of baby dimples in one pink cheek , `` I warn you frankly that this is a hint !
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 10]: -- especially things you can _ eat _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 6]: Noreen and Ida chuckled sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 4]: `` Come along !
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 9]: There is still a bed of late strawberries .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 30]: We 'll take camp-stools from the summer-house , and you shall sit and feast until you are tired , and we 'll sit and watch you , and talk .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 29]: We seem to have had strawberries at every meal for weeks past , and are quite tired of the sight , so you can have undisturbed possession . ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 20]: `` And I , '' said Darsie with a sigh , `` have never in my life had enough !
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 18]: It will be quite an epoch to go on eating until I _ want _ to stop .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 18]: That 's the worst of a large family , the dainties divide into such tiny shares ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 30]: Ten minutes later the three girls had taken up their position in the kitchen garden in a spot which to the town-bred girl seemed ideal for comfort and beauty .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 28]: The strawberry-bed ran along the base of an old brick wall on which the branches of peach-trees stretched out in the formal upward curves of great candelabra .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 49]: An old apple-tree curved obligingly over the gravel path to form a protection from the sun , and it was the prettiest thing in the world to glance up through the branches with their clusters of tiny green apples , and see the patches of blue sky ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 23]: Darsie sat stretching out her hand to pluck one big strawberry after another , an expression of beatific contentment on her face .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 15]: `` Yes -- it 's scrumptious to live in the country -- in summer !
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 30]: If it were always like this I 'd want to stay for ever , but it must be dreadfully dull in winter , when everything is dead and still .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 9]: I should n't like it a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 3]: No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 7]: the Percival girls protested in chorus .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 17]: `` It 's beautiful always , and livelier than ever , for there 's the hunting .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 10]: Hunting is just _ the _ most delightful sport !
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 16]: We hunt once a week always , and often twice -- the most exciting runs .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 14]: We are sorry , absolutely sorry when spring comes to stop us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 8]: `` Oh , do you hunt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 11]: Darsie was quite quelled by the thought of such splendour .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 33]: In town it was rare even to see a girl on horseback ; a hunt was a thing which you read about , but never expected to behold with your own eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 20]: The knowledge that her new friends actually participated in this lordly sport raised them to a pinnacle of importance .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 22]: She munched strawberries in thoughtful silence for several moments before recovering enough spirit to enter another plea in favour of town .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 18]: `` Well , anyway -- if you _ do n't _ hunt , it must be dull .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 5]: _ And _ lonely !
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 15]: Are n't you scared to death walking along dark lanes without a single lamppost ?
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 24]: I should live in terror of tramps and burglars , and never dare to stir out of the house after three o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 13]: `` No you would n't , if you were accustomed to it .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 28]: Our maids come home quite happily at ten o'clock at night , but if they go to a city they are nervous in the brightly lit streets .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 9]: That 's curious , but it 's true .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 37]: We used to leave doors and windows open all day long , and hardly trouble to lock up at night , until a few months ago when we had a scare which made us more careful .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 14]: Till then we trusted every one , and every one trusted us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 5]: `` A scare ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 9]: Darsie pricked her ears , scenting an excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 4]: `` What scare ?
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 4]: Do tell me !
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 5]: I love gruesome stories .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 4]: What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 3]: Thieves ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 4]: Noreen nodded solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 5]: It 's gruesome enough .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 22]: Simply horrid for us , for so many other people lost their -- but I 'll tell you from the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 19]: It was the night of the Hunt Ball at Rakeham , and the house was crammed with visitors .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 12]: We were allowed to sit up to see them all start .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 23]: They looked so lovely -- the men in their pink coats , and the ladies in their very best dresses and jewels .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 39]: Well , it was about half-past seven ; the ladies had gone upstairs to dress about half an hour before , when suddenly there was a great noise and clamour , and some one shouted ` Fire ! '
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 8]: and pealed an alarm on the gong .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 17]: No one knew where it was , but you never heard such a hubbub and excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 44]: Doors opened all down the corridors , and the ladies rushed out in dressing-gowns and dressing - jackets , with hair half done , or streaming down their backs , shrieking and questioning , and clinging to one another , and rushing downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 23]: The men were more sensible ; they took it quite calmly , and just set to work to put the fire out .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 39]: It was in a little room on the second floor , and the strange thing was that it had n't been used for months , and no one could account for there being a fire there at all .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 33]: After a little time one of the men came out into the corridor , and said : ` There 's something wrong about this -- this is not the result of accident !
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 12]: I do n't like the look of it at all . '
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 34]: Then he turned to the ladies , who were all huddled together , gasping and questioning , with their maids and the other servants in the background , and said : ` Ladies !
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 14]: I advise you to go back to your rooms as quickly as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 21]: There is not the slightest danger , but it might be just as well to look after your jewellery ! '
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 8]: `` You should have heard them shriek !
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 41]: They turned and rushed like rabbits , and the maids rushed after them , shrieking too , but that was nothing to the noise two minutes after , when they got back to their rooms and found their jewels gone !
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 42]: They were laid out ready to be put on , on the dressing-tables , and the alarm had been cleverly timed to give the ladies enough time to get half dressed , but not enough to have put on their jewellery .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 13]: Only one out of all the party had put on her necklace .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 6]: She _ was _ pleased !
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 24]: `` Well , they shrieked , and shrieked , and some of the men left the fire and came upstairs to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 45]: Captain Beverley was the smartest , and he just tore along the corridor to a dressing-room over the billiard - room , and there was a man letting himself drop out of the window , and scrambling over the billiard-room roof to the ground !
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 15]: Captain Beverley gave the alarm , and the servants rushed out to give chase .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 27]: It was very dark , and they could not tell how many men there were , for they kept dodging in and out among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 53]: Some people said there were only two , and some said they saw four , but only one was caught that night -- an idle , loafing young fellow who had been staying at the village inn for a few weeks , pretending to be a city clerk convalescing after an illness .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 29]: The worst of it was that he had only a few of the smaller things in his pockets , none of the really big , valuable pieces . ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 4]: `` Goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 7]: Darsie 's eyes sparkled with animation .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 8]: `` That _ was _ an excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 7]: I wish I 'd been here .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 3]: Go on !
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 6]: What happened after that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 11]: `` Oh , my dear , the most awful evening !
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 35]: The visitors had all brought their very _ best _ things , as the Hunt Ball is a great occasion , and they almost all cried , and one poor lady went into hysterics .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 40]: Her father had been an ambassador and had all sorts of wonderful orders and things which she had had made into brooches and pendants , and they could never be replaced , no matter how much money she spent .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 25]: Dinner was the most weepy meal you can imagine , and only one or two of the sensible ones went on to the ball .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 16]: The others stayed at home and moped , and mother had to stay , too .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 3]: Poor dear !
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 22]: she had to keep calm , and comfort every one else , when she 'd lost all her own pet things .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 39]: There was one string of pearls which has been in our family for generations , and each new owner adds a few more pearls , so that it gets longer and longer , and more and more valuable .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 11]: It would have belonged to Ralph 's wife some day .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 10]: He was so funny about it , so disappointed !
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 9]: He kept saying : ` Poor little girl !
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 8]: it _ is _ rough luck ! '
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 20]: We said : ` Why pity her , when you have n't the least idea who she is ? '
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 23]: He said : ` Why not , when I know very well that I _ shall _ know some day ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 7]: Darsie smiled with politely concealed impatience .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 28]: She was not in the least interested in Ralph 's problematical wife , but she was devoured with anxiety to hear further particulars of the exciting burglary .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 5]: `` Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 3]: Go on !
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 10]: You said they only caught one man that night .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 11]: That means , I suppose -- '' `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 4]: Noreen sighed tragically .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 9]: `` That was the saddest part of it .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 14]: The next morning they found another man lying just outside the walled garden .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 46]: He had scrambled up , holding on to the fruit-trees , and had then jumped down and broken his leg , and he was not a stranger , but one of our very own men -- an under-gardener whom we had all liked so much .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 55]: Father believed that he had been bribed and led away by the man from London , and offered to let him off if he would tell all he knew , how many thieves there had been , and give the names and descriptions of the ones who had escaped , but he would n't .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 6]: Nothing would make him speak .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 27]: We all tried in turns , and then the Vicar came and was shut up with him for an age , but it was no use .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 15]: They say ` there 's honour among thieves , ' and it 's true .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 23]: He would n't give the others away , so the two were sent to prison together , and they are there still .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 30]: Father says they wo n't mind a few months ' imprisonment , for when they come out they will get their share of the money and be quite rich .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 20]: They 'll probably sail off for America or Australia and buy land , and live in luxury ever after .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 7]: It _ is _ a shame !
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 7]: Father and mother feel it awfully .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 15]: Such a dreadful thing to happen when you ask your friends to stay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 10]: it 's a comfort to have nothing to lose .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 47]: Mother has one diamond ring , which she always wears above the wedding one , and there 's nothing else worth stealing in the house , except watches and silver spoons , so that Aunt Maria need fear no qualms on account of her present visitor .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 26]: No one will set her house on fire on account of my jewels -- a few glass beads and a gold safety-pin , all told !
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 8]: You see them before you now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 33]: Darsie tossed her head and pointed towards her treasures with an air of such radiant satisfaction that Noreen and Ida dropped the effort to be polite , and pealed with delighted laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 9]: `` You _ are _ a funny girl !
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 5]: You do amuse us .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 10]: It 's so nice to have a new friend .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 9]: The girls near here are so deadly dull .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 8]: You seem so full of spirit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 4]: `` Too full .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 6]: It runs away with me .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 7]: I act first and think afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 36]: _ Not _ a good principle for a working life , '' pronounced Miss Darsie sententiously as she searched among the green leaves for a strawberry sufficiently large and red to suit her fastidious taste .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 8]: The Percivals watched her with fascinated gaze .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 60]: An hour before they would have professed the most profound pity for a girl who lived in a street , owned neither horse nor dog , and looked forward to earning her own living , but it was with something more closely resembling envy that they now regarded Darsie Garnett , weighted as she was with all these drawbacks .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 20]: There was about her an air of breeziness , of adventure , which shook them out of their self-complacence .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 42]: It no longer seemed the all-important thing in life to belong to a county family , attend the hunt , and look forward to a presentation at Court ; they felt suddenly countrified and dull , restricted in aim and interest .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 40]: It was while Darsie was still conversing in airy , discursive fashion , and her companions listening with fascinated attention , that footsteps were heard approaching , and Ralph 's tall figure appeared at the end of the path .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 47]: He was evidently taking a short cut through the grounds , and as Darsie was out of his line of vision , being planted well back among the strawberry plants , he saw only his two sisters , and advanced to meet them with cheerful unconcern .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 3]: `` Hulloa !
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 4]: Here 's luck !
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 6]: Has n't she come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 8]: But it is luck all the same .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 5]: Look for yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 46]: cried Noreen gleefully , pointing with outstretched hand to where Darsie sat , a pale blue figure among a nest of greenery , her little , flushed , laughing face tilted upward on the long white throat , her scattered locks ashine in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 35]: With the air of a queen she extended finger-tips crimson with the strawberry juice towards the newcomer , and with the air of a courtier Ralph Percival stooped to take them in his own .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 27]: For a moment they stared full into each other 's eyes , while the bewilderment on the young man 's face slowly gave place to recognition .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 10]: `` Glad to see you again , Princess Goldenlocks !
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 11]: Let me congratulate you on the breaking of the spell .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 19]: Who was the kind fairy who set you free to appear among us in your rightful guise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 18]: He spoke like a book ; he looked tall and handsome enough to be a prince himself .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 22]: Darsie forgave him on the instant for his former lack of respect , and bent upon him her most dimpling smile .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 5]: `` I freed myself .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 18]: I wove my own spell , and when I was tired of it I broke loose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 12]: Ralph looked down at her with a slow , quizzical smile .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 7]: `` You had better be careful !
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 8]: Spells are awkward things to move about .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 21]: They might alight , you know , on some other shoulders , and not be so easily shaken off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 12]: His eyes , his voice , added point to the words .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 34]: It was the first , the very first compliment which Darsie had ever received from masculine lips , and compared with the blunt criticisms of Dan Vernon , she found it wonderfully stimulating .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 7]: `` Come along , girls ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 13]: cried Ralph with a sudden return to a natural , boyish manner .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 19]: `` There 's a whole hour yet before tea , and we ca n't sit here doing nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 10]: Let 's go down to the river and punt .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 7]: Do you punt , Miss Garnett ?
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 5]: I 'll teach you !
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 12]: You look the sort of girl to be good at sport .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 10]: You 'll pick it up in no time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 57]: The three girls rose obediently and followed Ralph 's lead riverwards , while Noreen and Ida , gesticulating and grimacing in the background , gave the visitor to understand that a great honour had been bestowed upon her , and that she might consider herself fortunate in being the recipient of an unusual mark of attention .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 3]: A TREATY .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 69]: If there were innumerable good points in an acquaintance with the Percival family , there was certainly the inevitable drawback , for on the days when she was alone with her great-aunt , Darsie was rendered lonelier and more restless than before by the knowledge that a couple of miles away were three agreeable young companions who would be only too pleased to include her in their pastimes .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 19]: The different points of view held by youth and age were , as usual , painfully in evidence .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 49]: Darsie considered that it would be desirable to meet the Percivals `` every single day '' ; Aunt Maria was glad that you had enjoyed yourself ; was pleased that you should meet young friends , and suggested a return invitation , `` some day next week ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 25]: pending which far-off period you were expected to be content with the usual routine of morning drive , afternoon needlework , and evening patience .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 20]: Really -- really -- really , to have lived to that age , and to have no better understanding !
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 14]: Letters from the seaside did not tend to soothe the exile 's discontent .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 72]: It seemed callous of the girls to expatiate on the joys of bathing , fishing , and generally running wild , to one who was practising a lady - like decorum in the society of an old lady over seventy years of age , and although Dan kept his promise to the extent of a letter of two whole sheets , he gave no hint of deploring Darsie 's own absence .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 29]: It was in truth a dull , guide-booky epistle , all about stupid `` places of interest '' in the neighbourhood , in which Darsie was frankly uninterested .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 43]: All the Roman remains in the world could not have counted at that moment against one little word of friendly regret , but that word was not forthcoming , and the effect of the missive was depressing , rather than the reverse .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 25]: Mother 's letters contained little news , but were unusually loving -- wistfully , almost , as it were , _ apologetically _ loving !
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 43]: The exile realised that in moments of happy excitement , when brothers and sisters were forgetful of her existence , a shadow would fall across mother 's face , and she would murmur softly , '' _ Poor _ little Darsie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 12]: Darsie 's own eyes filled at the pathos of the thought .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 17]: She was filled with commiseration for her own hard plight ... Father 's letters were bracing .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 9]: No pity here ; only encouragement and exhortation .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 16]: `` Remember , my dear , a sacrifice grudgingly offered is no sacrifice at all .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 10]: What is worth doing , is worth doing well .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 25]: I hope to hear that you are not only an agreeable , but also a cheerful and cheering companion to your old aunt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 6]: Darsie 's shoulders hitched impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 7]: Sounds like a copy - book .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 9]: _ I _ could make headlines , too !
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 9]: Easy to talk when you 're not tried .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 10]: Ca n't put an old head on young shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 16]: Callous youth , and crabbed age ... '' Not that Aunt Maria was really crabbed .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 35]: Irritable perhaps , peculiar certainly , finicky and old-fashioned to a degree , yet with a certain bedrock kindliness of nature which forbade the use of so hard a term as _ crabbed _ .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 23]: Since the date of the hair episode Darsie 's admiration for Lady Hayes 's dignified self-control had been steadily on the increase .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 42]: She even admitted to her secret self that in time to come -- far , far-off time to come , -- she would like to become like Aunt Maria in this respect and cast aside her own impetuous , storm-tossed ways .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 18]: At seventy one _ ought _ to be calm and slow to wrath , but at fifteen !
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 17]: Who could expect a poor little flapper of fifteen to be anything but fire and flame !
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 24]: Wet days were the great trial -- those drizzling , chilly days which have a disagreeable habit of intruding into our English summers .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 32]: Darsie , shivering in a washing dress , `` occupying herself quietly with her needlework '' in the big grim morning-room , was in her most prickly and rebellious of moods .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 9]: `` Hateful to have such weather in summer !
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 11]: My fingers are so cold I can hardly work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 8]: `` It is certainly very chill . ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 11]: `` Aunt Maria , could n't we have a fire ?
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 12]: It would be _ something _ cheerful to look at ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 5]: `` My dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 8]: Lady Hayes was apparently transfixed with amazement .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 4]: `` A fire !
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 8]: You forget , surely , the month !
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 5]: The month of August .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 11]: We never begin fires until the first of October . ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 12]: `` You 'd be much more comfortable if you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 16]: There being no controverting the truth of this statement , Lady Hayes made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 13]: But after the lapse of a few minutes she volunteered a suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 14]: `` There is a grey Shetland shawl folded up under the sofa rug .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 17]: You had better put it over your shoulders , since you feel so cold . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 5]: _ I _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 6]: Darsie gave an impatient laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 10]: `` Fancy me wrapped up in a Shetland shawl !
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 6]: I 'd sooner freeze . ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 10]: Lady Hayes dropped her eyelids and tightened her lips .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 62]: Her manner pointed out more eloquently than words the fact that her guest was wanting in respect , but as hostess it was her duty to consider the comfort of her guest , so presently she rang the bell and gave instructions that a cup of hot cocoa should be served at eleven o'clock instead of the usual glass of milk .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 50]: She herself was never guilty of the enormity of eating between meals , so that the listener knew perfectly well for whose benefit the order was given , but being at once cold , lonely , and cross , her heart was hardened , and she spoke no word .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 33]: Between that time and the appearance of James with the tray Aunt Maria made three successive attempts to open new topics of conversation , which were each time checkmated by monosyllabic replies .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 34]: There was a tone of relief in her voice , as of one hailing a much-needed assistance , as she said briskly -- `` Now , my dear , here is your cocoa !
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 7]: Drink it while it is hot .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 7]: It will warm you up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 10]: `` Thank you , I do n't drink cocoa .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 6]: It makes me sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 7]: There was a moment 's silence .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 9]: James stood at attention , tray in hand .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 20]: Lady Hayes tightened her lips , and the little red lines on her cheeks turned a curious bluish shade .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 19]: Then she cleared her throat , and said in her most courteous tones -- `` I am sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 11]: Would you kindly tell James what you would like instead .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 6]: Tea -- coffee -- soup ?
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 12]: A warm drink would be better than milk this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 7]: `` Nothing , thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 5]: `` Nothing , James !
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 5]: You may go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 3]: James departed .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 21]: Aunt Maria went on with her knitting , the click-click of the needles sounding startlingly distinct in the silent room .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 25]: Darsie sat shamed and miserable , now that her little ebullition of spleen was over , acutely conscious of the rudeness of her behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 60]: For five minutes by the clock the silence lasted ; but in penitence , as in fault , there was no patience in Darsie 's nature , and at the end of the five minutes the needlework was thrown on the floor , and with a quick light movement she was on her knees by Lady Hayes 's side .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 7]: `` Aunt Maria , forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 6]: I 'm a pig ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 11]: `` Excuse me , my dear , you are mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 14]: You are a young gentlewoman who has failed to behave as such . ''
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 17]: `` Oh , Aunt Maria , do n't , _ do n't _ be proper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 11]: pleaded Darsie , half - laughing , half in tears .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 37]: `` I _ am _ a pig , and I behaved as much , and you 're a duchess and a queen , and I ca n't imagine how you put up with me at all .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 16]: I wonder you do n't turn me out of doors , neck and crop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 32]: Lady Hayes put down her knitting and rested her right hand lightly on the girl 's head , but she did not smile ; her face looked very grave and sad .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 24]: `` Indeed , Darsie , my dear , '' she said slowly , `` that is just what I am thinking of doing .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 41]: Not ` neck and crop ' -- that 's an exaggerated manner of speaking , but , during the last few days I have been coming to the conclusion that I made a mistake in separating you from your family .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 16]: I thought too much of my own interests , and not enough of yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 10]: She smiled , a strained , pathetic little smile .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 13]: `` I think I hardly realised how _ young _ you were !
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 3]: One forgets .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 31]: The years pass by ; one falls deeper and deeper into one 's own ways , one 's own habits , and becomes unconscious of different views , different outlooks .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 22]: It was a selfish act to take a young thing away from her companions on the eve of a summer holiday .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 21]: I realise it now , my dear ; rather late in the day , perhaps , but not too late !
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 19]: I will arrange that you join your family at the sea before the end of the week . ''
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 16]: Darsie gasped , and sat back on her heels , breathless with surprise and dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 22]: dismay ; extraordinary though it might appear , no spark of joy or expectation lightened the shocked confusion of her mind .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 31]: We can never succeed in turning back the wheels of time so as to take up a position as it would have been if the disturbing element had not occurred .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 28]: The holiday visit to the seaside would have been joy untold _ if _ Aunt Maria had never appeared and given her unwelcome invitation , but now !
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 25]: -- now a return to Seaview would be in the character of a truant carrying within her heart the consciousness of failure and defeat .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 31]: In the moment 's silence which followed Aunt Maria 's startling announcement the words of advice and exhortation spoken by her father passed one by one through Darsie 's brain .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 28]: `` If you can not have what you like , try to like what you have ... Put yourself now and then in your aunt 's place .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 24]: -- A sacrifice grudgingly performed is no sacrifice at all ... What is worth doing at all , is worth doing well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 28]: Each word condemned her afresh ; she stood as judge before the tribunal of her own conscience , and the verdict was in every case the same .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 2]: Guilty !
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 62]: She had not tried ; she had not imagined ; everything that she had done had been done with a grudge ; the effort , the forbearance , the courtesy , had been all on the other side ... There fell upon her a panic of shame and fear , a wild longing to begin again , and retrieve her mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 32]: She could n't , she could _ not _ be sent away and leave Aunt Maria uncheered , unhelped , harassed rather than helped , as the result of her visit .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 17]: `` Oh , Aunt Maria , '' she cried breathlessly , `` give me another chance !
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 9]: Do n't , do n't send me away !
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 22]: I 'm sorry , I 'm ashamed , I 've behaved horribly , but , I _ want _ to stay .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 11]: Give me another chance , and let me begin again !
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 25]: Honestly , truly , I 'll be good , I 'll do all that you want ... '' Lady Hayes stared at her earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 36]: There was no mistaking the sincerity of the eager voice , the wide , eloquent eyes , but the poor lady was plainly puzzled as to what had wrought so speedy a change of front .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 21]: With her usual deliberation she waited for several moments before replying , studying the girl 's face with serious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 18]: `` My dear , do n't imagine that I am thinking of sending you back in disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 4]: Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 31]: I will take all responsibility upon myself , and explain to your parents that I have come to the conclusion that it would be a mistake to prolong your visit .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 40]: It has been very dull for you alone with an old woman , and I am sure that though you have not always succeeded , you have at least had the intention of making yourself pleasant and agreeable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 9]: Darsie shook her bright head in vigorous denial .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 5]: `` I have n't !
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 14]: I can be fifty times nicer than that , when I really try .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 23]: Let me stay , Aunt Maria , and you 'll see ... It 's quite true that I was cross at first .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 24]: I hated giving up the holiday with the Vernons , and there seemed nothing to do ; but I 've changed my mind .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 32]: I did n't know you , you see , and now I do , and I -- I would like you to be pleased with me before I _ go _ !
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 14]: Please , _ please _ , Aunt Maria , let me stay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 13]: `` Certainly , my dear , I shall be most pleased . ''
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 41]: Lady Hayes still wore a somewhat puzzled expression , but she was undoubtedly gratified by the girl 's appeal , and Darsie bent forward and kissed her cheek with the feeling of one who has narrowly escaped a great danger .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 17]: `` That 's settled , and now we are going to live happily ever after ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 16]: `` Ah , my dear , I am afraid that is too much to expect !
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 12]: I have no amusements to offer you to relieve the dullness .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 18]: My health obliges me to live a quiet life , and I have grown to dread change .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 24]: Of course , there are plenty of books to read -- improving , well-written books , very different from the rubbish published to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 32]: If you would like to have a little reading aloud , or I could give you lessons in knitting and crochet ... '' Darsie laughed , a bright , audacious laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 9]: `` I would n't like it a bit !
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 14]: I 've another plan to suggest , fifty times nicer and more exciting .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 54]: Suppose , '' -- she leaned her arms on the old lady 's knee and looked gaily into her spectacled eyes -- `` suppose , instead of your trying to make me old with you , _ I _ tried , for a time , to make you young with _ me _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 2]: Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 5]: What do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 9]: Would n't it be far more fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 6]: `` You ridiculous child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 15]: But Lady Hayes laughed in her turn , and showed no signs of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 12]: `` That would be too difficult an undertaking even for you .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 10]: To make me young again , ah , Darsie !
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 7]: that 's an impossible task . ''
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 13]: `` Not a whit more impossible than to make me old ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 4]: cried Darsie quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 6]: `` Suppose we took turns ?
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 6]: That would be only fair .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 104]: Your day first , when you would read aloud dull books with the blinds half down ; and then my day , when I 'd read funny ones , with the blinds drawn up to the top , and the sun streaming into the room ; your day , when we drove the ordinary round and came back to lunch ; and mine when we went away over the hill and took a picnic basket and drew up at the side of the road , and ate it , and got milk from a cottage and drank it out of cups without saucers !
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 25]: Your night , when we played Patience ; and mine when I showed you tricks and danced figure dances as we do at school .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 16]: I 'm _ sure _ you 'd like to see me dance the Highland fling !
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 6]: Now -- now -- promise !
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 8]: I _ know _ you 'll promise .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 10]: I can see the softening in your eye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 5]: `` Ridiculous child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 26]: protested Lady Hayes once more , but Darsie was right ; there was certainly a softening in her eye which bespoke a disposition to yield .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 39]: In truth it was not so much of Darsie as of herself that Lady Hayes was thinking at that moment , for as the young voice spoke the old heart quickened with quite an agreeable sense of expectation .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 38]: Years since she had read a `` funny book , '' years since she had partaken of a picnic meal ; years -- many , many years since she had looked on while a young girl danced !
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 28]: Radical changes and innovations in the routine of life she could not face at this late day , but Darsie 's girlish plan attempted nothing so ambitious .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 7]: Let the child have her way !
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 14]: It would be interesting , undoubtedly interesting , to see how she behaved .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 33]: So Darsie gained her point , and for the next week she and her hostess played in turn the part of Mistress of the Ceremonies , to their mutual benefit and satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 4]: A DANGEROUS ADVENTURE .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 41]: One of the privileges gained by the alliance between aunt and niece was that the former veto against bicycle riding was withdrawn , and that Darsie was set free each afternoon for an hour 's enjoyment of this favourite exercise .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 71]: In deference to Lady Hayes 's nervousness and sense of responsibility the high-road was avoided as much as possible , and detours taken through quiet lanes , where traffic was reduced to a minimum ; and it was along one of these lanes that Darsie rode joyously some five or six days after her visit to the Percivals , bearing in her pocket a return invitation to her new friends .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 37]: She had been longing to meet them again , had keenly regretted a domestic upset which had delayed the invitation until now , but all the same the last days had passed wonderfully quickly and happily .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 58]: Afire with resolution to `` begin again '' and show herself in the light of a cheerful and cheering companion , she had neglected no opportunity to make herself agreeable to her hostess , while Aunt Maria in return had been sweetly considerate , and on occasions quite startling in her divination of hidden wishes and desires .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 63]: The eyes behind the gold-rimmed spectacles would rest upon the girl 's face with an intent scrutiny which seemed to have the power to draw free confidences , till to her own surprise Darsie found herself discussing fluently the all - important subject of her own future , and setting forth her hopes and fears in relation to a scholarship for Newnham .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 53]: On this , as on almost every topic which came up for discussion , the old woman and the girl held almost diametrically opposite opinions , but so far Darsie had contrived to subdue her impatience , and to listen with some appearance of humility to Lady Hayes 's somewhat sententious criticism .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 10]: `` But I wonder if it can last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 16]: she was asking herself doubtfully this afternoon , as she pedalled through the sweet-smelling lanes .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 20]: `` I wonder if I can possibly go on being so unnaturally good without falling ill from the strain !
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 11]: How I hope the Percival girls will be at home !
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 38]: If I can let off steam for an hour , and make as much noise as I like , it will be no end of a relief , and help me to last out without a relapse .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 34]: I 'd hate to have a relapse and spoil it all , just when I 'm trying so hard ; and she 's really a dear , _ quite _ an old dear !
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 6]: I love to please her .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 25]: Whenever I begin to feel scratchy I must make an excuse and get over to the Percivals for an hour to be soothed down .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 11]: I do _ hope _ they are in to-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 3]: But alas !
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 41]: the butler announced `` Not at home , '' in reply to Darsie 's inquiry , then , seeing the blank disappointment on the young face , he added graciously : `` The young ladies are out for a ride .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 9]: They will probably be home about four o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 9]: Will you not step in and wait ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 4]: Darsie brightened instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 13]: Four o'clock , and she had promised to be back by five .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 49]: Yes , she could enjoy half an hour 's talk , and still leave ample time for the ride home , but as it was now barely three o'clock she did not feel tempted by the prospect of sitting cooped in the house for so long a time .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 9]: `` Thank you , '' she said briskly .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 17]: `` I should like to wait , but I think I 'll stay in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 14]: Perhaps you would be kind enough to tell them when they return . ''
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 32]: The man bowed and withdrew , and Darsie strolled away in the direction of the rose pergola , the beauty of which had attracted her so greatly on her first visit .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 76]: She wandered up and down the archways , sniffed at the fragrance of the late blooms which still remained , indulged in a little of the sentimental poetising which seems to flow so readily when one is `` alone among the roses , '' began to grow bored , wandered aimlessly ahead , grew very bored indeed , and , consulting her watch , was dismayed to find that only fifteen minutes had passed away .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 2]: Fifteen !
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 13]: and there still remained forty-five before her companions were likely to arrive !
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 14]: What could she find to do to while away a whole forty-five minutes ?
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 16]: As a matter of prudence Darsie put the suggestion of the fruit garden resolutely aside .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 41]: It would not be _ safe _ to put herself in proximity with those tempting strawberries , since on a second visit to a house one was , unfortunately , not on sufficiently intimate terms to take without being asked .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 28]: She was contemplating getting on her bicycle and taking a short ride round the lanes , when the brilliant alternative of the river darted into her mind .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 6]: Of course , the river !
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 6]: Nothing could be more delightful .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 37]: She set off at a trot , taking in her inexperience many wrong turnings , but arriving at last at the river , or rather the peaceful backwater of the river which bordered the Percival grounds .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 105]: To Darsie 's mind the spot was the most picturesque on the whole estate , and a good many people could be found ready to agree with her in the conclusion ; for the backwater though narrow was bordered by banks rich in reeds and bulrushes , while a hundred yards or so below the miniature jetty a pair of ancient wooden gates spanned the stream , through whose decaying beams could be seen fascinating peeps of a baby waterfall , and a great moss - covered wheel which proclaimed the former use of the old grey building of which it was a part .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 28]: In olden times this quiet backwater had been a busy centre of industry , but the modern inventions of machinery had left it hopelessly in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 51]: The mill-owner had been ruined long ago , and the mill-house , with its great panelled rooms , was given up to the occupancy of the rats , while the disused wheel was green with moss , and the wooden gateway threatened every day to fall free of its hinges .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 63]: The young Percivals could not remember the day when the mill had been working , but from a personal point of view they deeply regretted its cessation , for , deprived of the healthy action of the wheel , the little backwater was becoming every year more choked with weeds , until at some points it was difficult to navigate the punt .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 65]: At long intervals strange men came to investigate the mill and its machinery , and the Percivals were cheered by rumours of a certain `` let , '' but as one rumour after another died away without bringing any tangible result their hopes had reached a vanishing point , and they paid little attention to the occasional stirring into life of the dreamy backwater .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 24]: Darsie walked to the end of the jetty , stepped lightly into the punt , and sank down on the soft red cushions .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 40]: One might not eat one 's neighbour 's fruit , but one might sit in his punt , and arrange his cushions to fit comfily into the crick in one 's back , without infringing the laws of hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 42]: Darsie poked and wriggled , and finally lay at ease , deliciously comfortable , blinking up at the sunshine overhead , and congratulating herself on having hit on the spot of all others in which to spend the time of waiting .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 24]: She could lie here for hours without feeling bored ; it was the most deliciously lazy , drowsy sensation she had ever experienced .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 43]: At the end of five minutes , however , the drowsy feeling threatened to become altogether too pronounced , and having no wish either to be discovered fast asleep , or to sleep on undiscovered till past the hour for her return .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 13]: Darsie sat up hurriedly and began to look around for fresh distractions .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 48]: At the very first glimpse the usual temptation for idle hands stared her in the face , for there on the jetty lay , not only the long punt-pole , but also the dainty little paddle which she had handled under Ralph 's instructions the week before .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 35]: It had been quite easy , ridiculously easy ; the girls declared that she took to it as to the manner born ; she had paddled the whole boatload for quite a considerable distance .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 14]: Naturally it would be much easier and lighter to paddle for oneself alone .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 37]: The chain holding the punt to the jetty could easily be slipped from its ring ; there was not , _ could _ not be , any danger in paddling peacefully along a quiet little backwater .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 49]: Of course , prudent people would say -- Aunt Maria would say -- But then if you waited until all the prudent people on earth approved of all that you did , you might sit with your hands crossed in your lap for the rest of your life !
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 35]: Darsie tossed her head with the defiant little jerk which meant that she was _ going _ to do it , and she did n't care , and the consequences could look after themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 20]: In another moment the punt was free from the chain , and was being paddled slowly down the stream .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 54]: Really , she told herself , the solid old craft was as safe as a house ; so big , so heavily built was it that it seemed curious , not that its progress should be slow but that it should move at all in response to the efforts of one inexperienced girl !
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 75]: Glancing over , Darsie could see the weeds rising from the bed of the stream , sometimes so high that they caught in the paddle as it worked and greatly impeded its force ; still she was steadily moving along , and , fired with ambition , her eyes fell on a willow-tree standing out from the bank some hundred yards ahead , and she determined to persevere until the point should be reached .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 50]: To declare she had paddled `` some way '' -- `` quite a long way '' -- would probably be discounted to mean but a few yards by the Percival sisters , but `` to the willow and back '' was a definite feat which could not be gainsaid .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 37]: So Darsie worked and strained till her arms ached and her cheeks flamed , till the punt , moving heavily through the weeds , ran at last beneath the willow branches and found a natural anchorage .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 20]: Well , it was good to lie back against the cushions and rest one 's weary arms and back !
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 33]: Darsie peeped at her watch , saw with relief that she had still a good quarter of an hour to spare , and abandoned herself to a lazy enjoyment of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 58]: And then the inevitable happened , for the soothing influence of the shaded light lulled the tired senses into deeper and deeper unconsciousness , until at last the fringed eyelids ceased to flicker , and remained peacefully closed , and , like a happy , tired child , Darsie rested her cheek on her hand and slept .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 29]: Subsequent comparisons proved that her doze might have lasted for half an hour or more , before a sudden movement of the punt roused her with a start .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 30]: She sat up , blinked sleepily around , and discovered to her surprise that the punt had moved from its anchorage and drifted into the centre of the stream .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 56]: It had appeared so safely moored against the tree that she was puzzled to understand how this had come about , but as the movement had roused her from sleep she was glad that it had occurred , and , seating herself steadily , lifted her paddle to work her way back to the jetty .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 57]: As she settled herself , however , Darsie 's attention was arrested by the manner in which the banks seemed to be slipping past ; she turned her head over her shoulder , and discovered that in the minute which had elapsed since she had awakened from sleep the willow-tree had been left several yards behind .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 35]: Some mysterious change seemed to have passed over the surface of the still , almost stagnant , waters ; they were flowing as with a tide , the rippling movement stirring the weedy banks .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 42]: Darsie used her paddle automatically , but its puny force seemed superfluous , for the punt was moving of itself , quickly and still more quickly , swinging broadside to the stream in defiance of her efforts to keep it straight .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 15]: Darsie ceased to struggle and leaned forward on the paddle to consider the situation .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 34]: Then , for the first time , she became aware that the former stillness of the stream was replaced by a harsh , continuous noise , which seemed momentarily to increase in volume .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 5]: What could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 18]: She stared around with puzzled eyes , but there was no hint of alarm in her bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 35]: A child of the city , she was inured to sudden and inexplicable noises ; it was only when the punt swung heavily round a bend that she realised the seriousness of her position .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 5]: The mill was working !
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 53]: One of the infrequent experimental trials of which she had heard was even now in process , the great moss-covered wheel was revolving creakily on its axle , waking the sleeping river into life , and the heavy punt was bearing down , more and more rapidly towards the crazy wooden gates !
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 21]: In a second all that she had heard on this subject from the Percival family flashed through Darsie 's brain .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 43]: The gates were frail , so eaten by long action of water , that at the impact of a heavy mass they would almost certainly burst apart , and then -- what would happen to the punt and to its hapless occupant ?
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 26]: Would she be hurled against a broken boulder , wedged helplessly beneath the debris , or rushed forward into the swirl of the millpond itself ?
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 35]: Whatever happened it seemed certain that danger -- and serious danger -- loomed close at hand , unless she could succeed in overmastering the current and landing the punt safely at the little jetty .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 21]: At this moment it was not fear but rather an exhilarating tingling of excitement of which Darsie was most aware .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 21]: Here was an adventure -- a full-fledged adventure , such as came but seldom to break the monotony of life !
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 20]: For the sake of her future credit she must bear herself bravely , be swift , resourceful , energetic .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 29]: With all her strength she plied the paddle to and fro , but for all the effect produced she might as well have sat still upon her cushions .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 40]: It would have required an experienced hand to guide the heavy punt through the sweeping current , and under Darsie 's unpractised strokes it twisted , and turned , and revolved in aimless and disconcerting circles ... No matter !
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 25]: she was determined to win ; by hook or by crook she must make the left side of the stream and gain an anchorage .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 30]: The jetty or the millpond -- that was the alternative , and it was one to put power into the arm and give staying power to the laboured breath !
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 18]: The moments were flying now , the banks seemed to be flitting past more quickly than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 37]: Darsie tried to convert the paddle into an oar , with which to steer more vigorously for the desired bank ; then came a breathless second of suspense , followed by a sickening realisation of failure .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 32]: The punt had swept past the jetty at a distance just wide enough to make it impossible to grasp the chain , and was now bearing straight for the wooden gates !
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 4]: DARSIE 'S SUGGESTION .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 41]: With the passing of the jetty , fear awoke for the first time in Darsie 's breast -- the fear which arises when the possibility of action is over and nothing remains but to sit still and await the end .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 143]: In one moment of time an incredible number of thoughts flashed through her brain ; she thought of her father and mother , of their grief and pain at the knowledge of her untimely end ; she thought of her brothers and sisters , of Vie Vernon and plain Hannah , and Dan ; she saw a vision of them all garbed in black , sitting round the study fire , enlarging upon her own virtues and graces ; she thought of Aunt Maria and her responsibility ; she saw a vision of herself , cold and still , being dragged out of the millpond , with her hair floating like seaweed behind her , and at the thought a wild rebellion rose in her heart , a determination to fight on , to fight to the end for her precious life !
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 11]: One or two large trees stood out from the bank .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 31]: Darsie leaped to her feet and , raising the paddle so high above her head that it caught against the branches , strove to delay the progress of the punt .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 28]: The result was to upset her own equilibrium , and as she fell forward she screamed loudly , a shrill , penetrating scream of panic and appeal .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 20]: With almost startling quickness the answer came , in the form of an answering cry , close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 25]: Round the corner of the next clump of bushes dashed the figure of Ralph Percival , bareheaded , eager-faced , and , thank Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 4]: unhesitating in action .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 45]: Not for one fraction of a second did he hesitate , but with the assurance of one who knows every inch of the land rushed forward waist-deep into the river ; halted there , and called out a sharp command -- `` Your paddle !
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 7]: Stretch out your paddle towards me !
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 3]: Hold hard !
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 9]: Lean out as far as you can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 25]: Darsie fell on her knees , and , leaning forward to the utmost extent of her body , held out the paddle as directed .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 36]: There was a moment of sickening suspense , then came a halt , a jerk that seemed to pull her arms half out of the sockets , and the punt swung heavily towards the shore .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 38]: The danger was over ; she was helped on to the bank , where she collapsed in a little heap , while Ralph worked the punt slowly along to the jetty and fastened it to its chain .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 52]: _ The short _ breathing space had allowed Darsie to recover her self - possession , to master the overpowering temptation to cry , and to swallow the lump in her throat sufficiently to be able to say in a weak little voice -- `` You 've saved my life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 8]: `` You 've spoiled my trousers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 15]: retorted Ralph in a matter-of-fact manner calculated to put an instant check on sentimentality .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 19]: He sat down on the bank , unfastened his mud-soaked gaiters , and threw them on one side .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 15]: `` The river 's beastly dirty , and the mud sticks like the Dickens .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 6]: A new suit , too !
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 9]: It will never look the same again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 6]: `` I 'm sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 7]: `` So you ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 28]: Things are bad enough as they are , _ but _ ... How on earth did you come to be careering about alone in that punt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 9]: `` I was waiting to see your sisters .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 28]: I wandered down here , and thought I 'd just sit in it for a rest , then I thought I could just paddle up and down .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 18]: I managed quite well going up the stream ; I got as far as the willow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 15]: Even at that moment a faint note of pride crept into Darsie 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 40]: `` We grounded there , and I -- I must have fallen asleep , I suppose , and that hateful old mill must needs choose the opportunity to begin working at that very moment ... Just my luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 8]: Ralph pursed his lips in eloquent comment .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 21]: `` If it comes to that , I think you have had a fair amount of luck in another way !
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 14]: I heard the noise of the mill and came down to look on .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 20]: If I had n't been there , you 'd have been pretty considerably in Queer Street by this time .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 26]: Nice thing it would have been for us to discover your drowned body in the millpond , and have had to tell your aunt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 11]: `` I thought of that , '' agreed Darsie meekly .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 9]: `` It was one of my dying thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 23]: Do n't scold me , please , for I feel so shaky , and you would n't like it if I cried .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 13]: It was my own fault , and I got what I deserved .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 22]: I was n't a bit frightened till I missed the jetty , but that one moment was like a hundred years .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 8]: Did my yell sound very awful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 6]: `` Pretty middling blood-curdling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 5]: replied Ralph , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 6]: `` Good thing it did .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 47]: Gave me a bit of a shock , I can tell you , to see the old punt dashing down to the gates , with you sitting huddled up in the bottom , with your hair hanging wild , and your face the colour of chalk .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 8]: You looked like a young Medusa . ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 8]: `` Sounds attractive , I must say !
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 34]: Medusa froze _ other _ people 's blood , not her own , '' declared Darsie , tilting her chin with a little air of offence , at which her companion laughed triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 17]: `` Oh , _ you 're _ better ; you 're coming round again all right !
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 9]: I was afraid you were going to faint .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 12]: I do n't mind telling you that you were jolly plucky .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 17]: Most girls would have started screaming miles before , but you held on like a Briton .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 7]: How do the arms feel now ?
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 9]: Rather rusty at the hinges , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 22]: The stiffness will probably spread to the back by to - morrow , but it 'll come all right in time .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 39]: It is a pretty good weight , that punt , and I had to pull for all I was worth ... Do n't you think you 'd better come up to the house and have some tea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 5]: `` Yes , please .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 9]: And you can change your clothes , too .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 11]: I should feel so miserable if you caught cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 6]: `` No fear of that .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 18]: I 'm used to splashing in and out of the water half a dozen times a day .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 9]: You need have no anxiety about me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 7]: `` But -- the trousers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 7]: `` Oh , bother the trousers !
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 15]: I piled that on a bit , just to prevent you from getting sentimental .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 8]: _ They 're _ all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 12]: Ralph paused a moment , then , `` I say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 17]: he cried anxiously , `` is this going to get you into trouble with the aunt ?
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 11]: Need you say anything about it , do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 20]: I 'll swear to secrecy , if you say the word , and not a soul need know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 24]: Darsie debated the point thoughtfully while the two walked side by side along the gravelled paths , and finally arrived at a conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 12]: `` I think , on the whole , I 'll tell !
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 24]: Aunt Maria allowed me to go out alone as a great concession , and it was mean to take advantage and run risks .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 12]: So upsetting for her if I were killed in her house !
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 18]: So I 'm in honour bound to confess , and promise not to do it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 10]: `` You might do something else just as bad !
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 20]: Probably she 'll withdraw her permission and keep you under her thumb as she did those first weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 16]: `` She _ may _ ; but I do n't think she _ will _ !
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 30]: I think she will appreciate my confidence , '' said Darsie , with a grandiloquent air , at which her companion whistled softly , his face twitching with amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 48]: He was much more natural and boyish in his manner than on either of the previous occasions on which Darsie had met him , and the agitation of the last few minutes seemed to have carried them in a bound past all the formalities of early acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 6]: `` Right you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 4]: he said briskly .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 7]: `` I like a straight girl .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 16]: But if you do n't mind we wo n't speak of it before the mater .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 22]: She 's a bit nervous , and would be always imagining that the girls were going to have the same experience .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 12]: You might warn Lady Hayes not to speak of it either .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 10]: We 'll keep it a secret between us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 6]: `` Just as you like !
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 36]: I _ believe _ , '' said Darsie shrewdly , `` that you 're afraid of being praised and fussed over , as you would be if people knew that you had saved my life !
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 13]: Men hate a fuss , but you ca n't escape my gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 7]: I did n't want to die .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 33]: It came over me with a sort of horror -- the thought of leaving the flowers , and the trees , and the blue sky , and all the people I love .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 14]: Have you ever been so nearly dead to know how it feels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 10]: `` Once -- when I had enteric at school .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 10]: It was a near squeak at the crisis . ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 7]: `` And how did you feel ?
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 6]: What did you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 12]: `` I did n't care a whit one way or another .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 8]: I wanted to have the pillow turned .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 31]: That seemed a hundred times more important than life or death ; I was too ill to think ... Well , thank goodness , you are _ not _ dead !
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 27]: I hope you 'll live for many years to be a pride and glory to -- er -- er -- the ranks of women blue-stockings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 6]: Darsie looked at him sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 11]: `` The girls have been telling you of my ambitions !
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 4]: Mean of them !
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 8]: They might have known you 'd scoff .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 27]: All boys do , but I fail to see why if a girl has brains she should not use them as well as a man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 9]: `` The inference being -- '' `` Certainly !
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 9]: I 'm unusually clever for my years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 14]: returned Darsie proudly , whereupon they simultaneously burst into a peal of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 10]: `` Well , you goaded me to it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 5]: Darsie declared in self-vindication .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 11]: `` I ca n't stand it when boys are superior .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 31]: Why must they sneer and jeer because a girl wants to go in for the same training as themselves , especially when she has to make her own living afterwards ?
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 31]: In our two cases it 's more important for me than for you , for you will be a rich landowner , and I shall be a poor school marm .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 26]: You ought to be kind and sympathetic , and do all you can to cheer me on , instead of being lofty and blighting . ''
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 31]: Ralph Percival looked down at her with his handsome , quizzical eyes -- `` I do n't mind betting that _ you 'll _ never be a school marm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 31]: he said calmly ; and at that very moment , round a bend of the path , the two girls came suddenly into view , trotting briskly towards the river .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 15]: They waved their hands , and tore down upon the visitor in lively welcome .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 5]: `` There you are !
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 6]: This _ is _ nice .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 21]: Bates said you were in the garden , so we just flew and changed , and rushed off in pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 9]: So glad you had Ralph to amuse you .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 5]: The mill 's working !
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 23]: We guessed you 'd be there looking on ... '' `` There 's nothing to see but the old wheel creaking round .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 8]: Tea is far more to the point .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 22]: I 'm dying for some , and I 'm sure -- er -- Miss -- er -- Garnett is , too !
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 8]: She 's had a tiring afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 13]: `` Er -- Miss -- er -- Garnett 's name is Darsie .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 30]: You can always call a girl by her Christian name till her hair 's up , '' said Darsie quickly , and Ralph immediately availed himself of the permission .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 6]: `` All right , Darsie .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 7]: It 's a jolly little name .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 6]: Much easier to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 34]: Rather to Darsie 's disappointment tea was served in the drawing-room in formal , grown-up fashion , Mrs Percival presiding over the little table , with its shining silver and fine old-world china .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 50]: There were hot , brown little scones , crisp buttered toast , iced cakes , thick cream , and other indigestible luxuries , which came as an agreeable change from Lady Hayes 's careful dietary , and Darsie was acutely conscious of the beauty and elegance of the room .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 16]: How small and poky and drab the home drawing - room would appear in comparison !
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 42]: How different the outlook on another row of red-brick houses , from the sweep of green lawns , and the avenue of great beech-trees seen through the four long French windows which broke the side of this long , low room !
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 36]: How different her own life promised to be from those of the two girls by her side -- the girls who had just returned from a ride on their own horses over their own land !
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 68]: ... They would never need to worry about money ; their role in life for the next few years would consist in being pretty and agreeable , wearing charming frocks , visiting at friends ' houses , travelling in summer , hunting in winter , and , finally , making suitable Carriages , settling down as mistresses of other luxurious houses , and living happily ever after !
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 38]: She herself would study and cram for examination after examination ; go through agonies of suspense waiting for results , and as she passed or failed , obtain a good or second-rate appointment in a suburban school .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 45]: Henceforth work , work , work -- teaching by day , correcting exercises by night , in a deserted schoolroom , with three months ' holiday a year spent at home among brothers and sisters whose interests had necessarily drifted apart from her own !
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 83]: As the years passed by she would become staid and prim ; schoolmistressy manner ; the girls would speak of her by derisive nicknames ... A knifelike pang of envy pierced Darsie 's heart ; she dropped the dainty morsel of cake on to her plate with a feeling of actual physical nausea ; for the moment her old ambitions lost their savour , and appeared grey and dead ; she was pierced with an overpowering pity for her own hard lot .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 59]: The sensation was , perhaps , as much physical as mental , for no one can pass through a moment of acute mental tension without suffering from a corresponding nervous collapse , but being too young and inexperienced to realise as much , Darsie mentally heaped ashes on her head , and shed tears over her blighted life .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 30]: The signs of her emotion were noticeable , not only in an unusual silence but in whitening cheeks , which brought upon her the quick attention of her friends .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 11]: `` Are n't you feeling quite well , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 5]: Mrs Percival asked kindly .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 5]: `` You look pale .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 8]: Would you like to lie down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 9]: `` Darsie , you are _ green _ !
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 5]: What 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 9]: You were all right a moment ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 7]: `` I 'm all right now .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 8]: Please , please , take no notice .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 7]: I 'm perfectly all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 22]: Noreen was beginning to protest again , when Ralph called her sharply to order -- `` That 's enough , Nora !
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 6]: Awfully bad form to fuss .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 5]: Talk about something else .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 8]: What about that garden-party you were discussing ?
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 9]: I thought you wanted to ask suggestions . ''
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 10]: Instantly both sisters were sparkling with excitement and animation .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 7]: `` Oh , yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 3]: Of course !
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 5]: We must ask Darsie .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 6]: She has such lovely ideas .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 10]: Darsie , we are going to have a garden-party .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 7]: The invitations are going out to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 24]: Hundreds of people are coming -- mother 's friends , our friends , everybody 's friends , every bowing acquaintance for miles around .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 14]: The question of the hour is -- _ What shall we do _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 42]: Garden - parties are such monotonous occasions , always the same over and over again -- people sitting about in their best clothes , eating ices and fruit , listening to a band , and quizzing each other 's best clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 9]: We want to hit on a brilliant novelty .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 6]: What shall it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 11]: Darsie mused , her face lighting with pleasure and anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 7]: `` I know nothing about garden-parties .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 7]: There are n't any in town .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 7]: What have you done before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 47]: `` Tennis , croquet , clock-golf , ping-pong , archery , yeomanry sports , blue bands , red bands , black and yellow bands , glee-singers , Punch and Judy , '' Ida counted off one item after another on the ringers of her left hand .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 15]: `` And now we seem to have come to the end of our resources .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 8]: We ca n't think of anything else .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 12]: Do , like a darling , give us an idea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 33]: The darling deliberated once more , head on one side , lips pursed , eyes on the ceiling , while the Percival family looked on , and exchanged furtive glances of admiration .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 6]: She _ was _ pretty !
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 22]: prettier by far than ordinary pretty people , by reason of some picturesque and piquant quality more readily felt than denned .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 24]: It did n't seem to matter one bit that her nose turned up , and that her mouth was several sizes too large .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 25]: `` If you described me on paper , I 'd sound far nicer , but I look a wur-r - rm beside her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 29]: sighed Noreen mentally , just as Darsie lowered her eyes to meet those of her hostess , and inquired gravely -- `` How much may it cost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 29]: It was the question which accompanied every home plan , and on which hung a momentous importance , but the Percivals appeared quite taken aback by the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 12]: The girls stared , and their mother smilingly waved it aside .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 13]: `` Oh-h , I do n't think we need trouble about that !
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 15]: It 's only once a year , and we must do the thing well .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 15]: If you have a suggestion , dear , please let us have it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 17]: `` I was thinking , '' said Darsie hesitatingly , `` of a treasure hunt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 26]: Instantly all four hearers acclaimed the idea with such unanimity and fervour that the proposer thereof was quite overpowered by the thanks lavished upon her .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 7]: `` The _ very _ thing !
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 9]: Why did we never think of it ourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 23]: Every one will like it , and it will keep them moving about , which is always the great problem to solve .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 42]: Presents , presents , lots of presents , stowed away in odd corners ... '' `` We 'll each take a certain number and hide them in our _ own _ pet corners when no one else is in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 62]: We 'll make the parcels up in _ green _ paper , so as to be less easy to find ... '' `` Every one must be told to bring them back to the lawn for a grand public opening , so that the disappointed ones may join in the fun ... '' `` We may take part ourselves , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 7]: We _ must _ take part !
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 16]: Get lots and lots of presents , and let us hunt with the rest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 7]: `` Certainly , dears , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 15]: It is your party as much as mine ; of course you must hunt .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 14]: I 'll run up to town and buy the presents at the stores .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 10]: You must help me to think of suitable things .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 74]: Bags , purses , umbrellas , blotters , manicure-cases -- '' `` Boxes of French bonbons , belts , scarfs -- '' `` Cigarettes , brushes -- '' `` Nice little bits of jewellery -- '' Suggestions poured in thick and fast , and Mrs Percival jotted them down on a little gold and ivory tablet which hung by her side unperturbed by what seemed to Darsie the reckless extravagance of their nature .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 33]: It was most exciting talking over the arrangements for the hunt ; most agreeable and soothing to be constantly referred to in the character of author and praised for cleverness and originality .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 33]: Darsie entirely forgot the wave of depression which had threatened to upset her composure a few minutes before , forgot for the time being the suspense and danger of the earlier afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 50]: Some one else , it appeared , however , was more remindful , for when she prepared to depart the dog-cart stood at the door , and Ralph announced in his most grand seigneur manner -- `` We 're going to drive you back , do n't you know !
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 10]: Too awfully fagging to bicycle on a hot afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 12]: Put on your hats , girls , and hurry up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 16]: The girls obediently flew upstairs , and Darsie 's protestation of `` My bicycle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 6]: was silenced with a word .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 10]: `` The stable-boy shall ride it over to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 16]: You 're a bit jumpy still and ca n't be allowed to run any risks .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 14]: I mean to see you safely back in your aunt 's charge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 18]: Darsie scrambled up to her high seat and leaned back thereon with an agreeable sense of importance .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 19]: `` I feel like a cat that 's been stroked , '' she said to herself , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 16]: `` When you 're one of a large family you are not used to fussing .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 5]: It 's most invigorating !
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 12]: I 'd like to go in for a long course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 4]: THE TREASURE HUNT .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 48]: The invitations for the garden-party arrived in due course : one for Lady Hayes , another for Miss Darsie Garnett , and in the corner of each , beside the name of a celebrated military band , appeared the magic words '' _ Treasure Hunt _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 42]: Darsie felt something of the proud interest of the author who beholds in print the maiden effort of his brain , as she gazed upon those words , and reflected that but for her own suggestion they would never have appeared .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 33]: Lady Hayes also seemed to feel a reflected pride in her niece 's ingenuity , which pride showed itself in a most agreeable anxiety about the girl 's toilette for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 47]: After a survey of the few simple dresses which composed Darsie 's wardrobe , it was pronounced that nothing was suitable for garden-party wear , and a dressmaker was summoned from the country town to take measurements for a dainty white dress and hat to match .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 49]: The dress was made to reach right down to the ankles , in deference to Lady Hayes 's ideas of propriety , and Darsie felt prodigiously fine and grown-up as she peacocked about before the long glass of her bedroom wardrobe on the day of the garden-party itself .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 23]: Never in her life before had she possessed a gown made by an expert dressmaker , and the result was surprisingly flattering .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 18]: She expatiated on the same with a candour startling to the audience of aunt and her maid .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 7]: `` Do n't I look s-weet ?
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 3]: So slim !
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 11]: I 'd no idea I was such a nice shape .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 18]: I do n't know which looks nicest , the frock on me or me in the frock !
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 5]: Are n't I tall ?
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 15]: Is n't it graceful when I stand like this , and show the pleats ?
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 6]: The hat 's a duck !
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 11]: I must say I do look most scrumptiously nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 5]: `` My dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 8]: Lady Hayes looked both shocked and alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 10]: `` My dear , how _ can _ you ?
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 15]: I shall begin to regret my purchases if they encourage a spirit of vanity .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 17]: I was always taught to allow others to praise me and to keep silent myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 28]: `` But you _ thought _ all the time , Aunt Maria , you could n't help thinking , and it 's worse to bottle it up .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 17]: I 'm always quite candid on the subject of my appearance , '' returned Darsie calmly .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 4]: `` On principle !
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 16]: Why should you speak the truth on every other subject , and humbug about that ?
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 26]: When I 've a plain fit I know it , and grovel accordingly , and when I 'm nice I 'm as pleased as Punch .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 27]: I _ am _ nice to-day , thanks to you and Mason , and if other people admire me , why should n't I admire myself ?
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 8]: I _ like _ to admire myself !
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 13]: It 's like the cocoa advertisements , ` grateful and comforting . '
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 6]: Honest Ingin , Aunt Maria !
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 23]: Did n't _ you _ admire yourself when you saw yourself in the glass _ in _ that ducky grey bonnet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 16]: Evidently the question hit home , for Lady Hayes made a swift change of front .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 11]: `` My dear , my dear , moderate your language !
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 9]: Your expressions are unsuitable for a young gentlewoman .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 5]: You are growing up .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 13]: Try , I beg , to cultivate a more ladylike demeanour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 70]: Darsie made a little face at the charming reflection in the glass , the which Lady Hayes wisely affected not to see , and presently aunt and niece were seated side by side in the big old barouche , forming one of a concourse of vehicles which were converging together out of every cross road , and turning in a seemingly endless string in the direction of the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 67]: Shut carriages , open carriages , motors of different sizes and makes , dog-carts , pony carriages , governess carts -- on they came , one after another , stirring up the dust of the road till the air seemed full of a powdery mist , through which unhappy pedestrians ploughed along in the shadow of the hedgerows , their skirts held high in white-gloved hands .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 62]: Darsie thought it inhuman of her aunt not to fill the carriage to overflowing with these unfortunates , but she made no attempt to do so , but sat up stiff and straight in her seat , a typical old lady of the olden times , in her large bonnet , grey satin gown , and richly embroidered China crape shawl .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 16]: `` If you 're not proud of yourself , I 'm proud of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 13]: the girl declared , smoothing the satin folds with an approving hand .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 31]: `` You look just what you are , a dear old fairy godmother who pretends to be proud and fierce , and is really a lump of kindness and generosity .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 11]: All the other old ladies look dowds beside you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 9]: `` Do n't flatter me , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 29]: I dislike it extremely , '' returned Lady Hayes with such an obvious look of satisfaction the while that Darsie laughed in her face , and laughed unreproved .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 63]: Arrived at the Hall , the guests were escorted through the perilously slippery hall , on which the mats seemed to turn into fresh pitfalls and slide beneath the feet ; then through a side-door on to a miniature lawn , in the centre of which stood Mrs Percival , sweetly smiling , and ejaculating endlessly : `` Delighted to see you !
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 10]: _ So _ nice of you to come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 23]: before passing the visitors on to her husband and children who were ranged at discreet intervals along the sweep of the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 93]: The girls whispered dramatically to Darsie that for the time being they were tied , literally tied by the heels , so she sat demurely by her aunt 's side under the shade of a great beech-tree , listened to the band , spilt drops of hot tea down the front of her white dress , buttered the thumbs of her white kid gloves , and discovered the unwelcome but no doubt wholesome fact that there were other girls present who appeared just as attractive , or even more so than herself !
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 24]: Then the band began to play item number four on the programme , and Noreen Percival came forward with a sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 7]: `` At last I am free !
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 18]: They 've all come , or practically all , and we ca n't wait for the laggards .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 7]: The Hunt begins at three o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 23]: Mother thought we 'd better have it early , as it would shake them up and make them more lively and sociable .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 34]: You 'll have to search by yourself , Darsie , for as we have all done some of the hiding , it would n't be fair to us to go about in pairs .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 22]: There are piles of presents , and your eyes are so sharp that you are sure to find two or three .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 46]: You must n't open them on the spot , but bring them up to the cedar lawn , where mother will be waiting with the old fogies who are too old to run about , but who would like to see the fun of opening .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 11]: I _ do hope _ I find the right thing !
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 22]: There 's the sweetest oxydised buckle with a cairngorm in the centre that would be the making of my grey dress .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 20]: I have set my heart upon it , but I have n't the least notion where it 's stowed .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 31]: It may even have been among my own parcels , and of course I ca n't go near those ... '' `` If I get it , we 'll swop !
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 8]: I wish I knew the garden better .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 26]: I do n't know of _ one _ good hiding-place except those I made myself ... Perhaps I sha n't find anything at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 5]: `` Oh , nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 20]: Keep your eyes open and poke about with your feet and hands , and you ca n't go wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 11]: The paper 's just a shade lighter than the grass .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 3]: Remember ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 33]: Noreen flew off again to move a chair for an old lady who wished to escape the rays of the sun , and once more Darsie was left to her own resources .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 67]: By her side Lady Hayes was deep in conversation with another old lady on the well-worn subject of a forthcoming agricultural show , and the town-bred visitor , failing to take an intelligent interest in prize carrots and potatoes , turned her attention to the group on the right , where Ralph Percival was making himself agreeable to three fashionable-looking girls of about her own age .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 32]: He wore an immaculate grey suit and a Panama hat , and regarding him critically , Darsie felt another shock of surprise at being compelled to admire a _ man _ !
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 44]: Hitherto she had regarded the race as useful , intelligent creatures , strictly utilitarian in looks , as in attire , but to-day it was impossible to deny that the beauty was on Ralph 's side more than on that of his companions .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 67]: The poise of the tall , slim figure was so graceful and easy that it was a pleasure to behold ; the perfect lines of aquiline nose , and dented chin , the little kink and wave which refused to be banished from the clipped hair , the long narrow eyes , and well-shaped lips made up a whole which was quite startlingly handsome and attractive .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 35]: The three girls looked back at him with undisguised admiration and vied with one another in animated conversation , in return for which he drawled out slow replies in a tone of languid boredom .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 39]: During the fortnight which had elapsed since the date of her misadventure on the river , Darsie had had frequent meetings with the Percivals , and now felt on the footing of a friend rather than an acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 12]: Concerning the girls , there was no question in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 39]: They were dears , not dears of the same calibre as Vie and plain Hannah , dears of a less interesting , more conventional description , but dears all the same , lively , good-tempered , and affectionate .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 24]: The only brother was a far more complex character , with regard to whom Darsie changed her mind a dozen times a day .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 48]: At one time he was all that was delightful , full of natural , boy-like good-comradeships at another he was a bored and supercilious dandy , looking down on schoolgirls from an intolerable height of patronage , and evidently priding himself on a _ blase _ indifference .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 31]: The present moment showed him in the latter mood , and Darsie 's lips curled as she watched and listened , and in her eyes there danced a mocking light .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 9]: `` Like a vain , affected girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 28]: was the mental comment , as her thoughts flew back to Harry and Russell , uncompromising and blunt , and to Dan Vernon in his shaggy strength .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 25]: Even as the thought passed through her mind Ralph turned , met the dancing light of the grey eyes , and turned impatiently aside .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 14]: He would not look at her , but he could _ feel _ !
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 34]: Darsie watched with a malicious triumph the flush creeping slowly over the smooth pale cheek , the hitch of the shoulders , the restless movement of the hands which betrayed the hidden discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 36]: Presently some friends came forward to join the three ladies , when Ralph immediately joined her with an invitation which sounded more like a command -- `` Come for a walk round the gardens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 36]: Darsie rose , nothing loath , conscious that she was about to be reproved , and finding an agreeable sense of support in her lengthened skirts , and the semblance of grown-up-ness which they imparted .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 13]: `` What did you mean by staring at me like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 5]: `` Like which ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 6]: `` You know very well .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 15]: You did it on purpose to annoy me , and make me uncomfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 8]: `` Oh no , I did n't !
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 6]: I did n't do anything .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 4]: It did itself .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 16]: It was just the outward and visible expression of my inward and invisible thoughts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 11]: `` Pretty middling disagreeable thoughts they must have been ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 3]: `` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 4]: Not disagreeable exactly .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 6]: Hardly strong enough for that .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 4]: Just amused ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 4]: `` Amused ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 9]: The flush deepened on the lad 's cheek .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 12]: Unwittingly Darsie had hit upon the most scathing of all indictments .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 11]: To be an object of _ amusement _ to others !
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 12]: What could be more lacerating to the dignity of nineteen years .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 12]: `` I had no idea that I was being so funny .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 15]: Will you have the goodness to point out what you found so amusing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 9]: `` Your airs , '' replied Darsie bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 4]: `` And graces !
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 15]: You asked me , you know , so I 'm bound to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 11]: It 's so odd to see a boy like that .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 7]: But you need n't be cross .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 7]: I 'm speaking only for myself .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 16]: Those other girls liked it very much ... You could see that for yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 4]: `` Just so .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 18]: We are talking of _ your _ opinion at the moment , however , not of theirs .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 21]: What sort of -- er -- _ boys _ are you accustomed to meet , if one may ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 17]: The strong accent thrown on the word `` boys '' showed a fresh ground of complaint .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 21]: Darsie felt a twinge of compunction , remembering the episode of the punt and her own great cause for gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 7]: The answer came with startling earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 16]: `` Not a bit braver than you , nor quicker and cleverer in an emergency .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 5]: Perhaps not so good .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 15]: If you 'd hesitated one moment I might n't have been here to criticise .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 16]: But , just big , simple boys , not an ounce of affectation between them .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 8]: Of course , they are not handsome .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 21]: That makes a difference ... '' But Ralph was not to be mollified by a compliment on his good looks .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 15]: He was irritated , and considered that he had good reason for being so .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 75]: Darsie Garnett was an unusually pretty and attractive girl , and having saved her from a perilous position but a fortnight earlier , it had been an agreeable delusion to imagine himself ensconced for life in her estimation as a gallant young rescuer , the object of her undying gratitude and admiration -- a delusion indeed , since the criticism of those mocking eyes was more than equalled by the explicitness of her explanations !
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 21]: Ralph looked injured and melancholy , and Darsie , with characteristic softness of heart , was instantly seized with compunction .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 48]: She was finding out for herself what every one who came in contact with Ralph Percival discovered sooner or later -- that it was exceedingly difficult to keep up a feeling of offence against any one who showed his displeasure in so interesting and attractive a fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 27]: He was so handsome , so graceful in movement , he had the art of concealing the most ordinary emotions behind a cloak of baffling superiority .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 66]: To-day , as he paced the garden paths by Darsie 's side , Ralph wore the air of a lovelorn poet , of a patriot sorrowing for his country , an artist wrestling over a life 's masterpiece , like anything or everything , in fact , but just what he was -- a sulky and empty-headed young gentleman , wounded in his own conceit !
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 52]: To her own amazement Darsie presently found herself engaged in the humble position of `` making it up , '' and in taking back one after another each disparaging remark which she had made , which , being done , Ralph graciously consented to `` think no more about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 22]: and strolled off to speak to a friend , leaving her stranded by herself at the far end of the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 36]: The position would have been an uncomfortable one had it not happened that just at that moment a bell rang loudly , followed by a sudden gathering together of the guests upon the cedar lawn .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 15]: Mr Percival was making some announcement which was greeted by bursts of approving laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 18]: The words of the announcement were inaudible to Darsie 's ears , but the purport was unmistakable .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 6]: The treasure hunt had begun !
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 78]: With one accord the guests turned and streamed in the direction of the gardens , turning to right and to left , peering beneath bushes , poking delicately among the foliage of flower-beds with the ferules of walking - sticks and parasols ... Darsie turned and fled like a lapwing along the path leading past the tennis-lawn and rose and vegetable gardens , to the shaded fern grotto which formed one of the boundaries of the grounds .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 57]: The idea had come to her to begin , so to speak , at the end and have the field to herself , but , as is usually the case , she was to discover that others were as ingenious as herself , for she had soon quite a string of followers along the narrow paths .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 30]: The thickly growing ferns seemed to offer endless hiding-places , but a printed notice to the effect that `` It is not necessary to walk upon the Beds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 15]: seemed to limit the possible area to that within reach of hand or stick .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 48]: Darsie poked and peered , lifted the hanging fronds which fell over the rockwork border of the lily pond , stood on tiptoe on the rustic seat to peer between the branches of surrounding trees , but could discover nothing in the semblance of a paper packet .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 56]: It was the same story in the rose garden , though the thick foliage on the pergolas seemed to offer numberless hiding-places for dainty packets , containing great gear in little bulk ; it was the same story in the wide , herbaceous border , though pathways on either side offered double opportunities for search .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 46]: For the first few minutes the search was pursued in almost complete silence , but as time went on there came the sound of one triumphant cry after another , as a busy searcher was rewarded by a sudden sight of the longed-for paper wrapping .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 28]: Darsie 's envious eyes beheld one young girl running gaily past , with no less than three trophies carried bag-like in the folds of a chiffon scarf .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 4]: _ Three _ !
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 9]: And she herself had not yet discovered one !
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 16]: What would the Percivals say if at the end of the hunt she returned empty-handed ?
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 19]: The surprised incredulity of the girls , the patronising condolences of Ralph , seemed in prospect equally unwelcome .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 19]: Desire for a present itself became subservient to anxiety for the credit of her own sharp-sightedness and intuition .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 16]: She _ must _ and would discover a parcel before the time limit was past .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 25]: The next half-hour passed in a search ever more eager and strenuous , as with every moment that passed the chance of success diminished .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 25]: So many treasures had already been discovered that Darsie began to think with a pang that perhaps there were no more to be found .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 55]: Every third or fourth visitor seemed to be carrying a trophy ; some with airs of would-be modesty were wending their way back to the cedar lawn carrying as many as three or four , declaring that really and really they must not look any more -- it was altogether _ too _ greedy !
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 24]: As they passed by the spot where Darsie pursued her ceaseless search , they would pause with words of maddening advice or condolence .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 6]: `` Not found anything yet ?
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 3]: How unfortunate !
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 18]: Look beneath the leaves ... '' Once Ralph passed by and arched his eyebrows in eloquent surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 33]: He seemed on the point of offering advice , but Darsie whisked off in the opposite direction , to take refuge in the least frequented portion of the grounds , the orchard .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 5]: Only ten minutes left !
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 23]: The bell of warning was pealing loudly from the cedar lawn , she could hear the merry chatter of the returning guests .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 23]: Darsie lifted her muslin skirts and ran quickly in and out between the trees , searching for some hiding-place as yet undiscovered .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 26]: The gnarled branches seemed to offer endless convenient niches , but in none of them could anything in the shape of a parcel be discovered .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 38]: She was on the point of abandoning the search and returning empty-handed , when , lifting up a heavy branch , her eyes suddenly lit upon a cavity in the trunk of one of the oldest trees .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 28]: When the branch remained in its ordinary position , the hollow was completely hidden from sight ; moreover its position facing the wall made it doubly invisible .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 28]: It hardly seemed possible that so very obscure a hiding-place would be chosen under the circumstances , but at this last moment no chance could be neglected .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 33]: Darsie rolled back her dainty net sleeve , plunged her hand deep into the hollow trunk , and flushed with triumph as her fingers came in contact with something loose and soft .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 22]: It was not a paper parcel , it felt more like cloth -- cloth with knotted ends all ready to pull .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 54]: Darsie pulled with a will , found an unexpected weight , put up a second hand to aid the first , and with a tug and a cloud of dust brought to light nothing more exciting than a workman 's handkerchief , knotted round a lumpy parcel which seemed obviously a midday meal .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 28]: It was a disappointment , but the next moment an inherent sense of humour had discovered its possibilities of the position and gallantly accepted a second best .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 21]: Since she might not possess a proper present , she could at least be the happy proprietor of a joke !
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 39]: Into the middle of the ring of guests she would march , handkerchief bundle in hand , and to her credit would remain , if not the greatest applause , at least the biggest laugh of the afternoon !
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 24]: Darsie drew down her sleeve , brushed the top coating of dust from the handkerchief , and hurried onwards towards the cedar lawn .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 4]: A TREASURE INDEED .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 29]: Darsie was one of the last guests to arrive upon the final scene of the treasure hunt , and already the merry process of parcel opening had begun .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 31]: The young girl who had captured three prizes was on her knees before a garden seat , laying them out in a row to be seen and admired of all .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 38]: Gaily dressed women were running about appealing to their male friends for the loan of penknives to cut the encircling string , and the air was full of the sound of laughter and happy , triumphant voices .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 4]: `` How lovely !
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 3]: How beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 5]: Is n't it charming ?
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 8]: _ Just _ what I wanted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 31]: Darsie stood in the background , her hands clasping her bundle behind her back , so as to screen it from view until the right moment arrived for its production .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 35]: The prize-winners were one and all in such a desperate hurry to examine their `` finds '' that she would not have long to wait , and meanwhile the scene was delightful to witness .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 42]: Every one looked gay , and happy and smiling ; the many-coloured frocks of the women made charming flecks of colour against the sombre green of the old cedar , as they moved to and fro with dazzling , kaleidoscopic effect .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 22]: Darsie had never even imagined such a scene ; it seemed to her more like fairyland than the dull work-a-day world .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 45]: She looked on , absorbed in delighted admiration , while one after another the coverings were torn from the dainty packages , and the brilliance of the scene was enhanced by the glitter of silver , and glass , and dainty patches of colour .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 46]: It would take long , indeed , to write of the treasures which Mrs Percival had amassed in that day in town ; it seemed to Darsie that nothing less than the contents of an entire shop window could have supplied so bewildering a variety .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 47]: Bags , purses , satchels , brushes , manicure-cases , blotters , boxes , cigarette-cases , photograph frames , fans , brooches , bracelets , buckles , studs , tie-pins , waistcoat buttons -- wherever the eye turned there seemed something fresh and beautiful to admire .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 17]: After such an Aladdin 's feast , would not her workman 's bundle fall very flat ?
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 44]: With a sudden access of humility Darsie was about to turn tail and put the poor man 's dinner back in its hiding-place , when from across the lawn she met Ralph 's eyes fixed upon her with an expression of patronising commiseration .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 21]: He was pitying her , because she had come back empty-handed when sharper eyes had reaped so rich a harvest !
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 12]: That touch of superiority made short work of Darsie 's hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 41]: She would show that she was in no need of pity , that so far from being overpowered by failure , she remained jaunty and self-confident enough to turn her own disappointment into a joke for the amusement of others !
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 33]: With head thrown back she marched dramatically forward to the spot where Mrs Percival stood , the gracious mistress of the ceremonies , and held the bundle towards her in extended hands .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 9]: `` Dear child , what have you there ?
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 8]: A bundle -- a workman 's bundle !
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 10]: Where in the world have you discovered that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 17]: `` In the trunk of an old tree , in the orchard near the wall . ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 5]: `` In the orchard ?
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 10]: It belongs most likely to one of the men .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 16]: His dinner , I should say , but what an odd place to hide it !
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 4]: So dirty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 9]: She gave a dainty little shake of distaste .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 11]: `` I should put it away , dear , really !
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 7]: It is covered with dust . ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 24]: `` It 's a very _ lumpy _ dinner , '' said Darsie , patting the surface of the bundle with curious fingers .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 18]: `` I thought perhaps it was a treasure done up in a different way from the others .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 13]: It 's heavy , too , far heavier than bread and cheese .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 9]: I can open it , ca n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 6]: Just to make sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 44]: `` Oh , certainly , if you like -- '' assented Mrs Percival dubiously , and Darsie waited for no further permission , but promptly knelt down on the grass and set to work to untie the knotted ends of the checked handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 33]: The surrounding guests gathered around in a laughing circle , being in the gay and gratified frame of mind when any distraction is met halfway , and ensured of a favourable reception .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 7]: What was this pretty girl about ?
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 10]: What joke was hidden away in this commonplace-looking bundle ?
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 48]: The knot was strongly tied , but Darsie 's fingers were strong also and in a minute 's time it was undone , and the corners of the handkerchief dropped on the grass to reveal an inner bag of thick grey linen tied again round the mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 8]: `` It _ is _ lumpy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 29]: repeated Darsie again ; then with a tug the string came loose , and lifting the bag in her hands , she rained its contents over the grass .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 6]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Was it a dream ?
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 53]: Was it some fantasy of imagination -- some wonderful effect of sunshine shining upon hundreds and hundreds of dewdrops , and turning them into scintillating balls of light , catching reflections from the flowers in yonder beds , and sending dancing rays of red , blue , and green across the grass ?
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 36]: Red and blue and green the rainbow drops gleamed upon the ground , vivid and clear as the loveliest among the blossoms , but possessed of a radiance which no earth flower had inherited before .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 31]: Darsie sat back on her heels , her arms , falling slack by her sides , her wide eyes fixed on the ground in a surprise too complete for speech .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 37]: Nobody spoke ; the stupor in her own brain must surely have communicated itself to the guests crowding around , for while one might have counted fifty there was blank , utter silence upon the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 37]: Then suddenly came a dramatic interruption ; a cry , almost a scream , in a high , feminine voice , and a tall , fashionably dressed woman grasped wildly at a dangling chain of stones .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 4]: `` My rubies !
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 3]: My rubies !
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 6]: My beautiful , beautiful rubies !
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 3]: Found again !
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 4]: _ Safe _ !
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 6]: Oh , my rubies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 34]: She burst into excited sobs , a gentleman came forward and led her gently aside , but her place was immediately taken by other women -- white-faced , eager , trembling with anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 6]: Oh-h -- let me look !
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 15]: It 's the jewels , the lost jewels -- Are my diamonds among them ?
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 11]: Do you see a diamond necklace with an emerald clasp ?
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 10]: Oh , _ do _ , do look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 4]: `` My sapphires !
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 6]: They were taken , too .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 3]: My sapphires !
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 23]: -- '' They fell on their knees , regardless of their filmy draperies , and grasped at one shining treasure after another .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 51]: The delicate chains were knotted together ; curved corners of gold had caught in other curved corners , so that in some cases half a dozen different ornaments presented the appearance of one big , bejewelled ball , and it was no easy matter to disentangle one from the other .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 83]: The different owners , however , showed a marvellous quickness in recognising even a fragment of their lost treasures , and their exultation was somewhat undignified as they turned and twisted and coaxed the dainty threads , and finally clasped their lost treasures , safe and sound , and all the time Darsie sat back on her heels , with her golden hair hanging in heavy masses over her shoulders , her eyes fixed upon this extraordinary scene , staring -- staring !
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 13]: `` Darsie , dear child , how can we thank you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 49]: Mrs Percival 's low voice trembled with earnestness ; she had lifted a long string of pearls from the grass , and now held it between both hands , with a transparent pleasure it was true , but without any of the hysteric excitement shown by her guests .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 22]: `` Do you realise all that your workman 's bundle contained , or the weight you have taken off our minds ?
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 34]: It was the thief 's bundle , the bundle of jewels which he stole from the house on the night of the Hunt Ball , which we have tried so hard to recover !
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 18]: To think -- to think that all this time they have been hidden close at hand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 8]: `` Hidden with a purpose , too !
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 7]: Look at this , Evelyn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 35]: interrupted Mr Percival , holding out a corner of the checked handkerchief towards his wife , with a stern look on his handsome face -- '' ` B.W. ' That 's Wilson 's property !
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 10]: He was a worse offender than we thought . ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 3]: `` Wilson ?
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 11]: That was the young gamekeeper , was n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 18]: asked another man -- the husband of the lady who was still crooning over her recovered diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 25]: `` You thought he had been led away by smart London thieves , but this seems as if he had taken a leading part .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 19]: Looks , too , as if there may have been only himself and Forbes in the affair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 4]: `` Just so !
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 12]: No wonder Wilson refused to give the names of his colleagues .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 24]: When the chase grew too hot he hid the spoils in this tree -- evidently an old hiding-place -- before climbing the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 19]: If he had made clear away that night we should never have suspected his share in the theft .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 18]: He would have turned up as usual next morning , and expressed great surprise at the news .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 29]: As it is he and Forbes are no doubt patiently waiting until their sentences are out , expecting to slip back some dark night and secure their prey .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 25]: From such point of view it is a small business to serve a few months when there 's a fortune waiting at the end !
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 10]: Well , this takes ten years off my back .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 15]: I ca n't tell you how the whole business has preyed on our minds .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 16]: My dear fellow , I am so thankful that your diamonds have turned up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 16]: `` My dear fellow , it was fifteen times worse for you than for us !
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 12]: A most uncomfortable position ; I congratulate you a hundred times .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 9]: Just in the nick of time , too .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 15]: In a month or so there would have been no bundle to discover . ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 55]: A general gasp at once of dismay and relief passed round the little inner circle of those most nearly interested in the recovered treasures , and the first excitement of recovery having passed , every one seemed bent on lavishing thanks and praises upon the girl through whom the happy discovery had come about .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 6]: `` Who is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 7]: `` What is her name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 8]: `` Where does she come from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 25]: The questions buzzed on every side , and the answer , `` Lady Hayes 's grand-niece , '' served only to enhance existing attractions .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 39]: Darsie found herself kissed , patted , embraced , called by a dozen caressing names by half a dozen fine ladies in turn , during which process every eye on the lawn was turned upon her blushing face .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 46]: Through a gap in the crowd she could see Lady Hayes holding as it were a secondary court , being thanked effusively for possessing a grand-niece with a faculty for recovering jewels , and bowing acknowledgments with a bright patch of colour on either cheekbone .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 53]: The position was so strange and bewildering that even yet it seemed more like a dream than reality ; that sudden rain of jewels descending from the linen bag was the sort of thing one might expect in an Arabian night adventure rather than in the midst of a decorous English garden-party !
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 28]: It must surely be in imagination that she , Darsie Garnett , has been hailed as a good fairy to all these fashionably dressed men and women !
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 50]: The almost hysteric effusion of the women who kissed and gushed around her must surely have something infectious in its nature , since she herself was beginning to feel an insane inclination to burst into tears or laughter , it was immaterial which of the two it should be .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 37]: Darsie turned a quick look around , searching for a way of escape , and at that moment Noreen 's hand pressed on her arm , and she found herself being led gently towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 7]: `` Poor old Darsie , then !
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 6]: She looks quite dazed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 5]: said Noreen 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 9]: `` No wonder , after all that fuss .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 16]: You 've been kissed to pieces , poor dear , and howled over , too .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 3]: Silly things !
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 14]: howling when things are lost , and howling again when they are found !
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 26]: I 've no patience with them ; but , oh , my dear , I _ do _ bless you for what you 've done !
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 10]: You 've no idea how relieved we shall be .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 27]: It was such a _ stigma _ to have your guests robbed under your own roof , and by one of your own men , too .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 27]: Mother has never been the same since -- worried herself into nerves , and fancied every one blamed her , and thought she 'd been careless .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 28]: You ca n't think _ how _ happy she 'll be writing to the people who are n't here to-day telling them that their things are found .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 8]: She 'll feel a new creature . ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 6]: `` I 'm so glad .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 5]: She 's a dear .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 10]: Was n't she sweet and dignified among them all ?
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 4]: Oh , dear !
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 6]: I 'm all churned up .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 33]: I thought as I could n't find a treasure I 'd have a little joke on my own account , and after all I found the biggest treasure of all , Noreen !
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 9]: how much money were those things worth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 11]: `` Oh , my dear , do n't ask me !
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 17]: Mother 's pearls alone are worth three thousand , and that 's nothing to the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 12]: Mrs Ferriers ' rubies are the most valuable , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 14]: Altogether it must be a fortune -- to say nothing of the associations .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 8]: Is n't it strange to think of ?
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 37]: An hour ago you were a stranger whom scarcely any one knew even by sight , and now in a flash you have become a celebrity , a heroine -- the pet of the county ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 4]: `` Am I ?
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 2]: Really ?
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 4]: It sounds agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 20]: I 'll write to-night and tell Vie Vernon , and sign myself ` The Pet of the County . '
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 7]: She _ will _ be impressed .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 16]: Pity it was n't my own county , where it would be of more use .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 11]: I shall probably never see these good people again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 4]: `` Fiddle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 4]: cried Noreen derisively .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 6]: `` No chance of that .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 17]: Whether you like it or no , my dear , this day has settled your fate .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 10]: You can never be a mere acquaintance any more .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 17]: You 've done us a service which will bind us together as long as we live .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 19]: Henceforth a bit of you belongs to us , and we 'll see that we get it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 4]: A DREAM FULFILLED .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 12]: The next week brought with it a succession of bewildering excitements .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 49]: From morn till night , as it seemed , the bell rang , and visitors were ushered in to congratulate Lady Hayes and her niece on the happy episode of the jewel-finding , and to repeat _ ad infinitum _ the same questions , ejaculations , and remarks .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 75]: People who had no personal interest in the theft seemed , strangely enough , quite as excited and curious as those who had ; and even when their curiosity was satisfied there still remained the servants in the house , the tradesmen in the village , the very children in the roads , who seemed one and all possessed with a thirst to hear the romantic story from the lips of the heroine herself .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 7]: Then letters from relations and friends !
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 54]: However minutely one might retail every incident , there still seemed an endless number of details which remained to be told to people who could not be satisfied without knowing in each case what _ he _ said , how _ she _ looked , how _ you _ yourself felt and behaved !
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 21]: The first three days were spent in talk ; on the fourth began a second and still more exciting stage .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 66]: The bell rang , a small , daintily tied parcel was handed in for Miss Garnett , which being unwrapped revealed a red velvet jeweller 's box , and within that a small heart-shaped pendant , slung on a gold chain , and composed of one large and several small rubies , set transparently , so as to show to advantage their glowing rosy light .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 39]: An accompanying card bore the inscription , `` A small expression of gratitude from Mrs Eustace Ferriers '' ; but even this proof was hardly sufficient to convince Darsie that such splendour was really for her own possession .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 4]: `` Aunt Maria !
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 7]: Can she _ mean _ it ?
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 7]: Is it really to keep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 6]: `` Certainly , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 3]: Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 26]: It is quite natural that Mrs Ferriers should wish to give you some little remembrance as you were the means of restoring a valuable heirloom .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 6]: It is a good stone .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 10]: You must be careful not to lose it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 15]: `` Is it valuable , Aunt Maria -- worth a lot of money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 10]: `` It is a pretty ornament , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 11]: Do not look a gift horse in the mouth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 71]: It was all very well for Aunt Maria , a titled lady with a box full of jewels of her own , to take things calmly , but for a member of a poor large family to receive a ruby pendant was a petrifying experience , only to be credited by a continual opening of the box and holding of it in one 's hand to gaze upon its splendours .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 48]: And then the very next morning the bell rang again , and in came another parcel , another jeweller 's box , and inside it a blue enamelled watch with an encircling glitter of light where a family of tiny diamonds formed a border round the edge .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 31]: There was an enamel bow also to fasten it on to a dress , but Darsie fairly quaked at the thought of the responsibility of wearing so gorgeous an ornament .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 12]: `` That will do for mother , '' she announced decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 29]: `` It would n't be _ decent _ for me to flaunt about in enamel and diamonds when she has an old gold thing that is always slow .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 23]: Besides , if she wears it I can watch the diamonds flash , and that is the best part of the fun .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 7]: Aunt Maria , that 's two !
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 26]: Do you suppose , should you imagine , that they 'll _ all _ -- '' Lady Hayes looked shocked , as in duty bound .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 12]: `` My dear , I do n't suppose anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 6]: That is not our affair .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 25]: It is sufficient that these two friends have been most kind and generous , and that you ought to be a very grateful girl .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 13]: Surmises as to future gifts are in the worst possible taste . ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 29]: Darsie wrinkled her nose and sat in silence for several moments , moving the little watch to and fro to catch the play of light upon the stones .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 22]: Then suddenly she spoke again -- `` Aunt Maria , what are your ideas with regard to _ luck _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 8]: `` I have none , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 9]: I do n't believe in its existence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 8]: `` But you must , Aunt Maria .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 3]: You must .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 30]: It was the merest luck my seeing that hole , and thinking of feeling inside , but it seems as if it were going to have such big consequences .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 23]: Just in a moment it has brought me more influential friends than most girls meet with in the whole of their lives .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 45]: They are all grateful to me ; they feel that I have helped them ; they want to help me in return ; but after all there 's no credit to me , it was all done without one scrap of thought or trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 32]: It seems hard to think that many people work and slave for years , and fail to gain a quarter as much as I have done by just pure luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 12]: `` Do n't be so sweeping in your assertions , child .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 10]: These are early days yet to talk about results .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 40]: When you come to my age , my dear , you will look back and realise that those who go through life in the right spirit are never left to the mercy of what you call ` luck . '
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 18]: ` Submit thy way unto the Lord , and _ He _ will direct thy path . '
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 30]: I am an old woman , Darsie , but I can say from my heart that goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 10]: Darsie sat gazing thoughtfully into her aunt 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 41]: Within the last weeks a degree of intimacy had developed between the old woman and the girl , which made it possible for the latter to speak out more openly than she would have believed possible a short month before .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 30]: `` Aunt Maria , '' she said slowly , `` I wish you would explain ... You talk of goodness and mercy , but -- do n't be shocked !
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 19]: -- it does n't seem to me that you have so _ much _ to be thankful for !
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 52]: ... You are rich , of course , but that does n't count for much by itself , and your life must have been hard ... You are delicate , and your husband died , and you have no children -- no one to live with you in this big house .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 31]: Now when you _ are _ old you are so lonely that you are glad to have me -- a girl like me -- for a few weeks ' visit !
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 41]: When I go away you will be lonely again ... '' A tremor passed over Lady Hayes 's face ; the thin fingers crossed and uncrossed themselves on her lap , but she smiled , a brave and patient smile .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 7]: `` You are right , Darsie .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 24]: I have had bitter trials , nevertheless I have gained the greatest treasure that is given to any one on this earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 9]: `` What is that , Aunt Maria ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 26]: `` Peace in my soul , child -- ` the peace of God , which passeth understanding , ' '' said the old woman solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 7]: There was silence in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 16]: Darsie bent her head , awed and touched by the sound of those wondrous words .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 36]: A month ago , at home with her brothers and sisters , she would have scoffed at the idea of peace in connection with Great-aunt Maria , but a closer intimacy had altered her opinion .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 13]: About the trifling affairs of every day Aunt Maria continued to fuss .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 25]: No one could deny for a moment that she fussed ; but the big demands of life found her calm , serene , prepared .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 23]: On the surface the waters might dash occasionally into foam , but the deep , strong current bore steadily towards the sea !
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 19]: Darsie pondered , and as though divining the course of her thoughts , Lady Hayes spoke once more .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 27]: `` Perhaps that appears to you a serious statement for me to make , since there are times when I must appear a very unpeaceful person .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 19]: I am apt to be unduly concerned about trifles , to my own exhaustion and that of others .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 24]: I am aware of the fact , and also that to one of your impetuous disposition such a failing must be particularly trying .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 21]: Nevertheless , Darsie , '' -- the old voice deepened impressively -- '' _ the peace is there _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 8]: Slowly , thoughtfully Darsie bowed her head .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 6]: `` Yes , I know .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 7]: I 've _ felt _ it .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 6]: It has made me ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 25]: The human part of you may get out of hand sometimes , but you are _ very _ nearly an angel , Aunt Maria .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 9]: You have n't much more to learn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 28]: Lady Hayes shook her head , but her hand fell on Darsie 's head with a tender touch , and a light shone in the tired eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 11]: The lonely heart was grateful for those words of encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 50]: Darsie 's surmise that still more presents might arrive was justified by the delivery of three more packets -- a dainty little pearl necklace from Mrs Percival , a turquoise and diamond ring -LRB- oh , the rapture of owning a real ring of one 's very own ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 20]: and a combination present of a jewelled bangle from three other ladies who had benefited by the lucky find .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 40]: Thus in one short week had Darsie 's jewellery risen from a total which she herself described as consisting of `` a few glass beads and a gold safety-pin '' to five separate articles of real beauty and value .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 65]: She was fond of spreading her treasures in a row on the table and gazing at them _ en bulk _ , moving her head from side to side to enjoy the flashing colours of the stones , and as she did so Lady Hayes was more than surprised by a mercenary element which seemed out of keeping with the girl 's natural character .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 21]: `` Rubies are the most valuable stones , are n't they , Aunt Maria -- more valuable than diamonds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 17]: `` If they are of the right colour and depth , and of sufficient size . ''
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 9]: `` You said this was a good stone .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 6]: It 's a ripping colour .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 15]: I should think this must be a valuable stone , would n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 13]: `` I prefer not to speculate on the subject , child . ''
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 15]: Or again -- `` I should think this watch was worth lots of money .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 26]: I have just counted , and there are forty diamonds , teenies , of course , but still -- And the enamel is so fine .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 24]: My bracelet has five _ big _ diamonds , and a whole heap of pearls ; and there 's the necklace , too .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 18]: Should you think , Aunt Maria , that they were worth a hundred pounds put together ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 18]: Lady Hayes laid down her knitting , and stared with stony eyes into the girl 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 21]: `` I have told you before , Darsie , that I excessively dislike surmises as to the value of presents .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 16]: I am surprised and disappointed to discover signs of an avaricious and grasping nature ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 17]: To her surprise and dismay the only reply to this serious aspersion was a good-natured laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 9]: `` Goodness gracious , mercy on us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 4]: cried Darsie audaciously .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 18]: `` I 'm bad enough , in all conscience , but I 'm not _ that _ !
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 6]: Not a grasp in me !
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 18]: You ask any one at home , and they 'll tell you I 'm quite stupidly generous .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 24]: It 's not the money for the money 's sake , I think of , but for what it will _ do _ !
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 25]: I 've no use for jewels , Aunt Maria -- sha n't ever have a chance of wearing them , like Noreen and Ida .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 8]: Imagine a daily governess glittering with gems !
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 34]: But if only -- only I could turn them into money , it might fulfil the big ambition of my life and send me to Newnham , without troubling father for a penny !
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 20]: Can you wonder that I feel impatient with watches and chains when I think of _ that _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 8]: `` I am sorry , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 5]: I did not understand .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 4]: I apologise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 5]: said Lady Hayes promptly .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 37]: It was this unfailing sense of justice , combined with the dignity which never forsook her under any stress of excitement or agitation , which had been most largely instrumental in attracting the girl 's admiration .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 46]: From the impetuous standpoint of youth it seemed an almost inhuman pinnacle of perfection , but Darsie was quite determined that at some far-distant elderly epoch -- say , in thirty years ' time -- she would begin practising these virtues on her own account .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 12]: They seemed the only decorous accompaniment of white hair and spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 18]: She stretched out a sunburnt hand and patted the old lady 's shoulder with an affectionate touch .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 4]: `` All right !
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 4]: Do n't worry .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 15]: It _ did _ seem greedy , and of course you could n't guess .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 31]: You see , it 's particularly hard because plain Ha - Hannah Vernon , I mean -- is going up , and that seems to make it worse for me .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 54]: Her father is richer than ours , and he believes in higher education , so it 's all settled that she is to go to Newnham , and she talks about it all the time , and pities me when she 's in a good temper , and brags when she 's not .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 29]: And Dan would be at Cambridge , too , and Ralph Percival , and , oh dear , oh dear , we 'd have such _ sport _ !
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 22]: Balls , and picnics , and cocoa parties , and boating in summer -- no end of lovely exciting pranks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 44]: `` Excuse me , my dear , '' -- Lady Hayes was frosty again , staring stonily over the rim of her spectacles -- `` excuse me , but would you kindly explain for what reason you are anxious to go to Cambridge ?
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 20]: I had imagined that it was for education , now it appears that balls and picnics are the attraction .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 14]: Which of the two is it of which you are really thinking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 12]: `` Oh , Aunt Maria , I 'm a human girl !
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 6]: Of _ both _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 5]: cried Darsie , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 40]: `` Education first , of course , because of the result , and all it will mean afterwards , but if you want the truth , I should n't be so keen if it was n't for the fun !
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 56]: We know a girl who 's just come down , and it sounds such a lovely life ... I 'd work hard ; I love work , and when there is any on hand there 's no peace for me till it 's done ; but _ would n't _ I just play , too !
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 9]: It would be the time of my life .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 54]: Oh , Aunt Maria , when I look at the governesses at school , and think that I 'm going to be like that all my days , it _ does _ seem hard that I should n't have just two or three years _ first _ of the life I want ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 40]: The words , the tone , both bore a touch of real pathos ; nevertheless Lady Hayes smiled , as if , so far from being pained by the sad prospect , she found something amusing in the contemplation .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 29]: `` It is a mistake to look too far ahead in life , but of course if you contemplate teaching , you ought to be thoroughly equipped . ''
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 13]: She was silent for a moment , gazing thoughtfully through the window .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 53]: Then in a level , perfectly commonplace voice she continued : `` I shall be pleased , my dear , to defray the expenses of your course at Newnham ... '' The manner in which our great ambitions in life meet their realisation is always and inevitably other than we have imagined .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 77]: Sometimes so many years have passed by since the dreaming of the cherished plans , that the eager spirit is transformed into a wearied and dispirited being , to whom fulfilment brings no joy ; sometimes it comes freighted with complications which rob it of half its zest ; sometimes it brings no charm at all , but only bitterness and disappointment ; and again -- oh , often again , thank God for His mercies !
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 24]: -- it comes at the moment of hopelessness , of renunciation , dazzling the eyes and heart with a very incredulity of joy .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 33]: Those few quiet words in an old woman 's voice transformed for Darsie Garnett the whole path ahead , making what had seemed a far-away vision become a solid , tangible fact .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 22]: Quietly , prosaically , without any nourish of trumpets , the great prize of life had been handed into her grasp .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 21]: She sat motionless , staring with distended eyes , while Lady Hayes continued to speak in calm , even tones .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 24]: `` I should like to explain to you , my dear , that I am not as rich a woman as I appear .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 31]: It was my dear husband 's wish that I should continue to occupy this house for the term of my life , but after that it passes to his relations .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 22]: It is an expensive place to keep up , and leaves little margin out of the income which goes with it .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 18]: I can not save as I should have wished , and my own property is not large .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 19]: When it is divided among my various nephews and nieces , there will not be much for each .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 26]: I should like to have done more for your father , as he has a large family to provide for , but it is impossible .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 33]: In your case , however , you have done me a kindness in spending these weeks with me when I needed companionship -- and , I think , we are good friends !
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 29]: I can spare a few hundreds to give you your training _ and _ your fun -- and it will be a pleasure to me to do so .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 28]: I will make a formal arrangement in my will so that in the case of my -- so that in any case the money may be forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 21]: So , my dear , you may look upon the matter as settled , and make your arrangements accordingly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 8]: Darsie put her hands to her head .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 23]: Her cheeks were white , but around her eyes and nose an increasing pinkness of hue betrayed the inward struggle of emotion .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 7]: `` I 'm going to cry !
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 7]: I 'm going to cry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 25]: And when Lady Hayes began a protest , `` Oh , Aunt Maria , do n't , _ do n't _ be proper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 4]: she pleaded piteously .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 9]: `` I ca n't bear it just now .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 12]: Please , please let me thank you in my own way !
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 4]: I must howl !
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 5]: I _ must _ !
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 51]: I 'm all seething and churning with emotion , and if I do n't cry I shall burst ; but oh , I _ do _ love you -- I adore you -- I shall worship you until my dying day ... You 'll be like a saint to me .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 19]: I 'll put you up on a pedestal and burn incense to you every day of my life .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 9]: If you _ knew _ what it meant !
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 15]: And I 've been so mean and hateful -- such a contemptible little worm !
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 19]: Oh , if I lived a hundred thousand years , I could never repay you for this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 21]: `` My dear , does it strike you that you are talking in a very wild , exaggerated fashion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 7]: `` I am , I am !
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 17]: Girls _ do _ , Aunt Maria , when they are off their heads with joy .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 15]: Wild , I mean , not exaggerated -- I mean it , every word .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 9]: Oh , I _ must _ hug you .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 19]: Never mind your cap ; I must give you a bear hug , if I die for it .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 48]: Dear , dearest , kindest , best -- '' The old lady 's stiff , upright figure disappeared bodily within the swooping arms ; she was squeezed , hugged , rocked to and fro , and pelted with kisses until she was speechless and gasping for breath .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 69]: When she was released her cap was askew , and the muslin folds in the front of her gown crumpled out of recognition ; but for a marvel she spoke no word of reproach , and Darsie saw , with a sobering thrill , a glitter as of tears in the old eyes , and the mental question which arose at the sight was answered with intuitive sharpness .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 30]: It was so long since she had been hugged before , so many , many years since anything more than a conventional peck had been pressed upon her cheek !
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 16]: Old , stern , proper as she was , Aunt Maria loved to be loved !
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 21]: For the rest of the morning Darsie was as subdued and gentle in manner as she had hitherto been boisterous .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 49]: The future was discussed in detail , and plans made which revolutionised more and more her future life , for Lady Hayes seemed to take for granted that in taking upon herself the responsibility for the girl 's education she had earned a certain right to her society .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 57]: Such phrases as `` And in the holiday-time we can discuss , '' `` When you are here in the summer vacation , '' `` I shall look forward to hearing your descriptions , '' could not be misunderstood , but for the moment the big gain outweighed the loss , and Darsie smiled on unperturbed .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 37]: In time to come the sacrifice of merry family holidays would of a certainty demand its toll of suffering , but why encourage trouble that lay ahead when the present was so blissfully full of contentment ?
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 35]: When lunch was over Darsie tucked her hostess on the sofa , and hailed with delight the opportunity of a free hour in which to dream uninterrupted over the wonderful development of the day .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 10]: `` I 'll go out and walk it off .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 11]: I 'll rush down to the village and telegraph home .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 8]: I ca n't possibly wait to write .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 17]: How can I put it so that it will be plain enough and not too plain ?
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 5]: ` Newnham ahoy ! '
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 12]: ` I 'm off to Newnham College in the morning ! '
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 7]: ` Plans for Newnham satisfactorily arranged .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 6]: Break news to Hannah . '
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 7]: _ Wo n't _ they stare !
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 33]: It 's a blessing that neither Clemence nor Lavender would care to go if they had the chance , so they wo n't be jealous , but Hannah _ will _ jump .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 8]: And Dan -- what will Dan say ?
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 10]: It is good luck knowing the boys so well .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 8]: We 'll make them take us about .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 22]: To think that I was so furious and rebellious about this visit , and that it should have ended like this !
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 11]: It will be a lesson to me for life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 90]: It was very pleasant to ride through the sweet smelling lanes on this bright summer afternoon ; very pleasant work sending off that telegram to the parents at the seaside , and drawing mental pictures of the excitement and rejoicings which would follow its arrival ; pleasant to meet on every side kindly , interested glances , and to realise that if she were , as Noreen had declared , `` the pet of the county , '' she was assuredly also `` the heroine of the village . ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 84]: It was a temptation to linger in the quaint little streets ; but on this afternoon of all others Darsie was anxious not to be late for tea , so , with a sigh of regret , she turned up a side lane leading to the field path to the Manor , and in so doing came face to face with Ralph Percival , who , in his lightest and most sporting attire , was escorting a pack of dogs for an airing .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 40]: There was the big silky-haired collie whom Darsie loved , the splay-footed dachshund which she hated , the huge mastiff which she feared , with one or two terriers of different breeds -- alert , friendly , and gentle-eyed .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 48]: One and all came sniffing round her as their master stopped to shake hands , and she stood up stiff and straight , trying to look at ease , and as if she were not really in momentary terror of an attack upon her ankles and skirts .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 4]: `` Halloa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 5]: `` How are you ?
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 9]: Still living in a shower of jewels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 13]: `` I _ have _ been , but it 's clearing off !
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 7]: The combination bracelet finished the list .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 15]: Now I 'm beginning to live in fear of another burglary , on myself .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 11]: It will be a relief to get the things distributed .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 34]: Mother is to have the watch , Clemence the pendant , Lavender the brooch , and I am going to be greedy and keep the bracelet and necklace and ring for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 6]: `` What a miser ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 5]: cried Ralph , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 44]: His grey eyes looked very handsome and agreeable lit up with the twinkling light of amusement , and Darsie 's spirits rose still a degree higher as he whistled to the dogs and turned round with the evident intention of accompanying her home .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 8]: `` We 'll come along with you .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 15]: It does n't matter where we go so long as we have a run .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 8]: Bound for the Manor , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 6]: How 's the old lady ?
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 9]: In a good humour , I should say .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 10]: You look particularly full of beams this afternoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 7]: `` I am -- brimming over !
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 44]: You see before you , kind sir , the touching spectacle of a young female who has not a single ungratified wish in the world , and is so happy that she does n't know how to preserve a decent appearance of calm .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 14]: It 's the more extraordinary because she usually wants quite a lot . ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 9]: Ralph 's eyebrows went up in expressive disdain .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 3]: `` Re-al-ly !
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 6]: You do n't say so !
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 9]: Glad to hear it , I 'm shaw !
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 17]: The kind donors would be much gratified to know of the magic effect of their gifts .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 19]: I wonder , under the circumstances , that you could bear to part from any of them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 22]: The words were spoken in his most drawling and superior voice , and brought the blood rushing into Darsie 's cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 18]: She stood still in the middle of the road , and glared at him with flashing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 4]: `` Horrible boy !
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 16]: What a disagreeable mind you must have , to think such mean , contemptible thoughts !
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 4]: Bother the jewellery !
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 10]: It may go to Jericho for all I care .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 9]: I 'm happy for a very different reason .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 24]: Aunt Maria has just promised to pay for me to go to Newnham , and that has been the dream of my life .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 25]: There 's nothing to sneer at , you see , though perhaps _ you _ can manage to be superior even about that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 5]: `` Yes , easily .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 30]: I hate blue-stockings , '' said Ralph calmly , but his eyes twinkled as he spoke , and in spite of herself Darsie was obliged to smile in response .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 10]: `` And I hate narrow-minded , prejudiced young men !
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 26]: you 've put me in a bad temper on this day of days , just when I felt that I could never be cross again .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 17]: I 'll forgive you only because it 's impossible to go _ on _ being cross .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 19]: I 've just been to the post-office to telegraph the great news to my people at the seaside .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 31]: They 'll be wild with excitement , especially my chum who will be going up at the same time , Hannah Vernon -- ` plain Hannah ' we call her .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 8]: Funny nickname , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 5]: `` Sounds ingratiating ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 32]: Voice and expression were alike so expressive that Darsie went off into a merry trill of laughter , as she hastened to take up the cudgels in plain Hannah 's defence .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 8]: `` She does n't care a bit .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 7]: Jokes about it with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 13]: And she is so funnily ugly that it 's really rather dear .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 5]: _ And _ clever !
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 15]: She 'll be a first-class girl , you 'll see if she is n't .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 16]: I shall be nowhere beside her , but I 'm going to _ grind _ .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 30]: Let me see : if we go up in three years ' time , when we 're eighteen , how long will you have left of your course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 8]: `` Perhaps a year , perhaps two .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 8]: Depends upon how soon I go up .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 19]: It is n't as if I had to go in for a profession or anything of that kind .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 22]: I shall spend my life looking after the property , and there 's no particular need to swot for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 33]: `` I hate loafers , '' said Darsie in her turn , then once more relented and said genially , `` But I do n't believe you mean half that you say .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 44]: Anyway , I shall look forward to meeting you at Cambridge , and I hope you are prepared to be kind , and to be ready to return the good offices which I have been able to render to your respected family . ''
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 4]: `` I am .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 9]: What do you want me to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 9]: `` To be nice to me at Cambridge !
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 22]: I shall be a shy , lone Fresher , and you can make things much livelier for me if you like .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 6]: I want you to like !
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 29]: Dan Vernon will be there , too , but he 's so serious and clever that he wo n't be much good for the _ fun _ part .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 37]: I want you to promise not to be superior and proud , but a real friend to take us about , and dance with us at the balls , and get up picnics on the river .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 19]: I can manage the work part for myself , but I want some help for the fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 18]: She expected an instant response , but Ralph was too cautious to be drawn into rash promises .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 14]: `` Er -- what exactly do you mean by ` we ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 13]: `` Myself and my chum , of course -- Hannah Vernon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 5]: `` Plain Hannah ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 5]: `` Plain Hannah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 6]: Ralph shook his handsome head .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 10]: `` I make no promise as regards plain Hannah .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 20]: I 'm not particularly partial to plain Hannahs , but I 'll do my level best for Darsie Garnett .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 3]: Like to !
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 18]: You can count upon me to do my best to give you a rattling good time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 23]: Darsie regarded him doubtfully , reflected that it was wisdom to accept what one could get , and smiled a gracious approval .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 6]: `` Thanks -- so much !
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 7]: Then it 's a promise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 4]: A promise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 4]: They laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 11]: The dogs leaped in the air and barked with delight .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 8]: Everything and every one seemed happy to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 25]: Darsie felt that if she lived to be a hundred she could never , by any possibility , reach a higher pinnacle of content .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 4]: AFTER THREE YEARS .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 8]: `` Is your trunk ready , Darsie ?
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 7]: Are you ready to come down ?
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 11]: Lunch is on the table and we 're all waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 6]: Have you fitted everything in ?
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 15]: Oh dear , oh dear , how bleak and bare the room does look !
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 15]: I shall never have the heart to enter it after you 're gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 36]: Clemence Garnett , aged twenty years , gave a pitiful glance round the dismantled room , which a few hours before had been decorated with the many and varied objects which were Darsie 's treasures .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 67]: She looked at the wooden wardrobe , the doors of which swung wide , showing a row of empty pegs , at the scattering of paper and rejected ends of ribbon and lace which littered the floor , and finally back at the figure of Darsie herself , kneeling before the great black trunk , with her golden hair ruffling round a flushed , eager face .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 11]: `` Sit on it , Clemence , like a lamb .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 15]: It 's _ got _ to meet , but it 's inches apart still .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 19]: Sit down with a flop , and be your heaviest , while I fight with the lock . ''
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 6]: `` Better take something out .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 14]: If you make it so full , it may burst half - way .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 7]: How would you like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 11]: `` Not much ; but better than leaving anything behind .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 12]: It would n't dare to burst after costing so much money .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 4]: It 's done .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 10]: You 're a pretty substantial weight , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 16]: Now then for lunch and a rest ; I 've had a terrific morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 23]: Darsie rose to her feet and stood for a moment before the mirror , putting a tidying touch to hair and dress .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 36]: She was a tall , slim girl , nearly a head taller than the more substantial Clemence , and the easy grace which characterised her movements was the first thing which attracted an unaccustomed eye .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 41]: Even Clemence , with perceptions dulled by custom , felt dimly that it was an agreeable thing to watch Darsie brush her hair and shake out her skirts , though in another person such acts would be prosaic and tiresome .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 37]: The crisp hair needed nothing but a brush and a pat to settle itself into a becoming halo of waves , and the small face on the long white neck had a quaint , kitten-like charm .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 21]: Clemence looked from the real Darsie to the reflected Darsie in the glass , and felt a sudden knife-like pang .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 11]: `` Oh , how I _ hate _ you going !
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 6]: How dull it will be .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 20]: Why _ could n't _ you be content to stay at home instead of taking up this Newnham craze ?
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 9]: I shall miss you hideously , Darsie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 11]: Darsie smiled involuntarily , then nobly tried to look sad .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 27]: `` I expect you will , but one grown-up at home is as much as we can afford , and there 'll be lovely long vacs .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 27]: You must think of those , and the letters , and coming up to see me sometimes , and term time will pass in a flash .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 13]: I 'll be back before you realise that I 'm gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 6]: Clemence pouted in sulky denial .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 6]: `` Nothing of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 6]: It will seem an age .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 6]: It 's easy to talk !
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 24]: People who go away have all the fun and excitement and novelty ; it 's the poor stay-at-homes who are to be pitied .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 18]: How would you like to be me , sitting down to-morrow morning to darn the socks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 6]: `` Poor old Clem ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 4]: said Darsie lightly .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 27]: A moment later , with relenting candour , she added : `` You 'll like it a lot better than being examined by a Cambridge coach !
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 37]: So do n't grouse , my dear ; we 've both got the work we like best -- come down to lunch , and let 's see what mother has provided for my go-away meal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 45]: Darsie slid a hand through Clemence 's arm as she spoke and the two sisters squeezed down the narrow staircase , glad in their English , undemonstrative fashion of the close contact which an inherent shyness would have forbidden except in this accidental fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 25]: Across the oil - clothed passage they went , into the red-walled dining-room , where the other members of the family waited their arrival .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 29]: Mrs Garnett smiled at the traveller with a tinge of wistfulness on her face ; the four young people stared , with a curiosity oddly infused with respect .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 21]: A girl who was on the eve of starting for college had soared high above the level of ordinary school .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 57]: Lavender , at `` nearly seventeen , '' wore her fair locks tied back with a broad black ribbon ; her skirts reached to her ankles ; she was thin and angular ; her head was perpetually thrust forward , and a pair of spectacles were worn perpetually over the bridge of her pointed little nose .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 50]: The description does not sound attractive , yet in some mysterious manner , and despite all drawbacks , Lavender _ did _ manage to be attractive , and had a select band of followers at school who practised stoops and poked-out heads out of sheer admiration of her defects .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 63]: Harry 's voice was beginning to croak , which , taken together with a dawning passion for socks , ties , and brilliantine , was an unmistakable sign of growing up ; Russell was preternaturally thin and looked all arms and legs ; while Tim had forsaken knickers for full-fledged trousers , and resented any attempt at petting as an insufferable offence .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 79]: One and all were on their best company manners on the occasion of Darsie 's last lunch , and the most honeyed replies took the place of the usual somewhat stormy skirmish of wits ; nevertheless , there was a universal feeling of relief when the meal was over , and a peal at the bell announced the arrival of the cab which was to convey Darsie and a girl companion on the first stage of their journey .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 43]: If anything could have added to Darsie 's joy in the fulfilment of a lifelong ambition , it would have been the fact that Hannah Vernon was to be her companion at Newnham , as she had been through the earlier schooldays .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 28]: All the Vernon family were dears of the first water , and might have been specially created to meet the needs of their neighbours , the Garnetts .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 54]: It is true that the Vernons possessed the enviable advantage of a big grown-up brother , but when the Garnetts felt particularly tried on this score , they sought comfort from the reflection that a brother so solemn and scholarly , so reserved and unresponsive , hardly counted as a brother at all .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 23]: Dan was already in the second year of his Cambridge course , and was expected to do great things before he left .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 30]: So far as such a sober person could be made useful , Darsie Garnett intended to use him towards the furtherance of her own enjoyment of the new life .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 48]: For the rest , Vie , the eldest daughter of the Vernon household , was the sworn ally and confidante of Clemence , and John , the younger son , was in himself such a tower of mischievous strength that the Garnett trio sat at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 41]: Last , but certainly not least , came Hannah , and Hannah was -- Darsie would have found it an almost impossible task to describe `` plain Hannah '' to an unfortunate who had not the honour of her acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 17]: Hannah was Hannah , a being distinct by herself -- absolutely different from any one else .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 31]: To begin with , she was extraordinarily plain ; but , so far from grieving over the fact , Hannah wore it proudly as the foremost feather in her cap .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 35]: It was she herself who had originated and sanctioned the continued use of the sobriquet , which had its origin in a juvenile answer given by herself to a stranger who inquired her name .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 30]: Now Hannah was the only member of the family who was limited to one cognomen , so she answered unthinkingly , `` Hannah ; _ plain _ Hannah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 25]: and instantly descrying the twinkling appreciation in that stranger 's eyes , she twinkled herself , and henceforth led the adoption of the title .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 22]: Long use had almost deadened its meaning in the ears of the family , but strangers still suffered at the hearing .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 32]: Plain Hannah 's face peered cheerily out of the cab window , her little eyes twinkled merrily , her preposterous eyebrows arched in derision of the melancholy group upon the doorsteps .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 45]: No one dared shed a tear when she was so evidently on the watch for any sign of weakness , sentimental farewells were checked upon the speaker 's lips , and the whole business of parting assumed a lighter , a more matter-of-fact air .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 49]: A second big box was hoisted on to the cab roof , a few kisses shamefacedly exchanged , and then the travellers were off , and nothing remained to the watchers but to trail drearily back into a house from which half the brightness seemed to have departed .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 19]: Well might Clemence say that the worst pain of a parting fell on those who were left behind !
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 40]: While the stay-at-homes struggled heavily through a long afternoon , in every moment of which the feeling of loss became even more acute , Darsie and plain Hannah were enjoying one of the most exciting experiences of their lives .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 34]: In spite of an almost lifelong interest in Cambridge , neither girl had as yet visited the town itself , so that each incident of the journey was full of interest and excitement .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 54]: The station was disappointingly like other stations , and they had abundant opportunity of examining it at leisure , since the porters rushed in a body to attend to the male students who had arrived at the same time , and who could be trusted to give larger tips than their female companions .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 28]: The drive through the streets also fell short of expectations ; but , after all , Cambridge meant Newnham , and there could be no disappointment there !
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 15]: Peered at through the cab window , the building appeared unexpectedly large and imposing .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 32]: It gave one a thrill of importance to realise that for the next three years one would be part and parcel of its life , an inhabitant of its great halls .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 48]: The cabman descended from the box and rang a peal at the bell , and it came as something as a shock to see an ordinary-looking maid throw open the door , though what exactly they had imagined the girls would have found it difficult to say .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 32]: The maid inquired their names , led them forward through a long corridor , and flung open the door of a sitting - room where a lady sat before a desk .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 56]: It was a pretty , cheerful-looking apartment , full of flowers , books , pictures , and quaint old-world furniture , and the lady herself looked so much like other middle-aged ladies , that if you had not known it you would never have suspected her of being the Vice-President of a Women 's College .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 6]: She was kind and agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 86]: She shook hands , and hoped you were well ; hoped you had had a pleasant journey , hoped you would be happy in College , hoped you would like your rooms ; but there was a certain mechanical quality in her voice which betrayed the fact that she had said the same thing over and over again on innumerable occasions , would say it twenty times or more this very afternoon , and that your own personal arrival left her perfectly calm and cool .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 31]: The girls stuttered and stammered in response , felt vaguely crestfallen , and worried as to what they should do next , but the Vice herself was in no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 30]: `` She hoped they were ready for tea , '' and with a wave of the hand summoned the maid to lead them a stage forward on their journey .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 37]: The second stage deposited the new-comers in the dining-hall , where tea was already in progress , and about a dozen disconsolate-looking Freshers were munching at bread-and-butter and cake in a silence which could be felt .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 52]: Apparently Darsie and Hannah were the only ones of the number lucky enough to have come up in pairs , but even their tried powers of speech were paralysed beneath the spell of that terrible silence , and still more so by the relentless scrutiny of those twelve pairs of eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 9]: And how those Freshers _ did _ stare !
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 20]: The whites of their eyes positively shone , as with one accord the pupils turned towards the opening door .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 31]: They had been stared at themselves , had come through the ordeal of being the last arrival ; now , with thanksgiving , they were revenging themselves upon fresh victims !
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 48]: Darsie felt a horrible certainty that she would drop her cup , and spill the tea over the floor ; plain Hannah munched and munched , and looked plainer than ever , with her shoulders half-way up to her ears and her chin burrowed in her necktie .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 38]: Presently the door opened again , and another Fresher entered , cast a frightened glance around , and subsided on to the nearest chair , while every eye turned to gaze upon her , in her turn .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 36]: This programme was enacted several times over before Darsie and Hannah had finished tea , and were ready to be escorted to the upstairs apartments , which were to act as bedroom and study combined .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 42]: Mercifully the rooms were close together , so that , leaving Darsie half - way along the corridor , the maid could point to a door near at hand , where she could join her friend when her inspection was complete .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 25]: She entered with the feeling of one on the threshold of a new life , and stood gazing around in mingled disappointment and delight .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 23]: The first impression was of bareness and severity , an effect caused by the absence of picture or ornament of any kind .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 49]: A small white bed stood in one corner ; a curtain draped another , acting as a substitute for a wardrobe ; a very inadequate screen essayed unsuccessfully to conceal a wooden washstand , and a small square of glass discouraged vanity on the part of an occupant .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 5]: So far , bad !
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 36]: but , on the other hand , the room contained inexpensive luxuries , in the shape of an old oak chest , a bureau , a standing bookcase , and a really comfortable wicker chair .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 34]: Darsie could hardly believe that these treasures were meant for her own use ; it seemed more likely that they had belonged to a former student , who would presently demand their return .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 23]: She was sorrowfully resigning herself to this contingency when the door burst open , and in rushed Hannah , aglow with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 22]: `` I 've got a chest , and a bookcase , and a bu -- '' Her eyes rounded with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 4]: `` I say !
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 12]: So have you -- I thought I _ was _ swag !
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 10]: Do you suppose it 's the usual thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 5]: `` Ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 7]: Topping for us if it is .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 19]: But the screen 's a wretch , and the walls will need a _ lot _ of covering .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 9]: My few mites of pictures will go nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 14]: There 's not _ too _ much room for our clothes , either .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 15]: We 'd better unpack , I suppose , and get out things for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 8]: What are you going to wear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 19]: `` Oh , something -- whatever comes handy , '' replied plain Hannah in her most casual manner .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 63]: The subject seemed to her of infinitesimal importance ; but Darsie went through many agitations of mind before she decided on a high-necked summer frock , and then suffered still keener pangs because , on descending to Hall , several Freshers were discovered in full evening dress , and , in her imagination at least , eyed her lace yoke with disdain .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 49]: Dinner was almost as silent as tea -- an ordeal of curious , appraising eyes , as each Fresher continued to stare at every other Fresher , condemning her mentally for want of frankness and kindliness , while utterly neglecting to practise these virtues on her own account .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 24]: Then one by one the girls slunk upstairs , tired , shy , and homesick , and crept gratefully into their narrow beds .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 31]: Sleep was long in coming to Darsie Garnett that night : she lay awake hour after hour , living over again in thought the events of the last three years .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 23]: First and foremost her thoughts went back to the old great-aunt to whose generosity she owed the present fulfilment of her ambition .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 41]: Until Lady Hayes 's death , a year ago , Darsie had spent the major part of her holidays at The Towers , and the friendship between the old woman and the girl had developed into a very real affection .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 37]: It had been a wonderful experience , Darsie reflected , to watch the gradual mellowing of character , the patient endurance of suffering , the peaceful death which was so truly a `` falling asleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 32]: Until that time Darsie had felt all a girl 's natural shrinking from death , but the sight of Aunt Maria 's peaceful face had dissipated that fear once for all .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 52]: As she knelt by the bedside looking at the still , majestic features , she offered the most fervent prayer of her life -- a prayer that she , too , might be enabled to `` submit her way , '' and so in the end find peace in her soul !
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 47]: Her acquaintance with the Percival family had ripened into friendship , so that , though Noreen and Ida could never by any chance supplant the Vernon sisters , there were moments when she actually felt more at home with Ralph than with queer , silent Dan .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 33]: Ralph , at twenty-one , had outgrown many of his boyish failings -- or rather , as Darsie shrewdly surmised , had attained the art of screening them from _ view _ .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 28]: Instead of snubbing his sisters ' friends and adopting airs of haughty superiority , he was now all deference and attention , transparently eager for her society .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 38]: Dan , on the contrary , was absorbed in work ; he had taken the Longs in summer , so that Darsie had no chance of meeting him before starting on her annual visits to Lady Hayes .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 5]: In the Easter vac .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 37]: he had visited France and Germany to study languages , while at Christmas-times he was at once too shy and too busy to take part in the daily excursions indulged in by his brothers and sisters .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 47]: He was doing brilliantly at College , and as a better preparation for his life 's work had decided on a four-years course -- taking the Tripos in two parts , in both of which it was a foregone conclusion that he would take a first-class .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 13]: Ralph Percival was contentedly slacking it in preparation for a pass degree .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 7]: `` What did it matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 4]: he demanded serenely .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 40]: One came to Cambridge , do n't you know , because all one 's people had been there , because it was the thing to do , and a rattling old place for sport and having a good time .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 10]: He would be confoundedly sorry when it was over .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 12]: Only wished he could slack it out for twice as long !
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 32]: Darsie first frowned , and then smiled to herself in the dark as she recalled those utterances , and the actions fitly symbolised her sentiments towards the heir of the Percivals .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 68]: Her head had no mercy for such an utter want of ambition and energy , but the heart plays often a bigger part than the head in an estimate of a fellow-creature , and Darsie 's heart had a way of making excuses for the handsome truant , who smiled with such beguiling eyes , had such a pretty knack of compliment , and was -- generally !
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 9]: -- ready to play knight-errant in her service .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 29]: She felt herself lucky in possessing so charming a friend to act the part of gallant , and to be at her service when she chose to call .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 28]: And then quite suddenly she drew a sharp breath and said aloud in a trembling voice , `` Oh , Aunt Maria , dear Aunt Maria ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 54]: and her pillow was wet with tears ; for Aunt Maria was dead , had died too soon to hear of her grand - niece 's experiences at Newnham , to which she had looked forward with such interest , but not before evoking a real love and gratitude in Darsie 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 52]: How thankful the girl was to remember that she had been able to cheer the last year of that lonely life , to recall every loving word and action , every tiny scrap of self-denial on her own part which had repaid in some small way the great gift to herself .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 35]: Thankful and grateful she would be to the end of her life , but she was not , and had not even pretended to be , _ sorry _ that Aunt Maria was dead .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 15]: `` She was old , and she was lonely , and she was ill .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 18]: I 'm _ glad _ , not sorry , '' she had declared to the scandalised Lavender .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 30]: `` I 'm glad she 'll never come hobbling downstairs again , and sit all the long , long day in one chair , waiting for it to end .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 38]: I 'm _ glad _ she 's forgotten all about her back , and her feet , and her head , and her joints , and all the thousand parts that ached , and could not rest .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 33]: I 'm _ glad _ she does n't need any more spectacles , and sticks , and false teeth , nor to have people shouting into her ear to make her hear .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 4]: I 'm thankful !
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 25]: If I 'd hated her I might have liked her to live on here , but I loved her , so I 'm glad .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 104]: She has gone somewhere else , where she is happy , and cheerful , and _ whole _ , and I hope her husband has met her , and that they are having a lovely , lovely time together ... '' Darsie was glad , too , in quite an open , unconcealed fashion , when a legacy of a few thousand pounds lifted a little of the strain from her father 's busy shoulders , made it possible to send Harry and Russell to a good boarding-school , continue Clemence 's beloved music lessons , and provide many needfuls for household use .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 70]: It was not only pleasant but absolutely thrilling to know that as long as she herself lived she would , in addition , possess fifty pounds a year -- practically a pound a week -- of her very , very own , so that even when she grew too old to teach , she could retire to a tiny cottage in the country , and live the simple life .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 21]: In the meantime , however , she was young , and life stretched ahead full of delicious possibilities and excitements .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 7]: Her great ambition had been achieved .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 68]: She was a student at Cambridge ; the historic colleges whose names had so long been familiar on her lips lay but a few streets away , while in her own college , close at hand , along the very same corridor , lay other girls with whom she must work , with whom she must play , whose lives must of a surety touch her own .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 4]: What would happen ?
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 5]: How would she fare ?
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 39]: When the last night of her three-years course arrived , and she lay as now in this narrow white bed , staring across the darkened room which had been her home , what would her dreams be then ?
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 11]: What pictures would arise in the gallery of her mind ?
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 10]: What faces smile at her out of the mist ?
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 23]: `` Oh , God , '' sighed Darsie in a soft , involuntary appeal , `` help me to be good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 3]: THE AUCTION .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 53]: The next day Darsie and Hannah were interviewed by their several coaches , male and female , received instructions as to their future work , and had the excitement of witnessing the return of the second and third year girls , whose manner was strikingly different from that of the modest Freshers .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 55]: Dinner that evening was more of an ordeal than ever , with a galaxy of such assured , not to say aggressive , young women , staring with all their eyes at their new companions , and , to judge from the expressions on their faces , forming the meanest opinion of their intelligence !
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 27]: Hannah Vernon was of all the Freshers the least upset by their scrutiny , but then plain Hannah was proverbially thick-skinned about the opinion of others .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 16]: `` Let 'em stare if it amuses 'em -- _ I _ do n't mind !
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 20]: Long time since I 've been so much admired , '' she returned composedly to Darsie 's indignant whisper .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 7]: `` Every dog has its day .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 9]: Wait till it 's _ our _ turn !
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 24]: I 'll wear specs for that day -- if I never do again , and glare over them like our friend in green .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 17]: I 've been taking notes , and her glare is worth all the rest put together .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 20]: I feel sure she sees into my pocket , and knows exactly how much there is in my purse .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 7]: Perhaps she 's jealous of you .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 12]: You 're the prettiest girl here -- old or new ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 6]: `` Oh , am I ?
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 5]: _ Nice _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 5]: cried Darsie , dimpling .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 43]: She peered around the tables , examining the faces of the girls within sight with an appraising eye , compared them with the reflection which looked back at her out of her own mirror , and felt an agreeable sense of conviction .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 49]: There was one slim , dark-eyed girl with a bright rose flush on her cheeks , as to whose claim she felt a moment 's uncertainty , but when she turned her head -- lo , a nose was revealed soaring so unbecomingly skyward that Darsie breathed again .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 5]: she was the prettiest .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 48]: Now if she could just manage to be the most popular also , and , not the cleverest , of course -- that was _ too _ much to expect -- but well in the front rank , how agreeable it would be , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 55]: The dining-hall looked much more cheery tonight , when the long table was surrounded by over sixty students in their brightly coloured dresses ; the buzz of conversation rose steadily throughout the meal , and by the time that coffee was served curiosity seemed satisfied , for the staring had come to an end .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 11]: `` I think you must be Dan Vernon 's sister .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 5]: May I introduce myself ?
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 6]: I am Helen Ross . ''
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 44]: A tall girl , with brown hair brushed low over her ears , stood beside Hannah 's chair , holding out her hand with an air of assurance which plainly intimated that the mention of her name was expected to arouse instant recognition .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 25]: Hannah , who had never heard it before , and was not skilled in the art of pretence , stared back in blank surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 3]: `` Oh-h !
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 2]: Really ?
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 7]: Yes , I 'm Hannah Vernon .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 8]: This is my friend Miss Garnett . ''
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 19]: Helen Ross nicked her eyelashes at Darsie by way of a bow , but bestowed no spoken greeting .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 13]: `` Rather beastly , the first day , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 9]: she drawled , turning to Hannah once more .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 20]: `` Feel such a pelican in the wilderness , wandering about , not knowing what to be after next .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 6]: Make me useful , do !
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 7]: I 'd like to be useful .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 10]: Told your brother I 'd show you the ropes .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 8]: Did you get your milk last night ?
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 8]: Half a pint each is your allowance .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 17]: You get it from the pantry directly after dinner , and take it upstairs for cocoa .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 8]: Have you discovered your gyp-room yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 14]: Hannah stolidly shook her head , whereupon Miss Ross proceeded to further explanations .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 42]: The gyp-room was a species of pantry , one of which was to be found on each corridor , whence cups , saucers , and other utensils for the preparation of the famous ten o'clock `` cocoas '' could be obtained .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 30]: You helped yourself , do n't you know , and you took the things back when you had done with them , but you did n't wash them up .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 24]: The gyp-room owned a presiding dignitary of its own who was known as the `` gyp-woman , '' who obligingly performed that service .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 37]: Then Miss Ross expressed a wish to see Hannah 's room , and the three girls ascended the stairs together , and the two Freshers stood by meekly while the two-year girl indulged in candid criticism .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 3]: `` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 4]: Not so bad .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 19]: Rather a barn at present , but it 'll look all right when you 've fixed it up .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 25]: Always takes a few days to settle down , but one lives in one 's room so much that it 's worth taking pains .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 15]: You can get no end into the coffin , that 's one blessing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 4]: `` Coffin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 17]: Hannah and Darsie jerked at the ominous word , whereupon Miss Ross smiled with complacent superiority .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 10]: of course , you do n't know that name .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 28]: The chest 's the ` coffin , ' and you keep hats in it , likewise odd boxes , and evening cloaks , and other perishable splendours .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 45]: Every one calls them coffins , so you 'll have to get used to it , I 'm afraid ; and the bureau 's a ` burry , ' and the screen 's a ` farce , ' and a topply one at that .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 11]: You 'll have to buy another to take its place .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 11]: They never _ do _ supply you with decent screens .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 11]: By the way , there 's an auction on to-night !
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 6]: Did any one tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 12]: That 's your chance of picking up the things you want .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 7]: It 's held in the Gym .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 10]: at ten o'clock , and is not bad fun .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 16]: I 'll come along and take you , if you 'd care to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 3]: `` Thanks .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 13]: Yes , I 'd like to see everything that 's going on .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 9]: What sort of things are for sale ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 29]: `` All sorts of discards that have been left behind by other girls -- screens , bed-covers , curtains , china flower-pots , chairs , kettles , pictures .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 9]: Sometimes there 's quite a fine show . ''
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 4]: `` Sounds attractive !
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 7]: And who is the auctioneer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 18]: `` A second-year girl -- the one who is credited with the greatest amount of wit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 27]: There was a moment 's silence while the two Freshers each mentally leaped a year ahead , and saw herself in this proud and enviable position .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 8]: `` Who 's the one to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 5]: `` Margaret France . ''
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 7]: Miss Ross 's lips curled expressively .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 12]: `` I hope you wo n't judge us by her standard .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 19]: She 's certainly not the one whom _ I _ should have chosen to fill the position ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 34]: Silence again , while the Freshers reflected that they knew very well whom Miss Helen Ross would have chosen if she had had the chance , and were glad that she had n't .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 10]: `` Well , I 'll call round about ten .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 9]: Make up your fire , and be comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 21]: You 're allowed a scuttle of coals a day , and let me warn you to _ use _ it !
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 24]: If it 's not all burnt , keep a few lumps in a convenient cache -- a box under the bed will do .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 31]: It comes in handy for another day , and when it gets really cold you can stoke up at night and have a fire to dress by in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 17]: The authorities do n't approve of that -- they say it 's bad for the stoves .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 9]: Personally I consider myself before any stoves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 25]: She nodded casually and strode from the room , leaving the two friends divided between gratitude for her kindness and prejudice against her personality .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 12]: `` Do n't like her a bit , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 3]: `` Humph .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 2]: So-so !
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 6]: Means well , I think .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 6]: Wonder how she knows Dan ?
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 7]: He never mentioned her name . ''
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 15]: `` Not at _ all _ the sort of girl Dan would care for !
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 5]: Such a bumptious manner .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 10]: A good many of them have , I observe .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 3]: Fearfully self-possessed .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 11]: Perhaps it 's a special effort to impress the Freshers .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 31]: She did n't take much notice of me , but I 'm coming with you all the same to buy fixings for my room , and hear the second-year auctioneer .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 12]: Call for me when you 're ready , like a dear .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 11]: I 'm off now to read until ten o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 68]: Darsie shut herself in her room , and set to work at her burry with all the ardour of a beginner , so that the hour and a half passed like a flash , and it seemed as if she had scarcely begun before Hannah 's solid bang sounded at the door , and she went out into the corridor to follow Helen Ross to the Gym .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 38]: The auction had already begun , and the auctioneer , a fresh-looking girl with grey eyes planted extraordinarily far apart , was engaged in extolling the excellencies of an aged kettle to a laughing circle of girls .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 22]: She wore a black dress cut square at the neck , and a rose - coloured ribbon twined round her head .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 27]: She held out the kettle at the length of a bare white arm , and raised her clear voice in delightful imitation of the professional wheedle .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 5]: `` Friends and Freshers !
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 18]: We now come to Lot Three , one of the most striking and interesting on the catalogue .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 18]: A kettle , ladies , is always a useful article , but this is no ordinary kettle .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 32]: We have it on unimpeachable authority that this kettle was the kettle in residence at the establishment of our late colleague Miss Constantia Lawson , the Senior Classic of her year !
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 9]: The kettle of a Senior Classic , Freshers !
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 26]: The kettle which has ministered to her refreshment , which has been , in the language of the poem , the fount of her inspiration !
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 16]: What price shall I say , ladies , for the kettle of a Senior Classic ?
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 2]: Sixpence !
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 5]: Did somebody say sixpence !
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 10]: _ For the kettle of a Senior Classic _ !
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 2]: Eightpence !
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 5]: Thank you , madam .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 11]: For the kettle of a -- What advance on eightpence ?
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 14]: Freshers would do well to consider this opportunity before it is too late .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 71]: What an -- an _ inebriating _ effect , if I may use the word without offence to the late lamented poet , would be added to the cup that cheers by the thought that the same handle , the same spout , the same -- er -- er -- furry deposit in the inside , have ministered to the refreshment of one of the master spirits of our day !
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 12]: Going at eightpence -- eightpence-halfpenny -- I thank you , madam !
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 3]: At tenpence !
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 5]: No advance on tenpence ?
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 9]: Going -- going -- _ gone _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 32]: The hammer descended with a rap , the auctioneer leaned back with an air of exhaustion , and handed the kettle to her clerk , in blue silk and crystal beads .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 6]: `` Lady to the right .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 43]: Tell the lady , Joshua , that the small hole in the bottom can easily be soldered by an obliging ironmonger , or , if she prefers , she can hang the kettle on the wall as an object of vertu ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 8]: Peals of laughter greeted this tragic disclosure .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 38]: The lady to the right refused for some minutes to hand over her tenpence , but finally succumbed to the feeling of the meeting , when a crumpled cotton bed - cover was next produced for sale .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 4]: `` Lot Four .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 17]: Handsome Oriental bedspread -- design of peacocks , vultures , and pear-trees , in gorgeous colourings .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 14]: Encircling border on a background of blizzard white , and corner pieces complete .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 5]: Eight feet by three .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 2]: Joshua !
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 14]: carry the bedspread round and allow the ladies to examine it for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 25]: It is excessively hurtful to our feelings when purchasers imply that deception has been practised in order to induce them to purchase our goods .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 6]: Show the ladies the spread !
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 5]: Pure cotton , ladies .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 3]: Fast colours .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 10]: Design by Alma Tadema , in his happiest mood .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 20]: You could not possibly purchase such a spread in any establishment , ladies , under the sum of two-and-six .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 16]: Fine Oriental goods , warranted to impart an air of opulence to the humblest bedstead .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 20]: Any Fresher wishing to give the last touch of costly elegance to her room should not neglect this opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 13]: What am I to say , ladies , for this handsome spread ?
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 3]: Sixpence again !
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 5]: Thank you , madam !
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 7]: Sixpences seem in the ascendant to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 15]: Let us hope the collections on Sunday next will benefit from the ensuing dearth .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 2]: Ninepence !
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 5]: _ At _ ninepence .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 4]: Pardon , madam ?
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 13]: The lady in the eyeglasses wishes to make a remark , Joshua .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 16]: The lady in the eyeglasses remarks that one side of the spread has been torn .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 19]: The lady is evidently unaware that that fact is a proof positive of the authenticity of the spread .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 20]: No Eastern article , as all travellers are aware , is _ ever _ even at both sides . ''
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 8]: Another burst of laughter greeted this point .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 33]: The auctioneer showed her pretty white teeth in a complacent smile , her wide grey eyes roved round the room , and met Darsie 's eyes raised to her in beaming admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 9]: `` One-and-six did you say , madam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 4]: she cried instantly .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 9]: `` Did I understand you to say one-and-six ?
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 7]: The opportunity will never occur again .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 8]: At one-and-six for the lady in violet .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 12]: Take the name and address if you please , Joshua . ''
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 34]: And Darsie , with a shrug and a laugh , paid out her one-and-six , and received in return the blizzard-white cover , ornamented with a roughly mended tear all along one side .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 24]: The next articles offered for sale were framed pictures of various sizes which had evidently not been considered worth the trouble of removing .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 23]: Water-colour sketches by ` prentice hands , faded photographs , or pretty - pretty prints evidently torn from the pages of magazines .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 25]: The auctioneer exerted all the blandishments to induce the Freshers to purchase these masterpieces , and deplored their scant response with pathetic reproaches . ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 10]: _ No _ bids for this tasty little picture ?
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 10]: Ladies , ladies , this is a great mistake !
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 25]: In the midst of your arduous brain toil , what could be more soothing and refreshing than to gaze upon this charming pastoral scene ?
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 56]: This azure earth , this verdant sky , this lovely maid who combined in her person all the simpering charms of youth , and never , for one misguided moment , troubled her ochre head over the acquirement of that higher knowledge which , as we all know , is the proud prerogative of man !
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 13]: What price shall I say for ` The Maiden 's Dream ' ?
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 5]: _ No _ bids !
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 9]: Put it down if you please , Joshua .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 11]: We have no art collectors with us to - night .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 10]: Let me have the Botticelli for a change . ''
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 31]: The clerk in blue silk handed up another picture in a rickety Oxford frame , at which the auctioneer gazed rapturously for several moments before turning it towards her audience .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 7]: `` Number Six on the catalogue .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 13]: Genuine photograph of a Botticelli from the collection of Miss Eva Dalgleish .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 8]: Attention , Freshers , if you please !
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 8]: This is an item of serious importance .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 24]: The presence of a Botticelli bestows at once the air of culture and refinement without which no study is worthy of the name .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 37]: A genuine photograph of a Botticelli , purchased by the owner in the Italian city of Florence , and borne home by her own fair hands , as the crack across the corner will give proof .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 24]: In an Oxford frame -- a compliment to our sister University -- glazed and complete , with hanging loops and fragment of wire .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 8]: _ What _ offers for the Botticelli ?
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 16]: Any Fresher who wishes to prove herself endowed with refined and artistic -- One shilling ?
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 5]: Thank you , madam .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 5]: _ And _ sixpence !
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 4]: One and nine .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 8]: One and nine for this genuine Botticelli .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 12]: Ladies , ladies , this is a sad day for Newnham .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 6]: And nine -- and nine .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 2]: Going .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 7]: Going -- _ gone _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 16]: It was Hannah who had testified to her own artistic qualities by purchasing this photograph .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 26]: She tucked it proudly under her arm , and turned an envious eye on a brass flower-pot which was now engaging the auctioneer 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 27]: A simultaneous movement of the audience showed that this was an article on which many hopes had been set , and bidding promised to be brisk .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 38]: `` Now , ladies , we come to one of the principal events of the evening , the bidding for this very rich and magnificent brass , hand-beaten , richly - chased , Oriental , ornamental flower-pot .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 28]: We have several flower-pots in our catalogue , but none to be compared for one moment to the very superior article which you now see before you .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 30]: It is safe to say that no student , even in her third year , can boast of a flower-pot to equal this lot in either quality or design .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 14]: The possession of it will in itself ensure fame for its fortunate owner .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 19]: Let me have a handsome bid , if you please , ladies , to start this valuable article .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 25]: Half a crown !!! A lady , whose ignorance we can only deplore , offers me half a crown for a genuine antique brass !
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 21]: I am thankful that in such a large and enlightened audience such an error is not likely to be repeated .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 3]: Three shillings .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 7]: _ Thank _ you , madam .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 3]: And six .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 6]: Four shillings -- four shillings .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 26]: Freshers who neglect to take advantage of this opportunity will be compelled to content themselves with one of these common china articles to my left .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 15]: A flowerpot is a necessary article of furniture without which no room is complete .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 7]: What is home without an aspidistra ?
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 15]: You laugh , ladies , but you can find no answer to that question .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 3]: And six !
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 3]: Five shillings !
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 14]: The raw material for this masterpiece must have cost many times this sum .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 9]: Five -- five -- no advance on five .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 7]: The lady in green , Joshua .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 7]: Take the lady 's address ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 17]: The auctioneer put up her hand to her head and patted the rose-coloured ribbon into place .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 46]: Inspired by the laughing appreciation of her sallies , her cheeks had flushed to the same bright shade , and with her sparkling eyes and alert , graceful movements she made a delightful and attractive figure , at which the Freshers stared in undisguised delight .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 6]: `` I adore her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 8]: whispered Darsie in her friend 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 5]: `` Decent sort ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 26]: croaked Hannah the undemonstrative , and then by a common impulse their glance passed on to rest on Helen Ross 's set , supercilious face .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 11]: `` I loathe her , '' came the second whisper .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 7]: `` Mean thing -- jealousy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 15]: croaked Hannah once more , and turned her attention to the business in hand .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 37]: After the china flower-pots had been disposed of , a trio of basket - chairs gave an impetus to the bidding , as the truth of the auctioneer 's words went home to every heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 15]: ` Three luxurious basket-chairs , cushioned complete in handsome cretonne , stuffed pure wool .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 6]: Condition -- as new . '
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 31]: Ladies , in these basket-chairs you see not only elegant articles of furniture , but a solution of the dilemma which dogs every owner of a one-comfortable - chair study .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 28]: One question haunts her waking and sleeping hours ; one problem embitters the most social occasions -- ` _ Shall I be comfortable or polite _ ? '
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 35]: To this question , in this college of Newnham , there can , ladies , be but one reply -- and the wretched hostess sits on the coal-box and gives her visitor the chair .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 76]: After long hours of mental toil , after the physical strain of the hockey-field , a quiet hour is vouchsafed beside her own fireside , with the companionship of a beloved friend to soothe and cheer , and that hour , ladies -- that precious hour -- I say it with emotion almost too strong for words -- that stolen hour of peace and rest must needs be passed -- _ on the coal-box _ !
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 8]: Ladies , I need say no more .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 9]: The remedy is in your own hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 7]: So on , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 17]: After the chairs came curtains ; after the curtains , bookcases , ornaments , and books .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 31]: The auction flowed on , punctuated by explosions of laughter , until the last item on the `` catalogue '' was reached , and the auctioneer was crimson with exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 13]: Darsie and Hannah had amassed between them quite a stock of furnishings .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 28]: A screen apiece , chairs , Oriental window-curtains in stripes of contrasting colours warm and comfortable to look upon , flower-pots , and odd pictures and ornaments .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 24]: One felt a proprietor , indeed , as one looked over the spoils , and the inroads into capital had been agreeably small .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 37]: Darsie was folding up her damaged `` spread '' when a voice spoke in her ear , and with a little jump of the heart she looked up to find Margaret France standing by her side .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 6]: `` How do you do ?
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 8]: I must thank you for your patronage .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 5]: You chipped in nobly .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 12]: Hope you 'll like 'em , when you 've got 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 7]: Just up , are n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 6]: What 's your shop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 19]: For a moment Darsie stared blankly , then a flash of intuition revealed the meaning of the word .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 5]: `` Modern languages . ''
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 3]: `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 8]: So 'm I. And your friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 4]: `` Mathematics . ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 3]: `` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 5]: Well , good luck !
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 6]: I 'm off to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 8]: We shall meet on the Rialto ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 9]: She smiled , nodded , and was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 16]: With a sudden realisation of their own fatigue the Freshers turned to follow her example .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 25]: Helen Ross joined them on their way along the corridors , and Darsie could not resist expressing her appreciation of the auctioneer 's wit .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 5]: `` She was delicious .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 7]: I _ have _ enjoyed it .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 9]: She _ is _ amusing and clever . ''
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 5]: `` Think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 4]: said Helen coolly .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 3]: `` Really ?
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 5]: Glad you were pleased .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 11]: It 's usually _ far _ better than that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 22]: With a curt good-night she turned into her own room , and the two friends made haste to follow her example .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 46]: The banked-up fires burned warm and red ; the scattered oddments had been hidden from sight in the `` coffin 's '' rapacious maw ; photographs and knick-knacks gave a homy look to the rooms which had looked so bare and bleak twenty-four hours before .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 10]: The Freshers tumbled into bed and fell happily asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 3]: FIRST EXPERIENCES .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 20]: During the first month at Newnham Darsie and Hannah fell gradually and happily into the routine of college life .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 114]: They grew to recognise their companions by name , and to place them according to their several `` shops '' ; they entertained cocoa parties in their rooms ; picked up slang terms , and talked condescendingly of `` townees '' ; they paid up subscriptions to `` Hall , '' `` Games , '' `` Flowers , '' and `` Fic '' ; slept , played , and laughed and talked , and , above all , _ worked _ , with heart and mind , and with every day that passed were more convinced that to be a student at Cambridge was the most glorious fate that any girl could desire .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 41]: A week after the beginning of term Helen Ross , the fortunate possessor of a double room , gave a tea-party , with one of the younger Dons as chaperon , to which Dan Vernon and a companion were invited .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 58]: Ostensibly the party was given in Hannah 's honour , but to her astonishment and dismay Hannah 's friend was not favoured with an invitation , and felt her first real twinge of loneliness in the knowledge that two old friends were making merry together but a few yards away , while she sat solitary and alone .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 48]: What she had done to incur Helen Ross 's dislike Darsie could not imagine , and , fortunately for herself , she was too large-hearted to suspect that it arose simply from an unattractive girl 's jealousy of one whom all had combined to love and admire .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 25]: Be that as it may , Darsie was left out of the tea-party , and her subsequent cross-questionings of Hannah were far from comforting .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 7]: `` Had a good time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 5]: `` Top hole . ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 6]: `` Nice people there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 4]: `` Topping . ''
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 5]: `` Good cakes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 4]: `` Scrum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 7]: `` Dan ask for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 9]: `` Then he ought to have done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 35]: Darsie told herself indignantly , and her thoughts flew off to Ralph Percival , wondering when she would see him next , and recalling with pleasure his promise to `` see her through . ''
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 48]: The approach of the Freshers ' hockey match banished less important topics , for Hannah was on edge with anxiety to be at her best , and disport herself sufficiently well to be included in after-team practices , while Darsie was scarcely less eager on her behalf .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 51]: When the afternoon arrived and the match began , the second and third year girls crowded to look on , while the Captain stood apart surrounded by a few satellites from the Committee , as truly the monarch of all she surveyed as any king who ever graced a throne .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 35]: The thoughts of each Fresher turned with an anguish of appeal towards this figure ; a smile on her face raised them to the seventh heaven ; a frown laid them in the dust !
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 17]: Extraordinary to think that two short years ago this oracle had been a Fresher like themselves !
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 18]: Inconceivable to imagine that in two years to come they themselves might occupy that same magnificent altitude !
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 41]: The eyes of the Oracle fell upon Hannah and approved what she saw , and henceforth Hannah took part in team practices , and lorded it over Darsie , who in her turn affected a growing antagonism to the game .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 31]: `` You can have too much of a good thing -- even of games -- and I seem to have _ eaten _ hockey every meal since I arrived ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 37]: she announced impatiently ; and in truth , since an unwritten law forbade the discussion of `` shop '' at table , the conversation was largely limited to dissertations on this the most popular of games .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 52]: On Sundays the two girls went together to King 's College Chapel and gazed with admiration at the vaulted stone roof , with its marvellous fan tracery ; at its towering stained-glass windows , and the screen bearing the monogram of Anne Boleyn ; at the delicate carving of the stalls .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 65]: It was so wonderfully different from the dreary town edifice in which they had been accustomed to worship , with its painted walls , heavy gallery , and wheezy organ played by an indifferent musician -- so wonderfully , gloriously different that Darsie felt a pricking at the back of her eyes as though she were ready to cry for sheer pleasure and admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 19]: The music and the sermon seemed alike perfect , and Darsie ardently followed each stage of the service .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 45]: Some people are inclined to grow frivolous and forgetful when the world goes well with them and the desire of their hearts is accomplished ; others are filled with a passion of gratitude and thanksgiving , and Darsie Garnett belonged to the latter category .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 18]: Prosperity made her more humble , more kindly , more overflowing with love to God and man .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 28]: A portrait of Lady Hayes stood on her study mantelpiece , and every morning and evening she bent her sunny head to kiss the stern old face .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 5]: Dear old Aunt Maria !
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 18]: she had so loved being kissed -- _ really _ kissed , as if one meant it .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 34]: If in that higher life to which she had gone she knew what was happening on earth , Darsie felt sure that she would like to know that her portrait was still cherished .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 31]: Her thoughts hovered gratefully about the dead woman as she sat in this wonderful old church , and pictured with awe the succeeding generations who had worshipped within its walls .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 47]: It was only when the sermon was at an end that , turning her head , Darsie met the gaze of a girl sitting a few seats away , and after a moment of bewilderment recognised the widely set eyes and curling lips of Margaret France .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 33]: In her dark hat and coat she looked less attractive than in evening dress , but the fact made no difference in the thrill of pleasure with which Darsie realised her presence .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 51]: Some quality in this girl appealed to the deep places of her heart ; she realised instinctively that if the attraction were mutual the tie between them would be close and firm , but it must be all or nothing -- she could never dally with friendship with Margaret France !
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 67]: Walking home slowly along Silver Street , she found herself answering absently to Hannah 's remarks , her whole attention riveted on watching the passers-by , wondering if by any possibility Margaret France would stop to speak to her once more , and her heart leaped with exultation as a footstep paused by her side , and the clear , crisp tones addressed her by name .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 6]: `` Morning , Miss Garnett !
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 5]: Morning , Miss Vernon !
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 7]: Ripping day , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 8]: Glad to see you in King 's .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 13]: Saw you long before you spotted me , and enjoyed your enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 6]: Never forgot my first services .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 10]: Good to be there , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 4]: `` Oh-h ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 11]: Darsie 's deep-drawn breath of rapture was an eloquent response .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 8]: `` I _ have _ been happy !
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 12]: I 've never in my life seen anything so wonderful before .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 20]: It seems almost too good to be true that I can go there every Sunday for years to come .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 4]: Cambridge is wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 7]: I am more enchanted every day .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 11]: Even to walk along the streets is a joy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 4]: cried Margaret heartily .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 21]: `` Drop in to five o'clock service sometimes when you 're feeling tired , and tied up with your work .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 6]: It 's a grand soother .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 7]: How goes the work so far ?
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 4]: Enjoying the lectures ?
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 6]: Finding the literature interesting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 19]: The two Modern Languages discussed work together eagerly , while mathematical Hannah marched on a few feet ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 36]: Darsie felt a pang of remorse , because she could not help wishing that she would _ stay _ ahead , and so give the chance of a prolonged _ tete-a-tete _ with Margaret France .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 52]: The feeling of attraction was so strong now that they were face to face that it was only by an effort of will that she could resist slipping her hand through the black serge arm , but the expression of her face was eloquent , and Margaret smiled back well pleased .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 53]: When they parted a few minutes later to go to their different halls , the older girl said casually , but in a lowered voice which showed that the invitation was meant for Darsie alone -- `` By the way , I 'm at home for cocoa on Tuesday evenings at ten .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 11]: Bring your milk , and come along , will you !
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 8]: I 'd like to have you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 4]: `` Rather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 44]: cried Darsie eloquently , and ran up to her room aglow with delight and pride , which grew still deeper at lunch when a casual reference to the invitation -LRB- it was really impossible to keep silent on so thrilling a point ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 7]: evoked a wide stare of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 5]: `` To her Tuesdays !
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 4]: Are you sure ?
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 10]: Nobody goes to those but her very boon companions .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 7]: You _ are _ honoured ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 12]: `` Did n't ask _ me _ , I notice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 4]: sniffed Hannah huffily .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 6]: `` No twin soul here .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 10]: Recognised an affinity in you , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 15]: `` Well , _ I _ was n't asked to play in team matches !
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 9]: Do n't grudge me my little score ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 19]: returned Darsie , knowing well that an honour in sport was more to her companion than many cocoas .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 12]: `` Besides , you must remember you have Helen Ross ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 7]: `` Oh , ah , yes !
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 6]: Helen Ross dotes on me .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 5]: Disinterested , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 10]: No connection with the brother over the way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 6]: commented Hannah with a grin .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 32]: `` By the way , I hear from Dan that your friend Ralph Percival is in trouble already , playing cards , getting into debt , and staying out after hours .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 13]: Seems to be a poor-spirited sort of fellow from all accounts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 25]: `` He saved my life , anyway , when I was a youngster , and very nearly drowned myself , paddling up a mill-stream .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 9]: There 's no want of spirit about Ralph .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 15]: Life has been made too easy for him , that 's the mischief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 10]: said Darsie in her most elderly and judicial manner .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 20]: `` It 's difficult to keep to the grind when you know that you will never need to work .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 7]: He needs an object in life .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 13]: Until he finds that , he will be content to drift . ''
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 12]: `` He 'll drift into being sent down at this rate .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 9]: That will be the end of him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 20]: croaked Hannah gloomily ; whereupon Darsie knitted her brows and collapsed into silence for the rest of the meal .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 7]: Poor , dear , handsome Ralph !
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 16]: At the bottom of her heart Darsie was hardly surprised to hear Hannah 's report .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 57]: The indifference with which he had entered upon his college life had not developed into any more earnest spirit , as had been abundantly proved by his conversation when the two had last met , during the long vacation , while the hesitating manner of his mother and sisters seemed to hint at a hidden anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 46]: In the depths of her heart Darsie was feeling considerably piqued by the fact that though she had now been over a month in Cambridge Ralph had shown no anxiety to meet her , or to fulfil his promise of `` showing the ropes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 65]: Other girls had been invited to merry tea-parties in the different colleges , and almost daily she had expected such an invitation for herself , but neither of her two men friends had paid her this mark of attention ; but for the fact of an occasional meeting in the streets they might as well have been at the other end of the land .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 29]: Pride forbade her commenting on the fact even to Hannah ; but inwardly she had determined to be very proud and haughty when the deferred meeting came about .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 22]: Dan was too wrapped up in himself to care for outsiders ; Ralph was a slacker -- not worth a thought .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 8]: Darsie dismissed them both with a shrug .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 10]: Margaret France was worth a dozen men put together !
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 38]: Ten o'clock on Tuesday evening seemed long in coming , but the moment that the clock pointed to the hour Darsie hastened to her new friend 's study , and to her satisfaction found her still alone .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 40]: The room looked delightfully cosy with pink shades over the lights , a clear blaze upon the grate , and Margaret herself , in a pink rest-gown curled up in a wicker-chair , was the very embodiment of ease .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 28]: She did not rise as Darsie entered , but pointed to a chair close at hand , with an eagerness which was in itself the best welcome .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 5]: `` That 's right .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 3]: Come along !
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 8]: I 'm glad you 're the first .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 6]: Sit down and look around .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 8]: How do you like my den ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 24]: Darsie stared to right and left with curious eyes , and came to the instant conclusion that Margaret 's room was like herself .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 25]: From floor to ceiling , from window to door , there was not one single article which did not give back a cheering impression .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 75]: If the article were composed of metal , it shone and glittered until it could shine no farther ; if of oak , every leaf and moulding spoke of elbow-grease , and clean , fresh - smelling polish ; if it were a fabric of wool or cotton , it was invariably of some shade of rose , shedding , as it were , an aspect of summer in the midst of November gloom .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 21]: Over the fireplace was fastened a long brown-paper scroll , on which some words were painted in big ornamental letters .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 27]: Darsie read them with a thrill of appreciation -- `` Two men looked out through prison bars , One saw mud , the other stars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 11]: The eyes of the two girls met , and lingered .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 12]: Then Darsie spoke -- `` That 's your motto in life !
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 10]: You look out for stars -- '' `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 4]: So do you .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 10]: That 's why I wanted to be friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 5]: `` I wonder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 12]: mused Darsie , and sat silent , gazing into the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 23]: `` It is beautiful , and I understand the drift , but -- would you mind paraphrasing it for my benefit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 6]: `` It 's so simple .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 13]: There _ is _ mud , and there _ are _ stars .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 13]: It 's just a choice of where we choose to look . ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 6]: `` Yes -- I see .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 51]: But do n't you think there are times -- when one is awfully down on one 's luck , for instance -- when there 's no one on earth so trying as the persistent optimist who _ will _ make the best of everything , and take a cheerful view !
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 9]: You want to murder him in cold blood .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 6]: I do , at least .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 31]: You feel ever so much more cheered by some one who acknowledges the mud , and says how horrid it is , and pities you for sticking so fast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 11]: Margaret 's ringing laugh showed all her pretty white teeth .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 9]: She rubbed her hands together in delighted appreciation .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 9]: `` Oh , I know , I know !
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 8]: I want to kill them , too .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 10]: Vision 's not a mite of use without tact .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 17]: But no bars can shut out the stars if we choose to let them shine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 30]: Her own face was ashine as she spoke , but anything more unlike `` goodiness , '' abhorred by every normal girl , it would be impossible to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 17]: `` Tell me about your work -- how do you get on with your coach ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 64]: she asked the next moment , switching off to ordinary subjects in the most easy and natural of manners , and Darsie found herself laying bare all the little hitches and difficulties which must needs enter into even the most congenial course of study , and being alternately laughed at and consoled , and directed towards a solution by brisk , apt words .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 12]: `` You 're all right -- you 've got a head .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 16]: You 'll come through on top , if you 'll be content to go slow .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 18]: Want to take the Tripos first year , and honours at that -- that 's your style !
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 12]: Calm down , my dear , and be content to jog .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 8]: It pays better in the end . ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 42]: She flashed a radiant smile at Darsie 's reddening face , then jumped up to greet her other guests of the evening , three in number , who appeared at that moment , each carrying her own precious portion of milk .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 80]: One was `` Economics '' and owned so square a jaw that the line of it -LRB- there was no curve -RRB- seemed to run down straight with the ear ; another was `` Science '' and wore spectacles ; a third was `` Modern Languages , '' like the host , but one and all shared an apparently unlimited appetite for Cocoa , Conversation , and Chelsea buns , the which they proceeded to enjoy to the full .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 34]: `` Modern Languages '' being in the ascendant , indulged in a little `` shop '' as a preliminary , accompanied by the sighs , groans , and complaints incidental to the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 8]: `` How 's your drama getting on ?
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 6]: Is it developing satisfactorily ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 30]: Student Number Two inquired of Darsie , in reference to the paper given out at the last lecture in Divinity Hall , and Darsie shrugged with a plaintive air .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 27]: `` I 've been struggling to develop it , to _ trace _ its development , as he said ; but the tracings are decidedly dim !
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 17]: I get on much better with a subject on which I can throw a little imagination .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 21]: ` The growth of the novel , ' for instance -- I wove quite a fairy-tale out of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 10]: The girls smiled , but with a dubious air .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 5]: `` Better be careful !
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 32]: That 's a ruse which most of us have tried in our day , and come wearily back to sober fact ... How do you like the Historical French Grammar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 22]: The Fresher made a gesture as if to tear her hair , whereupon the second - year girls groaned in chorus .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 3]: `` Hopeless !
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 2]: Piteous !
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 11]: In last year 's Tripos the paper was positively inhuman .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 19]: The girls said it was impossible even to understand the questions , much less to answer them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 3]: `` Wicked !
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 8]: Waste of time , I call it .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 30]: Most of us are training to teach , but it 's not one in a hundred who will be called upon to teach _ that _ erudite horror . ''
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 28]: Darsie looked at Margaret France as she spoke , and saw at once by the expression of her companions that she had touched on a delicate subject .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 23]: There was a moment 's silence , then -- `` I am not going to teach , '' said Margaret , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 3]: `` Really !
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 10]: Then -- What are you going to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 6]: `` Live at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 29]: A future profession seemed so universal a prospect with the Newnham students that Margaret 's reply amazed Darsie as much as it appeared to annoy her other hearers .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 25]: Economics sniffed , and muttered beneath her breath ; Science stared fixedly at the ceiling through her glittering spectacles ; Modern Languages groaned aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 5]: `` With your brain !
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 4]: With your spirit !
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 4]: After this training !
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 9]: Such wicked waste ... '' Margaret laughed lightly .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 29]: `` Oh , Darsie Garnett , how mean of you , when I feed you with my best Chelsea buns , to land me in this time-honoured discussion !
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 26]: I 'm an only child , and my parents have been perfect bricks in giving me my wish and sparing me for three whole years !
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 16]: The least I can do is to go home and do a turn for them .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 11]: I fail to see where the waste comes in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 21]: `` All you have learned -- all you have studied -- all you have read -- '' `` Just so !
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 13]: I hope it will make me a more interesting companion for them .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 4]: And for myself !
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 28]: I 've got to live with myself all the days of my life , remember , and I do _ not _ wish to be bored ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 9]: `` You have such power , such capacity !
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 10]: You might do some work for the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 5]: `` I intend to .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 18]: What 's the world made up of , after all , but a number of separate homes ?
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 29]: As a matter of ordinary common sense is n't it best to work in one 's _ own _ home , rather than in a strange one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 26]: Margaret threw out her hands with a pretty appealing gesture , and her companions stared at her in silence , apparently too nonplussed to reply .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 18]: Before they had time to rally to the attack , however , a startling interruption had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 33]: With a suddenness and violence which made the cocoa-drinkers jump in their seats the door burst open , and the figure of a girl in evening dress precipitated herself into their midst .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 91]: Her light skirt was thrown over her shoulders , revealing an abbreviated white petticoat ; her eyes were fixed with a deadly determination ; regardless of the occupants of the room or of the articles of furniture scattered here and there , she flew at lightning speed to the window , closed it with a resounding bang , leaped like a cat at the ventilator overhead , banged that also , and with one bound was out of the room , the door making a third bang in her wake .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 5]: Darsie gasped in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 19]: She herself had been transfixed with astonishment , but her companions had displayed a marvellous self - possession .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 56]: Margaret had wrapped her arms round the cocoa-table to protect it from upset , another girl had steadied the screen , a third had obligingly lifted her chair out of the way ; but no sign of alarm or curiosity showed upon their faces , which fact did but heighten the mystery of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 11]: `` Is she -- is she _ mad _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 7]: The second-year girls laughed in chorus .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 29]: From afar could be heard a succession of bang , bang , bangs , as if in every study in the house the same performance was being enacted .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 9]: Margaret nodded at the Fresher with kindly reassurance .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 6]: `` Only the fire drill !
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 15]: They 've had an alarm , and she 's told to shut off draughts .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 4]: Very good going !
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 11]: Not more than five or six seconds all told ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 14]: `` There is n't really -- '' `` Oh , dear , no .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 4]: No such luck !
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 15]: Poor fun having a fire brigade , and no chance to show its mettle .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 6]: But we live in hope .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 5]: You ought to join .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 10]: I can imagine you making a magnificent captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 6]: So here was another ambition .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 26]: Darsie made a mental note to inquire into the workings of the fire brigade , and to offer her name as a recruit without delay .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 4]: THE FANCY BALL .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 43]: It was somewhat of a shock to the Fresher contingency to receive one morning the intimation of a Costume Ball , to be held in Clough Hall on the following night ; but their protests met with scant sympathy from the elders .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 60]: When Darsie plaintively declared that she had n't got a fancy dress , and would not have time to send home for it if she _ had _ , a third-year girl silenced her by a stern counter-question : `` And where , pray , would be the fun if you _ had _ , and _ could _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 39]: If at the cost of a postcard you could be fitted up as the Lady of the Lake in green draperies and water-lilies , it would no doubt be exceedingly becoming , but it would be no sport .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 44]: No , young woman , you 've got to contrive something out of nothing and an hour stolen from the night , and when you 've done it you 'll be in the mood to appreciate other people 's contrivings into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 3]: Buck up !
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 8]: You 're one of the dressy sort .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 8]: We 'll expect wonders from you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 35]: But when Darsie repaired to the seclusion of her study and set herself to the problem of evolving a fancy dress out of an ordinary college outfit , ideas were remarkably slow in coming .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 55]: She looked questioningly at each piece of drapery in turns , wondered if she could be a ghost in curtains , a statue in sheets , an eastern houri in the cotton quilt , a Portia in the hearthrug , discarded each possibility in turn , and turned her attention to her own wardrobe .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 30]: Black serge , grey tweed , violet ninon ; two evening frocks , and the one white satin which was the _ piece de resistance _ of the whole .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 31]: A cloth coat , a mackintosh , an art serge cloak for evening wear -- how _ could _ one manufacture a fancy dress from garments so ordinary as these ?
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 32]: In despair , Darsie betook herself to Margaret France 's room and found that young woman seated before her dressing-table engaged in staring fixedly at her own reflection in the mirror .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 51]: She betrayed no embarrassment at being discovered in so compromising a position , but smiled a broad smile of welcome out of the mirror , the while she continued to turn and to twist , and hold up a hand-glass to scrutinise more closely unknown aspects of face and head .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 9]: `` I know what you 've come for !
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 7]: I 've had two Freshers already .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 18]: Bowled over at the thought of inventing a costume -- that 's it , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 9]: Oh , you 'll rise to it yet .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 18]: The only difficulty is to hit on an idea -- the rest 's as easy as pie .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 17]: That 's what I 'm doing now -- studying my phiz to see what it suggests .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 5]: My nose , now !
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 7]: What d'you think of my nose ?
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 12]: Seems to me that nose was n't given me for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 9]: _ And _ the width between the eyes !
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 19]: It 's borne in upon me that I must be either a turnip lantern or a Dutch doll .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 16]: The doll would probably be the most becoming , so I 'll plump for that .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 16]: Do n't breathe a word , for it must be a secret to the last .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 17]: As for you -- it would be easy to suggest a dozen pretty - pretties . ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 20]: Margaret wheeled round in her chair , and sat nursing her knees , regarding Darsie with a twinkling eye .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 40]: `` Big eyes , long neck , neat little feet -- you 'd make an adorable Alice in Wonderland , with ankle - strap slippers , and a comb , and a dear little pinny over a blue frock !
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 9]: And your friend can be the Mad Hatter .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 14]: Look well , would n't she , with a hat on one side ?
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 24]: There are only the girls to see you , and the more comic you can make yourself the better they 'll be pleased .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 29]: You are about to be introduced to a new side of Newnham life , and will see how mad the students can be when they let themselves go .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 11]: You 'll laugh yourself ill before the evening 's over .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 17]: Well , think it over , and come back to me if you want any properties .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 59]: My dress will be easy enough -- braided hair , short white frock -LRB- butter-muslin at a penny the yard -RRB- , white stockings with sandals , another pair of stockings to cover my arms , chalked face and neck , with peaked eyebrows and neat little spots of red on the cheekbones and tip of the chin .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 27]: If you feel inclined to be angelic , you might run up with your paint-box at the last minute , and dab on my joints . ''
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 4]: `` Joints ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 24]: Darsie gaped in bewilderment , whereupon Margaret cried resentfully -- `` Well , I must _ have _ joints , must n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 8]: How do you expect me to move ?
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 17]: A paint-box is invaluable on these occasions , as you 'll find before you are through .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 17]: Now , my love , I 'll bid you a fond adieu , for work presses .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 10]: By the by , one word in your ear !
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 17]: Do n't ask a third-year girl to dance with you if you value your nose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 11]: `` What will happen to it if I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 4]: `` Snapped off !
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 17]: Never mind I look pretty and meek , and perhaps she 'll ask _ you _ .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 13]: Now be off -- be off -- I must to work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 23]: Darsie descended to Hannah 's study and proposed the idea of the Mad Hatter , the which was instantly and scornfully declined .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 51]: Hannah explained at length that though her head might be plain , it yet contained more brains than other heads she could mention , and that to play the part of idiot for a whole night long was a feat beyond the powers of a mathematical student reading for honours .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 51]: She then explained with a dignity which seemed somewhat misplaced that she had set her heart upon representing a pillar-box , and was even now on the point of sallying forth to purchase a trio of hat-boxes , which , being of fashionable dimensions , would comfortably encircle her body .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 29]: Fastened together so as to form a tube , covered with red sateen , and supported by scarlet-stockinged legs , the effect would be pleasingly true to life .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 16]: `` I 'll have peep-holes for eyes , and the slit will outline my mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 43]: Between the dances I 'll kneel down in a corner so that the box touches the ground , and I 'll look so real , that I shall expect every one to drop in _ letters -- chocolate _ letters , observe !
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 10]: You might buy some and set the example ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 41]: For the next twenty-four hours an unusual air of excitement and bustle pervaded the college , and the conversation at mealtime consisted for the most part of fragmentary questions and answers bearing on the important subject of costumes in making .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 12]: `` Lend me your boot brushes , like a lamb ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 15]: `` Got an old pair of brown stockings you ca n't wear again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 16]: `` Be an angel and lend me your striped curtains just for the night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 14]: `` Spare _ just _ ten minutes to sew up my back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 69]: So on it went , and in truth it was a pleasant chance to hear the merry , inconsequent chatter ; for , like every other class of the community , girl students have their besetting sins , and one of the most obvious of these is an air of assurance , of dogmatism , of final knowledge of life , against which there can be no appeal .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 79]: Girls of nineteen and twenty will settle a dispute of ages with a casual word ; students of economy will advance original schemes warranted to wipe the offence of poverty from the globe ; science students with unlowered voices will indulge across the dinner-table in scathing criticisms on historic creeds which their fathers hold in reverence ; and on each young face , on each young tongue , can be read the same story of certainty and self-esteem .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 50]: This state of mind is either sad , amusing , or exasperating , according to the mood of the hearer ; but , whatever be his mood , he yet knows in his heart that it is a transitory phase , and an almost inevitable result of theoretical knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 29]: A few years of personal grip with life and its problems will make short work of that over-confidence , and replace it with a gentler , sweeter touch .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 31]: But to-night was a night of frolic , and one would have to travel far indeed to find a more amusing spectacle than an impromptu costume dance in Clough Hall .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 25]: Beauty is a secondary consideration , and the girl who has achieved the oddest and most ludicrous appearance is the heroine of the hour .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 99]: Darsie Garnett made a fascinating Alice in Wonderland in her short blue frock , white pinny , and little ankle-strap slippers , her hair fastened back by an old-fashioned round comb , and eyebrows painted into an inquiring arch , but she received no attention in comparison with that lavished upon Hannah , when she dashed nimbly in at the door , and , kneeling down in a corner of the room , presented a really lifelike appearance of a pillar-box , a white label bearing the hours of `` Chocolate deliveries '' pasted conspicuously beneath the slit .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 48]: Hannah 's prophecies proved correct , for it became one of the amusements of the evening to feed that yawning cavity with chocolates and other dainties , so that more than one sweet tooth in the assembly made a note of the suggestion for a future day .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 73]: The Dutch Doll was another huge success ; for so dolly and so beyond all things Dutch did she appear , standing within the doorway with jointed arms and rigid back , with dark hair plastered over the forehead in the well-known curve , and the three little spots of colour blazing out from the whitened background , that it was almost impossible to believe that she was living flesh and blood .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 36]: Like a statue she stood until the laughter and applause had lasted for several minutes , and then , stepping jerkily on one side , made way for a new and even more startling apparition .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 10]: Topsy , by all that was wonderful and unexpected !
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 24]: A beaming , grinning little nigger girl , with tightly curled hair , rolling eyes , and white teeth showing to the gums .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 54]: A short gown of brilliantly striped cotton reached to the knees , brown-stockinged arms and legs were matched by brown-painted face and neck ; standing side by side with the Dutch Doll , the respective whiteness and brownness became accentuated to a positively dazzling extent , and the onlookers were jubilant with delight .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 37]: The climax was reached when the two waltzed off together round the room , the doll sustaining a delightful stiffness and stoniness of mien , while Topsy 's grin threatened to reach to her very ears .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 31]: Ordinary costumes fell somewhat flat after these triumphs , though to the Freshers there was a continuing joy in beholding dignified students in their third year pirouetting in childlike abandonment .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 92]: There , for instance , was the cleverest girl in college , of whom it was accepted as a certainty that she would become a world-wide celebrity , an austere and remote personage who was seldom seen to smile ; there she stood , the daintiest Christmas Cracker that one could wish to behold , in a sheath of shimmery pink , tied in the middle by a golden string , finished at either end with a froth of frills , and ornamented front and back with immense bouquets of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 41]: By an ingenious arrangement also , if you pulled a string in a certain way , a mysterious cracking sound was heard , and a motto made its appearance bearing an original couplet whose reference was strictly and delightfully local .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 35]: The run on these mottoes was great , and after their points were fully enjoyed , they were folded carefully away , to be kept as souvenirs of the great scholar of later years .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 26]: The evening was half over , and the girls had settled down to the dance , when suddenly , unexpectedly , the great excitement arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 73]: At a moment when the music had ceased , and the various couples were preparing for the usual promenade around the Hall , a loud roar was heard from without , and into the middle of the floor there trotted nothing more nor less than a tawny yellow lion , which , being confronted by a crowd of spectators , drew back as if in fear , and crouched in threatening manner .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 58]: Its masked face showed a savage row of teeth ; a mass of red hair , shortened by that mysterious process known as `` back combing , '' produced a sufficiently convincing mane ; a yellow skin hearthrug was wrapped round the body , while paint and wadding combined had contrived a wonderfully good imitation of claws .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 19]: It was the colour of the hair alone which revealed the identity of the Lion to her companions .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 10]: `` It 's that wretched little ginger Georgie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 7]: `` That little ginger beast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 8]: went the cry from lip to lip .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 50]: But , abuse her as they might , for the rest of the evening `` Ginger Georgie '' remained the centre of attraction , as she persistently ambled after Topsy , and gnawed at her brown feet , evidently recognising in her at once a compatriot and a tit-bit .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 4]: Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 10]: _ Il faut souffrire pour etre -- celebre _ !
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 31]: When supper-time arrived , and the lion 's mask was removed , behold a countenance so magenta with heat that compared with it even the Letter Box herself was pale .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 18]: The two sufferers were waited upon with the most assiduous attention , as was indeed only fair .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 42]: When one has voluntarily endured a condition of semi-suffocation throughout an evening 's `` pleasuring '' for the unselfish reason of providing amusement for others , it 's a poor thing if one can not be assisted to lemonade in return .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 44]: The Lion sat up well into the night combing out her mane ; the Letter Box had the first bad headache in her life , but both tumbled into bed at last , proud and happy in the remembrance of an historic success .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 3]: UNDERGRADUATE FRIENDS .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 12]: Hannah strolled into Darsie 's study , open letter in hand .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 6]: `` Here 's games ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 3]: she announced .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 23]: `` An invitation from Mrs Hoare for myself and friend -- that 's you -- to go to tea on Sunday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 12]: That 's because I 'm Dan 's sister , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 20]: He 'll be there , too , I expect , and the handsome Percival , and lots more men .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 9]: The question is , shall we go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 35]: Now Mrs Hoare was the wife of the head of that well-known college of which Dan and Ralph were members , and the invitation was therefore the fulfilment of one of Darsie 's dreams .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 8]: `` Of course we 'll go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 4]: she cried ardently .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 25]: `` Sunday tea at a man 's college is part of the Cambridge programme , and we want to see all that we can .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 13]: Personally , I consider that they might have asked us before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 28]: She lay back in her seat , and stared dreamily at the wall , puckering her brow in thought , the while Hannah chuckled in the background .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 10]: `` I know what you are thinking about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 6]: `` You do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 11]: cried Darsie , and blushed , a deep guilty blush .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 6]: `` I _ do _ !
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 29]: Costume for Sunday , and the question of possibly squeezing out three or four shillings to buy an extra bit of frippery to add to your charms ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 4]: `` Boo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 25]: cried Darsie impatiently ; then with a sudden change of front : `` And if I _ was _ , I was perfectly right !
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 18]: Newnham girls are not half careful enough about their appearance , and it tells against the cause .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 29]: A perfect woman , nobly planned , ought to be as clever as she is -- er -- dainty , and as dainty as she is clever . ''
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 7]: `` Thank you for the concession !
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 9]: Very considerate of you , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 17]: If you had stuck to ` beautiful , ' I should have been hopelessly left out .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 48]: Even ` dainty ' is beyond me , I 'm afraid ; but I 'll promise you to be neat and tidy , and saints can do no more -- if they happen to have been born _ plain _ saints , that 's to say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 24]: Hannah stood in front of the mirror , staring back at her flat , square face with an expression of serenely detached criticism .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 20]: `` If you are the beauty of this college , I run a close race for the booby prize !
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 12]: Bit of a handicap that , if you care about popularity .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 5]: This Sunday afternoon now !
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 20]: they 'll all be buzzing round you like so many flies , while I do wallflower in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 9]: Nonsense to say that looks do n't count !
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 23]: So far as I can see , the difference between your face and mine will probably make the difference in our lives .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 20]: You 'll marry a lord of high degree , and I 'll school marm and be maiden aunt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 6]: `` Oh , Hannah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 12]: Darsie was acutely discomfited by such words from Hannah 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 32]: True they were spoken in matter-of-fact tones , and without the suspicion of a whine , but as the first instance of anything approaching a lament , the occasion was historic .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 13]: `` Oh , Hannah , dear -- it 's only at first !
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 23]: After the first no one cares a rap _ what _ you look like , so long as you 're nice . ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 4]: `` Fal-de-ral ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 4]: cried Hannah scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 6]: `` Of course they care !
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 18]: Any one would -- should myself , but you need n't look so hang-dog , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 17]: It 's not _ your _ fault , and I am quite comfortable , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 30]: If any man ever wants to marry me , I 'll know jolly well that it 's for myself , and that he really loves me through and through .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 27]: There is n't any of the glamour business about this child to make him imagine that he cares , when it 's only a passing phase .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 25]: And if it 's my lot to live alone , I 'll back myself to be as happy as most wives I come across .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 27]: It 's my own big , splendid life , and I 'm going to _ make _ it splendid , or know the reason why ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 23]: Hannah struck a dramatic gesture , danced a few fancy steps in an elephantine manner , and stumped towards , the door .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 7]: `` So be it , then !
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 16]: We accept with pleasure , and I 'll leave you to trim your hat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 72]: Whether or no any such embellishment did take place history sayeth not , but it is certain that Darsie Garnett made a very charming picture on the following Sunday afternoon , and that her dainty style of beauty showed to peculiar advantage against the oak panelling of the stately old room in which the head of -- College and his gracious , fragile - looking wife dispensed tea to their guests .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 50]: The first few minutes after their arrival were rather an ordeal to the two Freshers , who had never before been present at such a gathering , and felt themselves the cynosure of every eye ; but the kindness of host and hostess soon put them at their ease .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 20]: A fair sprinkling of college men were in the room , handing round tea and cakes to the guests .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 11]: Dan Vernon greeted Darsie with an illuminating `` Halloa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 41]: and his sister with an even shorter grunt ; but it was only when she was comfortably settled down to tea that Darsie caught sight of Ralph Percival 's fair , close-clipped head at the far side of the table .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 41]: He seemed in no hurry to speak to her -- a fact duly scored against him in Miss Darsie 's mind , and this indifference served to pique her into a more vivacious reception of the attentions of his companions .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 29]: As Hannah had foretold , her pretty friend held quite a little court as one man after another strolled up to join the animated group around her chair .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 30]: There were two other girls in that group , and a married woman with a strikingly sweet face , who had been introduced as the sister of the hostess .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 35]: Mrs Reeves , as she was called , appeared to be on intimate terms with the men , and her presence , instead of acting as a restraint , only added to their enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 30]: Darsie thought that she was a charming creature , was conscious that she herself was being scrutinised with special attention , and sincerely hoped that the verdict was favourable .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 18]: It was a curious person who did not wish to stand well in Alicia Reeves 's estimation !
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 23]: Suddenly Ralph Percival edged in at the back of the group , and stationed himself by Darsie with an air of possession .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 21]: `` Well , Miss Darsie Garnett , is n't it about time that you had some talk with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 5]: `` Quite time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 27]: Darsie 's tone was eloquent , and she looked Ralph in the face with a quiet steadiness , at which he had the grace to blush .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 41]: He had been in no hurry to claim acquaintanceship until her social success was assured ; she was fully aware of the fact , but her pique died a rapid death as she looked closely into the lad 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 61]: Ralph at twenty-two was as handsome as in his boyhood , handsomer , indeed , but there were other changes , which the girl 's eyes were quick to read ; for though we may keep silence with our tongue , the hand of Time imprints marks upon our features which are unfailing guides to our spiritual progress or decline .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 36]: For many months past Ralph Vernon had persistently allowed himself to fall short of his best , slacking in work , overstepping at play , abandoning `` straightness '' for a gathering mesh of deceit .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 53]: Attached to his name was an unsavoury reputation of card-playing for high stakes , of drinking too much , although not to the extent of actual drunkenness ; and the character had alienated from him the friendship of serious men , and evoked a disapproving aloofness in the manner of his instructors .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 36]: At the moment when he most needed help those who were best fitted to give it sedulously avoided his company , and in this first moment of meeting Darsie was tempted to follow their example .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 6]: Horrid to look like that !
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 17]: At his age to own those lines , those reddened eyes , that dulled white skin !
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 22]: Up went the little head , the slender neck reared itself proudly , the red lips curled over small white teeth .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 39]: Darsie intended to wither Ralph by the sight of such obvious distaste , but with the easy vanity of his nature he attributed her airs to girlish pique at his own neglect , and was correspondingly elated thereat .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 28]: The little schoolgirl who had been his sister 's friend had grown into a `` stunning girl , '' with whom the men were evidently greatly impressed .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 21]: Ralph decided that the hour had come to claim her as an old friend and take her under his wing .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 13]: He sat himself down by her side and persistently monopolised her attention .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 9]: `` College life evidently suits you , Darsie .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 7]: You are looking rippingly well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 4]: `` Am I ?
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 10]: Sorry to be unable to return the compliment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 4]: Ralph moved impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 10]: `` Do n't _ you _ begin that tune !
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 11]: It is dinned into my ears from morning till night .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 34]: A fellow may swot himself into a rag , and not a word will be said , but if he oversteps an inch for his own amusement there 's the dickens to pay .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 14]: I said from the start that I intended to have a good rag .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 30]: College is one of the best times in a man 's life , and he 's a fool if he does n't make the most of his chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 31]: `` It is also -- incidentally -- supposed to be a time for mental improvement , '' returned Darsie in sententious tones , which brought upon her an instant rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 16]: `` Oh , for pity 's sake do n't come the Newnham swag over me !
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 9]: Ca n't stand those girls as a rule .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 5]: Avoid 'em like poison .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 17]: Take my advice as an old friend and avoid that style as you would the plague .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 11]: You 're too jolly pretty to come the strong-minded female .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 8]: Far better stick to your old style .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 8]: Men like it a heap better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 17]: `` It is a matter of perfect indifference to me _ what _ men like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 15]: declared Darsie , not , it is to be feared , with absolute veracity .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 28]: `` I am proud to be a Newnhamite , and if the girls do have a few mannerisms , they count for precious little beside their virtues .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 32]: They are up to work , and they _ do _ work with might and main , though there can be no place in the world where there is no fun .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 35]: We are always having some prank or other -- politicals , and cocoa-parties and hockey matches , and dances -- '' `` What 's the fun of dances with no men to dance with ?
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 14]: Wait till May term , and see what a real ball is like .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 15]: We 'll have some river picnics , too , and breakfasts at the Orchard .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 19]: There 's lots to be done in summer , but just now there 's nothing on but teas .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 9]: You must come to tea in my rooms .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 8]: I 've got a slap-up study . ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 12]: He turned towards Mrs Reeves and addressed her with confident familiarity .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 21]: `` Mrs Reeves will play chaperon , and I 'll promise you the best cakes that Cambridge can produce . ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 11]: `` Oh , yes , I 'll play chaperon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 28]: To Darsie 's surprise the sweet-faced woman smiled back into Ralph 's face with friendly eyes , not appearing even to notice the over-confidence of his manner .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 23]: `` Mr Percival gives charming parties , and I can answer for it that his boast as to the cakes is justified .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 10]: I can never fathom where he gets them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 17]: She turned to Darsie with a little gesture of confidence , and slightly lowered her voice .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 11]: `` I am known as ` the Professional Chaperon . '
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 30]: I hope you will engage my services if you are in need of such a personage , but perhaps we ought to know one another a little better first .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 9]: I should like so much to know you !
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 22]: Will you come to see me one afternoon next week when you are free , and feel inclined for a chat ?
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 19]: I wo n't ask any one else , so that we can have a real cosy time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 40]: Surprised and gratified , and more than a little flattered , Darsie mentioned her free hours , and received in return Mrs Reeves 's card bearing an address in Grange Road , then once more Ralph engrossed her attention .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 4]: `` I say !
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 16]: You might ask Ida up for a night or two , and bring her along .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 19]: They 'll let you have a friend now and then , and she 'd like it all right .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 17]: Awfully decent in writing to me , Ida is , and fights my battles at home .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 3]: Sensible girl !
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 8]: Understand it 's no good to jaw .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 12]: I 'd like to have Ida up for a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 12]: `` So would I. I 'll ask her with pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 23]: One of Ralph 's best points had been his affection for his sisters , and the reminder thereof softened Darsie 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 8]: She smiled at him with recovered friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 22]: `` I 'll ask Ida , and you must ask Dan and Hannah Vernon , and make a nice family party .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 7]: Do you see much of Dan ?
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 16]: I do n't expect _ he _ makes a rag of himself over amusement ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 4]: Ralph shrugged carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 8]: `` I 've no use for Vernon !
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 17]: Good head for routine work , but as a pal , dull as you make 'em !
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 24]: I 'll ask him once as you make a point of it , but I do n't fancy you 'll want him twice .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 16]: As for the sister -- but perhaps I 'd better not make any remarks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 5]: `` Much better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 4]: Darsie said frostily .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 9]: `` Your manners have not improved , Ralph .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 21]: I think , if you please , that I would rather not talk to you any more for the present .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 15]: Would you tell Dan Vernon that I want him to take your place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 41]: It was the first , the very first time in her life that Darsie had essayed the part of queening it over a member of the opposite sex , and the success of the venture was startling even to herself .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 44]: Ralph flushed , flinched , rose without a word , and stalked across the room to summon Dan as required ; and Dan came meekly forward , seated himself in the discarded chair , and faced her with an air of solemn expectation .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 41]: His rugged face looked plain and roughly hewn in contrast with Ralph 's classical features , but the dark eyes were eloquent as of yore , and the sight of the tilted chin brought back a score of old-time memories .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 21]: Darsie looked at him with satisfaction , but with a disconcerting blankness of mind as to what to say first .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 27]: From the other side of the room Ralph was looking on with cynical eyes ; it was imperative that the silence should be broken at once .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 9]: `` Dan , _ please _ say something !
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 12]: I wanted Ralph to go , so I asked for you .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 8]: Do please find something to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 4]: Dan smiled broadly .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 19]: Each time that she saw him smile Darsie wondered afresh how she could ever have thought him plain .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 15]: His dark eyes glowed upon her with the look she liked best to see .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 7]: `` What am I to say ?
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 10]: It 's good to see you here , Darsie .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 7]: You are looking very -- well !
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 5]: Everything going all right ?
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 9]: Sure there 's nothing I can do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 4]: Darsie beamed happily .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 10]: At that moment there seemed nothing left to wish .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 21]: Dan 's friendliness gave the finishing touch to her content , and the world was _ couleur de rose _ .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 11]: `` I am loving it all more than I expected .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 19]: The work 's glorious , and the play 's glorious , and I 'm just absorbed in both .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 18]: It 's splendid , coming here to-day to see this lovely old house and meet you again .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 10]: I thought you had forgotten all about me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 15]: But Dan had drawn back into his shell , and refused to be cajoled .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 23]: He glowered at the opposite wall for some minutes , then asked abruptly -- `` Why did you send off Percival ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 5]: `` Oh -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 33]: Darsie hesitated , and then answered with discretion : `` I had talked to him as much as I cared about for the moment , and I shall see him soon again .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 19]: He is going to get up a tea-party for me , with that sweet Mrs Reeves as chaperon .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 10]: I told him to ask you and Hannah . ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 9]: `` You should not have done that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 6]: Dan spoke with sharp displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 20]: `` I do n't care to accept Percival 's hospitality for myself , and certainly not for my sister .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 8]: I shall tell Hannah to refuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 73]: Darsie glanced across to where Hannah sat , a typical plain Hannah at that moment , with feet planted well apart , and on her face the expression of dour determination which she adopted in moments of boredom ; from her to Ralph Percival , standing in graceful pose , his fine , almost feminine , profile outlined clearly against the panelled wall , and , glancing , laughed softly to herself .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 15]: It seemed so ridiculous to think of this girl needing protection from this man .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 13]: `` I fancy Hannah is quite capable of looking after herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 7]: `` I 'm sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 23]: She 's a new-comer , however , and she does n't get into Percival 's set if I can help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 3]: `` Dan !
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 14]: It ca n't be so bad if Mrs Reeves is willing to go .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 6]: She accepted in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 6]: I heard her myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 12]: `` She goes everywhere , to the wildest fellows ' rooms .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 19]: She has her own ideas , no doubt , but I do n't profess to understand them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 17]: He hesitated , puckering his brows , and looking at her with dark , questioning eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 26]: `` I have no authority over you , Darsie , but I wish -- '' `` Ralph saved my life , '' interrupted Darsie simply .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 22]: Dan looked at her sharply , stared with scrutinising attention at her face , but spoke no further word of protest .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 31]: He evidently realised , as Darsie did herself , that it would be a mean act to reject the friendship of a man who had wrought so great a service .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 45]: Half an hour later the two girls slowly wended their way past the tower gateway of Trinity , past Caius , with its twinkling lights , stately King 's , and modest Catherine 's , to the homelike shelter of their own dear Newnham .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 22]: cried Hannah , breaking a long silence , `` you had a big success and I had -- _ not _ !
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 15]: But you 're not a bit happier than I , that I can see .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 7]: Men are poor , blind bats .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 31]: I prefer my own sex ; they are much more discriminating , and when they like you -- they _ like _ you , and there 's no more shilly-shally .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 9]: Those men never know their own minds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 6]: MRS. REEVES MAKES A PROPOSAL .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 28]: Four days later Darsie went by appointment to her _ tete-a-tete _ tea with the professional chaperon with a pleasurable expectation which was largely streaked with curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 18]: If physiognomy counted for anything , Mrs Reeves must surely be a most sweet and noble character .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 49]: Her grey eyes looked into yours with a straight , transparent gaze , her lips closed one upon another firmly enough to debar all trace of weakness , yet not so firmly as to hint at undue severity , her hair waved back from a broad white brow .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 30]: It was , as Dan had said , difficult to understand how such a woman could be the willing companion of men whom even fellow-students were anxious to shun .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 16]: Darsie wondered if the afternoon 's conversation would throw any light on this knotty point .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 67]: She was shown , not into the drawing-room but into a cosy little den on the second floor , a sort of glorious edition of a college study , where Mrs Reeves sat reading by the fire , clad in a loose velvet gown of a curious reddish-brown , like the autumn tint of a leaf , which matched the high lights of her chestnut hair .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 46]: Darsie watched her with fascinated attention as she presided over the tea-table , with lithe , graceful movements which made a poem out of the every-day proceeding , and Mrs Reeves studied her in return , as she chatted lightly about a dozen casual subjects .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 22]: Then the tea-things were carried away , and with the drawing nearer to the fire conversation took a more intimate turn .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 38]: `` I hope your friend did not think me inhospitable for not including her in my invitation to-day , but when I want to get to know a girl I prefer to have her entirely to myself .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 7]: Perhaps she will come another day .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 10]: Vernon 's sister ought to be worth knowing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 6]: `` You know Dan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 23]: Darsie 's smile was somewhat anxious , for Dan 's own manner with respect to her hostess was still a disturbing element .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 7]: `` You know him well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 12]: `` No , '' Mrs Reeves smiled ; `` not well .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 8]: But I like him well by repute !
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 8]: Vernon has no need of my services .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 11]: He is strong : enough to stand by himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 6]: `` You mean tea-parties ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 14]: queried Darsie vaguely , whereat Mrs Reeves subsided into a ripple of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 16]: `` No , I do _ not _ mean tea-parties -- something very much wider .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 30]: I do n't fancy , however , that Vernon is sociably disposed , and the authorities here are not inclined to encourage meetings between the men and girl students .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 44]: The head of his college is my brother-in-law , and one of your Dons is a very old friend , so I hear the question discussed from both sides , and then -- like a wise woman -- I gang my own gait !
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 53]: So long as men are men , and girls are girls , they are bound to attract each other ; it 's natural and right , and when they are bound to meet in any case , it is my little hobby to help them to do so under the best conditions .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 38]: I flatter myself I am quite an expert in the art of being just chaperon enough , and not too chaperon , and I never refuse to act if I can possibly contrive to do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 17]: Dan said -- '' began Darsie involuntarily , and then stopped short with a furious blush .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 28]: Mrs Reeves , however , did not share her discomfiture ; she laughed , and said shrewdly -- `` Oh , I have observed his disapproving eye .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 7]: I can guess what he said .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 24]: Many people feel the same , who judge only from the surface , and do n't take the trouble to realise my motives .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 21]: One does n't explain such things to the world in general , but I want _ you _ to understand .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 33]: If one man less admirable than another ; if his friends and his entertainments are inclined to become rowdy and discreditable , does he need help _ less _ , or more ?
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 21]: Vernon and other men of his kind consider that they do their duty by leaving such a man severely alone .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 19]: I find mine in being with him -- just -- as much -- as ever I can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 28]: She emphasised the words by a series of taps with the poker on the top of an obstinate coal , given in the most delightfully school-girlish manner .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 33]: `` I chaperon his parties ; I talk to him and his friends ; I make myself so agreeable that they love to have me , and want to have me again .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 49]: I try with every power I possess to encourage all that is good , and kind , and honest , and cheering in themselves and their conversation , and deftly , delicately , invisibly , as it were , to fight against everything that is mean and unworthy .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 6]: It 's difficult , Darsie !
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 11]: -- I may call you Darsie , may n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 8]: it 's such a beguiling little name !
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 32]: -- one of the most difficult feats a woman could set herself to accomplish , and though I 've had a fair measure of success , it 's only a measure .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 8]: It 's such a great big work .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 33]: Think of all that it means , that it _ may _ mean to England , if we can keep these men from drifting , and give them a pull-up in time !
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 10]: I am constantly looking , looking out for fellow-workers .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 21]: That 's why I invited you here to-day -- to ask _ you _ to be on my side ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 4]: `` I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 10]: Darsie 's gasp of amazement sounded throughout the room .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 3]: `` I !
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 8]: Oh , you ca n't mean it !
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 5]: What could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 12]: I can do nothing -- I 'm only a girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 5]: `` Only a girl !
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 11]: But , dear child , that 's your finest qualification !
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 32]: You can do more than I can ever accomplish , just because you _ are _ a girl , and will be admitted to an intimacy which is impossible for me .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 24]: Besides , Darsie , you are a particularly pretty and attractive girl into the bargain ; you know that , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 23]: You _ ought _ to know it , and be very , very thankful for a great weapon given into your hands .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 25]: If you will join the ranks with me , and act as my curate , you will immensely increase my power for good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 6]: `` But I ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 4]: I ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 18]: I 'd love to if I could , but you do n't know how impossible it is .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 10]: I could n't preach to save my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 8]: `` I 'm thankful to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 8]: I do n't want you to preach .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 10]: You 'd soon lose your influence if you did .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 44]: It 's a case of _ being _ , Darsie , rather than doing ; being your truest , sweetest , highest self when you are with these men , so that they may feel your influence through all the fun and banter .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 24]: Lots of fun , please ; you ca n't have too much of that ; a dull girl is soon left to herself .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 29]: People in general do n't half realise the influence of just right _ thinking _ -- the atmosphere which surrounds a person who is mentally fighting for good .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 41]: The sunbeams fall on the dark earth and soak up the poisoned waters , and so may our thoughts -- our prayers , '' She was silent for a few moments , her hand resting lightly on Darsie 's knees .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 18]: `` There is a girl in your house -- Margaret France -- I expect you know her !
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 12]: She has been one of my best helpers these last years .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 35]: Wherever Margaret is there is fun and laughter ; she is just brimful of it , but -- can you imagine any one going to Margaret with an unworthy thought , an unworthy cause ?
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 10]: I want you to follow in her steps ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 22]: She paused again for a long minute , then said slowly and emphatically -- `` Ralph Percival needs help , Darsie !
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 14]: He has not fallen very low as yet , but he is drifting .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 21]: He is in a bad set , and , like too many of our richer men , he lacks purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 21]: They come up here because their fathers have been before them , and it is the correct thing to do .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 31]: There is no real reason why they should work , or take a high place , but there seems to themselves every reason why they should have a good time .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 21]: Parents sometimes seem to hold more or less the same opinion ; at others they seem distressed , but powerless .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 33]: College authorities are regarded as natural enemies ; religious influences for the time beat on closed doors ; now , Darsie , here comes the chance for ` only a girl ! '
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 29]: A man like Ralph Percival , at this stage of his life , will be more influenced by a girl like you than by any power on earth .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 27]: It 's a law of Nature and of God , and if every girl realised it , it would be a blessed thing for the race .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 30]: I once heard a preacher say that so long as one dealt with general principles , and talked broadly of the human race , there was very little done .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 20]: We have to fine it down to _ my next door neighbour _ before we really set to work .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 18]: Fine down what I have said to Ralph Percival , Darsie , and help me with him !
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 4]: He 's drifting .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 4]: He needs you .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 8]: Help me to pull him back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 4]: Darsie nodded dumbly .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 27]: Mrs Reeves thought the expression on her downcast face touchingly sweet and earnest , but even she missed the clue to the girl 's inmost thought .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 41]: Years ago she herself had been drifting , drifting towards death , and Ralph had stepped forward to save her ; now , in an allegorical sense , the positions were reversed , and she was summoned to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 9]: There was no refusing a duty so obvious .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 17]: Heavy and onerous as the responsibility might be , it had been placed in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 7]: Darsie braced herself to the burden .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 3]: CHRISTMAS DAY .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 32]: It was Christmas Day ; fifteen eventful months had passed by since Darsie Garnett and Hannah Vernon had made their appearance in Clough in the character of modest and diffident Freshers .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 45]: Now , advanced to the dignity of second-year girls , they patronised new-comers with the best , and talked , thought , and behaved as though , deprived of their valuable support , the historical centre of Cambridge must swiftly crumble to the dust .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 87]: The little air of assurance and self-esteem which seems inseparable from a feminine student had laid its hand on Darsie 's beauty , robbing it of the old shy grace , and on each fresh return to the old home Clemence and Lavender eloquently described themselves as `` squelched flat '' by the dignified young woman who sailed about with her head in the air , and delivered an ultimatum on every subject as it arose , with an air of `` My opinion is final .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 6]: Let no dog bark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 70]: These mannerisms , however , were only , after all , a veneer ; and when two or three days of merry , rollicking family life had passed by , the old Darsie made her appearance once more , forgot to be learned and superior , forbore to refer to college and college ways in every second or third sentence , and showed a reviving interest in family affairs .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 42]: Clemence was fatter than ever , a subject of intense mortification to herself , though at each fresh meeting she confided in whispered asides that she had `` lost five pounds -- ten pounds , '' as the case might be .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 36]: No one believed in these diminutions , but if one happened to be amiably disposed , one murmured vaguely , and affected conviction ; and if one were not , one openly jeered and scoffed !
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 30]: Lavender was sentimental and wrote poetry in which `` pale roses died , in the garden wide , and the wind blew drear , o'er the stricken mere . ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 17]: She had advanced to the dignity of long skirts , and dressed her hair -- badly !
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 8]: -- in the latest eccentricity of fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 54]: Vie Vernon , on the contrary , had developed into a most elegant person , quite an accomplished woman of the world , darkly suspected of `` going to be engaged '' to a young lawyer with a dark moustache , who had lately developed a suspicious fondness for her father 's company .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 52]: It really gave one quite a shock to realise _ how _ grown-up the old companions had become even the brothers Harry and Russell were transformed into tall striplings who bought newspapers on their own account , and preferred , actually _ preferred _ , to be clean rather than dirty !
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 35]: It was a positive relief to listen to Tim 's loud voice , look at his grimy paws , and reflect that one member of the family was still in the enjoyment of youth .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 15]: As usual , the postman 's arrival was the first excitement of Christmas morning .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 33]: He brought with him an armful of letters and parcels , and Darsie was quick to spy Ralph Percival 's handwriting upon one of the smallest and most attractive-looking of the packets .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 43]: The colour came into her cheeks as she looked , but after holding the parcel uncertainly for a moment , she laid it down again , and proceeded to open other letters and boxes , leaving this particular one to the last .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 31]: An onlooker would have been puzzled to decide whether it was more dread or expectation which prompted this decision ; and perhaps Darsie herself could hardly have answered the question .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 39]: The table was soon spread with envelopes and wrappings of paper which had enclosed souvenirs from college friends , and the more costly offerings from Mrs Percival and her girls , inscribed with the orthodox words of greeting .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 20]: Darsie ranged them in order , and then , still hesitating , turned to the last packet of all .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 18]: Inside was a note folded so as to act as additional wrapper for a small white box .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 14]: Ralph 's writing , large and well-formed like himself , filled the half-sheet .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 25]: `` Dear Darsie , -- I hope you will accept the enclosed trifle which has been made for you , from my own design .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 6]: You will understand its meaning !
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 11]: I am more than ever in need of pulling up !
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 8]: Do n't fail a fellow , Darsie !
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 10]: `` Yours , -- `` Ralph B. Percival . ''
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 22]: Inside the box lay a small but beautifully modelled anchor brooch , with a fine golden rope twined round the stock .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 29]: Darsie looked at it with the same mingling of joy and pain which seemed inseparable from each stage of her friendship with this attractive but irresponsible young man .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 61]: It was just like Ralph to have thought of this pretty and graceful way of expressing his sentiments , and it was not in girl nature to resist a glow of gratified vanity ; but as she turned the golden anchor in her hands and realised the significance of the symbol , an old impatience stirred in Darsie 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 39]: A man who trusted to another for anchorage in life , and who was ever in danger of breaking loose and drifting on to the rocks , was not the strong knight of a young girl 's dreams .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 23]: There were moments when the protecting tenderness which had prompted the last year 's efforts gave place to sudden intolerance and resentment .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 33]: Inspired by Mrs Reeves 's words in her first term at college , Darsie had set gallantly to the task of influencing Ralph Percival for good , and preventing his further deterioration .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 40]: At first it had appeared a forlorn hope ; and she would have despaired many a time if it had not been for the encouragement which she received from Mrs Reeves and her `` curate , '' Margaret France .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 13]: Then gradually and surely her influence had begun to make itself felt .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 33]: It could not truthfully be said that she had so inspired Ralph that he had turned over a new leaf , and abandoned bad practices from a desire for the right itself .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 32]: If the truth must be told , desire for his pretty mentor 's approbation and praise had been a far stronger factor in the improvement which seemed to have been effected .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 35]: Ralph was emotional , and as his interest in Darsie deepened into the sentimental attachment which seemed a natural development of their intimacy , he grew increasingly anxious to stand well in her estimation .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 73]: During the May term there had been teas in the college gardens , breakfast parties at the Orchard , picnics on the river , which had afforded opportunities of _ tete-a-tete _ conversations when , amidst the flowers and the sunshine , it had been quite an agreeable sensation to lament over one 's weaknesses and shortcomings , and to receive in return the wisest of counsels from Darsie 's pretty lips .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 9]: `` To please _ you _ , Darsie !
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 32]: -- I 'm hanged if I care what other people think , but if _ you _ ask me -- '' The promises gained were all couched in this personal vein .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 16]: `` If you chuck me , Darsie , I sha n't worry any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 10]: This was the threat held out for the future .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 46]: Unsatisfactory , if you will , yet the fact remained that for the first part of the last term Ralph _ had _ appeared to show greater interest in work than he had before manifested , and had been involved in a minimum of scrapes .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 40]: There were moments when , remembering these facts , Darsie felt proudly that she had not lived in vain ; moments when Ralph 's dependence on herself and graceful acknowledgments of her help seemed the chief interest in life .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 17]: But there were also other moments when the bond between them weighed heavy as a chain .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 29]: In less than two years the training days would be over , Ralph would be a man , and she herself a woman on the threshold of life .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 26]: Would she be expected to play the part of permanent anchor , and , if so , could she , should she undertake the task ?
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 48]: For the last few weeks of the term Darsie had been so absorbed in her own surroundings that she had had no time or thought to bestow on outside interests , and Mrs Reeves being abroad , no college news came to her ears from that source .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 46]: Now since the beginning of the holidays Ralph 's name had hardly been mentioned , since family interests were predominant , and Darsie had learned from experience that the subject of `` Percival '' was calculated to send Dan Vernon into his most taciturn mood .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 25]: On this Christmas morning , however , Darsie was in a mood of somewhat reckless gaiety ; let the future take care of itself .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 47]: For to-day , at least , she was young and happy and free ; the Vernon family was coming over in bulk to spend the evening , when the presence of one of Dan 's chums would supply an agreeable element of novelty to the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 17]: Not one single gloomy thought must be allowed to cloud the sunshine of this Christmas Day !
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 14]: Dinner was served at seven o'clock , and was truly a festive occasion .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 26]: The dining-room table being unequal to the task of providing accommodation for sixteen people , the schoolroom table had to be used as a supplement .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 55]: It was a good inch higher than the other , and supplied with a preponderance of legs , but these small drawbacks could not weigh against the magnificent effect of the combined length , covered , as it was , with fruit , flowers , and a plethora of bright red bonbons and crackers .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 50]: The girls wore their prettiest evening frocks ; the turkey , the goose , the plum-pudding , and the mince-pies were all paragons of their kind , while dessert was enlivened by the discovery of small surprise presents cunningly hidden away within hollowed oranges , apples , and nuts .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 43]: Silver thimbles , pocket-calendars , stamp-cases , sleeve-links , and miniature brooches , made their appearance with such extraordinary unexpectedness that Darsie finally declared she was afraid to venture to eat even a grape , lest she might swallow a diamond alive !
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 25]: When the hilarious meal had come to an end , the company adjourned into a drawing-room illumined by firelight only , but such firelight !
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 25]: For over a week those logs had been stacked by the kitchen grate so that they might become `` as dry as tinder . ''
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 60]: Placed in the big grate , they sent up a leaping , crackling flame which was in itself an embodiment of cheer , and when the sixteen chairs were filled and ranged in a circle round the blaze , there was a Christmas picture complete , and as goodly and cheery a picture as one need wish to see .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 46]: A basket of fir-cones stood at either side of the grate , and the order of proceedings was that each guest in turn should drop a cone into the heart of the fire , and relate an amusing story or coincidence the while it burned .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 25]: Results proved that the amount of time so consumed varied so strangely that suggestions of foul play were made by more than one raconteur .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 6]: `` It 's not fair !
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 8]: Some one has got at these cones !
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 11]: Some of them have been soaked to make them damp !
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 36]: -- '' Be that as it may , no one could possibly have foretold who would happen to hit on this particular cone , so that the charge of injustice fell swiftly to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 23]: Mrs Garnett opened the ball with a coincidence taken from her own life , the cone burning bright and blue the while .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 32]: `` When I was a girl of twenty , living at home with my father and mother , I had a curiously distinct dream one night about a certain Mr Dalrymple .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 20]: We knew no one of that name , but in my dream he appeared to be a lifelong friend .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 22]: He was a clergyman , about sixty years of age -- not handsome , but with a kind , clever face .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 15]: He had grey hair , and heavy black eyebrows almost meeting over his nose .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 16]: I was particularly interested in his appearance , because -- this is the exciting part !
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 48]: -- in my dream I was engaged to him , and we were going to be married the following month ... Next morning , when I awoke , the impression left was unusually distinct , and at breakfast I made them all laugh over my matrimonial plans .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 29]: My sisters called me ` Mrs Dalrymple ' for several days , and then the joke faded away , and was replaced by something newer and more exciting .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 22]: Two years passed by , and then , in the summer holidays , I went to Scotland to pay a visit .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 35]: A slight accident on the line delayed me at a small station for a couple of hours , and I strolled through the village to pass the time by seeing what could be seen .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 45]: It was a dull little place , and the principal street was empty of every one but a few children until , when I reached the end , a man in a black coat came suddenly out of a house and walked towards me .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 26]: He was tall and elderly and thin , his hair was grey , his eyebrows were dark and met in a peak over his nose .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 33]: My heart gave a great big jump , for it was the face of the man I had seen in my dream -- the man who was to have been my husband !
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 6]: You can imagine my surprise !
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 45]: It was many , many months since I had given a thought to the silly old dream , but at the first glance at that face the memory of it came back as clear and distinct as on the morning after it had happened .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 16]: I walked towards him quite dazed with surprise , and then another extraordinary thing happened !
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 54]: He was evidently short-sighted , and could not distinguish figures at a distance , but presently , as we drew nearer together , he in his turn started violently , stared in my face as if he could hardly believe his eyes , and then rushed forward and seized me by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 16]: ` I _ am _ glad to see you -- I _ am _ glad !
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 7]: This _ is _ a pleasure !
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 6]: When did you come ? '
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 4]: Poor old man !
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 20]: My blank face showed him his mistake , and he dropped my hand and began to mumble out apologies .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 7]: ` I 've made a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 33]: I thought you were -- I thought you were -- ' He frowned , evidently searched in vain for a clue , and added feebly , ` I thought I knew you .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 9]: _ Your face is so familiar _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 8]: It was all over in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 24]: He took off his hat , and hurried on overcome with embarrassment , and I turned mechanically in the direction of the church .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 29]: It was closed , but by the gate stood a board bearing the hours of services , and beneath them the name of the minister of the parish .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 7]: I read it with a thrill .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 13]: The name was ` _ The Rev. John Dalrymple _ ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 37]: Mrs Garnett lay back in her chair with the contented air of a _ raconteuse _ who has deftly led up to a _ denouement _ , and her audience gasped in mingled surprise and curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 6]: `` How _ thrilling _ !
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 4]: How weird ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 6]: `` What an extraordinary thing !
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 3]: Go on !
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 3]: Go on !
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 6]: And what happened next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 5]: Mrs Garnett chuckled contentedly .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 15]: `` I met your father , married him , and lived happily ever after !
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 16]: As for Mr Dalrymple , I never met him again nor heard his name mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 25]: The sequel is not at all exciting , but it was certainly an extraordinary coincidence , and caused me much agitation at the time .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 14]: I have timed myself very well -- my cone has just burned out .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 7]: Who 's turn comes next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 22]: There followed a somewhat lengthened pause while every one nudged a next-door neighbour , and disdained responsibility on his own account .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 8]: Then Mr Vernon stepped into the breach .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 10]: `` I heard a curious thing the other day .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 28]: A friend of mine was taken suddenly ill on a hillside in Switzerland , was carried into a chalet and most kindly tended by the good woman .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 26]: When , at the end of several hours , he was well enough to leave , he wished to make her a present of money .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 52]: She refused to take it , but said that she had a daughter in service in England , and that it would be a real pleasure to her , if , upon his return , my friend would write to the girl telling her of his visit to the old home .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 25]: He asked for the address , and was told , ` Mary Smith , care of Mr Spencer , The Towers , Chestone . '
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 22]: He read it , looked the old woman in the face and said , ` _ I _ am Mr Spencer !
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 21]: _ I _ live at The Towers , Chestone ; and my children 's nurse is called Mary Smith ! '
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 23]: I can vouch for the absolute truth of that coincidence , and I think you will find it hard to beat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 11]: `` And what did he say to the nurse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 28]: asked literal Clemence , to the delight of her brothers and sisters , whose imaginary dialogues between master and maid filled the next few minutes with amusement .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 30]: Dan 's friend hailed from Oxford , and gave a highly coloured account of a practical joke in several stages , which he had played on an irritating acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 35]: The elder members of the party listened with awe , if without approval , but Tim showed repeated signs of restlessness , and in a final outburst corrected the narrator on an all-important point .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 16]: `` That 's the way they had it in _ Britain 's Boys _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 22]: he declared , whereupon the Oxford man hid his head under an antimacassar , and exclaimed tragically that all was discovered !
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 8]: `` Now it 's Darsie 's turn !
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 40]: Tell us a story , Darsie -- an adventure , your own adventure when you went out in that punt , and the mill began working -- '' `` Why should I tell what you know by heart already ?
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 7]: You 'd only be bored . ''
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 23]: `` Oh , but you never tell a story twice over in the same way , '' persisted Clemence with doubtful flattery .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 9]: `` And Mr Leslie has never heard it .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 8]: I 'm sure he 'd be interested .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 8]: It really _ was _ an adventure .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 5]: So romantic , too .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 9]: Ralph Percival is _ so _ good-looking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 23]: `` I fail to see what his looks have to do with it , '' said Darsie in her most Newnham manner .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 17]: `` Strong arms were more to the purpose , and those he certainly does possess . ''
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 8]: `` Strong arms -- stout heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 6]: murmured Lavender in sentimental aside .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 22]: `` Well , then , tell about the treasure-hunt in the Percivals ' garden -- and how you -- you know !
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 12]: Go on -- that 's another _ real _ adventure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 18]: `` All Miss Darsie 's adventures seem to have been in connection with the Percival family ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 8]: remarked the Oxford man at this point .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 12]: Darsie flushed with annoyance , and retired determinedly into her shell .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 37]: She was seated almost in the centre of the circle , between her father and John Vernon , and the leaping light of the fire showed up her face and figure in varying shades of colour .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 68]: Now she was a rose-maiden , dress , hair , and face glowing in a warm pink hue ; anon , the rose changed into a faint metallic blue , which gave a ghostlike effect to the slim form ; again , she was all white -- a dazzling , unbroken white , in which the little oval face assumed an air of childlike fragility and pathos .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 51]: As she sat with her hands folded on her knee , and her head resting against the dark cushions of her chair , more than one of the company watched her with admiration : but Darsie was too much occupied with her own thoughts to be conscious of their scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 25]: As each story-teller began his narrative , she cast a momentary glance in his direction , and then turned back to fire-gazing once more .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 39]: Once or twice she cast a curious glance towards the far corner where Dan Vernon was seated , but he had drawn his chair so far back that nothing could be distinguished but the white blur of shirt-front .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 81]: Darsie wondered if Dan were uninterested , bored , asleep -- yet as her eyes questioned the darkness she had the strangest impression of meeting other eyes -- dark , intent eyes , which stared , and stared -- Vie Vernon was telling `` a _ most interesting _ coincidence , '' her opening sentence -- `` It was told to me by a friend -- a lawyer , '' -- causing surreptitious smiles and nudges among her younger hearers .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 13]: `` There was a girl in his office -- a typewriting girl .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 12]: All the money had been lost -- '' `` Whose money ?
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 9]: The lawyer 's or the office 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 3]: `` Neither !
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 5]: Do n't be silly .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 10]: The girl 's father 's , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 12]: `` You never told us that she had a father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 14]: `` Russell , if you interrupt every minute , I wo n't play .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 17]: Of course he 'd lost it , or the girl would n't have been a typist .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 6]: Any one would know that !
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 15]: Ed -- the lawyer did sea-sort of business -- what do you call it ?
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 10]: -- marine things -- and the girl typed them .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 15]: Years before a brother had disappeared -- '' `` The lawyer 's brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 6]: I 'm sorry I began .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 38]: You are so disagreeable , The _ girl 's _ uncle , of course , and they often wanted to find him , because he was rich , and might have helped them now they were poor .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 18]: One day , when she was typing out one of the depositions -- '' `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 8]: The unusual word evoked unanimous comment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 8]: ` De-pos-itions -- if you please ' !
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 11]: How legal we are becoming , to be sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 88]: Vie flushed , and hurried on breathlessly -- `` She came across the name of John H. Rose , and she wondered if the H. meant Hesselwhaite , for that was her uncle 's second name , and she looked it up in the big document , and it _ was _ him , and he was on the west coast of South America , and they wrote to him , and he left them a lot of money , and they lived happy ever after . ''
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 41]: Polite murmurs of astonishment from the elders , unconcealed sniggerings from the juniors , greeted the conclusion of this thrilling tale , and then once more Darsie was called upon for her contribution , and this time consented without demur .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 4]: `` Very well !
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 7]: I 've thought of a story .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 17]: It 's about a managing clerk who was sent to Madrid on business for his firm .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 13]: I did n't know him myself , so do n't ask questions !
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 19]: While he was in Madrid he went to the opera one night , and sat in a box .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 14]: Just opposite was another box , in which sat a beauteous Spanish maid .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 11]: He looked at her , and she looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 6]: They kept looking and looking .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 23]: At last he thought that she smiled , and waved her fan as if beckoning him to come and speak to her .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 43]: So in the first interval the eager youth made his way along the richly carpeted corridors ; but just as he reached the door of the box it opened , and a man came out and put a letter into his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 50]: It was written in Spanish , which the youth did not understand ; but , being filled with a frenzy of curiosity to know what the fair one had to say , he decided to run to his hotel , and get the manager to translate it without delay .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 61]: Well , he went ; but as soon as the manager had read the note he started violently , and said in a manner of the utmost concern : ` I exceedingly regret , sir , to appear inhospitable or inconsiderate , but I find it my painful duty to ask you to leave my hotel within an hour . '
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 16]: The clerk protested , questioned , raged , and stormed , but all in vain .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 46]: The manager refused even to refer to the letter ; he simply insisted that he could entertain him no longer in the hotel , and added darkly : ` It would be well for the Senor to take the first train out of Spain . '
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 35]: `` Alarmed by this mysterious warning , the unhappy youth accordingly shook off the dust from his feet and returned to London , where he confided his woes to his beloved and generous employer .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 20]: The employer was a Spanish merchant and understood the language , so he naturally offered to solve the mystery .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 37]: No sooner , however , had his eye scanned the brief lines , than a cloud shadowed _ his _ expressive countenance , and he addressed himself to the youth more in sorrow than in anger .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 48]: ` It grieves me to the heart , Mr -- er -- _ Bumpas _ , ' he said , ` to sever our connection after your faithful service to the firm ; but , after the perusal of this note , I have unfortunately no choice .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 44]: If you will apply to the cashier he will hand you a cheque equal to six months ' salary ; but I must ask you to understand that when you leave my office this morning it is for the last time ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 29]: A rustle of excitement from the audience , a momentary glimpse of Dan 's face in the flickering light , testified to the interest of this extraordinary history .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 66]: Darsie bent forward to encourage her fir-cone with a pat from the poker , and continued dramatically -- `` Bewildered , broken-hearted , almost demented , the unfortunate youth betook him to an uncle in America -LRB- all uncles seem to live in America -RRB- , who received him with consideration , listened to his sad tale , and bade him be of good cheer .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 11]: ` By a strange coincidence ' -LRB- coincidence again ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 23]: said the worthy man , ` there sups with me to-night a learned professor of languages , resident at our local college .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 17]: He , without doubt , will make plain the mysterious contents of the fatal note ! '
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 22]: Punctual to his hour the professor arrived , and the harassed youth hailed with joy the end of his long suspense .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 49]: Whatever might be the purport of the words written in that fatal paper , the knowledge thereof could not be worse than the fate which had dogged his footsteps ever since that tragic night when he had first cast eyes on the baleful beauty of the Spanish maid .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 41]: Yet might it not be that once again the sight of these words would send him wandering homeless o'er the world -- that the stream of his uncle 's benevolence might be suddenly damned by a force mysterious as inexorable ?
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 26]: `` Trembling with emotion , the young man thrust his hand into his pocket to bring forth this mystic note -- '' Darsie paused dramatically .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 10]: `` And -- and -- and then -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 9]: `` He discovered that it was not there !
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 14]: In the course of his long wanderings it had unfortunately been mislaid . ''
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 51]: The clamour of indignation which followed this _ denouement _ can be better imagined than described but the example having been set , wonderful how many stories of the same baffling character were revived by the different members of the company during the remainder of the firelight _ stance _ .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 53]: So wild and exaggerated did the narratives become , indeed , that the meeting broke up in confusion , and took refuge in those admittedly uproarious Christmas games which survived from the happy nursery days , when `` to make as much noise as we like '' seemed the climax of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 15]: And so ended Christmas Day for the joint ranks of the Vernons and Garnetts .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 3]: THE MELODRAMA .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 25]: On Boxing Day , Lavender excused herself from joining a rinking party , and lay curled up on a sofa reading a Christmas number .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 17]: The following morning she stayed in bed to breakfast , and complained of a swollen face .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 37]: On the third day , the sight of the huge cheeks and doubled chin sent the family flying for the doctor , and the tragic verdict of `` mumps '' was whispered from mouth to mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 6]: Mumps in the Christmas holidays !
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 29]: Isolation for the victim for days , even weeks ; the risk of infection for others ; the terrible , unthinkable possibility of `` missing a term '' !
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 38]: Mrs Vernon came nobly to the rescue , and invited Darsie to spend the remainder of the holidays under her roof , since , with a Tripos in prospect , every precaution must be taken against infection .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 52]: For the rest , Lavender 's own little eyrie was situated at the end of a long top passage , and might have been originally designed for a sanatorium and there , in solitary state , the poor mumpy poetess bewailed her fate , and besought the compassion of her companions .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 66]: Letters were not forbidden , and she therefore found a sad satisfaction in pouring out her woes on paper , as a result of which occupation the following poetical effusion presently found its way to the schoolroom party -- `` All gay and fair the scene appeared : I was a gladsome maid ; When the dire hand of circumstance Upon my life was laid .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 44]: Upon the eve of festal day The first dread symptoms fell ; And those who should have sympathised , Whose tender words I would have prized , Did sneer , and jeer , and with loud cries , Ascribe the reason to mince-pies !
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 37]: `` What time I woke the third day morn , By mirror was the sad truth borne ; Not alone exile , grief , and pain Must fill my cup -- but also _ shame _ !
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 31]: Gone is my youthful glee and grace , I have an elephantine face ; My cheeks are gross , which were so thin ; I have a loathsome pendant chin .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 13]: All who behold me smile aside , And their derision barely hide .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 5]: Oh , cruel fate !
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 13]: instead of tears , In my sad plight I get but jeers .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 20]: `` Friends , comrades , readers of this ditty , If heart ye have , on me have pity .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 32]: Go not unthinking on your way , Content to sing , content to play , While I and mumps sit here alone In an unending , drear ` At home . '
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 32]: Put wits to work , think out some way To cheer the captive 's lonely day , Forget yourself , and think of me , And doubly blessed you shall be .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 31]: For since the days of earliest youth You have been brought up on this truth -- To help the ailing by your side Is the true work of Christmas-tide ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 38]: To disregard so touching an appeal being plainly an impossibility , an impromptu committee meeting was held in the Vernons ' study , when the idea of an open-air melodrama was proposed , and carried with acclamation .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 46]: A melodrama acted in the back garden , underneath Lavender 's window , opened out prospects of amusement for the actors as well as the audience , and a rainy afternoon was passed in the merriest fashion discussing the plot , characters , and costume .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 17]: Darsie sat on the hearthrug , and prodded the fire vigorously to mark each point scored .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 9]: Vie wrote from dictation at the centre table .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 38]: Dan sat chuckling in his own particular chair , and allowed himself to be cast as hero with lamblike calm , and plain Hannah affected dire displeasure at being passed over for the part of beauteous maid .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 43]: It was like the dear old days when they had all been young -- _ really _ young -- in pinafores and pigtails , with no dread of coming Tripos , no agitation about youthful lawyers to chase away sleep at night !
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 23]: Looking back through the years , that hour stood out in remembrance as one most happily typical of the dear home life .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 5]: The programme was delicious .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 87]: Vie discovered a great sheet of white paper , left over from the parcel wrappings of the week before ; Dan printed the words in his most dashing fashion ; John nailed it on the lid of a packing-chest , and the whole party escorted it round the terrace to the Garnett dwelling , and waited in the street beneath until it was conveyed upstairs , and Lavender , discreetly swathed in a shawl , appeared at her lighted window and waved a towel in triumph .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 44]: This was the programme -- On Wednesday Afternoon Next -LRB- _ Weather permitting _ -RRB- In Aid of the Fund for Sick and Suffering Spinsters A First Performance will be given of The Blood-Curdling and Hair-Raising Melodrama entitled The Blue Cabbage by Allthelotofus .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 5]: _ Dramatis Personae _ .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 11]: Efflorescence -LRB- A Guileless Maid -RRB- -- Miss Darsie Garnett .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 10]: Meretricia -LRB- 1st Villainess -RRB- -- Mr Harry Garnett .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 10]: Mycrobe -LRB- 2nd Villainess -RRB- -- Mr Russell Garnett .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 11]: Elijah B. Higgins -LRB- Hero -RRB- -- Mr Dan Vernon .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 13]: Sigismund La Bas -LRB- A False Caitiff -RRB- -- Mr Percy Lister .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 11]: D. Spenser -LRB- Certificated Poisonmonger -RRB- -- Mr John Vernon .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 10]: Endeavora -LRB- A Well-Meaner -RRB- -- Miss Clemence Garnett .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 8]: The Greek Chorus -- Miss Hannah Vernon .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 9]: _ N.B. -- _ There is no Cabbage !
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 36]: Imagine the feelings of a solitary invalid on receipt of such a programme as the above -- a programme of an entertainment organised , composed , and designed wholly and solely for her own amusement !
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 42]: Lavender 's mumps were at a painful stage -- so sore , so stiff , so heavy , that she felt all face , had no spirit to read , craved for companionship , and yet shrank sensitively from observing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 35]: Let those jeer who may , it _ is _ an abominable thing to feel a martyr , and look a clown , and poor Lavender 's sensitive nature suffered acutely from the position .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 3]: Then oh !
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 47]: it was good to feel that to-morrow something exciting was going to happen -- that she would be amused , cheered , comforted ; that her dear companions would be near her , so near that once again she would feel one of the merry throng .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 6]: If only it were fine !
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 19]: Really and truly Lavender felt that she could not support the blow if it were _ wet _ .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 25]: Mumps seem to sap the constitution of moral force ; if she could not see the melodrama , she would weep like a child !
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 8]: It _ was _ fine , however .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 74]: The very elements conspired in her behalf , and produced a still , unshiny day , when the pageant of the melodrama appeared to the best advantage , and the voices rose clear and distinct to that upper window , before which Lavender stood , a muffled figure , in a fur coat and cap , and a great wool shawl swathed round face and neck after the fashion of an English veil .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 11]: The melodrama proved even more thrilling than had been expected .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 74]: On his , or her , first appearance on the scene , each character advanced to a spot directly in front of the upstairs window , and obligingly related the salient points of his life , character , and ambitions , together with a candid exposition of his intentions towards the other members of the cast ; the while Hannah , as Greek Chorus , interposed moral remarks and reflections on the same .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 57]: After an indulgent hearing of these confessions , it would appear that two ambitions were common to the actors -- either they wished to elope with the hero or heroine , or to poison the False Caitiff , and the Villainess Number One or Two , or such a contingent of these worthies as excluded themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 58]: The Well-Meaner assiduously endeavoured to foil these intents , and received the scant amount of encouragement which falls to well-meaning interference in real life ; the Certified Poisonmonger presided over three tin pails of liquids , labelled respectively , `` Lingering , '' `` Sudden , '' and `` A highly superior article in writhes and coils .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 95]: As patronised by the Empress of China '' and the demand for these wares was naturally brisk in so quarrelsome a company : the False Caitiff chose a sudden death for his rival , the Hero ; Meretricia , the first Villainess , poisoned the Caitiff by a more lingering means ; Villainess Number Two , under the false impression that the Hero had given his heart to Meretricia , poisoned that good lady , sparing no money on the deed , whereby Russell was afforded an admirable opportunity of exhibiting his wriggling powers .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 52]: The guileless maid poisoned herself with the dregs in her lover 's glass ; and the Poisonmonger , fatigued with the rush of Christmas business , fainted away , and , being revived by potions from his own pails , survived only long enough to administer a forcible dose in revenge .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 51]: The Well-Meaner 's fate differed from that of her companions in that she was insidiously poisoned by each actor in turn , so that , figuratively speaking , the curtain descended upon a row of corpses , in the midst of which the Greek Chorus intoned exemplary precepts and advice .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 38]: Hannah , as Greek chorus , was by common consent pronounced the star of the company , her interpolated reflections being so droll and to the point that even the lingering victims found themselves overcome with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 17]: As for the audience , her joy , though great , was not unmixed with pain .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 36]: As the melodrama approached its critical point the actors could see her at her window , holding up her mumps with either hand , and the piteous plea -- `` Do n't make me laugh !
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 7]: Do n't make me laugh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 7]: floated down on the wintry air .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 59]: Next day Lavender was worse , and melodramas were banned as a means of recreation ; but she sent a touching message of thanks to the troupe , in which she declared that `` the joy outweighed the pain , '' so that , all things considered , `` The Blue Cabbage '' was voted a great success .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 4]: DAN AND DARSIE .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 46]: No sooner did the news of Lavender 's illness , and Darsie 's consequent absence from home , reach the Percival household than three separate letters were dispatched , insisting that at least a part of the remaining holidays should be spent at the Manor .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 27]: Pray why , the girls demanded , should Hannah Vernon be allowed to engross Darsie , when she enjoyed her society practically the whole year round ?
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 8]: It was unjust , mean , contemptible .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 9]: They were so dull and sad this Christmas-time .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 5]: Would n't Darsie come ?
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 17]: Pray why , inquired Ralph ingenuously , did Darsie not come when she had the chance ?
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 11]: She knew that he would be glad to see her .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 6]: It was quite horribly dull .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 25]: The parents were absurdly humped -- Mrs Percival 's words were few but disturbing : `` I want to consult with you about Ralph .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 11]: You have more influence over him than any one else .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 12]: Do come , dear child , if you possibly can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 13]: In face of the last letter it was impossible to say no .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 27]: Darsie was not sure that she wanted to say no ; on the other hand , she was aggravatingly uncertain if she wanted to say yes .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 55]: At college and at home alike the atmosphere was at once austere and bracing ; it would be agreeable to live for a time in the lap of luxury -- to be regarded as a miracle of cleverness and beauty ; which treatment was invariably bestowed upon her during her visits to The Manor .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 45]: She would enjoy staying with the Percivals , but she would be sad to miss the cosy hours when Dan and his friend , Percy Lister , joined the little party in the old study , and they all talked together round the fire .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 10]: What talks they had ; what themes they discussed !
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 28]: What animated discussions sprang from a casual word , and were pursued with a go and a spirit which seem to exist only on such informal occasions .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 68]: Sometimes they laughed and quipped , and beheld everything from the comic point of view ; anon , a sudden spirit of earnestness would pass from one to the other , and as the fading light hid their faces from view , tongues were set free , so that they talked of the things which mattered , the towering realities which lay at the heart of life !
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 31]: During these discussions Dan invariably seated himself in the darkest corner , and Darsie , looking across , had again and again the impression of deep eyes staring -- staring !
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 44]: Vie Vernon considered the Percivals `` grasping creatures , '' and did n't care who knew it ; Hannah was placidly unconcerned ; Dan made no remark ; Percy Lister was leaving himself , and considered that things `` fitted in well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 17]: Altogether , in comparison with the enthusiasm of the invitation , the opposition was blightingly resigned .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 24]: Darsie tossed her head , packed her boxes , and prepared to depart a whole three days sooner than she had originally intended .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 33]: On the afternoon before her departure a party was made up for the rink , but at the last moment Darsie excused herself , and declared a wish to stay at home .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 32]: There were several pieces of sewing and mending which were necessary , there was a letter to be written to Margaret France , and a farewell ode to cheer poor Lavender .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 42]: A gas fire in her bedroom allowed her to perform these tasks in solitude , but as soon as they were satisfactorily accomplished she made her way downstairs to the study , prepared to enjoy an hour over an interesting book .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 46]: The gas was unlit , the usual large fire blazed in the grate ; an arm - chair was drawn up to the side , and within it sat Dan , head leaning on hand , in an attitude which spoke of weariness and dejection .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 19]: He raised his eyes and looked at her , and Darsie shut the door and came forward eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 3]: `` Dan !
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 5]: Back again so soon ?
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 5]: Is anything wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 6]: `` But you look strange .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 12]: You -- you did n't hurt yourself at the rink ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 7]: `` Quite , quite sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 4]: `` Quite . ''
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 18]: Darsie subsided on to her favourite seat -- the hearthrug -- with a little sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 6]: `` That 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 7]: You 're very monosyllabic , Dan .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 13]: Shall I disturb you if I sit here for a time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 5]: `` A hundred thanks !
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 7]: You are _ too _ gracious .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 8]: I can be quiet if you like .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 11]: I like staring into the fire and dreaming myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 5]: Dan did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 21]: Darsie peered at him , moving her little head from side to side so as to get the clearest view .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 17]: He looked very large -- a great shapeless mass of dark in the old red chair .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 28]: She liked the bigness of him , felt the old satisfaction at sight of the strong , rugged face , the old craving for confidence and approval .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 11]: Strange how different one felt in company with different people .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 30]: _ Tete - a-tete _ with Ralph Percival , Darsie felt a giant of strength and resource -- assured , self-confident , a bulwark against which others might lean .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 66]: With Dan , well , with Dan she was just a slip of a girl , conscious of nothing so much as her own weaknesses , mental and physical ; her difficult gropings , compared with his clear vision ; her tiny hands and wrists , compared with his big sinewy paw ; her slim form , compared to the bulk of the square-cut shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 36]: Never -- Darsie realised it with a smile -- never did she feel so humble and diffident as when in Dan 's society ; yet , strangely enough , the sensation was far from disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 4]: `` Dan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 4]: `` Darsie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 6]: `` Is anything the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 5]: Between you and me !
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 18]: You do n't happen to be snarkey , do you , about anything I 've done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 12]: `` Why should you think I am ` snarkey ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 8]: `` Because -- you _ are _ !
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 17]: You 're not a bit sociable and friendly -- even _ your _ sort of sociability .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 24]: I 'm a guest in your mother 's house if I 'm nothing else and it 's your duty to be civil . ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 13]: `` Have n't I always been civil to you , Darsie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 28]: Darsie drew a quick breath of impatience and , seizing upon the poker , beat at the unoffending coal as the best method of letting off steam .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 7]: `` You are so painfully literal .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 20]: I can _ feel _ what other people are thinking , however much they try to disguise it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 12]: `` How do _ I _ feel , for example ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 12]: Darsie turned her head and stared curiously into Dan 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 33]: The hand on which it leaned shielded it somewhat from view , but , even so , there was something in the intent gaze which filled her with a strange new discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 9]: She turned back to her poking once more .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 22]: `` I think -- there 's something that I do n't understand -- I think -- there 's something you disapprove !
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 33]: I 'm a very good girl , and I work very hard , and I 'm fond of my friends , and I expect them to be fond of me in return .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 13]: I do n't _ like _ you to disapprove , Dan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 9]: `` I ca n't help it , Darsie .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 21]: I 've hated that friendship from the beginning , and I hate it more with every month that passes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 7]: _ that _ old story . ''
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 27]: Darsie 's voice took a tone of impatience ; for it was annoying to find that Dan was harking back on the well-known subject of dispute .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 41]: `` Well , I 'm sorry to distress you , but I am conceited enough to believe that I have taken no harm from my friendship with Ralph Percival , and that he has reaped some little good from mine .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 22]: While that state of thing continues , I shall certainly refuse to give him up -- even to please you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 46]: There was silence for several moments , then Dan said slowly -- `` If I agreed with your conclusions , I should not try to persuade you , Darsie ; but I do not , and my opportunities of judging are better than yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 7]: `` You are unfair , Dan .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 20]: It is a pity to allow yourself to be so prejudiced that you ca n't give a fair judgment .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 21]: I should have imagined that even you would be forced to admit that Ralph had done better this term . ''
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 5]: Dan did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 32]: He turned his head and looked Darsie full in the eyes , and there was in his look a puzzled , questioning air , which she found it difficult to understand .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 28]: When he spoke again , it was not to reply in any direct way to her accusation , but to ask a question on his own account .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 15]: `` Darsie , do you mind telling me -- is your position entirely disinterested ?
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 27]: Do you look upon the fellow merely as a man to be helped , or do you care for him for his own personal sake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 3]: Darsie deliberated .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 33]: The firelight played on her downcast face , on the long white throat rising from the low collar of her white blouse , on the little hands clenched round the steel poker .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 23]: Before her mind 's eye arose the memory of handsome , melancholy eyes ; imagination conjured back the sound of impassioned appeals .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 11]: Her expression softened , her voice took a deeper note .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 8]: `` He needs me , Dan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 5]: That was her answer .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 10]: Dan nodded in silence , accepting it as sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 34]: He rose from his chair , and paced up and down the room , hands thrust deep into his trouser pockets , head held back with the characteristic forward tilt of the chin .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 17]: Darsie , watching him , thought involuntarily of a caged animal striving restlessly against the bars .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 18]: Her heart gave a little throb of relief when he spoke again in his own natural voice .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 6]: `` All right , Darsie .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 6]: Good luck to your efforts !
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 15]: I appreciate your intentions , and am only sorry that I ca n't agree .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 16]: According to my belief no one can help a man who refuses to help himself .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 16]: We 've got to fight our own battles , and to bear our own burdens !
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 30]: If some one steps forward and offers to undertake for us , we may imagine for a time that we are set free , but it 's a mistake !
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 26]: Sooner or later the time comes when we 're bound to fight it out alone , and it does n't get easier for being deferred .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 16]: Everything that is worth learning in life we have to worry out for ourselves ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 8]: Darsie drew a long , trembling sigh .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 22]: How puzzling life was , when the two people on whose judgment you most relied delivered themselves of directly opposing verdicts !
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 24]: Mrs Reeves believed that her help was all - important to Ralph 's progress ; Dan insisted that her efforts were in vain .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 4]: Was he right ?
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 4]: Was he wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 27]: Could she honestly assure herself that Ralph was stronger , more self-reliant , more able to stand alone without the stimulus of constant support and encouragement ?
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 21]: Instinctively Darsie 's hand went up to touch the little golden brooch which fastened the lace collar of her blouse .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 15]: If the anchor were withdrawn , would Ralph drift once more towards the rocks ?
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 5]: The answer was difficult .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 19]: She pondered it aloud , speaking in low , anxious tones , with lengthened pauses between the words .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 8]: `` We 're both right , Dan .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 13]: We 've both got hold of _ bits _ of the truth !
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 29]: In the end we must win through for ourselves , but surely , in preparation for the battle , we can give each other _ some _ help .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 12]: Some natures seem made to stand , and others to lean .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 23]: A prop is not of much account , but it may serve to keep a plant straight while it is gathering strength .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 25]: The big oaks need no props ; they are so strong that they ca n't understand ; they have no pity for weakness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 7]: Dan stopped short in his pacings .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 9]: `` That meant for me , Darsie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 3]: `` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 5]: Just as you please !
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 27]: Oaks are nice things -- big , and strong , and restful , but just a little bit inclined to grow -- _ gnarled _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 25]: Dan vouchsafed no reply , and Darsie sat , hands clasped round knees , staring into the fire for five long , silent minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 56]: She was hoping that Dan would never grow `` gnarled '' towards herself , longing for him to speak and promise that he would not , but he still remained silent , and presently the door burst open , the rinking party appeared on the threshold , and the opportunity for quiet conclave was over .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 5]: NEW YEAR 'S EVE .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 59]: Seated alone in the train , _ en route _ for her visit to the Percivals , Darsie had time to think in a more quiet and undisturbed fashion than had been possible in the past bustling days , and a disagreeable feeling of apprehension arose in her mind as she recalled the wording of the three invitations .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 24]: In each was present the same note of depression , the same hint of trouble in connection with the son of the house .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 10]: Could anything have happened of which she was unaware ?
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 35]: No letter from The Manor had reached her for some weeks past , but letters were proverbially scarce at Christmas-time , so that it would be foolish to argue ill from that fact alone .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 17]: Darsie braced herself physically and mentally , squared her shoulders , and resolutely dismissed gloomy thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 31]: Noreen and Ralph met her at the station , looking reassuringly cheerful and at ease a magnificent new motor stood in waiting outside , with a cart for the luggage .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 28]: Inside the beautiful old house the atmosphere was warmed by hot pipes , and scented with the fragrance of hothouse plants , banked together in every corner .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 29]: It was not the usual case of being warm and cosy inside a room , and miserably chilled every time one crossed a passage or ascended the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 39]: Mrs Percival and the girls were marvels of elegance in Parisian gowns , Ralph looked his handsomest in knickerbocker suit and gaiters , and the servants moved noiselessly to and fro , performing their tasks with machine-like accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 15]: Extraordinary how complete a change of scene may take place between lunch and tea !
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 10]: How swiftly a new atmosphere makes the old unreal !
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 51]: As Darsie sat drinking her tea in the old wainscoted hall , it seemed impossible to realise that such things as poverty and struggle were in existence ; even the shabby bustle and squeeze of her own dear home became incredible in the face of this spacious , well-ordered calm !
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 33]: Mrs Percival made no attempt at private conversation , and showed no trace of `` ulterior motive '' in manner or conversation , which was a huge relief to Darsie 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 40]: She was not in a mood for serious conversation ; what she wanted was the usual Percival offering of praise , admiration , and petting , and this was bestowed upon her with even more than the usual generosity .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 32]: The grey-whiskered old Squire kissed her on both cheeks ; the girls assured her that she was prettier than ever , and greeted her feeblest sallies with bursts of delighted laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 25]: Ralph gazed at her with adoring eyes ; it was all , as Darsie had been wont to remark , most grateful and comforting !
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 36]: The first evening passed pleasantly enough , though there was a noticeable effort on the part of each member of the family to keep the conversation from touching upon the subject of Ralph 's affairs .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 30]: Any reference to Cambridge was taboo , as Darsie swiftly discovered , but there were many points of interest left , which were both pleasant and amusing to discuss .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 36]: The next morning -- the last morning of the year -- broke fine and bright , and the view seen through the long windows of the dining-room was almost as beautiful as in summer itself .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 42]: The park showed the same stretch of velvet green , a belt of evergreens and tall Scotch firs filled up the far distance , while the leafless boughs of elms and beeches made a lace - like tracery against the sky .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 31]: To the right the old cedar stood calm and unmoved , as it had stood while generations of Percivals had lived , and loved , and sorrowed , and died .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 37]: When breakfast was over -- and breakfast in the country is a meal which pursues a calm and leisurely course -- the four young people strolled into the porch to discuss the programme for the day .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 14]: `` Darsie is nerving herself to look at the horses ' tails ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 4]: said Ida laughingly .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 38]: It was a Percival peculiarity , agreeable or irritating according to the mood of the hearer , that they never by any chance forgot a remark , but continually resurrected it in conversation for years to come .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 41]: Never a morning had Darsie spent at the Manor that she had not been reminded of scathing comments on the habit of daily visits to kennels and stables , as delivered by herself on the occasion of her first visit .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 28]: To-day , however , she had only time to grimace a reply , before Ida continued cheerfully -- `` You wo n't be asked , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 9]: We have something far more important on hand .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 37]: You have walked right into the jaws of the tenants ' annual New Year 's treat , and will have to tire your hands decorating all the morning , and your gums smiling all the evening .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 53]: It 's an all-day-and - night business , and we get home at cock-crow in a state of collapse -- '' `` It 's held in the village hall , '' Noreen took up the tale , slipping unconsciously into what Darsie called her `` squire 's - eldest-daughter - manner . ''
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 6]: `` Quite a nice building .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 10]: We make it look festive with wreaths and bunting .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 8]: They think so much of decorations ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 17]: -LRB- `` They '' in Percival parlance alluded to the various tenants on the estate . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 14]: `` We try to think of something novel each year as a surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 4]: They like surprises .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 14]: We 've arranged with half a dozen girls to be there to help .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 10]: Quite nice girls , daughters of the principal farmers .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 14]: You must be _ quite _ sweet to them , Darsie , please !
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 19]: It is our principal meeting of the year , and we make a point of being friendly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 6]: `` Must I really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 7]: Darsie assumed an expression of dejection .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 5]: `` What a disappointment !
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 14]: It 's so seldom I get an opportunity of being proud and grand .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 33]: What 's the good of staying at a Manor House , and driving down with ` the family , ' if I have to be meek and friendly like any one else ?
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 20]: Could n't you introduce me as the Lady Claire , and let me put on airs for a treat ?
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 22]: It would act as a contrast to your ` friendly ways , ' and make them all the more appreciated . ''
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 32]: The girls laughed as in duty bound , and declared that it _ would _ be sport , and wondered if they dared , but Ralph sharply called them to order .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 3]: `` Rot !
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 13]: As if everybody in this neighbourhood did n't know Darsie by heart !
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 11]: Put on your hats , and do n't talk rubbish .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 17]: It will take us all our time to get through with the hall before lunch . ''
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 33]: Town-bred Darsie privately hoped that the motor would appear to carry the helpers to the hall three miles away , but the Percivals themselves never seemed to dream of such a possibility .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 51]: In short skirts and thick boots they plodded cheerfully across boggy meadows and muddy lanes , climbed half a dozen stiles , and arrived at last in the High Street of the little village , close to the entrance of the unpretentious wooden building which called itself the Village Hall .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 26]: Darsie thought that she had never beheld an interior which seemed so thoroughly to need , and at the same time to defy , decoration !
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 52]: Whitewashed walls , well splashed by damp ; a double row of pegs all round the walls at a level of some five or six feet from the ground ; wooden forms , and a small square platform , made up a whole which was bare and ugly to a degree .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 42]: A group of five or six girls stood beside a pile of evergreens ; a youth in shirt-sleeves was in process of unpacking crumpled flags and flattened Japanese lanterns from an old tin box ; two ladders stood against the walls .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 29]: The entrance of `` the family '' was marked by a general movement among the little company , and Darsie watched the greetings which ensued with twinkling amusement .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 40]: Noreen and Ida were _ so _ pleasant , _ so _ full of gratitude for the presence of each individual helper , _ so _ anxious to be assured that they could _ really _ spare the time .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 38]: Ralph was so laboriously polite , while the girls themselves , pleasant , kindly , and well-educated , were either happily unaware of the thinly disguised patronage , or had the good manners to conceal their knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 14]: There was no doubt which side appeared to best advantage in the interview !
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 20]: `` The first thing we must do is to decide upon a scheme of decoration , '' Ida declared .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 6]: `` Darsie , suggest something !
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 15]: You have never done it before , so your ideas ought to be novel .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 14]: What can we do to make the hall look pretty and cheerful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 5]: `` Rebuild it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 26]: was Darsie 's instant and daring reply , whereat the farmers ' daughters laughed _ en masse _ , and the Percivals looked haughtily displeased .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 6]: `` Father built it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 6]: `` Awfully good of him !
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 8]: _ And _ wicked of his architect .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 11]: I sha n't employ him to build my house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 23]: `` I think , '' said Noreen loftily , `` that we had better confine ourselves to discovering the scheme of decoration .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 13]: It is too late to interfere with the structure of the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 20]: We generally make wreaths and fasten them to the gas brackets , and drape the platform with flags . ''
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 18]: `` Then we may take it as settled that we _ wo n't _ do that to-day .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 7]: What happens to the pegs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 28]: `` They hang their things on them , of course -- hats , and coats , and mufflers -- '' `` That _ must _ be decorative !
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 43]: How would it be to make them leave their wrappings at the entrance to-night , or put them under their own chairs , and to arrange a broad band of holly round the room so as to hide the pegs from view ?
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 23]: It would be so easy to tie on the branches , and it would have quite a fine frieze effect . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 10]: ` Mrs Dick , you are invaluable ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 4]: quoted Ralph gaily .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 7]: `` It 's a ripping idea .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 13]: Let 's set to at once , and try the effect . ''
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 49]: No sooner said than done ; the little band of workers spread themselves over the room , and began the task of trying prickly holly branches to the line of pegs in such fashion as to form a band about two feet deep , entirely round the room .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 32]: Berries being unusually plentiful that year , the effect was all the more cheery , and with the disappearance of the utilitarian pegs the hall at once assumed an improved aspect .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 34]: A second committee meeting hit on the happy idea of transforming the platform into a miniature bower , by means of green baize and miniature fir-trees , plentifully sprinkled with glittering white powder .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 8]: The flags were relegated to the entrance-hall .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 45]: The Japanese lanterns , instead of hanging on strings , were so grouped as to form a wonderfully lifelike pagoda in a corner of the hall , where -- if mischievously disposed -- they might burn at their ease without endangering life or property .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 23]: The ironwork of the gas-brackets was tightly swathed with red paper , and the bare jets fitted with paper shades to match .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 78]: From an artistic point of view Darsie strongly opposed the hanging of the timeworn mottoes , `` A Hearty Welcome to All , '' `` A Happy New Year , '' and the like , but the Squire 's daughters insisted that they liked to see them , and the farmers ' daughters confirming this theory , up they went , above the evergreen frieze , the white cotton letters standing out conspicuously from their turkey-red background .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 28]: It was one o'clock before the work was finished , and a tired and distinctly grubby quartette started out on their three-mile return walk across the fields .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 8]: Certainly country-bred folk were regardless of fatigue !
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 14]: `` If I owned a motor I should _ use _ it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 47]: Darsie said to herself with a distinct air of grievance as she climbed to her own room after lunch , and laid herself wearily on her couch , the while the Percival trio trotted gaily forth for `` just a round '' over their private golf-links .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 30]: The evening programme was to begin with a concert , alternate items of which were to be given by the villagers and members of the surrounding `` families . ''
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 62]: At ten o'clock refreshments were to be served , in adjoining classrooms , and during the progress of the informal supper chairs and forms were to be lifted away , and the room cleared for an informal dance , to be concluded by a general joining of hands and singing of `` Auld Lang Syne '' as the clock struck twelve .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 17]: The Percival ladies and their guests from the surrounding houses made elaborate toilettes for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 72]: The villagers were resplendent in Sunday blacks , `` best frocks '' and bead chains , the small girls and boys appearing respectively in white muslins and velveteen Lord Fauntleroy suits ; the Squire opened proceedings with expressions of good wishes , interspersed with nervous coughs , and Noreen and Ida led off the musical proceedings with a lengthy classical duet , to which the audience listened with politely concealed boredom .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 45]: To Darsie 's mind , the entire programme as supplied by `` the families '' was dull to extinction , but to one possessing even her own slight knowledge of the village , the contributions of its worthies were brimful of interest and surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 164]: The red-faced butcher , who , on ordinary occasions , appeared to have no mind above chops and steaks , was discovered to possess a tenor voice infinitely superior in tone to that of his patron , the Hon. Ivor Bruce , while his wife achieved a tricky accompaniment with a minimum of mistakes ; the sandy-haired assistant at the grocer 's shop supplied a flute obbligato , and the fishmonger and the young lady from the stationer 's repository assured each other ardently that their true loves owned their hearts ; two school-children with corkscrew curls held a heated argument -- in rhyme -- on the benefits of temperance ; and , most surprising and thrilling of all , Mr Jevons , the butler from The Manor , so far descended from his pedestal as to volunteer `` a comic item '' in the shape of a recitation , bearing chiefly , it would appear , on the execution of a pig .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 38]: The last remnant of stiffness vanished before this inspiring theme , and the audience roared applause as one man , whereupon Mr Jevons bashfully hid his face , and skipped -- literally skipped -- from the platform .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 7]: `` Who 'd have thought it !
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 9]: Butlers are human beings , after all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 11]: gasped Darsie , wiping tears of merriment from her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 13]: `` Ralph , do you suppose Jevons will dance with me to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 8]: I _ should _ be proud ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 14]: He has one square dance with the mater , and that finishes it .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 7]: You must dance with me instead .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 15]: It 's ages since we 've had a hop together -- or a talk .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 45]: I 'm longing to have a talk , but I do n't want the others to see us at it , or they 'd think I was priming you in my own defence , and the mater wants to have the first innings herself .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 32]: We 'll manage it somehow in the interval between the dances , and I know you 'll turn out trumps , as usual , Darsie , and take my part . ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 14]: Ralph spoke with cheerful confidence , and Darsie listened with a sinking heart .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 25]: The merry interlude of supper was robbed of its zest , as she cudgelled her brains to imagine what she was about to hear .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 21]: Ralph was evidently in trouble of some sort , and his parents for once inclined to take a serious stand .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 30]: Yet anything more gay and debonair than the manner with which the culprit handed round refreshments and waited on his father 's guests it would be impossible to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 16]: Darsie watched him across the room , and noted that wherever he passed faces brightened .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 58]: As he cracked jokes with the apple-cheeked farmers , waited assiduously on their buxom wives , and made pretty speeches to the girls , no onlooker could fail to be conscious of the fact that , in the estimation of the tenants , `` Master Ralph '' was as a young prince who could do no wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 17]: For reasons of his own , Ralph was tonight bent on ingratiating himself to the full .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 37]: For the first half-hour of the dance he led out one village belle after another , and it was not until waltz number five had appeared on the board that he returned to Darsie 's side .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 10]: `` At last I 've a moment to myself !
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 16]: My last partner weighed a ton , at least , and I 'm fagged out .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 16]: Got a scarf you can put round you if we go and sit out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 32]: Darsie nodded , showing a wisp of gauze , and , laying her hand on Ralph 's arm , passed with him out of the main room into the flag-decked entrance .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 22]: For the moment it was empty , the dancers having made _ en masse _ in the direction of the refreshment-tables .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 38]: Ralph looked quickly from side to side , and , finding himself unobserved , took a key from his pocket and opened a small door leading into the patch of garden at the back of the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 14]: The moonlight showed a wooden bench fitted into a recess in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 15]: Ralph flicked a handkerchief over its surface , and motioned Darsie towards a seat .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 6]: `` It 's clean enough .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 8]: I gave it a rub this morning .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 7]: You wo n't be cold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 10]: `` Oh , no ; not a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 33]: Darsie wrapped the wisp of gauze round her shoulders , and prepared to risk pneumonia with as little thought as ninety-nine girls out of a hundred would do in a similar case .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 34]: The hour had come when she was to be told the nature of Ralph 's trouble ; she would not dream of losing the opportunity for so slight a consideration as a chill !
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 27]: Ralph seated himself by her side , rested an elbow on his knees , the thumb and first finger of the uplifted hand supporting his chin .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 10]: His eyes searched Darsie 's face with anxious scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 14]: `` You did n't hear anything about me before you left Newnham ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 4]: `` Hear what ?
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 7]: What was there to hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 13]: Ralph averted his eyes , and looked across the patch of garden .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 15]: The moonlight shining on his face gave it an appearance of pallor and strain .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 7]: `` Dan Vernon said nothing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 26]: Darsie recalled Dan 's keen glance of scrutiny , the silence which had greeted her own remarks , and realised the reason which lay behind .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 12]: `` Dan is not the sort to repeat disagreeable gossip . ''
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 18]: `` It 's not gossip this time ; worse luck , it 's solid , abominable fact .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 7]: You 'll be disappointed , Darsie .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 4]: I 'm sorry !
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 6]: I _ have _ tried .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 10]: Beastly bad luck being caught just at the end .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 7]: I was sent down , Darsie !
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 20]: It was just at the end of the term , so they sent me down for the last week .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 15]: A week is neither here nor there , but the parents took it hard .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 10]: I 'm afraid you , too -- '' Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 7]: Darsie `` took it hard . ''
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 27]: One look at her face proved as much , and among many contending feelings , disappointment was predominant -- bitter , intense , most humiliating disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 5]: `` Oh , Ralph !
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 3]: What for ?
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 16]: I hoped , I thought -- you _ promised _ me to be careful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 8]: `` And so I was , Darsie !
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 8]: Give you my word , I was .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 17]: For the first half of the term I never got anything worse than three penny fines .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 12]: It is n't a deadly thing to stay out after ten .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 15]: And I was so jolly careful -- never was so careful in my life .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 15]: But just the night when it was most important I must needs be caught .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 16]: You ca n't expect a fellow to get away from a big evening before twelve .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 24]: But that 's what it ended in -- a big jaw , throwing up all my past misdeeds , and being sent down .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 7]: Now you can slang away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 10]: But Darsie made no attempt to `` slang . ''
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 14]: With every word that had been uttered her feelings of helplessness had increased .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 22]: Ralph had apparently made little difference in his ways ; he had only been more careful not to be found out !
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 29]: At the very moment when she had been congratulating herself , and boasting of the good results of her friendship , this crowning disgrace had fallen upon him .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 22]: No wonder Dan had been silent ; no wonder that he had looked upon her with that long , questioning gaze !
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 27]: The thought of Dan was singularly comforting at this moment -- strong , silent , loyal Dan , going forth valiantly to the battle of life .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 23]: Darsie 's little face took on a pinched look ; she shivered , and drew the thin scarf more tightly round her .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 33]: Her silence , the suffering written on her face , hit Ralph more hardly than any anger ; for the first time something deeper than embarrassment showed itself in face and voice .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 10]: `` For pity 's sake , Darsie , speak !
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 3]: Say something !
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 12]: Do n't sit there and look at me like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 12]: `` But , Ralph , what is there to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 11]: Darsie threw out her arms with a gesture of hopelessness .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 15]: `` I 've talked so often , been so eloquent , believed so much !
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 13]: If this is the outcome , what more can be said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 7]: `` I _ have _ tried !
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 10]: I _ did _ want to please you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 7]: `` By not being found out !
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 18]: It 's not much comfort , Ralph , to feel that I 've encouraged you in deception .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 21]: And all those nights when you stayed out late , were you betting as usual -- getting into debt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 3]: Ralph frowned .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 14]: `` I 've been beastly unlucky , never knew such a persistent run .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 9]: That 's the dickens of it , Darsie .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 23]: I have n't dared to tell the Governor yet , but I positively must get hold of the money before the tenth .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 9]: I 'm bound to pay up by then .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 8]: It 's a debt of honour . ''
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 9]: Darsie 's red lip curled over that word .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 14]: She sat stiff and straight in her seat , not deigning a reply .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 25]: Ralph appeared to struggle with himself for several moments , before he said urgently -- `` The mater is going to talk to you .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 14]: She knows that you have more influence with me than any one else .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 22]: It 's true , Darsie , whatever you may think -- I should have drifted a lot deeper but for you .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 11]: When she does , do your best for a fellow !
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 14]: They 'll be down on me for not having told about this debt .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 26]: The Governor asked if there was anything else , but upon my word I had n't the courage to own up at that moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 6]: Still Darsie did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 60]: She was wondering drearily what she could find to say when the dreaded interview came about ; shrinking from the thought of adding to the mother 's pain , feeling a paralysing sense of defeat ; yet , at this very moment of humiliation , a ray of light illumined the darkness and showed the reason of her failure .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 4]: Dan was right !
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 19]: no one could truly help a man without first implanting in his heart the wish to help himself !
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 39]: She had been content to bribe Ralph , as a spoiled child is bribed to be good ; had felt a glow of gratified vanity in the knowledge that her own favour was the prize to be won .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 20]: If the foundations of her buildings were unstable , what wonder that the edifice had fallen to the ground ?
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 30]: The thought softened her heart towards the handsome culprit by her side , and when she spoke at last it was in blame of herself rather than of him .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 9]: `` I 'm sorry , too , Ralph .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 7]: I might have helped you better .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 9]: I rushed in where angels fear to tread .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 7]: I gave you a wrong motive .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 37]: It should have been more than a question of pleasing me -- more even than pleasing your parents ... Oh , Ralph , dear , you know -- you know there is something higher than that !
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 9]: -- Is religion nothing to you , Ralph ?
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 18]: Do n't you feel that in wasting your life you are offending against God -- against Christ !
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 14]: Ca n't you try again with _ that _ motive to help you ?
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 23]: -- I ca n't make light of things to your people , but I can take part of the blame on myself .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 34]: If it is true that I have any influence over you , I have thrown it away ... '' Ralph laid his hand over the gloved fingers clasped together on Darsie 's knee .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 6]: `` Do n't say that !
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 7]: Do n't think that , Darsie .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 23]: I may be a rotter , but I 'd have been a hundred times worse if it had n't been for you .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 15]: And do n't exaggerate the position : it 's a pity to do that .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 9]: Every man is n't born a Dan Vernon .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 13]: Most fellows only reach that stage of sobriety when they are middle-aged .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 21]: It would be a pretty dull world if no one kicked over the traces now and then in their youth .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 8]: What have I done , after all ?
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 25]: Slacked my work , helped myself to a bit more play and come down on the Governor for an extra cheque now and again .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 49]: Lots of fellows come a worse cropper than that -- '' Darsie wondered if a `` worse cropper '' might not possibly be a less serious ill than persistent slacking and irresponsibility ; but now that the bad news was out , Ralph was fast regaining his composure .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 15]: `` I 'll turn out all right yet , Darsie , you 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 5]: The tenants like me .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 14]: I 'll settle down and make a first-rate squire when my time comes .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 16]: And I 'll make up to you then for all this worry and bother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 43]: For a moment his voice was significantly tender , then the recollection of his present difficulty swept over him once more , and he added hastily : `` You 'll -- you 'll break it to the mater , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 7]: About that money , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 27]: She 'll take it best from you -- '' Darsie rose from her seat , and stood before him , tall and white in the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 4]: she said clearly .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 5]: `` I will not .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 7]: You must make your own confession .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 13]: Things have been made easy for you all your life , Ralph .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 8]: Now you must fight for yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 37]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Ralph bore no malice ; even his momentary irritation at finding himself , as he considered , `` left in the lurch , '' lasted but a few moments after his return to the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 11]: Darsie would rather have had it last a little longer .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 30]: To see an unclouded face , to catch the echo of merry laughter within ten minutes of a humiliating confession , seemed but another instance of instability of character .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 62]: It seemed literally impossible for Ralph to feel deeply on any subject for more than a few moments at a time ; nevertheless , such was the charm of his personality that she felt both pleased and flattered when twelve o'clock approached and he came smilingly forward to lead her to her place in the great ring encircling the whole room .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 40]: `` I must have you and mother -- one on either side , '' he said , and as they crossed the floor together Darsie was conscious that every eye in the room followed them with a smiling significance .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 26]: The young Squire , and the pretty young lady who was his sister 's friend -- a nice pair they made , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 31]: Every brain was busy with dreams of the future , weaving romantic plans , seeing in imagination other scenes like the present , with Darsie in the place of hostess .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 35]: She knew it , divined instinctively that Ralph knew it too , felt the recognition of it in the grip of Noreen 's hand , in the tender pathos of Mrs Percival 's smile .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 19]: And once again Darsie wondered , and doubted , and feared and felt the weight of invisible chains .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 36]: There are moments , however , when doubts and fears are apt to be swept away in a rush of overwhelming emotions , and one of those is surely the beginning of a new year .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 31]: To be young and pretty ; to be by general acceptance the queen of the evening -- no normal girl could help being carried away by such circumstances as these !
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 47]: When the last chime of the twelve rang slowly out , and the audience with one accord burst into the strains of `` Auld Lang Syne , '' Darsie 's eyes shone with excitement , and she returned with unction the pressure of Ralph 's fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 21]: `` Then here 's a hand , my trusty friend , And gie 's a hand o ' thine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 60]: The volume of sound swelled and sank , here and there a voice took a husky tone ; here and there an eye grew dim , but these belonged as a rule to the patriarchs among the guests , for whom the past was full of tender memories , for whom but a few more New Years could dawn .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 17]: Perhaps this might be the last , the very last , they would live to see .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 27]: The young folks shed no tears ; they were not unconscious of the prevailing emotion , but with them it found vent in a tingling expectation .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 4]: Life lay ahead .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 5]: Life was to come .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 5]: What would life bring ?
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 33]: When the song ceased , and the linked circle broke up into separate groups , Darsie , glancing up into Ralph 's face , was surprised to see it white and tense .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 28]: She smiled , half amused , half sad , bracing herself to hear some emotional protest or vow for the future ; but Ralph spake no word .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 33]: Instead , he led her to a seat , bowed formally before her , and , still with that white , fixed look , marched straight across the room to his father .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 29]: Darsie 's pulse quickened , her little teeth clenched on her lower lip , she pressed her hands against her knee the while she watched the eloquent scene .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 45]: Father and son faced each other ; handsome man , handsome youth , strangely alike despite the quarter of a century between their respective ages ; the Squire 's face , at first all genial welcome and unconcern , showing rapidly a pained gravity .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 33]: Ralph was speaking rapidly , with an occasional eloquent gesture of the arm , obviously recounting some facts of pressing importance to himself and his hearer , as obviously pleading a cause .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 15]: With a thrill of excitement Darsie leaped to the true explanation of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 34]: Fresh from the singing of the New Year song , Ralph had not paused to consider conventions , but then and there had hastened to make his confession in his father 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 3]: `` Governor !
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 4]: I 'm sorry !
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 11]: I was a coward , and would n't own up .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 14]: I 've been playing the fool again , and have lost more money .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 21]: I owe over fifty pounds , and it has to be paid up by the tenth of this month . ''
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 10]: The Squire looked his son full in the face .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 15]: `` Is that all the truth , Ralph , or only a part ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 4]: he asked quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 16]: `` Let me hear the whole please , now that we are about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 8]: `` That is the whole , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 9]: There 's nothing more to be told . ''
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 17]: `` The money shall be paid , but you must do something for me in return .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 6]: We ca n't talk here .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 10]: Come to my study when we get home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 31]: The Squire laid his hand on his son 's shoulder with a momentary pressure as he turned aside to attend to his guests , but Ralph lopped crestfallen and discomfited .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 36]: It was one thing to blurt out a disagreeable confession on the impulse of a moment , and another and very different one to discuss it in cold blood in the privacy of a study .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 9]: In the middle of the night , too !
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 6]: Ralph shivered at the thought .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 16]: Why on earth could n't the Governor be sensible , and wait till next morning ?
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 18]: The money would be paid -- that was the main point -- all the rest could wait .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 4]: AT THE ORCHARD .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 43]: Ralph Percival spent a long hour alone with his father in the chill dawn of that New Year 's morn , and during its passing heard more stern home - truths than he had ever before listened to from those indulgent lips .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 45]: The Squire had not insisted on any arduous work on his son 's part : in his heart he shared Ralph 's theory that a man whose life is to be spent looking after his own land has no need of much scholarly lore .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 40]: He must be straight and manly , intelligent enough to understand and move with the movements of the day , but not so intelligent as to grow discontented with a circle of admirable , but somewhat humdrum , neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 35]: He must be possessed of courteous and agreeable manners , able on occasion to take the chair at a meeting , possibly even on a Bench , with credit to himself and his family .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 32]: A ` Varsity education was obviously the best means of developing such qualities , but who was going to bother his head as to the question of honours or no honours ?
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 22]: There was no reason why the boy should slave as if he had his living to make by sheer brain effort .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 66]: The Squire was prepared to show the utmost leniency towards Ralph 's scholastic efforts , but that he should have persistently broken the rules , ignored warnings , incurred gambling debts , and , crowning indignity of all , that he should have been sent down , even for the last week of the term -- that stabbed the honest old countryman to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 37]: He said very little on the subject of his own feelings ; such men are not given to talk of themselves , but the tone of his voice was eloquent , and Ralph winced before it .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 36]: It was a new experience for the spoilt son and heir to hear any accents but those of love and appreciation from a member of his own family , and the experience was unexpectedly bitter .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 21]: Who could have believed that the Governor would cut up so rough -- could deliver himself of such sledge-hammer judgments ?
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 50]: The card debts would be paid , there was no question of that -- every debt should be paid -- and Ralph should return to college with a clean sheet so far as money was concerned , and with his handsome allowance undiminished -- _ for the present _ .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 11]: He himself must decide what would happen in the future .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 45]: The Squire asked for no promises ; he had had experience of the uselessness of promises -LRB- the listener winced again at the significance of those words -RRB- ; but Ralph must understand that any debts would be subtracted from his own future allowance .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 16]: He must also understand that he was expected to take his pass the following May .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 18]: There had been too much shirking and running loose -- now he must work for a change .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 25]: For his parents ' sake , his sisters ' sake , he must make amends for the pain and shame of the last weeks .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 37]: It was a painful scene for both father and son , but the charm of manner which was the great secret of Ralph 's popularity did not forsake him , even in this hour of humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 31]: He made an ideal penitent -- abashed , yet manly , subdued and silenced , yet when the right moment came ready with a few apt , quietly spoken words .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 6]: `` Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 5]: You are always generous .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 8]: I 've made a beastly poor return .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 13]: I hope this year may end better than it has begun . ''
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 3]: Poor Ralph !
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 15]: How little he guessed at that moment all that the year held in store !
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 20]: How little the father dreamed of the altered conditions with which he would face another New Year 's Day !
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 35]: But so long as they both lived it was good to remember that the interview had ended peacefully and with a renewed sense of harmony , with a firm hand-grip and an affectionate glance .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 38]: Ralph took his candle from a table in the hall and made his way quietly up the oak staircase , and his father stood below and watched him go , while his heart waxed tender within him .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 7]: His son -- his only son !
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 11]: He would give his heart 's blood for the lad .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 17]: Had he been just , wise , prudent , in the words which he had said ?
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 6]: Had he been stern enough ?
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 4]: -- too stern ?
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 20]: He was in a thousand minds about his own conduct , but in only one as regards Ralph 's .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 10]: The boy had taken his dressing like a man .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 38]: How handsome he had looked as he stood to listen , not flinching or hanging his head as an ordinary culprit would have done , but drawn to his full height , with straight , fearless gaze .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 16]: With what a frank air he had held out his hand for that farewell grasp !
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 4]: Bless the boy !
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 8]: his heart was in the right place .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 12]: He would settle down , and make a fine man yet .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 2]: Patience !
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 2]: Patience !
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 49]: And so when the family met again for a late breakfast that New Year 's morning there was no shadow visible on the horizon , and throughout the remainder of Darsie 's visit every day seemed given up to enjoyment , and brought with it some fresh festivity .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 60]: Contrary to her expectation , the subject of Ralph 's troubles was avoided rather than sought , and it was only on the eve of her departure to Newnham that mother and sisters broke the silence to urge in each case the same request -- `` See as much of Ralph as you can during these next six months !
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 10]: Have a little talk with Ralph now and again !
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 7]: Show an interest in his work .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 7]: Let him see that you care .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 13]: We must all do our best to encourage him to work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 47]: By all the members of the family it was taken for granted that Darsie 's interest in Ralph 's future was equal to , if not greater than , their own ; they made no secret of their belief that her influence had the more weight .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 28]: If Darsie had known a passing temptation to abandon her efforts , it would have been impossible to do so in the face of such unanimous appeals .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 51]: Well , it was good to be back in Newnham once more , to get to work again after the lazy weeks , to wake up one 's brains with tussles over Anglo - Saxon texts , to wrestle with philology , instead of browsing over novels and magazine tales .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 59]: The Divinity Schools were stuffy as ever , the men on one side shutting up the windows with their usual persistence , while the girls on theirs frowned and fumed ; but the Chaucer lectures were full of interest , and coaching assumed a keener interest as spring advanced and the prospect of `` Mays '' drew near .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 26]: Last year both Darsie and Hannah had gained second-class honours ; this year they had determined to gain firsts , or perish in the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 25]: With a second and a first record for Mays there was a possibility -- a dazzling possibility -- of firsts in the final Tripos .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 25]: When one thought of that it seemed impossible to work too hard , to put _ too _ much energy into one 's studies .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 22]: But the happy blending of work and play which characterises Newnham life prevented industry from being carried to an exaggerated extent .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 39]: The hour 's informal dancing after dinner on Wednesday and Saturday evenings seemed to quicken circulation and brain alike , and the great Shakespeare Ball was a distinct fillip , although -- or was it _ because _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 11]: -- it involved some slackness for the preparation of costumes .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 5]: The short Easter vac .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 22]: served but as a breathing-space , and then another May term began with an unparalleled succession of fine and sunny days .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 50]: Everything seemed early this spring ; trees and shrubs rushed into leaf , a wealth of blossom gave a fairy-like beauty to the old-world gardens , and in every youth and maid the spirit of the spring awoke also , and called to them to come out to play .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 43]: This was the season for picnics , for walks along the fields by the riverside , for boating , for bathing , for garden teas , for breakfast parties at the Orchard , amidst the pink and white wonder of the apple-blossom .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 64]: Darsie Garnett was fired with a desire to give an Orchard party on her own account , the guests to be Hannah , Margaret France , her special Fresher adorer -LRB- Marian White by name -RRB- , Ralph Percival , Dan Vernon , two agreeable Classics from King 's ; Mrs Reeves to play chaperon -- just a cheery little party of nine .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 7]: What could you wish for more ?
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 17]: Margaret , preternaturally solemn , opined that _ ten _ would be a more desirable number .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 5]: `` Poor Mrs Reeves !
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 7]: What has _ she _ done ?
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 13]: Why not ask some one to play about with _ her _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 18]: I ca n't bear to see a Lonely at a picnic or to be interrupted myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 12]: `` It _ might _ be judicious to invite Minerva ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 21]: agreed Darsie , twinkling , and alluding to the Don who enjoyed the privilege of Mrs Reeves 's special friendship .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 4]: `` Two chaperons !
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 13]: What a character for propriety I shall gain , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 5]: They little know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 14]: `` They know perfectly well , but they are human creatures after all .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 12]: They 've been young themselves , and they enjoy the Orchard !
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 15]: Set to work at once , my dear , and get out your invitations .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 21]: This weather ca n't possibly last , and it 's going to break my heart if it is wet . ''
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 36]: But there was no sign of rain on that exquisite morning when at the striking of six o'clock Darsie leaped out of bed , and thrust her ruffled golden head out of the opened window .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 31]: A few feathery white clouds served but to intensify the blueness of the sky ; the air was soft and sweet , the garden beneath was already bathed in sunlight .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 8]: Darsie gave a little caper of delight .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 42]: Sunshine , a picnic , a pretty frock and hat waiting to be worn , and one 's very best friends to admire the result -- what healthy girl of twenty could fail to be happy under such circumstances as these ?
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 27]: She sang as she dressed ; she made little fancy steps , and three separate pirouettes which would have delighted the heart of a terpsichorean mistress .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 48]: One pirouette greeted the effect of the white dress ; the second , that of the wide straw hat , with its appropriate garland of blossom ; the third was partly in celebration of the combined effect , and partly out of sheer inability to keep still .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 52]: Her toilette completed , Darsie repaired to Hannah 's room and surprised that tasteless young woman engaged in putting the final touches to her own costume , in the shape of an abomination designated `` a neck arrangement , '' composed of the cheapest of machine lace and papery satin ribbon .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 21]: Hannah jumped with dismay as a hand descended suddenly over her shoulder , and tore this treasure from her grasp .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 4]: cried Darsie firmly .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 33]: `` You are my childhood 's friend , and I love you dearly , but wear lace frills with a linen collar at my Orchard party you -- _ shall not _ !
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 3]: Miserable woman !
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 9]: Will you never learn how to dress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 14]: `` I paid eleven-three for it , near the end of a term .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 10]: Thought I _ would _ please you this time !
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 6]: Hate the tickling stuff myself .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 26]: Some people are never satisfied , '' grumbled Hannah , rummaging in her tie-box , but it never occurred to her to dispute the decree .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 10]: On questions of toilette Darsie 's word was absolute .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 42]: The two girls descended the stairs together , and found the other three members of the party awaiting them at the door , Margaret and the little Fresher abeam with smiles , and even Minerva herself looking quite young and skittish .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 26]: At moments like these it dawned upon the student mind that even a don herself could occasionally enjoy a mixture of play with her work .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 54]: At the river Mrs Reeves and the four men came forward to meet the Newnham party , the canaders were ranged ready for the embarkment , and Darsie felt the honours of her position press heavily , as the other members of the party stood silently waiting for her to apportion the crews .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 17]: The worst of it was that one felt obliged to take the least desirable place oneself .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 26]: Considered as a don , Minerva had many points , but when bound for a river picnic one did not exactly hanker after her society .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 6]: Still , there it was .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 6]: Every position has its drawbacks .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 46]: The row up the river on that exquisite morning was a joy independent of society , and when the Orchard itself was reached it was undeniably agreeable to sit at the head of the table , and play the gracious hostess to one 's guests .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 17]: Orchard appetites are proverbial , but this particular party claimed to have broken all previous records .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 13]: Soon there was hardly a fragment of food left on a plate .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 54]: The pile of banana-skins was positively startling to behold ; tea and coffee pots were drained , and drained again ; requests for milk and more milk threatened the supply of later guests , and the birds in the trees overhead chattered not a whit more gaily than the company around the board .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 39]: `` Shop '' was sternly forbidden as a subject of conversation , and the remotest reference thereto was instantly booed into silence , for behind all the lightsomeness of demeanour a weight of anxiety lay on each heart .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 20]: The critical time was approaching when the result of the year 's work would be put to the test .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 26]: The two classics , as sons of a poor clergyman , were acutely conscious of all that was involved by a first or second class .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 72]: Ralph Percival was realising painfully the difficulty of making up for years of slacking , or even of keeping up a spurt beyond a few days at a time ; the little Fresher trembled at the thought of her first Mays ; even Margaret France herself showed signs of nerves before the ordeal of the Tripos , and on one tragic occasion had even been discovered weeping hysterically upon her bed .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 59]: `` C-c-couldn ' t remember a context , '' was her hiccoughing explanation of the breakdown , and henceforth Darsie had taken her in hand , fagged for her , petted her , scolded her , put her to bed , and ruthlessly carried off notebooks to her own study , to frustrate disastrous attempts at midnight toil .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 11]: As for Dan , he was a giant among pigmies .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 12]: Examinations had no terrors for him ; his place was assured .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 30]: When strangers visited Cambridge , their sons and brothers pointed out his big , lumbering form in the streets , and bade them remember Vernon -- Vernon would arrive !
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 22]: Darsie was conscious that his presence lent distinction to her party , for Dan but seldom appeared in the social world .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 9]: And he was behaving so well , too !
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 24]: taking part in the conversation , even telling stories and capping anecdotes of his own accord , and behaving quite amiably to Ralph .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 25]: Darsie beamed approval on him from the end of the table , and deliberately singled him out as her companion for the after-breakfast stroll .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 9]: `` Come down to the river , Dan !
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 25]: There 's a tree with the most convenient forked branch where one can sit hidden by the leaves and watch the canaders come up .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 12]: Last year I heard some quite thrilling fragments of conversation . ''
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 64]: `` I 'll be wary of that tree , '' said Dan solemnly , but he helped Darsie to her eyrie , and swung himself up beside her with an alacrity which showed that the suggestion fell in well with his own wishes , and there they sat like birds in a nest , smiling at each other with bright , friendly glances .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 6]: `` Is n't this fine ?
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 9]: No one saw us come , did they ?
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 7]: They 'll think we 're lost .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 7]: I 'm tired of being polite .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 17]: Thank you for coming to my party , Dan , and for being so jolly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 14]: `` Thank you for asking me and for looking so -- ripping ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 13]: Dan cast an appreciative glance at the white dress and blossom-wreathed hat .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 16]: `` Glad to see you 're not knocking yourself up with too much work . ''
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 9]: Darsie bent her head with a dubious air .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 22]: She wished to look well , but , on the other hand , a little sympathy would not have been unwelcome .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 18]: `` I 'm excited this morning , and that gives me a colour , '' she explained .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 23]: `` If you could see me at the end of the day -- I 'm so weak in my mediaeval French Grammar .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 11]: It haunts me at night -- '' `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 4]: cried Dan warningly .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 22]: `` Do n't let it haunt you here , at any rate -- it would be a crime among this blossom .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 15]: Tell me a story as you used to do in the old schoolroom days .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 33]: I have n't heard you tell a story since that Christmas night when we all sat round the fire and burnt fir - cones , and the light shone on your face .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 7]: You wore a white dress then .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 8]: You looked _ all _ white . ''
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 22]: `` And you sat in the corner and glowered -- I could see nothing , but I _ felt _ eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 31]: That will be one of the times we shall remember , Dan , when we look back on our young days -- all together , and so happy and free .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 38]: I had a melancholy turn during that cone-burning , one of the shadows that fall upon one causelessly in the midst of the sunshine , but that was only a bit of the happiness , after all .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 20]: It 's rather wonderful to be twenty , Dan , and never to have known a real big sorrow !
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 17]: Most of the girls here have come through something , some of them a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 8]: I feel such a babe beside them .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 19]: It is n't good for one , I suppose , to have things _ too _ smooth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 14]: `` I hope they 'll continue smooth for a long time to come .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 14]: You 're too young for troubles , Darsie , '' said Dan hastily .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 26]: He sat silent for a few moments , his chin poking forward , his thin , expressive lips twitching as if struggling with difficult speech .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 27]: A canader came gliding slowly by , the man and girl occupants chatting gaily together , unconscious of the watchers in the tree on the bank .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 19]: Their words fell absently on Darsie 's ear , she was waiting for what Dan had to say .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 16]: `` When they _ do _ come , you know you can depend on me .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 51]: I 'm not much of a hand at social life , so it 's best to keep out of the way and let other fellows chip in who can make a better show , but if there 's anything useful to be done , you might give me a turn .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 7]: We 're very old friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 7]: Darsie gave him an affectionate glance .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 5]: `` Indeed I will .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 9]: I should feel you a tower of strength .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 7]: Thank you , dear Oak-tree . ''
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 7]: `` Thank you , Apple-blossom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 20]: returned Dan quite gallantly , if you please , and with a laugh which followed the passing seriousness vanished .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 37]: For the next half-hour they laughed and sparred , capped stories , and made merry , more like a couple of happy children than hard-worked students on the verge of examinations ; and then , alas !
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 30]: it was time to return to work , and , sliding down from their perch , Dan and Darsie walked forward to assemble the scattered members of the party .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 2]: DISASTER .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 29]: Cambridge May week is a function so well known , and so often described , that it would be superfluous to enter in detail into its various happenings .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 30]: In their first year Darsie and Hannah had taken little part in the festivities , but upon their second anniversary they looked forward to a welcome spell of gaiety .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 51]: Not only were the Percivals coming up for the whole week , but Mr and Mrs Vernon and Vie were also to be installed in rooms , and the Newnham students had received permission to attend the two principal balls , being housed for the nights by their own party .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 18]: Throughout Newnham the subject of frocks became , indeed , generally intermingled with the day 's work .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 83]: Cardboard boxes arrived from home , cloaks and scarves were unearthed from the recesses of `` coffins , '' and placed to air before opened windows ; `` burries '' were strewn with ribbons , laces , and scraps of tinsel , instead of the usual notebooks ; third-year girls , reviving slowly from the strain of the Tripos , consented languidly to have their hats re-trimmed by second-year admirers , and so , despite themselves , were drawn into the maelstrom .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 32]: One enterprising Fresher offered items of her wardrobe on hire , by the hour , day , or week , and reaped thereby quite a goodly sum towards her summer holiday .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 30]: A blue-silk parasol , in particular , was in universal request , and appeared with _ eclat _ and in different hands at every outdoor function of the week .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 38]: In after-years Darsie Garnett looked back upon the day of that year on which the Masonic Ball was held with feelings of tender recollection , as a piece of her girlhood which was altogether bright and unclouded .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 33]: She met the Percival party at one o'clock , and went with them to lunch in Ralph 's rooms , where two other men had been invited to make the party complete .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 24]: There was hardly room to stir in the overcrowded little study , but the crush seemed but to add to the general hilarity .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 29]: Ralph made the gayest and most genial of hosts , and the luncheon provided for his guests was a typical specimen of the daring hospitality of his kind !
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 54]: Iced soup , lobster mayonnaise , salmon and green peas , veal cutlets and mushrooms , trifle , strawberries and cream , and strong coffee , were pressed in turns upon the guests , who -- be it acknowledged at once -- ate , drank , enjoyed , and went forth in peace .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 35]: Later in the afternoon the little party strolled down to the river , and in the evening there was fresh feasting , leading up to the culminating excitement of all -- the ball itself .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 67]: Beside the Percivals ' Parisian creations , Darsie 's simple dress made but a poor show , but then Darsie 's dresses were wont to take a secondary place , and to appear but as a background to her fresh young beauty , instead of -- as is too often the case -- a dress _ par excellence _ , with a girl tightly laced inside .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 32]: When she made her appearance in the sitting - room of the lodgings , the verdict on her appearance was universally approving -- `` You look a _ lamb _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 4]: gushed Ida enthusiastically .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 9]: `` How do you manage it , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 12]: You _ always _ seem to hit the right thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 32]: exclaimed Mrs Percival in plaintive amaze ; and as he helped her on with her cloak , Ralph murmured significantly -- `` As if it mattered what _ you _ wore !
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 8]: No one will notice the frock . ''
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 23]: At the ball there was an appalling plethora of girls ; wallflowers sat waiting round the walls , and waited in vain .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 39]: Darsie felt sorry for them , tragically sorry ; but the sight of their fixed smiles could not but heighten the sense of her own good luck in having the chance of more partners than she could accept .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 24]: Ralph showed at his best that evening , evincing as much care for his sisters ' enjoyment as for that of their friend .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 25]: Not until the three programmes were filled to the last extra did he rest from his efforts , and think of his own pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 34]: It is true that his pleasure consisted chiefly in dancing with Darsie , and their steps went so well together that she was ready to give him the numbers for which he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 33]: As for Dan Vernon , he did not dance , but out of some mistaken sense of duty , felt it his duty to put in an appearance and _ glower _ .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 10]: `` See old Vernon , glowering over there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 32]: inquired Ralph , laughing , as he whirled Darsie lightly by to the strains of an inspiriting two-step , and for a moment a cloud shadowed the gaiety of her spirits .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 9]: Dan ought either to dance or stay away !
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 12]: She did n't _ like _ to see him looking glum !
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 50]: The dancing was carried on until four in the morning , when in the chill grey light the company were ranged in rows , and photographed , apparently to provide a demonstration of how elderly and plain even the youngest of the number could look under such inauspicious circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 52]: The three girls had breakfast in bed the next morning , somewhere about twelve o'clock -- a delightful occasion when all three talked at the same time , relating thrilling experiences of the night before , comparing notes , admiring , quizzing , shaking with laughter over a dozen innocent drolleries .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 45]: These after-conferences are perhaps the best part of the festivities of our youth ; and Noreen , Ida , and Darsie began that fine June day as gaily , as happily , as unconscious of coming ill as any three girls in the land .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 51]: Ralph had been anxious that his people should again lunch in his rooms , but Mrs Percival had prudently decided in favour of a simple meal at home , and it was approaching tea-time when the party sallied forth to witness the day 's `` bumping '' on the river .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 36]: The elders were frankly tired after their late hours , but the three girls looked fresh as flowers in their dainty white frocks , and enjoyed to the full the kaleidoscopic beauty of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 31]: The two Percivals ' interest in the bumping was of the slightest description -- Ralph was not taking part this afternoon , and with Ralph began and ended their concern .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 23]: They stood on the crowded bank , rather hot , rather bored , amusing themselves by scanning the people near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 16]: The Vernon party were but a few yards away , and Hannah attracted special attention .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 8]: `` She _ is _ plain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 12]: exclaimed Noreen ; whereat Darsie snapped her up in double-quick time .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 9]: `` Of _ course _ she is plain !
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 11]: She would n't dream , of being anything else ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 4]: Beloved plain Hannah !
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 19]: No features , however classic , could be as eloquent as hers in her old friend 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 30]: Darsie tossed her head , and looked flusty and annoyed , whereat Noreen feebly apologised , emphasising her offence by blundering explanations , and Ralph grew restless and impatient .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 4]: `` I say !
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 5]: This is getting slow .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 17]: Come along , girls ; let 's take the ferry and cross to the other side .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 12]: It 's not half bad fun to see all the shows .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 19]: It will be a change , anyhow , and you can come back when you 're tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 12]: `` I 'll stay with mother , '' Noreen decided dutifully .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 25]: Ida surveyed the crowd on the opposite bank with the dubious air of one who has lived all her life within her own gates .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 16]: `` I do n't _ think _ I care to go into that crush . ''
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 8]: `` Oh , come along , Darsie .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 8]: Thank goodness you 're not so squeamish .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 8]: Let 's get out of this . ''
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 26]: Ralph pushed impatiently forward , and Mrs Percival turned to Darsie , with raised eyebrows , and said urgently -- `` Do go , dear !
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 7]: Ralph will take care of you .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 8]: We will wait for you here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 23]: Darsie smiled assent , the thought passing lightly through her mind that Mrs Percival looked particularly sweet and gracious when she smiled .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 32]: She never dreamt that that particular smile , that little glance of appeal , were to remain with her all heir life , to be her comfort in a bitter grief .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 47]: They passed the spot where Hannah and Dan were standing with their friends , and acting on a sudden impulse , Darsie turned her head , with a few laughing words of explanation : `` We 're going to look at the Punch and Judies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 21]: There was no definite response , but Hannah 's exclamation had an envious tone which made Ralph quicken his footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 30]: It was rare good luck to get Darsie to himself for an hour ; he certainly did not wish to be saddled with plain Hannah as an unwelcome third .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 16]: The ferry-boat was on the point of starting , its flat surfaces crowded with pleasure-seekers .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 20]: Ralph and Darsie had to run the last few yards in order to secure a bare space for standing .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 24]: Ralph took the outside with the nonchalance of the true boating-man , who would almost as soon fall in the water as not .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 33]: Darsie , standing close by his side , glanced from one to the other of her companions , her never-failing interest in _ people _ discovering a story in each new group .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 28]: They had reached the middle of the stream , when a movement of the deck upset her balance , and sent her swaying against Ralph 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 18]: She looked up with a laughing apology , and was startled by the sight of his face .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 27]: So far was he from sharing her amusement , that never in the course of their acquaintance had she seen him so pale , so set .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 28]: He seized the hand she had laid on his arm , and held it in a vice-like grip , as he bent to look at the deck .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 19]: At that moment Darsie stumbled afresh , and felt the lapping of water against her thinly clad feet .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 25]: She exclaimed loudly , but her voice was drowned in the chorus of cries , questions , and appeals which arose from every side .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 23]: How swiftly , with what incredible , paralysing speed a scene may change , and seeming security give way to panic fear !
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 32]: Darsie , turning her head to look at the crowd of faces which towered so strangely above her , met but one expression in every eye -- breathless , agonising dread .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 65]: Looking back upon the scene in after-life , it seemed the nightmare of a moment ; then the grip upon her arm tightened , she felt herself being pushed past Ralph towards the edge of the boat , heard his voice speaking to her in crisp , firm tones which she had heard in dreams , but never , never from his living lips .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 3]: `` Darsie !
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 5]: She 's turning turtle !
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 12]: There 's no danger , darling , if you jump clear .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 6]: The water 's not deep .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 5]: Some one will come .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 8]: I 'm going to throw you in .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 7]: Strike out for your life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 56]: She was lifted like a doll in his strong arms ; her wild eyes , searching his , met a cheery smile in response , she felt herself swayed to and fro , realised with a shudder the parting from the firm grasp -- fell , splashed , felt the water close over her head .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 48]: When she rose to the surface the water near her seemed full of struggling forms ; she caught a terrified glimpse of a perpendicular deck , of passengers falling like flies from their perch , and with the instinct of despair struck out in the opposite direction .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 41]: Like most Newnham girls , she was a fair swimmer -- happy hours spent in the swimming-tent had ensured so much ; but it was her first experience of fighting the water in all the crippling fineries of race-week attire .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 60]: Her shoes , her skirts , the floating ends of sash and scarf all held her down ; her soaking hat flopped over her eyes , her very gloves seemed to lessen the force of her stroke ; but breathless and spent as she was , she could not pause while from behind arose that dread , continued cry .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 19]: Ralph had told her to strike out , that there was no danger if only she kept clear .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 9]: `` All right , Darsie -- all right !
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 6]: Keep calm -- keep calm !
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 4]: I 'm coming !
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 5]: I 've got you !
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 6]: Leave yourself to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 58]: It was Dan 's voice speaking in her ear , clear and distinct in the midst of the clamour ; she felt herself seized in scientific fashion -- in the way at which she herself had played at rescuing her companions from imaginary death -- and , relinquishing all effort , was towed numbly to the shore .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 30]: It seemed as if hundreds of people were waiting to rescue her ; hundreds of arms stretched out in welcome ; hundreds of eyes grew suddenly moist with tears .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 26]: She was tired , and wet , and dazed , but she could stand on her own feet , had no need of helping arms .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 30]: Dan took her hand in his and ran swiftly across the grass to the nearest tent , where already preparations were in train for the restoration of the unfortunates .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 25]: Darsie was the first of the crew to reach this shelter , and Mrs Percival and the girls awaited her tearfully on the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 20]: She awoke to fuller consciousness at sight of their faces , smiled in reassurement , and murmured disjointed phrases .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 8]: `` Quite all right -- only wet !
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 4]: Ralph saved me !
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 4]: A second time !
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 6]: So calm and brave ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 8]: `` Yes , dear child ; yes !
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 7]: Take off that wet hat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 37]: replied Mrs Percival urgently , the girl 's praise of her son adding to her tender solicitude , and she hovered around with tender touches , the while from around rose a ceaseless string of suggestions .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 3]: `` Brandy !
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 4]: Hot tea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 9]: `` She ought to change at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 15]: `` My house is just at hand -- do come to my house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 7]: `` My motor is waiting outside !
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 7]: Let me drive you home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 24]: So on , and so on , innate kindliness of heart bubbling to the surface as it invariably does in moments of disaster .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 18]: As each unfortunate entered the tent the same programme was enacted , the same kind offices volunteered .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 15]: `` My house is close at hand -- do come to my house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 14]: `` My motor is waiting -- do let me drive you back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 60]: Each victim of the immersion wore at first the same dazed , helpless expression , but the presence of their companions , the kindly voices speaking in their ear , the hot , reviving draughts soon brought about a change of mood , so that they began to smile , to exchange remarks , to congratulate themselves on escape .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 30]: Darsie , with characteristic elasticity , was one of the first to regain composure , and the Percivals hung delightedly on her description of Ralph 's composure and resource .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 5]: `` I was terrified .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 29]: It was a dreadful sensation to feel the deck sinking beneath your feet on one side , and to see it gradually rising above you on the other .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 8]: And all the bewildered , terrified faces !
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 6]: Ralph never turned a hair .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 34]: He told me that there was no danger so long as I kept clear of the boat ; he lifted me up in his arms as if I had been a doll . ''
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 21]: The colour mounted to Darsie 's white cheeks as she spoke , and a thrill of emotion tingled her blood .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 27]: The first time she hears herself addressed as `` darling '' in a man 's deep voice is one that a girl can not lightly forget .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 20]: She turned her head over her shoulder so as to be able to see the entrance into the tent .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 8]: `` Where _ is _ Ralph ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 7]: `` He will be here presently .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 9]: None of the men have come in yet .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 6]: Ralph will be so useful .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 13]: He is as much at home in the water as on land .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 9]: He will be busy helping the others . ''
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 41]: Mrs Percival spoke with happy assurance ; nevertheless , she left Darsie 's side and edged her way through the crowd towards the open doorway , through which she ought now to be able to see her son 's return .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 45]: As she was within a few yards of the entrance it was suddenly blocked by a group of men -- hatless , dripping , dishevelled , but in demeanour composed and cheery , as if what had happened had been quite an enjoyable experience .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 15]: The foremost of the group greeted their friends with smiles and waving of hands .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 3]: `` Hullo !
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 2]: Hullo !
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 4]: Here we are !
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 5]: How are you feeling ?
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 4]: All serene now ?
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 6]: Every one comfortably on shore ?
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 6]: Got any tea left ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 7]: `` Is my son with you ?
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 10]: Have you seen my son -- Ralph Percival ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 19]: Mrs Percival spoke in a high , clear voice , at the sound of which a young undergrad .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 7]: wheeled round quickly towards his companions .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 6]: `` By Jove -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 5]: He was on board .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 7]: I thought we were all here .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 5]: Where 's Percival ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 20]: He dashed out of the tent , stood looking blankly around , turned a blanched face towards the tent .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 16]: Then from an inner corner of the tent another voice questioned sharply : `` Mary !
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 7]: Where 's Mary -- Mary Everard ?
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 9]: She was with us -- standing quite near .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 8]: _ Mary 's not here _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 4]: No one answered .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 36]: There was a breathless silence , while each man and woman in that crowded tent was subtly , overpoweringly conscious of a new presence filling the atmosphere around -- the presence of _ Fear _ !
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 24]: Heavy as a palpable presence it pressed upon them ; it lapped them round ; the fumes of it mounted to their brains .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 76]: Months before , Darsie had listened while a woman who had been near San Francisco at the time of the earthquake and fire endeavoured to describe what was in truth indescribable , how the very air itself was at that time charged with a poignancy of agony -- an impalpable spiritual agony , apart from such physical cause as heat and fire , an agony which arose from the grief of thousands of tortured hearts .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 42]: She had listened -- interested , curious , pleased to nestle in her easy - chair , and ponder over a novel thought ; but at this terrible moment she had no need to ponder ; realisation came sharp and sure .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 21]: Tragedy was in the air ; she inhaled it with every breath , tasted it , felt its heavy hand .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 26]: With one accord the occupants of the tent streamed across the lawns towards the waterside , where even now an informal inquiry was taking place .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 14]: The officials in charge of the ferry-boat were defending themselves against their accusers .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 2]: Overcrowded ?
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 17]: The ferry-boat had been as crowded on two previous days , and all had gone well .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 9]: It was impossible to account for the accident .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 25]: Since no further harm than a few minutes ' ducking had happened to the passengers , the greater loss was on their own side .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 74]: To these officials , protesting , excusing , arrived in a mass a body of white-faced men and women , demanding with one voice their lost -- a young man , an undergraduate ; tall , fair , in a white flannel suit ; last seen standing on the side of the boat helping to lower the women into the water ; a young girl , in a boating-dress of blue and white .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 7]: They were not among the rescued .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 12]: They had not been seen since the moment of the accident .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 6]: _ Where were they _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 24]: As Darsie stood , ghastly and shuddering , by the water brink , she was subconsciously aware of a strong arm in hers .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 33]: Subconsciously also she was aware that the arm belonged to Dan Vernon , but she had no time for look or word ; her whole being was strung to one agonising thought .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 24]: Mr Percival supported his half-fainting wife ; the two sisters clung together ; the relations of Mary Everard paced wildly to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 21]: On shore all was tumult and confusion , on the river sunbeams sparkled , the stream was quiet and undisturbed .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 16]: `` Percival was like a fish : Percival could have kept afloat for hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 27]: A voice separated itself from the confused babel , and struck on Darsie 's ear , but even as her heart leaped upward another voice spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 9]: `` It is not a case of swimming .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 19]: If he were not quick enough in getting away -- if he were caught beneath -- penned ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 13]: The strong arm gripped her more firmly still , steadied her trembling .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 10]: A fierce voice issued an order for `` Silence !
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 3]: Silence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 14]: Margaret France came up with beautiful soft eyes and a beautiful soft voice .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 7]: She spoke wise , tender words .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 11]: You were to come away -- it was better so .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 13]: It would add to your friends ' distress if you were ill .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 6]: You were wet , cold .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 9]: You were to be sensible and come home .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 10]: Darsie looked at her thoughtfully for a long moment .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 23]: She was thinking that she loved Margaret France , that she had taken a fancy to her the first evening at Newnham .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 11]: How droll and witty she had been as an auctioneer !
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 12]: Of the purport of her present words she had no comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 10]: She sighed and turned her face to the river .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 13]: `` Leave her to me , '' said Dan 's voice quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 9]: `` I will take care of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 38]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ They found them at sundown ; the two young , fair bodies -- the tall , pale lad , the slim , dark maid -- two cold effigies of youth , and health , and joy .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 38]: On Ralph 's forehead was a deep red mark , the mark of the blow which had given him a prey to the waters ; but Mary 's brown locks floated round a sweet , untroubled face .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 17]: They bore them to the mortuary , and those who loved them sat and wept alone .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 30]: Darsie spent the two following days with the stricken family , who found their one comfort in listening again and again to the story of Ralph 's brave end .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 37]: Weak and unstable in life , in death he had shown a gallant front , and more than one of the unfortunate crew came forward to testify to his courageous and selfless efforts on their behalf .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 18]: Mr Percival went about with a set face and shoulders bowed like those of an old man .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 40]: The girls wept helplessly from morn till night ; Mrs Percival lost in one night all lingering trace of youth ; she kept up bravely before her husband and daughters , but alone with Darsie her anguish found vent .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 7]: `` My son , my son !
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 12]: He was so good to me -- so loving and kind .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 19]: His faults were the faults of youth , and , oh , Darsie , my , faults also !
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 13]: We blamed him for faults which we had not tried to check .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 29]: If he had lived and had been obliged to face life for himself he would have risen to it , as he rose to that last great chance .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 10]: It takes a brave man to face death calmly .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 11]: He was not weak or selfish then -- my Ralph !
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 7]: No one dared call him weak .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 3]: Thank God !
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 20]: We were with him to the end , we were happy together , and you were with him too .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 8]: That is what he would have wished .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 6]: He loved you , Darsie .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 15]: If he had lived , he would have wished you for his wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 14]: sighed Darsie , and laid her head gently on the other 's knee .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 35]: In the silence which followed she was acutely aware of the unspoken question which filled the air , acutely distressed that she could not give the stricken mother the assurance for which she craved .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 52]: In Ralph 's lifetime his friendship had brought Darsie as much pain as joy , and , though death had wiped away all but tender recollections , even in this hour of grief and shock she did not delude herself that she sorrowed for him with the deepest sorrow of all .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 28]: The anxious , pitiful affection which she had felt for the man who leaned so heavily upon her was more that of a sister than a wife .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 30]: Darsie stretched out her hand , found the chilly one of the poor mother , and leaning her soft cheek over it , pressed it tenderly with her lips .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 10]: `` You must let me be your third daughter !
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 7]: We can talk about him together .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 19]: I can tell you about this last year -- every little tiny thing that he said and did .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 15]: You 'll never be anxious about him any more , dear , never afraid !
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 11]: You will always be proud of your hero boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 4]: Mrs Percival sighed .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 39]: She was in too sensitive a mood not to realise the meaning of the girl 's lack of response , but the first pang of disappointment was followed by a thought full of comfort to the sore mother-heart .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 6]: `` I loved him best .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 7]: He was mine to the end !
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 9]: No one loved him like his mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 3]: BRIGHTER DAYS .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 43]: Six months passed by -- months of grief and pain , and bitter , unavailing regret ; of work and play , of long summer days , and wintry fog and cold ; of reviving happiness also , since , thank God !
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 16]: joy returns like the spring , bringing back hope and joy to a darkened world .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 83]: There was a place in Darsie 's heart which would ever be consecrated to the memory of Ralph ; but _ it _ was not a foremost place -- that most crushing of sorrows had been spared her ; and when one not yet twenty-one is living the healthiest and most congenial of lives , and is above all elevated to the proud position of third-year girl , it would be as unnatural as wrong to dwell continually upon a past grief .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 50]: At first Darsie felt shocked and ashamed when the old gay mood swept her off her balance , and she found herself dancing , singing , and making merry as of yore , but her two mentors , Mrs Reeves and Hannah Vernon , united to combat this impression .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 18]: `` To bear a sorrow _ cheerfully _ is the only resignation worthy of the name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 27]: This was the older woman 's verdict ; the younger preached the same precept in student vernacular -- `` Why grizzle when you want to smile ?
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 24]: Pray , what good can you do yourself , or any one else , by going about with a face like a fiddle ?
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 17]: Remember Margaret France , and do n't block up the window to shut out the stars !
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 14]: Let them twinkle for all they are worth , the blessed little things .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 11]: They are _ tired _ of hiding behind the clouds .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 18]: You have a duty to the living as well as to the dead ; remember that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 6]: Yes , it was true .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 27]: Looking back over the last eight months Darsie realised what a debt of gratitude she owed to relations and friends alike for their tenderness and forbearance .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 76]: It had been hard on the home party to have the summer holidays clouded by the presence of a mourner who shuddered at the sight of water , collapsed into tears at unexpected moments , and lived in a condition of super-sensitiveness , ready as it seemed to be hurt by the most innocent word ; yet how gentle and patient they had been , every single one of them , down to Tim himself !
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 35]: Mother and father , of course , had been angels ; one took it for granted that they would be , but who could have believed in such consideration from the boys and girls .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 4]: Dear old Clemence !
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 7]: What a comfort she had been !
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 53]: Darsie had often been inclined to think that , for sheer rest and soothing , no one could compete with a plump , practical , matter-of-fact sister , who had no thought for `` ifs '' or `` whys , '' but was full of care to ensure your present physical well-being .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 37]: Then , if for a moment Clemence seemed to fall short , there was Lavender , ready to pour out floods of sympathy , to mingle her tears with yours , and listen to endless reminiscences .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 29]: As for the boys , Harry and Russell forbore to tease , affected blindness to reddened eyes , and said , `` Buck up , old girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 17]: with real heartiness of feeling , while Tim was assiduous in the offer of sticky sweets .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 6]: The Vernons , lucky creatures !
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 13]: went off _ en masse _ to Switzerland for July and August .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 24]: Darsie morbidly told herself that they were anxious to avoid the depression of her own presence during the chief holiday of the year .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 39]: She was , as she expressed it , `` too proud to say so , '' but the inward soreness made her so cold and abrupt in manner that her friends had good cause to reverse the accusation .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 16]: With regard to Dan Vernon in especial there was a soreness at Darsie 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 33]: During the first days after the tragic happening Dan had been a tower of strength , always at hand to comfort , support , and take every difficulty upon his own shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 24]: To outward appearance Darsie had appeared oblivious of his presence , but subconsciously she had leaned on his strength with a profound relief .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 51]: It was hard to have Dan withdraw into his shell just as she was beginning to long for his presence ; but he _ had _ withdrawn , and like most naturally shy and reticent people , withdrawn farther than ever , as if in reaction from his unusual demonstration .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 13]: In hall itself the absence of Margaret France made a big blank .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 31]: Having passed her tripos with a first class , Margaret had placidly returned home to help her mother in the house , and take part in an ordinary social life .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 6]: `` What a waste ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 27]: cried her Newnham acquaintances , but Margaret 's friends , remembering her own words on the subject , believed that she had chosen the better part .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 21]: With October came the return to Newnham , and for the first few weeks an access of grief and depression .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 41]: It was hard to fall into the old life shorn of its greatest interest , to be reminded of Ralph at every turn , to see his friends pass by , laughing and gay , while his place was blank .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 23]: Then it was that Darsie discovered the real tenderness of heart which lies beneath the somewhat callous exterior of the college girl .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 22]: Freshers , second-year girls , even austere thirds themselves , combined to surround her with an atmosphere of kindness and consideration .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 28]: No _ word _ of sympathy was ever spoken , but almost every hour of the day brought with it some fresh deed of comfort and cheer .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 47]: Offerings of flowers , tendered by a friend , or laid anonymously on `` burry '' or coffin ; bags of fruit and cake , invitations galore , surprise visits to her own study , each in turn bringing a gleam of brightness to the day .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 10]: Plain Hannah , too , dear old plain Hannah !
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 21]: In the midst of her grief Darsie was filled with amusement at Hannah 's unique fashion of showing her sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 44]: Hot water evidently commended itself to her mind as the ideal medium , for at a dozen hours of the day and night the door of Darsie 's study would open and Hannah would appear on the threshold , steaming can in hand .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 30]: Early morning , eleven o'clock , before lunch , before tea , before dinner , before cocoa , before bed , Hannah and her can never failed to appear .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 21]: For the first half of the Michaelmas term Darsie might literally have been described as never out of hot water .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 48]: And now it was the Lent term ; eight months had passed by since the date of Ralph 's death , and it surely behoved Darsie to rise above her depression , and to throw herself once more into the full , happy life of the house .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 37]: She was thankful to do it , thankful to welcome dawnings of the old zest , to feel her feet involuntarily quicken to a dance , to discover herself singing as she moved to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 11]: The winter had passed ; spring was in the air .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 12]: It seemed right that it should be in her heart also .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 42]: As usual in the Lent term , hockey was the one absorbing subject outside `` shop , '' and Hannah Vernon , now advanced to the lofty position of captain , had special reasons for welcoming her friend 's reviving spirits .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 16]: One chilly day in February she entered Darsie 's study with a somewhat unusual request .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 20]: `` The girls are getting restive , and think that it 's quite time we had another fancy match .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 10]: They want me to arrange one on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 19]: It 's so blighting to be told that one is so clever , and looked to for inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 8]: Every idea forsakes one on the instant .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 17]: You 've been hibernating for an age , you ought to have lots stored up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 11]: `` I have n't -- I 've grown hideously dull .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 7]: What did we have last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 5]: `` Thicks against Thins !
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 6]: Never shall I forget it !
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 36]: To play forward padded with three separate cushions , and with shawls wound round your limbs , is the sort of thing one rises to _ once _ in a lifetime , but never twice .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 7]: I made an adorable fat woman !
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 14]: The Thins had no spirit left in them when they beheld my bulk .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 14]: I vote that we do n't have anything that involves padding this time .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 8]: One never knows one 's luck . ''
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 3]: `` No-o !
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 21]: I think we might hit on something more subtle , '' Darsie ruminated , with her eyes on the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 16]: Her reputation of being the Newnham belle remained unchallenged after two separate incursions of Freshers .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 80]: As she sat before a `` burry , '' clad in a blue , pinafore-like garment , from which emerged white silk sleeves to match the collar and yoke , her hand absently turning over a pile of notebooks , bound in green and blue and rose , she made a striking contrast to Hannah Vernon in a cinnamon coat and skirt , built for wear by a cheap tailor on the principle of `` there or thereabouts . ''
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 42]: Even the notebooks reflected the personality of their owners , for the one which Hannah carried was of the shiny black persuasion which seemed to proclaim that , being made for good solid work , it disdained the affectation of beauty .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 12]: Plain Hannah 's little eyes twinkled affectionately at her old friend .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 22]: She detached a pencil from a chain which dangled by her side , and said tentatively -- `` Subtle -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 3]: Good biz !
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 10]: Let 's have a Subtler by all means . ''
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 15]: `` I -- was thinking -- we might have something touching upon future possibilities .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 15]: I 've not quite got it yet , but something about brides and spinsters .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 10]: Future brides -- budding brides -- beautiful brides . ''
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 10]: `` Easy enough to have adjectives for the brides .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 8]: Where do the spinsters come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 22]: `` Oh , one would have to infer -- subtly , of course -- that they _ would _ be spinsters !
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 6]: That would be adjective enough .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 9]: Embryo spinsters -- preparatory spinsters -- p-p-probable spinsters .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 4]: I have it !
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 4]: I have it !
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 9]: ` Possible Brides against Probable Spinsters ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 13]: ejaculated Hannah , and drew her forefinger slowly down her nose . ''
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 4]: _ Good _ !
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 3]: Top hole .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 7]: Amusin ' , but -- injudicious ?
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 15]: Should n't mind one rap myself ; lead off the Probables with a cheer .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 15]: But , I fear me , there 'd be brickbats floating in the air .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 25]: How much would you take in coin of the realm to go up to Vera Ruskin and invite her to play for the spinsters ?
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 8]: Personally I 'd rather be excused . ''
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 8]: `` I 'd volunteer as a start !
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 6]: Love to do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 3]: `` Ye-es !
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 3]: Just so .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 15]: Noble of you , no doubt ; but unconvincing , '' returned Hannah dryly .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 19]: It 's a fine suggestion in theory , but in practice I 'm afraid it wo n't work .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 11]: I do n't want to imperil my popularity for good .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 8]: Think of something a trifle less searching !
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 10]: Er -- er -- Slackers against -- against what ?
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 4]: Slackers against Swotters !
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 9]: How would that do for a change ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 6]: Darsie curled her little nose .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 3]: `` Dull !
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 3]: No scope .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 6]: How would you dress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 3]: `` Oh-h !
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 15]: The Swotters might have bandages round their heads , and study notebooks between play .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 13]: The Slackers would just -- could just -- '' `` Just so !
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 5]: ` Could just ' !
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 6]: Too feeble , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 5]: It wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 6]: What about worth and charm ?
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 8]: Might make up something out of that .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 14]: Worth , solid worth , genuine worth -- '' `` Moral worth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 5]: `` That 's it !
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 8]: Moral Worth against Charm , personal charm !
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 5]: That 'll do it .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 5]: That 'll do it !
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 8]: _ Moral Worth against Personal Charm _ .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 13]: Nobody can be offended at being asked to represent Moral Worth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 6]: `` They will , though !
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 12]: The female heart is desperately wicked , '' returned Hannah shrewdly .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 11]: `` But if they do it 's their own look-out .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 15]: We 'll preserve a high and lofty tone , and be _ surprised _ !
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 6]: Thanks awfully , old girl .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 6]: It 's an adorable idea .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 12]: What price the Moral Worth costume -- eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 24]: The Hockey captain went off chuckling , and excitement ran high in the hockey world when the thrilling announcement was posted that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 12]: `` For which side shall I be asked to play ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 53]: Forwards , Backs , and Goals alike agitated themselves over these questions , and , sad to relate , Hannah proved a true prophet , for while an invitation from the ` Personal Charm ' captain aroused smiles of delight , the implication of ` Moral Worth ' was but coldly received .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 39]: Darsie Garnett herself was conscious of an electric shock of the most unpleasant nature when , but half an hour after the posting of the notice , the `` Moral Worths '' invited her to join their ranks !
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 32]: With all the determination in the world , she found it impossible to repress a start of surprise , and was acutely conscious of smothered giggles of amusement from those around .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 28]: She accepted , of course , with protestations of delight , and ten minutes later found balm in the shape of an invitation from the rival team .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 40]: The `` Personal Charms '' deplored Darsie 's loss , but considered it a masterpiece of diplomacy on the part of the `` Moral Worth '' captain to have headed her team with the name of the Newnham Belle .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 10]: `` No one could be snarkey after that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 45]: The two teams held committee meetings on the subject of costumes , which were kept a dead secret until the hour for the match had arrived , when a large body of spectators awaited their arrival on the ground , with expectations pleasantly excited .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 34]: The `` Personal Charms '' appeared first , marching in pairs with heads erect , and stamped on each face that brilliant , unalterable , toothy smile affected by actresses of inferior rank .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 23]: Each head was frizzed and tousled to about twice its natural size , and crowned by an enormous topknot of blue ribbon .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 37]: White blouses and skirts , blue belts , ties , and hose completed an attractive costume , and as a finishing touch , the handle of the hockey-stick was embellished with a second huge blue bow .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 36]: From a spectacular point of view the `` Personal Charms '' were certainly an unusually attractive spectacle , but as regards popularity with the `` field , '' they fell far behind the rival team .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 56]: The `` Moral Worths '' allowed a judicious time to elapse after the appearance of the `` Personal Charms , '' and then , just as the spectators were beginning to wax impatient , excitement was aroused by the appearance of a white banner , borne proudly aloft in the arms of two brawny Forwards .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 37]: Printed on the banner were two lines of poetry , which at nearer view proved to be a highly appropriate adaptation -- `` Be good , sweet maid , And let who will be charming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 17]: Certainly the `` Moral Worths '' had been at pains to disguise any charm they possessed !
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 36]: Even Darsie herself looked plain with her hair dragged back into a tight little knot , her grey flannel shirt padded into the similitude of stooping shoulders , her skirt turned carefully back to front .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 46]: With lumping gait and heavy footsteps the team marched round the field , and drew up beside the beaming `` Personal Charms , '' who despite the blasts of easterly wind through summer muslin blouses , continued to smile , and smile , and smile .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 43]: Throughout the heated game which followed the `` Moral Worths '' were distinctly the favourite team ; nevertheless , it is the deplorable truth that the `` Personal Charms '' won at a canter , despite the handicap of their beribboned sticks .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 32]: When , tired and muddy , Darsie reached her study again , it was to find a postcard from Lavender which a kindly Fresher had laid upon her `` burry . ''
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 28]: It bore but a few words written in large characters , and plentifully underlined -- '' _ Which team were you asked to play for _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 30]: What a glow of satisfaction it gave one to be able to reply , truthfully and accurately , with one short , illuminating -- '' _ Both _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 19]: Among the other joys of the last terms , one shone out pre-eminent in Darsie Garnett 's estimation .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 5]: She was Prime Minister !
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 9]: It seemed almost too splendid to be true !
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 32]: She , who three years before had made her first appearance at Political as the bashful representative of Bootle-cum - Linacre , to have advanced to this dizzy height of power !
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 46]: To be captain of the Hockey Club paled into insignificance before this crowning honour , but as Hannah was `` Speaker , '' Darsie was unable to crow as loudly as she would have done if her friend 's place had been below the gangway .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 46]: Political was held in College Hall on Monday evenings at eight o'clock , and in old-fashioned style the members were divided into three parties , Conservatives , Liberals , and Unionists , whose seats were so arranged as to form three sides of a square .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 15]: Viewed from afar there was a strong element of humour about this mock Parliament .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 69]: Prophetic it might be , but it was distinctly droll to hear Honourable Members addressed as `` Madam , '' while some of the statutes embodied in the Constitution-book were quite deliciously unexpected , the special one , which ran , '' _ Members occupying the front benches are requested not to darn stockings during Political _ '' being a constant source of delight to parents and friends .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 5]: Darsie was a Liberal .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 10]: Members of the Opposition accused her openly of Socialism .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 3]: _ What !
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 15]: shall we sacrifice our brother man for the sake of the demon gold _ ?
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 29]: she would declaim with waving hands and cheeks aflame , whereat the Liberals would cheer as one girl , and even the Conservatives themselves be moved to admiration .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 71]: Debates relating to Education , Suffrage , and the House of Lords were held during the winter months , but the crowning excitement followed a daring Bill introduced by the Liberal party for the abolishment of the Unionists _ in toto _ , on the ground that , being neither fish , flesh , nor good red herring , they acted but as a drag on the wheels of progress .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 56]: The benches were crowded to their fullest capacity on the occasion of this historic debate ; even the Dons themselves came in to listen , and the whips flew round the corridors , giving no quarter to the few skulkers discovered at work in their studies , until they also were forced into the breach .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 22]: As a result , the Unionist party , supported by Moderates on both sides , achieved a brilliant and decisive victory .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 34]: So much for Political , but the Prime Minister occupied another proud position , for Margaret France 's prophecy had been fulfilled , and Darsie was now captain of the Clough Fire Brigade .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 36]: Beneath her were two lieutenants , and two companies , each seven girls strong , and the duty of choosing times of the utmost inconvenience and unpreparedness for drill alarms rested entirely at her discretion .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 30]: When the fire-bell rang , every member of the brigade must leave whatever she happened to be about , and dash pell-mell to the assembling-ground on an upper story .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 61]: There the force ranked up in order , the captain explained the locality and nature of the supposed conflagration , and each `` man '' received `` his '' own instruction -- one to shut windows and ventilators , and so diminish draughts , another to uncoil the hose , a third to affix the nozzle , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 69]: The work was accomplished , examined by the authorities , and the `` men '' were back on the top landing , ranked up in their original order , in an incredibly short space of time , when the captain gave a sharp criticism of the performance , followed by a few questions to test the general knowledge of the staff : Where was Mary Murray 's study ?
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 5]: What was its aspect ?
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 7]: What was the nearest water supply ?
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 2]: Etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 56]: One excuse for non-attendance , and one only , was allowed to pass muster -- a member who chanced to be in a hot bath what time the bell rang forth the alarm might lie at ease and smile at the scurry without , health and the risk of chill being considered before imaginary dangers .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 44]: If , however , the bath were _ cold _ , out she must get , dash into the coat and skirt which , for members of the fire brigade , supplanted the ordinary dressing-gown , and take her place with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 42]: Nor -- with Darsie Garnett as captain -- was it any use to attempt deception , as a tired little Fresher discovered to her cost , when she naughtily turned a warm stream into her cold bath and refused to budge .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 46]: No sooner were lightning-like instructions rapped out upstairs than down flew the irate captain , rapped at the door , demanded admission , and -- in the absence of steam upon the wall -- sentenced the cringing truant to a month 's suspension of privileges .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 43]: Nor was Darsie 's own position free from anxiety , for once in a term it was the prerogative of the brigade to surprise the captain , and woe befall her prestige if , on that occasion , she were found wanting !
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 39]: Coat , skirt , and slippers lay nightly on a chair by her bedside , together with the inevitable pile of notebooks , and she felt a burden off her mind when the alarm had come and gone .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 17]: Deep , deep down in the recesses of Darsie 's mind there slumbered a fell ambition .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 16]: If there could be a _ real _ fire before her term of office expired !
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 41]: Not a serious one , of course -- nothing to imperil the safety of the dear old house , but just sufficient to cause a _ real _ alarm , and give the brigade an opportunity of demonstrating its powers !
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 35]: It was almost too aggravating to be borne , to hear one morning that a second - year girl had indulged in a study fire , and had extinguished it of her own accord .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 27]: Extinguished by private effort , when a captain , two lieutenants , and fourteen `` men '' were languishing for an opportunity to exhibit their powers !
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 13]: The captain spoke sternly to the second-year girl , and rebuked her .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 27]: `` How , '' she demanded , `` can you _ expect _ a reliable force , if precious opportunities are to be wasted like this ?
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 8]: Curtains ablaze , and the bedclothes singeing .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 13]: We may wait for _ years _ for another such opportunity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 11]: `` But where do _ I _ come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 5]: cried the second-year girl .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 10]: `` I gave ten and sixpence for that quilt .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 10]: And a jug of water standing close at hand !
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 40]: It was only human nature -- '' `` I hope , '' returned the captain of the Fire Brigade icily -- `` I _ hope _ that is not the spirit in which you propose to go through life .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 22]: It 's a poor thing if you can not sacrifice a ten-and-sixpenny quilt in the interest of the public good . ''
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 8]: And she stalked majestically from the room .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY NINE .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 3]: TRIPOS WEEK .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 4]: The Tripos week !
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 18]: Every third-year girl felt as if life and death trembled in the balance during those eventful days .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 71]: They woke on the Monday morning with much the same feeling as that of a patient who expects to have an arm amputated at eleven , and is morally convinced that she will sink beneath the strain , and when at seven o'clock a second-year friend crept into the study , tray in hand , and administered sympathising cups of tea , the final touch was given to the illusion .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 10]: Darsie quailed before the prospect of those three-hour papers .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 54]: Experience had proved that she was not at her best in examinations ; imaginative people rarely are , since at the critical moment the brain is apt to wander off on dire excursions into the future , envisaging the horrors of failing , instead of buckling to work in order to ensure success .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 30]: Historical French Grammar in especial loomed like a pall , and she entered the Mission Room at Saint Columba 's with the operation-like feeling developed to its acutest point .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 20]: For several minutes after taking the first paper in her hand Darsie found it impossible to decipher the words .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 52]: The type danced mistily before her eyes ; and when at last letters shaped themselves out of the confusion , the last state was worse than the first , for she was convinced -- drearily , hopelessly convinced -- that she could not answer a single question out of the number .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 11]: She laid down the paper , and steadied herself resolutely .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 33]: All over the room other girls were sitting on hard , uncomfortable chairs before tables like her own , some motionless and stunned-looking like herself , some already setting briskly to work .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 18]: On the walls , among a number of quotations , '' _ Help one another _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 25]: stared her in the face with tragic significance , and again : `` How far high failure overleaps the bounds of low successes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 4]: _ Failure _ !
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 42]: She lifted the paper again , and decided with a glimmer of hope that she could answer at least _ one _ question , set to work , and scribbled for life until the last moment of the prescribed three hours !
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 3]: What exhaustion !
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 3]: What collapse !
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 13]: Positively one 's legs wobbled beneath one as one trailed wearily Newnhamwards .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 22]: What a comfort to be fussed over and petted , treated as distinguished invalids whom the College was privileged to tend !
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 40]: The Tripos girls `` sat at High '' at the head of the room , surrounded by attentive Dons , with the V.C. herself smiling encouragement , and urging them to second helpings of chicken -LRB- chicken !! -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 29]: By the time that it was necessary to start forth for the afternoon 's ordeal they felt mentally and physically braced , and the operation feeling lessened sensibly .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 34]: At the afternoon 's ordeal , however , the weariness and depression grew more acute than ever , and on the walk home the comparing of answers had anything but a cheering effect .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 18]: No girl was satisfied ; each was morally convinced that her companions had done better than herself .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 19]: Where she had failed to answer a question , a reminder of the solution filled her with despair .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 3]: Of course !
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 7]: It was as simple as ABC .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 8]: She had known it off by heart .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 13]: Nothing short of softening of the brain could explain such idiotic forgetfulness .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 45]: It was a kindly custom which separated the sufferers on their return to College , each one being carried off by her special second-year adorer to a cheery little tea-party , for which the most congenial spirits and the most delectable fare were provided .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 25]: Here the tired senior was soothed and fed , and her self-esteem revived by an attitude of reverence on the part of the audience .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 38]: The second-year girls shuddered over the papers ; were convinced that never , no never , could they face the like , and suggested that it would be a saving of time to go down at once .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 37]: Later on that first evening , when Marian White appeared to put her invalid to bed , she bore in her hand a letter from Margaret France , which Darsie hailed with a cry of joy .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 10]: I _ thought _ she would write to me .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 19]: I wondered that I did n't have a letter this morning , but she was right as usual .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 10]: She knew I should need it more to-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 23]: Margaret 's letter was short and to the point -- `` Dearest Darsie , -- A year ago you were cheering me !
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 47]: How I wish I could do the same for you in your need , but as I ca n't be present in the flesh , here comes a little line to greet you , old dear , and to tell you to be of good cheer .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 13]: You are very tired , and very discouraged , and very blue .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 5]: I _ know _ !
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 4]: Every one is .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 7]: It 's part of the game .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 28]: Do you remember what a stern mentor I had , and how she bullied me , and packed me to bed , and took away my books ?
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 7]: Oh , the good old times !
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 23]: The good old times , how happy we were -- how I think of them now , and long to be back !
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 27]: But the best part remains , for I have still my friend , and you and I , Darsie , ` belong ' for our lives .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 7]: `` Cheer up , old dear !
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 12]: _ You 've done a lot better than you think _ !
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 4]: `` Margaret . ''
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 8]: `` What 's the matter now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 35]: asked the second-year girl sharply , spying two big tears course slowly down her patient 's cheeks , and Darsie returned a stammering reply -- `` I 've had such a ch-ch-cheering letter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 5]: `` Have you indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 20]: The less of _ that _ sort of cheering you get this week , the better for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 5]: snapped Marian once more .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 36]: She was jealous of Margaret France , as she was jealous of every girl in the College for whom Darsie Garnett showed a preference , and she strongly resented any interference with her own prerogative .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 25]: `` Hurry into your dressing-gown , please , and I 'll brush your hair , '' she said now in her most dictatorial tones .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 6]: `` I 'm a pro .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 13]: at brushing hair -- a hair-dresser taught me how to do it .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 19]: You hold the brush at the side to begin with , and work gradually round to the flat .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 24]: I let a Fresher brush mine one right when I 'd a headache , and she began in the middle of my cheek .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 10]: There 's been a coldness between us ever since .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 5]: is n't that good ?
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 15]: Gets right into the roots , does n't it , and tingles them up !
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 11]: Nothing so soothing as a smooth , hard brush . ''
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 14]: Darsie shut her eyes and purred like a sleek , lazy little cat .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 3]: `` De-lic-ious !
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 2]: Lovely !
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 7]: You _ do _ brush well !
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 8]: I could sit here for hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 8]: `` You wo n't get a chance .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 23]: Ten minutes at most , and then off you go , and not a peep at another book till to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 12]: `` Marian -- _ really _ -- I _ must _ !
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 11]: Just for ten minutes , to revive my memory . ''
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 9]: `` I 'll tell you a story ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 15]: said Marian quietly -- `` a _ true _ story from my own experience .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 26]: It was when I was at school and going in for the Cambridge Senior , the last week , when we were having the exams .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 16]: We had _ slaved _ all the term , and were at the last gasp .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 23]: The head girl was one Annie Macdiarmid , a marvel of a creature , the most all-round scholar I 've ever met .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 16]: She was invariably first in everything , and I usually came in a bad third .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 38]: Well , we 'd had an arithmetic exam , one day , pretty stiff , but not more so than usual , and on this particular morning at eleven o'clock we were waiting to hear the result .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 31]: The Mathematic Master was a lamb -- so keen , and humorous , and just -- a _ rageur _ at times , but that was only to be expected .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 24]: He came into the room , papers in hand , his mouth screwed up , and his eyebrows nearly hidden under his hair .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 11]: We knew at a glance that something awful had happened .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 16]: He cleared his throat several times , and began to read aloud the arithmetic results .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 6]: ` Total , a hundred .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 6]: Bessie Smith , eighty-seven . '
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 7]: There was a rustle of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 4]: Not Annie Macdiarmid ?
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 20]: Just Bessie -- an ordinary sort of creature , who was n't going in for the Local at all .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 6]: ` Mary Ross , eighty-two .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 6]: Stella Bruce , seventy-four . '
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 8]: Where did _ I _ come in ?
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 8]: I 'd never been lower than that .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 7]: ` Kate Stevenson , sixty-four . '
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 31]: Some one else fifty , some one else forty , _ and _ thirty _ and _ twenty , and still not a mention of Annie Macdiarmid or of me .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 9]: You should have _ seen _ her face !
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 6]: I shall never forget it .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 4]: _ Green _ !
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 15]: and she laced her fingers in and out , and chewed , and chewed .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 7]: I was too stunned to feel .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 10]: The world seemed to have come to an end .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 30]: Down it came -- sixteen , fourteen , ten -- and then at last -- at bitter , long last -- ` Miss Marian White , _ six _ !
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 7]: Miss Macdiar-mid , Two ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 13]: Darsie stared beneath the brush , drawing a long breath of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 9]: `` What _ did _ you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 3]: `` Nothing !
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 9]: That was where he showed himself so wise .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 30]: An ordinary master would have raged and stormed , insisted upon our working for extra hours , going over and over the old ground , but he knew better .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 23]: He just banged all the books together , tucked them under his arm , and called out : ` No more work !
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 34]: Put on your hats and run off home as fast as you can go , and tell your mothers from me to take you to the Waxworks , or a Wild Beast show .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 13]: Do n't dare to show yourselves in school again until Monday morning .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 19]: Read as many stories as you please , but open a school book at your peril ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 22]: Marian paused dramatically , Darsie peered at her through a mist of hair , and queried weakly , `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 8]: `` Well -- so we did n't !
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 35]: We just slacked and lazed , and amused ourselves till the Monday morning , and then , like giants refreshed , we went down to the fray and -- '' `` And what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 7]: `` I 've told you before !
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 25]: I got second-class honours , and the Macdiarmid came out first in all England , distinction in a dozen subjects -- arithmetic among them .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 26]: So now , Miss Garnett , kindly take the moral to heart , and let me hear no more nonsense about ` reviving memories . '
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 26]: _ Your _ memory needs putting to sleep , so that it may wake up refreshed and active after a good night 's rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 7]: And Darsie weakly , reluctantly obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTY .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 4]: FAREWELL TO NEWNHAM .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 19]: May week followed hard on the Tripos that year , but Darsie took no part in the festivities .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 33]: The remembrance of the tragic event of last summer made her shrink from witnessing the same scenes , and in her physically exhausted condition she was thankful to stay quietly in college .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 41]: Moreover , a sad task lay before her in the packing up her belongings , preparatory to bidding adieu to the beloved little room which had been the scene of so many joys and sorrows during the last three years .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 60]: Vie Vernon , as a publicly engaged young lady , was paying a round of visits to her _ fiance 's _ relations , but Mr and Mrs Vernon had come up as usual , arranging to keep on their rooms , so that they might have the satisfaction of being in Cambridge when the Tripos List came out .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 59]: With a son like Dan and a daughter like Hannah , satisfaction was a foregone conclusion ; calm , level-headed creatures both of them , who were not to be flurried or excited by the knowledge of a critical moment , but most sanely and sensibly collected their full panoply of wits to turn them to good account .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 13]: Hannah considered it in the last degree futile to dread an exam .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 20]: `` What else , '' she would demand in forceful manner -- `` what else are you working for ?
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 9]: For what other reason are you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 20]: But her arguments , though unanswerable , continued to be entirely unconvincing to Darsie and other nervously constituted students .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 15]: The same difference of temperament showed itself in the manner of waiting for results .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 33]: Dan and Hannah , so to speak , wiped their pens after the writing of the last word of the last paper , and there and then resigned themselves to their fate .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 27]: They had done their best ; nothing more was possible in the way of addition or alteration -- for good or ill the die was cast .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 4]: Then why worry ?
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 9]: Wait quietly , and take what came along !
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 6]: Blessed faculty of common sense !
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 72]: A man who is born with such a temperament escapes half the strain of life , though it is to be doubted whether he can rise to the same height of joy as his more imaginative neighbour , who lies awake shivering at the thought of possible ills , and can no more `` wait quietly '' for a momentous decision than he could breathe with comfort in a burning house .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 50]: When the morning arrived on which the results of the Tripos were to be posted on the door of the Senate House , Darsie and Hannah had taken a last sad farewell of their beloved Newnham , and were ensconced with Mr and Mrs Vernon in their comfortable rooms .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 27]: The lists were expected to appear early in the morning , and the confident parents had arranged a picnic `` celebration '' party for the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 37]: Darsie never forgot that morning -- the walk to the Senate House with Dan and Hannah on either side , the sight of the waiting crowd , the strained efforts at conversation , the dragging hours .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 24]: At long last a list appeared -- the men 's list only : for the women 's a further wait would be necessary .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 43]: But one glance at the paper showed Dan 's name proudly ensconced where every one had expected it would be , and in a minute he was surrounded by an eager throng -- congratulating , cheering , shaking him by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 33]: He looked quiet as ever , but his eyes shone , and when Darsie held out her hand he gripped it with a violence which almost brought the tears to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 21]: The crowd cleared away slowly , the women students retiring to refresh themselves with luncheon before beginning a second wait .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 43]: The Vernons repaired to their rooms and feasted on the contents of the hamper prepared for the picnic , the father and mother abeam with pride and satisfaction , Dan obviously filled with content , and dear old Hannah full of quips .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 43]: Darsie felt ashamed of herself because she alone failed to throw off anxiety ; but her knees _ would _ tremble , her throat _ would _ parch , and her eyes _ would _ turn back restlessly to study the clock .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 16]: `` Better to die by sudden shock , Than perish piecemeal on the rock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 23]: The old couplet which as a child she had been used to quote darted back into her mind with a torturing pang .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 10]: How much longer of this agony could she stand ?
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 17]: Anything , anything would be better than this dragging on in suspense , hour after hour .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 20]: But when once again the little party approached the Senate House , she experienced a swift change of front .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 13]: No , no , this was not suspense ; it was hope !
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 6]: Hope was blessed and kindly .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 13]: Only certainty was to be dreaded , the grim , unalterable fact .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 12]: The little crowd of girls pressed forward to read the lists .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 15]: Darsie peered with the rest , but saw nothing but a mist and blur .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 17]: Then a voice spoke loudly by her side ; Hannah 's voice : `` First Class !
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 5]: _ Hurrah _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 5]: Whom did she mean ?
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 21]: Darsie 's heart soared upward with a dizzy hope , her eyes cleared and flashed over the list of names .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 17]: Hannah Vernon -- Mary Bates -- Eva Murray -- many names , but not her own .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 31]: The mist and the blur hid the list once more , she felt an arm grip her elbow , and Dan 's voice cried cheerily -- `` A Second Class !
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 6]: Good for you , Darsie !
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 9]: I thought you were going to fail . ''
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 5]: It was a relief .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 24]: Not a triumph ; not the proud , glad moment of which she had dreamed , but a relief from a great dread .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 16]: The girls congratulated her , wrung her hand , cried , `` Well done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 43]: and wished her luck ; third - class girls looked envious and subdued ; first-class girls in other `` shops '' whispered in her ear that it was an acknowledged fact that Modern Languages had had an uncommonly stiff time this year .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 17]: Modern Languages who had themselves gained a first class , kept discreetly out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 10]: Hannah said , `` See , I was right !
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 6]: Are you satisfied now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 8]: No one showed any sign of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 15]: Perhaps no one but herself had believed in the possibility of a first class .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 15]: The last band of students turned away from the gates with a strange reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 39]: It was the last , the very last incident of the dear old life -- the happiest years of life which they had ever known , the years which from this moment would exist but as a memory .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 25]: Even the most successful felt a pang mingling with their joy , as they turned their backs on the gates and walked quietly away .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 15]: Later that afternoon Dan and Darsie found themselves strolling across the meadows towards Grantchester .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 52]: They were alone , for , the picnic having fallen through , Mr and Mrs Vernon had elected to rest after the day 's excitement , and Hannah had settled herself down to the writing of endless letters to relations and friends , bearing the good news of the double honours .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 49]: Darsie 's few notes had been quickly accomplished , and had been more apologetic than jubilant in tone , but she honestly tried to put her own feelings in the background , and enter into Dan 's happiness as he confided to her his plans for the future .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 16]: `` I 'm thankful I 've come through all right -- it means so much .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 8]: I 'm a lucky fellow , Darsie .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 25]: I 've got a rattling opening , at the finest of the public schools , the school I 'd have chosen above all others .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 16]: Jenson got a mastership there two years ago -- my old coach , you remember !
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 24]: He was always good to me , thought more of me than I deserved , and he spoke of me to the Head .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 11]: There 's a vacancy for a junior master next term .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 7]: They wrote to me about it .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 19]: It was left open till the lists came out , but now I now it will go through .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 8]: I 'm safe for it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 17]: `` Oh , Dan , I 'm so glad ; I 'm so glad for you !
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 11]: You 've worked so hard that you deserve your reward .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 14]: A mastership , and time to write -- that 's your ambition still ?
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 9]: You are still thinking of your book ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 7]: `` Ah , my book ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 11]: Dan 's dark eyes lightened , his rugged face shone .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 20]: It was easy to see how deeply that book of the future had entered into his life 's plans .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 64]: He discussed it eagerly as they strolled across the fields , pointing out the respects in which it differed from other treatises of the kind ; and Darsie listened , and sympathised , appreciated to the extent of her abilities , and hated herself because , the more absorbed and eager Dan grew , the more lonely and dejected became her own mood .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 9]: Then they talked of Hannah and her future .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 26]: With so good a record she would have little difficulty in obtaining her ambition in a post as mathematical mistress at a girls ' school .
