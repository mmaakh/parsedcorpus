Parsing [sent. 1 len. 29]: The Personal History and Experience of David Copperfield the Younger by Charles Dickens Affectionately Inscribed to the Hon. Mr. And Mrs. Richard Watson , of Rockingham , Northamptonshire .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 44]: Preface to 1850 Edition I do not find it easy to get sufficiently far away from this Book , in the first sensations of having finished it , to refer to it with the composure which this formal heading would seem to require .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 60]: My interest in it , is so recent and strong ; and my mind is so divided between pleasure and regret -- pleasure in the achievement of a long design , regret in the separation from many companions -- that I am in danger of wearying the reader whom I love , with personal confidences , and private emotions .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 24]: Besides which , all that I could say of the Story , to any purpose , I have endeavoured to say in it .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 64]: It would concern the reader little , perhaps , to know , how sorrowfully the pen is laid down at the close of a two-years ' imaginative task ; or how an Author feels as if he were dismissing some portion of himself into the shadowy world , when a crowd of the creatures of his brain are going from him for ever .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 49]: Yet , I have nothing else to tell ; unless , indeed , I were to confess -LRB- which might be of less moment still -RRB- that no one can ever believe this Narrative , in the reading , more than I have believed it in the writing .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 12]: Instead of looking back , therefore , I will look forward .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 59]: I can not close this Volume more agreeably to myself , than with a hopeful glance towards the time when I shall again put forth my two green leaves once a month , and with a faithful remembrance of the genial sun and showers that have fallen on these leaves of David Copperfield , and made me happy .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 6]: London , October , 1850 .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 56]: Preface to The Charles Dickens Edition I REMARKED in the original Preface to this Book , that I did not find it easy to get sufficiently far away from it , in the first sensations of having finished it , to refer to it with the composure which this formal heading would seem to require .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 54]: My interest in it was so recent and strong , and my mind was so divided between pleasure and regret -- pleasure in the achievement of a long design , regret in the separation from many companions -- that I was in danger of wearying the reader with personal confidences and private emotions .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 24]: Besides which , all that I could have said of the Story to any purpose , I had endeavoured to say in it .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 63]: It would concern the reader little , perhaps , to know how sorrowfully the pen is laid down at the close of a two-years ' imaginative task ; or how an Author feels as if he were dismissing some portion of himself into the shadowy world , when a crowd of the creatures of his brain are going from him for ever .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 49]: Yet , I had nothing else to tell ; unless , indeed , I were to confess -LRB- which might be of less moment still -RRB- , that no one can ever believe this Narrative , in the reading , more than I believed it in the writing .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 23]: So true are these avowals at the present day , that I can now only take the reader into one confidence more .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 11]: Of all my books , I like this the best .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 34]: It will be easily believed that I am a fond parent to every child of my fancy , and that no one can ever love that family as dearly as I love them .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 18]: But , like many fond parents , I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 7]: And his name is DAVID COPPERFIELD .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 36]: 1869 Chapter 1 I Am Born Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life , or whether that station will be held by anybody else , these pages must show .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 36]: To begin my life with the beginning of my life , I record that I was born -LRB- as I have been informed and believe -RRB- on a Friday , at twelve o'clock at night .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 18]: It was remarked that the clock began to strike , and I began to cry , simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 100]: In consideration of the day and hour of my birth , it was declared by the nurse , and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of our becoming personally acquainted , first , that I was destined to be unlucky in life ; and secondly , that I was privileged to see ghosts and spirits ; both these gifts inevitably attaching , as they believed , to all unlucky infants of either gender , born towards the small hours on a Friday night .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 30]: I need say nothing here , on the first head , because nothing can show better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified by the result .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 38]: On the second branch of the question , I will only remark , that unless I ran through that part of my inheritance while I was still a baby , I have not come into it yet .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 37]: But I do not at all complain of having been kept out of this property ; and if anybody else should be in the present enjoyment of it , he is heartily welcome to keep it .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 25]: I was born with a caul , which was advertised for sale , in the newspapers , at the low price of fifteen guineas .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 76]: Whether sea-going people were short of money about that time , or were short of faith and preferred cork jackets , I do n't know ; all I know is , that there was but one solitary bidding , and that was from an attorney connected with the bill-broking business , who offered two pounds in cash , and the balance in sherry , but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 64]: Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss -- for as to sherry , my poor dear mother 's own sherry was in the market then -- and ten years afterwards , the caul was put up in a raffle down in our part of the country , to fifty members at half-a-crown a head , the winner to spend five shillings .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 28]: I was present myself , and I remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused , at a part of myself being disposed of in that way .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 61]: The caul was won , I recollect , by an old lady with a hand-basket , who , very reluctantly , produced from it the stipulated five shillings , all in halfpence , and twopence halfpenny short -- as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic , to endeavour without any effect to prove to her .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 29]: It is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there , that she was never drowned , but died triumphantly in bed , at ninety-two .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 75]: I have understood that it was , to the last , her proudest boast , that she never had been on the water in her life , except upon a bridge ; and that over her tea -LRB- to which she was extremely partial -RRB- she , to the last , expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and others , who had the presumption to go ` meandering ' about the world .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 22]: It was in vain to represent to her that some conveniences , tea perhaps included , resulted from this objectionable practice .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 27]: She always returned , with greater emphasis and with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection , ` Let us have no meandering . '
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 16]: Not to meander myself , at present , I will go back to my birth .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 21]: I was born at Blunderstone , in Suffolk , or ` there by ' , as they say in Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 6]: I was a posthumous child .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 21]: My father 's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months , when mine opened on it .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 99]: There is something strange to me , even now , in the reflection that he never saw me ; and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I have of my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the churchyard , and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it lying out alone there in the dark night , when our little parlour was warm and bright with fire and candle , and the doors of our house were -- almost cruelly , it seemed to me sometimes -- bolted and locked against it .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 34]: An aunt of my father 's , and consequently a great-aunt of mine , of whom I shall have more to relate by and by , was the principal magnate of our family .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 112]: Miss Trotwood , or Miss Betsey , as my poor mother always called her , when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable personage to mention her at all -LRB- which was seldom -RRB- , had been married to a husband younger than herself , who was very handsome , except in the sense of the homely adage , ` handsome is , that handsome does ' -- for he was strongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey , and even of having once , on a disputed question of supplies , made some hasty but determined arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs ' window .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 23]: These evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay him off , and effect a separation by mutual consent .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 49]: He went to India with his capital , and there , according to a wild legend in our family , he was once seen riding on an elephant , in company with a Baboon ; but I think it must have been a Baboo -- or a Begum .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 15]: Anyhow , from India tidings of his death reached home , within ten years .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 62]: How they affected my aunt , nobody knew ; for immediately upon the separation , she took her maiden name again , bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way off , established herself there as a single woman with one servant , and was understood to live secluded , ever afterwards , in an inflexible retirement .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 35]: My father had once been a favourite of hers , I believe ; but she was mortally affronted by his marriage , on the ground that my mother was ' a wax doll ' .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 17]: She had never seen my mother , but she knew her to be not yet twenty .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 9]: My father and Miss Betsey never met again .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 18]: He was double my mother 's age when he married , and of but a delicate constitution .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 22]: He died a year afterwards , and , as I have said , six months before I came into the world .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 26]: This was the state of matters , on the afternoon of , what I may be excused for calling , that eventful and important Friday .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 37]: I can make no claim therefore to have known , at that time , how matters stood ; or to have any remembrance , founded on the evidence of my own senses , of what follows .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 132]: My mother was sitting by the fire , but poorly in health , and very low in spirits , looking at it through her tears , and desponding heavily about herself and the fatherless little stranger , who was already welcomed by some grosses of prophetic pins , in a drawer upstairs , to a world not at all excited on the subject of his arrival ; my mother , I say , was sitting by the fire , that bright , windy March afternoon , very timid and sad , and very doubtful of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her , when , lifting her eyes as she dried them , to the window opposite , she saw a strange lady coming up the garden .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 17]: My mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance , that it was Miss Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 40]: The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady , over the garden-fence , and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to nobody else .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 14]: When she reached the house , she gave another proof of her identity .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 65]: My father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any ordinary Christian ; and now , instead of ringing the bell , she came and looked in at that identical window , pressing the end of her nose against the glass to that extent , that my poor dear mother used to say it became perfectly flat and white in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 28]: She gave my mother such a turn , that I have always been convinced I am indebted to Miss Betsey for having been born on a Friday .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 18]: My mother had left her chair in her agitation , and gone behind it in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 40]: Miss Betsey , looking round the room , slowly and inquiringly , began on the other side , and carried her eyes on , like a Saracen 's Head in a Dutch clock , until they reached my mother .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 28]: Then she made a frown and a gesture to my mother , like one who was accustomed to be obeyed , to come and open the door .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 4]: My mother went .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 30]: ` Mrs. David Copperfield , I think , ' said Miss Betsey ; the emphasis referring , perhaps , to my mother 's mourning weeds , and her condition .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 10]: ` Yes , ' said my mother , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 9]: ` Miss Trotwood , ' said the visitor .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 12]: ` You have heard of her , I dare say ? '
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 9]: My mother answered she had had that pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 19]: And she had a disagreeable consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 11]: ` Now you see her , ' said Miss Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 13]: My mother bent her head , and begged her to walk in .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 68]: They went into the parlour my mother had come from , the fire in the best room on the other side of the passage not being lighted -- not having been lighted , indeed , since my father 's funeral ; and when they were both seated , and Miss Betsey said nothing , my mother , after vainly trying to restrain herself , began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 9]: ` Oh tut , tut , tut ! '
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 8]: said Miss Betsey , in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 6]: ` Do n't do that !
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 5]: Come , come ! '
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 19]: My mother could n't help it notwithstanding , so she cried until she had had her cry out .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 21]: ` Take off your cap , child , ' said Miss Betsey , ` and let me see you . '
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 25]: My mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd request , if she had any disposition to do so .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 31]: Therefore she did as she was told , and did it with such nervous hands that her hair -LRB- which was luxuriant and beautiful -RRB- fell all about her face .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 8]: ` Why , bless my heart ! '
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 4]: exclaimed Miss Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 8]: ` You are a very Baby ! '
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 59]: My mother was , no doubt , unusually youthful in appearance even for her years ; she hung her head , as if it were her fault , poor thing , and said , sobbing , that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish widow , and would be but a childish mother if she lived .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 71]: In a short pause which ensued , she had a fancy that she felt Miss Betsey touch her hair , and that with no ungentle hand ; but , looking at her , in her timid hope , she found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up , her hands folded on one knee , and her feet upon the fender , frowning at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 19]: ` In the name of Heaven , ' said Miss Betsey , suddenly , ` why Rookery ? '
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 10]: ` Do you mean the house , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 4]: asked my mother .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 5]: ` Why Rookery ? '
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 4]: said Miss Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 25]: ` Cookery would have been more to the purpose , if you had had any practical ideas of life , either of you . '
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 14]: ` The name was Mr. Copperfield 's choice , ' returned my mother .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 19]: ` When he bought the house , he liked to think that there were rooks about it . '
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 35]: The evening wind made such a disturbance just now , among some tall old elm-trees at the bottom of the garden , that neither my mother nor Miss Betsey could forbear glancing that way .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 73]: As the elms bent to one another , like giants who were whispering secrets , and after a few seconds of such repose , fell into a violent flurry , tossing their wild arms about , as if their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind , some weatherbeaten ragged old rooks ' - nests , burdening their higher branches , swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 7]: ` Where are the birds ? '
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 4]: asked Miss Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 5]: ` The -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 9]: My mother had been thinking of something else .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 11]: ` The rooks -- what has become of them ? '
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 4]: asked Miss Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 17]: ` There have not been any since we have lived here , ' said my mother .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 34]: ` We thought -- Mr. Copperfield thought -- it was quite a large rookery ; but the nests were very old ones , and the birds have deserted them a long while . '
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 7]: ` David Copperfield all over ! '
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 4]: cried Miss Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 8]: ` David Copperfield from head to foot !
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 28]: Calls a house a rookery when there 's not a rook near it , and takes the birds on trust , because he sees the nests ! '
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 78]: ` Mr. Copperfield , ' returned my mother , ` is dead , and if you dare to speak unkindly of him to me -- ' My poor dear mother , I suppose , had some momentary intention of committing an assault and battery upon my aunt , who could easily have settled her with one hand , even if my mother had been in far better training for such an encounter than she was that evening .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 23]: But it passed with the action of rising from her chair ; and she sat down again very meekly , and fainted .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 27]: When she came to herself , or when Miss Betsey had restored her , whichever it was , she found the latter standing at the window .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 32]: The twilight was by this time shading down into darkness ; and dimly as they saw each other , they could not have done that without the aid of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 46]: said Miss Betsey , coming back to her chair , as if she had only been taking a casual look at the prospect ; ` and when do you expect -- ' ' I am all in a tremble , ' faltered my mother . '
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 9]: I do n't know what 's the matter .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 9]: I shall die , I am sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 12]: ` No , no , no , ' said Miss Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 6]: ` Have some tea . '
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 19]: ` Oh dear me , dear me , do you think it will do me any good ? '
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 8]: cried my mother in a helpless manner .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 11]: ` Of course it will , ' said Miss Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 7]: ` It 's nothing but fancy .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 9]: What do you call your girl ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 21]: I do n't know that it will be a girl , yet , ma'am , ' said my mother innocently .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 6]: ` Bless the Baby ! '
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 34]: exclaimed Miss Betsey , unconsciously quoting the second sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer upstairs , but applying it to my mother instead of me , ' I do n't mean that .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 6]: I mean your servant-girl . '
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 8]: ` Peggotty , ' said my mother .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 4]: ` Peggotty ! '
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 8]: repeated Miss Betsey , with some indignation .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 27]: ` Do you mean to say , child , that any human being has gone into a Christian church , and got herself named Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 13]: ` It 's her surname , ' said my mother , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 19]: ` Mr. Copperfield called her by it , because her Christian name was the same as mine . '
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 3]: ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 3]: Peggotty ! '
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 9]: cried Miss Betsey , opening the parlour door .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 3]: ` Tea .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 7]: Your mistress is a little unwell .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 5]: Do n't dawdle . '
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 87]: Having issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she had been a recognized authority in the house ever since it had been a house , and having looked out to confront the amazed Peggotty coming along the passage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice , Miss Betsey shut the door again , and sat down as before : with her feet on the fender , the skirt of her dress tucked up , and her hands folded on one knee .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 16]: ` You were speaking about its being a girl , ' said Miss Betsey . '
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 10]: I have no doubt it will be a girl .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 11]: I have a presentiment that it must be a girl .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 29]: Now child , from the moment of the birth of this girl -- ' ` Perhaps boy , ' my mother took the liberty of putting in . '
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 19]: I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl , ' returned Miss Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 5]: ` Do n't contradict .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 18]: From the moment of this girl 's birth , child , I intend to be her friend .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 18]: I intend to be her godmother , and I beg you 'll call her Betsey Trotwood Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 12]: There must be no mistakes in life with THIS Betsey Trotwood .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 12]: There must be no trifling with HER affections , poor dear .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 21]: She must be well brought up , and well guarded from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 8]: I must make that My care . '
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 39]: There was a twitch of Miss Betsey 's head , after each of these sentences , as if her own old wrongs were working within her , and she repressed any plainer reference to them by strong constraint .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 52]: So my mother suspected , at least , as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire : too much scared by Miss Betsey , too uneasy in herself , and too subdued and bewildered altogether , to observe anything very clearly , or to know what to say .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 11]: ` And was David good to you , child ? '
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 24]: asked Miss Betsey , when she had been silent for a little while , and these motions of her head had gradually ceased .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 7]: ` Were you comfortable together ? '
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 11]: ` We were very happy , ' said my mother .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 11]: ` Mr. Copperfield was only too good to me . '
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 11]: ` What , he spoilt you , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 4]: returned Miss Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 28]: ` For being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world again , yes , I fear he did indeed , ' sobbed my mother .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 5]: Do n't cry ! '
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 4]: said Miss Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 25]: ` You were not equally matched , child -- if any two people can be equally matched -- and so I asked the question .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 10]: You were an orphan , were n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 7]: ` And a governess ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 13]: I was nursery-governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came to visit .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 34]: Mr. Copperfield was very kind to me , and took a great deal of notice of me , and paid me a good deal of attention , and at last proposed to me .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 5]: And I accepted him .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 12]: And so we were married , ' said my mother simply .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 4]: Poor Baby ! '
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 13]: mused Miss Betsey , with her frown still bent upon the fire .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 8]: ` Do you know anything ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 12]: I beg your pardon , ma'am , ' faltered my mother .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 13]: ` About keeping house , for instance , ' said Miss Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 12]: ` Not much , I fear , ' returned my mother .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 9]: ` Not so much as I could wish .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 19]: But Mr. Copperfield was teaching me -- ' -LRB- ` Much he knew about it himself ! ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 7]: said Miss Betsey in a parenthesis .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 46]: - ` And I hope I should have improved , being very anxious to learn , and he very patient to teach me , if the great misfortune of his death ' -- my mother broke down again here , and could get no farther .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 6]: ` Well , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 4]: said Miss Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 32]: - ' I kept my housekeeping-book regularly , and balanced it with Mr. Copperfield every night , ' cried my mother in another burst of distress , and breaking down again .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 6]: ` Well , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 4]: said Miss Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 8]: ` Do n't cry any more . '
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 58]: - ` And I am sure we never had a word of difference respecting it , except when Mr. Copperfield objected to my threes and fives being too much like each other , or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines , ' resumed my mother in another burst , and breaking down again .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 29]: ` You 'll make yourself ill , ' said Miss Betsey , ` and you know that will not be good either for you or for my god-daughter .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 7]: You must n't do it ! '
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 19]: This argument had some share in quieting my mother , though her increasing indisposition had a larger one .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 19]: There was an interval of silence , only broken by Miss Betsey 's occasionally ejaculating ` Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 10]: as she sat with her feet upon the fender .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 23]: ` David had bought an annuity for himself with his money , I know , ' said she , by and by .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 9]: ` What did he do for you ? '
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 34]: ` Mr. Copperfield , ' said my mother , answering with some difficulty , ` was so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to me . '
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 5]: ` How much ? '
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 5]: asked Miss Betsey . '
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 13]: A hundred and five pounds a year , ' said my mother .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 12]: ` He might have done worse , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 8]: The word was appropriate to the moment .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 96]: My mother was so much worse that Peggotty , coming in with the teaboard and candles , and seeing at a glance how ill she was , -- as Miss Betsey might have done sooner if there had been light enough , -- conveyed her upstairs to her own room with all speed ; and immediately dispatched Ham Peggotty , her nephew , who had been for some days past secreted in the house , unknown to my mother , as a special messenger in case of emergency , to fetch the nurse and doctor .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 49]: Those allied powers were considerably astonished , when they arrived within a few minutes of each other , to find an unknown lady of portentous appearance , sitting before the fire , with her bonnet tied over her left arm , stopping her ears with jewellers ' cotton .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 60]: Peggotty knowing nothing about her , and my mother saying nothing about her , she was quite a mystery in the parlour ; and the fact of her having a magazine of jewellers ' cotton in her pocket , and sticking the article in her ears in that way , did not detract from the solemnity of her presence .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 51]: The doctor having been upstairs and come down again , and having satisfied himself , I suppose , that there was a probability of this unknown lady and himself having to sit there , face to face , for some hours , laid himself out to be polite and social .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 14]: He was the meekest of his sex , the mildest of little men .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 16]: He sidled in and out of a room , to take up the less space .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 14]: He walked as softly as the Ghost in Hamlet , and more slowly .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 23]: He carried his head on one side , partly in modest depreciation of himself , partly in modest propitiation of everybody else .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 17]: It is nothing to say that he had n't a word to throw at a dog .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 12]: He could n't have thrown a word at a mad dog .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 53]: He might have offered him one gently , or half a one , or a fragment of one ; for he spoke as slowly as he walked ; but he would n't have been rude to him , and he could n't have been quick with him , for any earthly consideration .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 48]: Mr. Chillip , looking mildly at my aunt with his head on one side , and making her a little bow , said , in allusion to the jewellers ' cotton , as he softly touched his left ear : ` Some local irritation , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 15]: replied my aunt , pulling the cotton out of one ear like a cork .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 30]: Mr. Chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness -- as he told my mother afterwards -- that it was a mercy he did n't lose his presence of mind .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 13]: But he repeated sweetly : ` Some local irritation , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 4]: ` Nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 13]: replied my aunt , and corked herself again , at one blow .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 32]: Mr. Chillip could do nothing after this , but sit and look at her feebly , as she sat and looked at the fire , until he was called upstairs again .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 12]: After some quarter of an hour 's absence , he returned .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 15]: said my aunt , taking the cotton out of the ear nearest to him .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 22]: ` Well , ma'am , ' returned Mr. Chillip , ` we are - we are progressing slowly , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 8]: ` Ba -- a -- ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 13]: said my aunt , with a perfect shake on the contemptuous interjection .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 6]: And corked herself as before .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 30]: Really -- really -- as Mr. Chillip told my mother , he was almost shocked ; speaking in a professional point of view alone , he was almost shocked .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 30]: But he sat and looked at her , notwithstanding , for nearly two hours , as she sat looking at the fire , until he was again called out .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 8]: After another absence , he again returned .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 13]: said my aunt , taking out the cotton on that side again .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 22]: ` Well , ma'am , ' returned Mr. Chillip , ` we are -- we are progressing slowly , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 8]: ` Ya -- a -- ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 16]: With such a snarl at him , that Mr. Chillip absolutely could not bear it .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 13]: It was really calculated to break his spirit , he said afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 25]: He preferred to go and sit upon the stairs , in the dark and a strong draught , until he was again sent for .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 76]: Ham Peggotty , who went to the national school , and was a very dragon at his catechism , and who may therefore be regarded as a credible witness , reported next day , that happening to peep in at the parlour-door an hour after this , he was instantly descried by Miss Betsey , then walking to and fro in a state of agitation , and pounced upon before he could make his escape .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 47]: That there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices overhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude , from the circumstance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on whom to expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 61]: That , marching him constantly up and down by the collar -LRB- as if he had been taking too much laudanum -RRB- , she , at those times , shook him , rumpled his hair , made light of his linen , stopped his ears as if she confounded them with her own , and otherwise tousled and maltreated him .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 35]: This was in part confirmed by his aunt , who saw him at half past twelve o'clock , soon after his release , and affirmed that he was then as red as I was .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 19]: The mild Mr. Chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time , if at any time .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 36]: He sidled into the parlour as soon as he was at liberty , and said to my aunt in his meekest manner : ` Well , ma'am , I am happy to congratulate you . '
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 5]: ` What upon ? '
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 6]: said my aunt , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 34]: Mr. Chillip was fluttered again , by the extreme severity of my aunt 's manner ; so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile , to mollify her .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 12]: ` Mercy on the man , what 's he doing ! '
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 6]: cried my aunt , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 7]: ` Ca n't he speak ? '
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 18]: ` Be calm , my dear ma'am , ' said Mr. Chillip , in his softest accents .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 12]: ` There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 4]: Be calm . '
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 28]: It has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt did n't shake him , and shake what he had to say , out of him .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 18]: She only shook her own head at him , but in a way that made him quail .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 25]: ` Well , ma'am , ' resumed Mr. Chillip , as soon as he had courage , ' I am happy to congratulate you .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 12]: All is now over , ma'am , and well over . '
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 23]: During the five minutes or so that Mr. Chillip devoted to the delivery of this oration , my aunt eyed him narrowly .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 6]: ` How is she ? '
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 17]: said my aunt , folding her arms with her bonnet still tied on one of them .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 20]: ` Well , ma'am , she will soon be quite comfortable , I hope , ' returned Mr. Chillip .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 20]: ` Quite as comfortable as we can expect a young mother to be , under these melancholy domestic circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 14]: There can not be any objection to your seeing her presently , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 7]: It may do her good . '
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 4]: ` And SHE .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 5]: How is SHE ? '
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 6]: said my aunt , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 22]: Mr. Chillip laid his head a little more on one side , and looked at my aunt like an amiable bird .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 9]: ` The baby , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 6]: ` How is she ? '
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 15]: ` Ma'am , ' returned Mr. Chillip , ' I apprehended you had known .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 6]: It 's a boy . '
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 46]: My aunt said never a word , but took her bonnet by the strings , in the manner of a sling , aimed a blow at Mr. Chillip 's head with it , put it on bent , walked out , and never came back .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 33]: She vanished like a discontented fairy ; or like one of those supernatural beings , whom it was popularly supposed I was entitled to see ; and never came back any more .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 80]: I lay in my basket , and my mother lay in her bed ; but Betsey Trotwood Copperfield was for ever in the land of dreams and shadows , the tremendous region whence I had so lately travelled ; and the light upon the window of our room shone out upon the earthly bourne of all such travellers , and the mound above the ashes and the dust that once was he , without whom I had never been .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 85]: Chapter 2 I Observe The first objects that assume a distinct presence before me , as I look far back , into the blank of my infancy , are my mother with her pretty hair and youthful shape , and Peggotty with no shape at all , and eyes so dark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face , and cheeks and arms so hard and red that I wondered the birds did n't peck her in preference to apples .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 37]: I believe I can remember these two at a little distance apart , dwarfed to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor , and I going unsteadily from the one to the other .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 46]: I have an impression on my mind which I can not distinguish from actual remembrance , of the touch of Peggotty 's forefinger as she used to hold it out to me , and of its being roughened by needlework , like a pocket nutmeg-grater .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 51]: This may be fancy , though I think the memory of most of us can go farther back into such times than many of us suppose ; just as I believe the power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite wonderful for its closeness and accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 70]: Indeed , I think that most grown men who are remarkable in this respect , may with greater propriety be said not to have lost the faculty , than to have acquired it ; the rather , as I generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness , and gentleness , and capacity of being pleased , which are also an inheritance they have preserved from their childhood .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 86]: I might have a misgiving that I am ` meandering ' in stopping to say this , but that it brings me to remark that I build these conclusions , in part upon my own experience of myself ; and if it should appear from anything I may set down in this narrative that I was a child of close observation , or that as a man I have a strong memory of my childhood , I undoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 38]: Looking back , as I was saying , into the blank of my infancy , the first objects I can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of things , are my mother and Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 6]: What else do I remember ?
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 4]: Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 24]: There comes out of the cloud , our house -- not new to me , but quite familiar , in its earliest remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 66]: On the ground-floor is Peggotty 's kitchen , opening into a back yard ; with a pigeon-house on a pole , in the centre , without any pigeons in it ; a great dog - kennel in a corner , without any dog ; and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me , walking about , in a menacing and ferocious manner .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 40]: There is one cock who gets upon a post to crow , and seems to take particular notice of me as I look at him through the kitchen window , who makes me shiver , he is so fierce .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 40]: Of the geese outside the side-gate who come waddling after me with their long necks stretched out when I go that way , I dream at night : as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 15]: Here is a long passage -- what an enormous perspective I make of it !
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 11]: - leading from Peggotty 's kitchen to the front door .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 81]: A dark store-room opens out of it , and that is a place to be run past at night ; for I do n't know what may be among those tubs and jars and old tea-chests , when there is nobody in there with a dimly-burning light , letting a mouldy air come out of the door , in which there is the smell of soap , pickles , pepper , candles , and coffee , all at one whiff .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 59]: Then there are the two parlours : the parlour in which we sit of an evening , my mother and I and Peggotty -- for Peggotty is quite our companion , when her work is done and we are alone -- and the best parlour where we sit on a Sunday ; grandly , but not so comfortably .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 46]: There is something of a doleful air about that room to me , for Peggotty has told me -- I do n't know when , but apparently ages ago -- about my father 's funeral , and the company having their black cloaks put on .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 22]: One Sunday night my mother reads to Peggotty and me in there , how Lazarus was raised up from the dead .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 45]: And I am so frightened that they are afterwards obliged to take me out of bed , and show me the quiet churchyard out of the bedroom window , with the dead all lying in their graves at rest , below the solemn moon .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 34]: There is nothing half so green that I know anywhere , as the grass of that churchyard ; nothing half so shady as its trees ; nothing half so quiet as its tombstones .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 69]: The sheep are feeding there , when I kneel up , early in the morning , in my little bed in a closet within my mother 's room , to look out at it ; and I see the red light shining on the sun-dial , and think within myself , ` Is the sun-dial glad , I wonder , that it can tell the time again ? '
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 8]: Here is our pew in the church .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 5]: What a high-backed pew !
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 52]: With a window near it , out of which our house can be seen , and IS seen many times during the morning 's service , by Peggotty , who likes to make herself as sure as she can that it 's not being robbed , or is not in flames .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 36]: But though Peggotty 's eye wanders , she is much offended if mine does , and frowns to me , as I stand upon the seat , that I am to look at the clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 45]: But I ca n't always look at him - I know him without that white thing on , and I am afraid of his wondering why I stare so , and perhaps stopping the service to inquire -- and what am I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 14]: It 's a dreadful thing to gape , but I must do something .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 14]: I look at my mother , but she pretends not to see me .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 16]: I look at a boy in the aisle , and he makes faces at me .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 44]: I look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through the porch , and there I see a stray sheep -- I do n't mean a sinner , but mutton -- half making up his mind to come into the church .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 29]: I feel that if I looked at him any longer , I might be tempted to say something out loud ; and what would become of me then !
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 50]: I look up at the monumental tablets on the wall , and try to think of Mr. Bodgers late of this parish , and what the feelings of Mrs. Bodgers must have been , when affliction sore , long time Mr. Bodgers bore , and physicians were in vain .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 31]: I wonder whether they called in Mr. Chillip , and he was in vain ; and if so , how he likes to be reminded of it once a week .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 61]: I look from Mr. Chillip , in his Sunday neckcloth , to the pulpit ; and think what a good place it would be to play in , and what a castle it would make , with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it , and having the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 51]: In time my eyes gradually shut up ; and , from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a drowsy song in the heat , I hear nothing , until I fall off the seat with a crash , and am taken out , more dead than alive , by Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 44]: And now I see the outside of our house , with the latticed bedroom-windows standing open to let in the sweet-smelling air , and the ragged old rooks ' - nests still dangling in the elm-trees at the bottom of the front garden .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 91]: Now I am in the garden at the back , beyond the yard where the empty pigeon-house and dog-kennel are -- a very preserve of butterflies , as I remember it , with a high fence , and a gate and padlock ; where the fruit clusters on the trees , riper and richer than fruit has ever been since , in any other garden , and where my mother gathers some in a basket , while I stand by , bolting furtive gooseberries , and trying to look unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 14]: A great wind rises , and the summer is gone in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 13]: We are playing in the winter twilight , dancing about the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 53]: When my mother is out of breath and rests herself in an elbow-chair , I watch her winding her bright curls round her fingers , and straitening her waist , and nobody knows better than I do that she likes to look so well , and is proud of being so pretty .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 8]: That is among my very earliest impressions .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 47]: That , and a sense that we were both a little afraid of Peggotty , and submitted ourselves in most things to her direction , were among the first opinions -- if they may be so called -- that I ever derived from what I saw .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 14]: Peggotty and I were sitting one night by the parlour fire , alone .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 9]: I had been reading to Peggotty about crocodiles .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 39]: I must have read very perspicuously , or the poor soul must have been deeply interested , for I remember she had a cloudy impression , after I had done , that they were a sort of vegetable .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 54]: I was tired of reading , and dead sleepy ; but having leave , as a high treat , to sit up until my mother came home from spending the evening at a neighbour 's , I would rather have died upon my post -LRB- of course -RRB- than have gone to bed .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 17]: I had reached that stage of sleepiness when Peggotty seemed to swell and grow immensely large .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 45]: I propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers , and looked perseveringly at her as she sat at work ; at the little bit of wax-candle she kept for her thread -- how old it looked , being so wrinkled in all directions !
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 58]: -- at the little house with a thatched roof , where the yard-measure lived ; at her work-box with a sliding lid , with a view of St. Paul 's Cathedral -LRB- with a pink dome -RRB- painted on the top ; at the brass thimble on her finger ; at herself , whom I thought lovely .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 22]: I felt so sleepy , that I knew if I lost sight of anything for a moment , I was gone .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 16]: ` Peggotty , ' says I , suddenly , ` were you ever married ? '
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 10]: ` Lord , Master Davy , ' replied Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 10]: ` What 's put marriage in your head ? '
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 13]: She answered with such a start , that it quite awoke me .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 24]: And then she stopped in her work , and looked at me , with her needle drawn out to its thread 's length .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 10]: ` But WERE you ever married , Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 15]: says I. ` You are a very handsome woman , a n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 27]: I thought her in a different style from my mother , certainly ; but of another school of beauty , I considered her a perfect example .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 20]: There was a red velvet footstool in the best parlour , on which my mother had painted a nosegay .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 21]: The ground-work of that stool , and Peggotty 's complexion appeared to me to be one and the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 16]: The stool was smooth , and Peggotty was rough , but that made no difference .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 7]: ` Me handsome , Davy ! '
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 3]: said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 8]: ` Lawk , no , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 10]: But what put marriage in your head ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 5]: I do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 19]: -- You must n't marry more than one person at a time , may you , Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 13]: ` Certainly not , ' says Peggotty , with the promptest decision .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 28]: ` But if you marry a person , and the person dies , why then you may marry another person , may n't you , Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 16]: ` YOU MAY , ' says Peggotty , ` if you choose , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 8]: That 's a matter of opinion . '
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 10]: ` But what is your opinion , Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 20]: said I. I asked her , and looked curiously at her , because she looked so curiously at me .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 46]: ` My opinion is , ' said Peggotty , taking her eyes from me , after a little indecision and going on with her work , ` that I never was married myself , Master Davy , and that I do n't expect to be .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 10]: That 's all I know about the subject . '
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 15]: ` You a n't cross , I suppose , Peggotty , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 10]: said I , after sitting quiet for a minute .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 56]: I really thought she was , she had been so short with me ; but I was quite mistaken : for she laid aside her work -LRB- which was a stocking of her own -RRB- , and opening her arms wide , took my curly head within them , and gave it a good squeeze .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 38]: I know it was a good squeeze , because , being very plump , whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed , some of the buttons on the back of her gown flew off .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 19]: And I recollect two bursting to the opposite side of the parlour , while she was hugging me .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 35]: ` Now let me hear some more about the Crorkindills , ' said Peggotty , who was not quite right in the name yet , ` for I a n't heard half enough . '
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 24]: I could n't quite understand why Peggotty looked so queer , or why she was so ready to go back to the crocodiles .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 90]: However , we returned to those monsters , with fresh wakefulness on my part , and we left their eggs in the sand for the sun to hatch ; and we ran away from them , and baffled them by constantly turning , which they were unable to do quickly , on account of their unwieldy make ; and we went into the water after them , as natives , and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats ; and in short we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 33]: I did , at least ; but I had my doubts of Peggotty , who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into various parts of her face and arms , all the time .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 17]: We had exhausted the crocodiles , and begun with the alligators , when the garden-bell rang .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 43]: We went out to the door ; and there was my mother , looking unusually pretty , I thought , and with her a gentleman with beautiful black hair and whiskers , who had walked home with us from church last Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 53]: As my mother stooped down on the threshold to take me in her arms and kiss me , the gentleman said I was a more highly privileged little fellow than a monarch -- or something like that ; for my later understanding comes , I am sensible , to my aid here .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 7]: ` What does that mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 8]: I asked him , over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 40]: He patted me on the head ; but somehow , I did n't like him or his deep voice , and I was jealous that his hand should touch my mother 's in touching me -- which it did .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 11]: I put it away , as well as I could .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 6]: ` Oh , Davy ! '
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 4]: remonstrated my mother .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 5]: ` Dear boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 5]: said the gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 9]: I can not wonder at his devotion ! '
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 14]: I never saw such a beautiful colour on my mother 's face before .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 33]: She gently chid me for being rude ; and , keeping me close to her shawl , turned to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her home .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 30]: She put out her hand to him as she spoke , and , as he met it with his own , she glanced , I thought , at me .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 29]: ` Let us say `` good night '' , my fine boy , ' said the gentleman , when he had bent his head -- I saw him !
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 8]: -- over my mother 's little glove .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 5]: ` Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 5]: said I. ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 11]: Let us be the best friends in the world ! '
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 6]: said the gentleman , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 5]: ` Shake hands ! '
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 17]: My right hand was in my mother 's left , so I gave him the other .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 12]: ` Why , that 's the Wrong hand , Davy ! '
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 4]: laughed the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 29]: My mother drew my right hand forward , but I was resolved , for my former reason , not to give it him , and I did not .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 24]: I gave him the other , and he shook it heartily , and said I was a brave fellow , and went away .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 30]: At this minute I see him turn round in the garden , and give us a last look with his ill-omened black eyes , before the door was shut .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 26]: Peggotty , who had not said a word or moved a finger , secured the fastenings instantly , and we all went into the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 34]: My mother , contrary to her usual habit , instead of coming to the elbow-chair by the fire , remained at the other end of the room , and sat singing to herself .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 36]: - ` Hope you have had a pleasant evening , ma'am , ' said Peggotty , standing as stiff as a barrel in the centre of the room , with a candlestick in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 29]: ` Much obliged to you , Peggotty , ' returned my mother , in a cheerful voice , ' I have had a VERY pleasant evening . ' '
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 14]: A stranger or so makes an agreeable change , ' suggested Peggotty . '
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 12]: A very agreeable change , indeed , ' returned my mother .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 43]: Peggotty continuing to stand motionless in the middle of the room , and my mother resuming her singing , I fell asleep , though I was not so sound asleep but that I could hear voices , without hearing what they said .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 23]: When I half awoke from this uncomfortable doze , I found Peggotty and my mother both in tears , and both talking .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 19]: ` Not such a one as this , Mr. Copperfield would n't have liked , ' said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 11]: ` That I say , and that I swear ! '
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 5]: ` Good Heavens ! '
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 11]: cried my mother , ` you 'll drive me mad !
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 14]: Was ever any poor girl so ill-used by her servants as I am !
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 13]: Why do I do myself the injustice of calling myself a girl ?
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 9]: Have I never been married , Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 12]: ` God knows you have , ma'am , ' returned Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 71]: ` Then , how can you dare , ' said my mother -- ` you know I do n't mean how can you dare , Peggotty , but how can you have the heart -- to make me so uncomfortable and say such bitter things to me , when you are well aware that I have n't , out of this place , a single friend to turn to ? '
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 20]: ` The more 's the reason , ' returned Peggotty , ` for saying that it wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 6]: That it wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 7]: No price could make it do .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 3]: No ! '
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 18]: -- I thought Peggotty would have thrown the candlestick away , she was so emphatic with it .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 29]: ` How can you be so aggravating , ' said my mother , shedding more tears than before , ` as to talk in such an unjust manner !
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 38]: How can you go on as if it was all settled and arranged , Peggotty , when I tell you over and over again , you cruel thing , that beyond the commonest civilities nothing has passed !
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 5]: You talk of admiration .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 6]: What am I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 16]: If people are so silly as to indulge the sentiment , is it my fault ?
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 10]: What am I to do , I ask you ?
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 30]: Would you wish me to shave my head and black my face , or disfigure myself with a burn , or a scald , or something of that sort ?
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 8]: I dare say you would , Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 10]: I dare say you 'd quite enjoy it . '
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 14]: Peggotty seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 30]: ` And my dear boy , ' cried my mother , coming to the elbow-chair in which I was , and caressing me , ` my own little Davy !
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 27]: Is it to be hinted to me that I am wanting in affection for my precious treasure , the dearest little fellow that ever was ! '
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 15]: ` Nobody never went and hinted no such a thing , ' said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 7]: ` You did , Peggotty ! '
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 4]: returned my mother .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 6]: ` You know you did .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 60]: What else was it possible to infer from what you said , you unkind creature , when you know as well as I do , that on his account only last quarter I would n't buy myself a new parasol , though that old green one is frayed the whole way up , and the fringe is perfectly mangy ?
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 7]: You know it is , Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 7]: You ca n't deny it . '
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 24]: Then , turning affectionately to me , with her cheek against mine , ` Am I a naughty mama to you , Davy ?
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 12]: Am I a nasty , cruel , selfish , bad mama ?
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 35]: Say I am , my child ; say `` yes '' , dear boy , and Peggotty will love you ; and Peggotty 's love is a great deal better than mine , Davy .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 12]: I do n't love you at all , do I ? '
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 9]: At this , we all fell a-crying together .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 21]: I think I was the loudest of the party , but I am sure we were all sincere about it .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 25]: I was quite heart-broken myself , and am afraid that in the first transports of wounded tenderness I called Peggotty a ` Beast ' .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 56]: That honest creature was in deep affliction , I remember , and must have become quite buttonless on the occasion ; for a little volley of those explosives went off , when , after having made it up with my mother , she kneeled down by the elbow-chair , and made it up with me .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 7]: We went to bed greatly dejected .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 38]: My sobs kept waking me , for a long time ; and when one very strong sob quite hoisted me up in bed , I found my mother sitting on the coverlet , and leaning over me .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 14]: I fell asleep in her arms , after that , and slept soundly .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 31]: Whether it was the following Sunday when I saw the gentleman again , or whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared , I can not recall .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 10]: I do n't profess to be clear about dates .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 16]: But there he was , in church , and he walked home with us afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 19]: He came in , too , to look at a famous geranium we had , in the parlour-window .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 31]: It did not appear to me that he took much notice of it , but before he went he asked my mother to give him a bit of the blossom .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 36]: She begged him to choose it for himself , but he refused to do that -- I could not understand why -- so she plucked it for him , and gave it into his hand .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 37]: He said he would never , never part with it any more ; and I thought he must be quite a fool not to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 18]: Peggotty began to be less with us , of an evening , than she had always been .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 44]: My mother deferred to her very much -- more than usual , it occurred to me -- and we were all three excellent friends ; still we were different from what we used to be , and were not so comfortable among ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 50]: Sometimes I fancied that Peggotty perhaps objected to my mother 's wearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers , or to her going so often to visit at that neighbour 's ; but I could n't , to my satisfaction , make out how it was .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 14]: Gradually , I became used to seeing the gentleman with the black whiskers .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 68]: I liked him no better than at first , and had the same uneasy jealousy of him ; but if I had any reason for it beyond a child 's instinctive dislike , and a general idea that Peggotty and I could make much of my mother without any help , it certainly was not THE reason that I might have found if I had been older .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 12]: No such thing came into my mind , or near it .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 40]: I could observe , in little pieces , as it were ; but as to making a net of a number of these pieces , and catching anybody in it , that was , as yet , beyond me .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 31]: One autumn morning I was with my mother in the front garden , when Mr. Murdstone -- I knew him by that name now -- came by , on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 46]: He reined up his horse to salute my mother , and said he was going to Lowestoft to see some friends who were there with a yacht , and merrily proposed to take me on the saddle before him if I would like the ride .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 42]: The air was so clear and pleasant , and the horse seemed to like the idea of the ride so much himself , as he stood snorting and pawing at the garden-gate , that I had a great desire to go .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 62]: So I was sent upstairs to Peggotty to be made spruce ; and in the meantime Mr. Murdstone dismounted , and , with his horse 's bridle drawn over his arm , walked slowly up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence , while my mother walked slowly up and down on the inner to keep him company .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 62]: I recollect Peggotty and I peeping out at them from my little window ; I recollect how closely they seemed to be examining the sweetbriar between them , as they strolled along ; and how , from being in a perfectly angelic temper , Peggotty turned cross in a moment , and brushed my hair the wrong way , excessively hard .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 22]: Mr. Murdstone and I were soon off , and trotting along on the green turf by the side of the road .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 46]: He held me quite easily with one arm , and I do n't think I was restless usually ; but I could not make up my mind to sit in front of him without turning my head sometimes , and looking up in his face .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 57]: He had that kind of shallow black eye -- I want a better word to express an eye that has no depth in it to be looked into -- which , when it is abstracted , seems from some peculiarity of light to be disfigured , for a moment at a time , by a cast .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 28]: Several times when I glanced at him , I observed that appearance with a sort of awe , and wondered what he was thinking about so closely .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 24]: His hair and whiskers were blacker and thicker , looked at so near , than even I had given them credit for being .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 40]: A squareness about the lower part of his face , and the dotted indication of the strong black beard he shaved close every day , reminded me of the wax-work that had travelled into our neighbourhood some half-a-year before .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 29]: This , his regular eyebrows , and the rich white , and black , and brown , of his complexion -- confound his complexion , and his memory !
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 17]: -- made me think him , in spite of my misgivings , a very handsome man .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 14]: I have no doubt that my poor dear mother thought him so too .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 21]: We went to an hotel by the sea , where two gentlemen were smoking cigars in a room by themselves .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 19]: Each of them was lying on at least four chairs , and had a large rough jacket on .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 20]: In a corner was a heap of coats and boat-cloaks , and a flag , all bundled up together .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 27]: They both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner , when we came in , and said , ` Halloa , Murdstone !
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 7]: We thought you were dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 9]: ` Not yet , ' said Mr. Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 8]: ` And who 's this shaver ? '
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 11]: said one of the gentlemen , taking hold of me .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 10]: ` That 's Davy , ' returned Mr. Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 5]: ` Davy who ? '
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 4]: said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 4]: ` Jones ? '
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 8]: ` Copperfield , ' said Mr. Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 7]: Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield 's encumbrance ? '
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 4]: cried the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 7]: ` The pretty little widow ? '
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 16]: ` Quinion , ' said Mr. Murdstone , ` take care , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 5]: Somebody 's sharp . '
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 5]: ` Who is ? '
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 6]: asked the gentleman , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 11]: I looked up , quickly ; being curious to know .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 11]: ` Only Brooks of Sheffield , ' said Mr. Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 26]: I was quite relieved to find that it was only Brooks of Sheffield ; for , at first , I really thought it was I .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 37]: There seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of Mr. Brooks of Sheffield , for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he was mentioned , and Mr. Murdstone was a good deal amused also .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 33]: After some laughing , the gentleman whom he had called Quinion , said : ` And what is the opinion of Brooks of Sheffield , in reference to the projected business ? '
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 33]: ` Why , I do n't know that Brooks understands much about it at present , ' replied Mr. Murdstone ; ` but he is not generally favourable , I believe . '
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 26]: There was more laughter at this , and Mr. Quinion said he would ring the bell for some sherry in which to drink to Brooks .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 41]: This he did ; and when the wine came , he made me have a little , with a biscuit , and , before I drank it , stand up and say , ` Confusion to Brooks of Sheffield ! '
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 26]: The toast was received with great applause , and such hearty laughter that it made me laugh too ; at which they laughed the more .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 8]: In short , we quite enjoyed ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 56]: We walked about on the cliff after that , and sat on the grass , and looked at things through a telescope -- I could make out nothing myself when it was put to my eye , but I pretended I could -- and then we came back to the hotel to an early dinner .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 49]: All the time we were out , the two gentlemen smoked incessantly -- which , I thought , if I might judge from the smell of their rough coats , they must have been doing , ever since the coats had first come home from the tailor 's .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 28]: I must not forget that we went on board the yacht , where they all three descended into the cabin , and were busy with some papers .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 17]: I saw them quite hard at work , when I looked down through the open skylight .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 51]: They left me , during this time , with a very nice man with a very large head of red hair and a very small shiny hat upon it , who had got a cross-barred shirt or waistcoat on , with ` Skylark ' in capital letters across the chest .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 48]: I thought it was his name ; and that as he lived on board ship and had n't a street door to put his name on , he put it there instead ; but when I called him Mr. Skylark , he said it meant the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 16]: I observed all day that Mr. Murdstone was graver and steadier than the two gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 7]: They were very gay and careless .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 12]: They joked freely with one another , but seldom with him .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 27]: It appeared to me that he was more clever and cold than they were , and that they regarded him with something of my own feeling .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 75]: I remarked that , once or twice when Mr. Quinion was talking , he looked at Mr. Murdstone sideways , as if to make sure of his not being displeased ; and that once when Mr. Passnidge -LRB- the other gentleman -RRB- was in high spirits , he trod upon his foot , and gave him a secret caution with his eyes , to observe Mr. Murdstone , who was sitting stern and silent .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 30]: Nor do I recollect that Mr. Murdstone laughed at all that day , except at the Sheffield joke -- and that , by the by , was his own .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 8]: We went home early in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 29]: It was a very fine evening , and my mother and he had another stroll by the sweetbriar , while I was sent in to get my tea .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 25]: When he was gone , my mother asked me all about the day I had had , and what they had said and done .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 31]: I mentioned what they had said about her , and she laughed , and told me they were impudent fellows who talked nonsense -- but I knew it pleased her .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 12]: I knew it quite as well as I know it now .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 38]: I took the opportunity of asking if she was at all acquainted with Mr. Brooks of Sheffield , but she answered No , only she supposed he must be a manufacturer in the knife and fork way .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 55]: Can I say of her face -- altered as I have reason to remember it , perished as I know it is -- that it is gone , when here it comes before me at this instant , as distinct as any face that I may choose to look on in a crowded street ?
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 34]: Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty , that it faded , and was no more , when its breath falls on my cheek now , as it fell that night ?
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 44]: Can I say she ever changed , when my remembrance brings her back to life , thus only ; and , truer to its loving youth than I have been , or man ever is , still holds fast what it cherished then ?
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 27]: I write of her just as she was when I had gone to bed after this talk , and she came to bid me good night .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 33]: She kneeled down playfully by the side of the bed , and laying her chin upon her hands , and laughing , said : ` What was it they said , Davy ?
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 4]: Tell me again .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 8]: I ca n't believe it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 8]: `` Bewitching -- '' ' I began .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 12]: My mother put her hands upon my lips to stop me .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 12]: ` It was never bewitching , ' she said , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 10]: ` It never could have been bewitching , Davy .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 8]: Now I know it was n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 6]: ` Yes , it was .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 11]: `` Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield '' , ' I repeated stoutly .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 8]: ` And , `` pretty . '' '
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 10]: ` No , no , it was never pretty .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 16]: Not pretty , ' interposed my mother , laying her fingers on my lips again .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 5]: ` Yes it was .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 7]: `` Pretty little widow . '' '
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 8]: ` What foolish , impudent creatures ! '
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 10]: cried my mother , laughing and covering her face .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 5]: ` What ridiculous men !
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 4]: A n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 10]: Davy dear -- ' ` Well , Ma . '
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 13]: ` Do n't tell Peggotty ; she might be angry with them .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 18]: I am dreadfully angry with them myself ; but I would rather Peggotty did n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 23]: I promised , of course ; and we kissed one another over and over again , and I soon fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 41]: It seems to me , at this distance of time , as if it were the next day when Peggotty broached the striking and adventurous proposition I am about to mention ; but it was probably about two months afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 117]: We were sitting as before , one evening -LRB- when my mother was out as before -RRB- , in company with the stocking and the yard-measure , and the bit of wax , and the box with St. Paul 's on the lid , and the crocodile book , when Peggotty , after looking at me several times , and opening her mouth as if she were going to speak , without doing it -- which I thought was merely gaping , or I should have been rather alarmed -- said coaxingly : ` Master Davy , how should you like to go along with me and spend a fortnight at my brother 's at Yarmouth ?
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 8]: Would n't that be a treat ? '
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 11]: ` Is your brother an agreeable man , Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 5]: I inquired , provisionally .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 11]: ` Oh , what an agreeable man he is ! '
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 8]: cried Peggotty , holding up her hands .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 52]: ` Then there 's the sea ; and the boats and ships ; and the fishermen ; and the beach ; and Am to play with -- ' Peggotty meant her nephew Ham , mentioned in my first chapter ; but she spoke of him as a morsel of English Grammar .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 26]: I was flushed by her summary of delights , and replied that it would indeed be a treat , but what would my mother say ?
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 29]: ` Why then I 'll as good as bet a guinea , ' said Peggotty , intent upon my face , ` that she 'll let us go .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 17]: I 'll ask her , if you like , as soon as ever she comes home .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 4]: There now ! '
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 13]: ` But what 's she to do while we 're away ? '
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 15]: said I , putting my small elbows on the table to argue the point .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 9]: ` She ca n't live by herself . '
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 36]: If Peggotty were looking for a hole , all of a sudden , in the heel of that stocking , it must have been a very little one indeed , and not worth darning . '
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 3]: I say !
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 2]: Peggotty !
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 11]: She ca n't live by herself , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 7]: ` Oh , bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 10]: said Peggotty , looking at me again at last .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 6]: ` Do n't you know ?
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 12]: She 's going to stay for a fortnight with Mrs. Grayper .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 12]: Mrs. Grayper 's going to have a lot of company . '
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 12]: If that was it , I was quite ready to go .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 40]: I waited , in the utmost impatience , until my mother came home from Mrs. Grayper 's -LRB- for it was that identical neighbour -RRB- , to ascertain if we could get leave to carry out this great idea .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 40]: Without being nearly so much surprised as I had expected , my mother entered into it readily ; and it was all arranged that night , and my board and lodging during the visit were to be paid for .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 8]: The day soon came for our going .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 49]: It was such an early day that it came soon , even to me , who was in a fever of expectation , and half afraid that an earthquake or a fiery mountain , or some other great convulsion of nature , might interpose to stop the expedition .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 18]: We were to go in a carrier 's cart , which departed in the morning after breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 24]: I would have given any money to have been allowed to wrap myself up over-night , and sleep in my hat and boots .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 37]: It touches me nearly now , although I tell it lightly , to recollect how eager I was to leave my happy home ; to think how little I suspected what I did leave for ever .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 47]: I am glad to recollect that when the carrier 's cart was at the gate , and my mother stood there kissing me , a grateful fondness for her and for the old place I had never turned my back upon before , made me cry .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 21]: I am glad to know that my mother cried too , and that I felt her heart beat against mine .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 36]: I am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move , my mother ran out at the gate , and called to him to stop , that she might kiss me once more .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 24]: I am glad to dwell upon the earnestness and love with which she lifted up her face to mine , and did so .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 29]: As we left her standing in the road , Mr. Murdstone came up to where she was , and seemed to expostulate with her for being so moved .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 20]: I was looking back round the awning of the cart , and wondered what business it was of his .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 28]: Peggotty , who was also looking back on the other side , seemed anything but satisfied ; as the face she brought back in the cart denoted .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 51]: I sat looking at Peggotty for some time , in a reverie on this supposititious case : whether , if she were employed to lose me like the boy in the fairy tale , I should be able to track my way home again by the buttons she would shed .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 46]: Chapter 3 I have a Change The carrier 's horse was the laziest horse in the world , I should hope , and shuffled along , with his head down , as if he liked to keep people waiting to whom the packages were directed .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 26]: I fancied , indeed , that he sometimes chuckled audibly over this reflection , but the carrier said he was only troubled with a cough .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 35]: The carrier had a way of keeping his head down , like his horse , and of drooping sleepily forward as he drove , with one of his arms on each of his knees .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 45]: I say ` drove ' , but it struck me that the cart would have gone to Yarmouth quite as well without him , for the horse did all that ; and as to conversation , he had no idea of it but whistling .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 30]: Peggotty had a basket of refreshments on her knee , which would have lasted us out handsomely , if we had been going to London by the same conveyance .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 12]: We ate a good deal , and slept a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 46]: Peggotty always went to sleep with her chin upon the handle of the basket , her hold of which never relaxed ; and I could not have believed unless I had heard her do it , that one defenceless woman could have snored so much .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 44]: We made so many deviations up and down lanes , and were such a long time delivering a bedstead at a public-house , and calling at other places , that I was quite tired , and very glad , when we saw Yarmouth .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 57]: It looked rather spongy and soppy , I thought , as I carried my eye over the great dull waste that lay across the river ; and I could not help wondering , if the world were really as round as my geography book said , how any part of it came to be so flat .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 20]: But I reflected that Yarmouth might be situated at one of the poles ; which would account for it .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 78]: As we drew a little nearer , and saw the whole adjacent prospect lying a straight low line under the sky , I hinted to Peggotty that a mound or so might have improved it ; and also that if the land had been a little more separated from the sea , and the town and the tide had not been quite so much mixed up , like toast and water , it would have been nicer .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 37]: But Peggotty said , with greater emphasis than usual , that we must take things as we found them , and that , for her part , she was proud to call herself a Yarmouth Bloater .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 113]: When we got into the street -LRB- which was strange enough to me -RRB- and smelt the fish , and pitch , and oakum , and tar , and saw the sailors walking about , and the carts jingling up and down over the stones , I felt that I had done so busy a place an injustice ; and said as much to Peggotty , who heard my expressions of delight with great complacency , and told me it was well known -LRB- I suppose to those who had the good fortune to be born Bloaters -RRB- that Yarmouth was , upon the whole , the finest place in the universe .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 7]: ` Here 's my Am ! '
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 10]: screamed Peggotty , ` growed out of knowledge ! '
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 26]: He was waiting for us , in fact , at the public-house ; and asked me how I found myself , like an old acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 43]: I did not feel , at first , that I knew him as well as he knew me , because he had never come to our house since the night I was born , and naturally he had the advantage of me .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 18]: But our intimacy was much advanced by his taking me on his back to carry me home .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 41]: He was , now , a huge , strong fellow of six feet high , broad in proportion , and round-shouldered ; but with a simpering boy 's face and curly light hair that gave him quite a sheepish look .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 32]: He was dressed in a canvas jacket , and a pair of such very stiff trousers that they would have stood quite as well alone , without any legs in them .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 30]: And you could n't so properly have said he wore a hat , as that he was covered in a-top , like an old building , with something pitchy .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 111]: Ham carrying me on his back and a small box of ours under his arm , and Peggotty carrying another small box of ours , we turned down lanes bestrewn with bits of chips and little hillocks of sand , and went past gas-works , rope-walks , boat-builders ' yards , shipwrights ' yards , ship-breakers ' yards , caulkers ' yards , riggers ' lofts , smiths ' forges , and a great litter of such places , until we came out upon the dull waste I had already seen at a distance ; when Ham said , ` Yon 's our house , Mas ' r Davy ! '
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 36]: I looked in all directions , as far as I could stare over the wilderness , and away at the sea , and away at the river , but no house could I make out .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 56]: There was a black barge , or some other kind of superannuated boat , not far off , high and dry on the ground , with an iron funnel sticking out of it for a chimney and smoking very cosily ; but nothing else in the way of a habitation that was visible to me .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 7]: ` That 's not it ? '
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 8]: said I. ` That ship-looking thing ? '
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 14]: ` That 's it , Mas ' r Davy , ' returned Ham .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 32]: If it had been Aladdin 's palace , roc 's egg and all , I suppose I could not have been more charmed with the romantic idea of living in it .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 65]: There was a delightful door cut in the side , and it was roofed in , and there were little windows in it ; but the wonderful charm of it was , that it was a real boat which had no doubt been upon the water hundreds of times , and which had never been intended to be lived in , on dry land .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 9]: That was the captivation of it to me .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 40]: If it had ever been meant to be lived in , I might have thought it small , or inconvenient , or lonely ; but never having been designed for any such use , it became a perfect abode .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 12]: It was beautifully clean inside , and as tidy as possible .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 51]: There was a table , and a Dutch clock , and a chest of drawers , and on the chest of drawers there was a tea-tray with a painting on it of a lady with a parasol , taking a walk with a military-looking child who was trundling a hoop .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 41]: The tray was kept from tumbling down , by a bible ; and the tray , if it had tumbled down , would have smashed a quantity of cups and saucers and a teapot that were grouped around the book .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 48]: On the walls there were some common coloured pictures , framed and glazed , of scripture subjects ; such as I have never seen since in the hands of pedlars , without seeing the whole interior of Peggotty 's brother 's house again , at one view .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 29]: Abraham in red going to sacrifice Isaac in blue , and Daniel in yellow cast into a den of green lions , were the most prominent of these .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 58]: Over the little mantelshelf , was a picture of the ` Sarah Jane ' lugger , built at Sunderland , with a real little wooden stern stuck on to it ; a work of art , combining composition with carpentry , which I considered to be one of the most enviable possessions that the world could afford .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 42]: There were some hooks in the beams of the ceiling , the use of which I did not divine then ; and some lockers and boxes and conveniences of that sort , which served for seats and eked out the chairs .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 34]: All this I saw in the first glance after I crossed the threshold -- child-like , according to my theory -- and then Peggotty opened a little door and showed me my bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 79]: It was the completest and most desirable bedroom ever seen -- in the stern of the vessel ; with a little window , where the rudder used to go through ; a little looking-glass , just the right height for me , nailed against the wall , and framed with oyster-shells ; a little bed , which there was just room enough to get into ; and a nosegay of seaweed in a blue mug on the table .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 22]: The walls were whitewashed as white as milk , and the patchwork counterpane made my eyes quite ache with its brightness .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 47]: One thing I particularly noticed in this delightful house , was the smell of fish ; which was so searching , that when I took out my pocket-handkerchief to wipe my nose , I found it smelt exactly as if it had wrapped up a lobster .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 75]: On my imparting this discovery in confidence to Peggotty , she informed me that her brother dealt in lobsters , crabs , and crawfish ; and I afterwards found that a heap of these creatures , in a state of wonderful conglomeration with one another , and never leaving off pinching whatever they laid hold of , were usually to be found in a little wooden outhouse where the pots and kettles were kept .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 37]: We were welcomed by a very civil woman in a white apron , whom I had seen curtseying at the door when I was on Ham 's back , about a quarter of a mile off .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 41]: Likewise by a most beautiful little girl -LRB- or I thought her so -RRB- with a necklace of blue beads on , who would n't let me kiss her when I offered to , but ran away and hid herself .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 39]: By and by , when we had dined in a sumptuous manner off boiled dabs , melted butter , and potatoes , with a chop for me , a hairy man with a very good-natured face came home .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 58]: As he called Peggotty ` Lass ' , and gave her a hearty smack on the cheek , I had no doubt , from the general propriety of her conduct , that he was her brother ; and so he turned out -- being presently introduced to me as Mr. Peggotty , the master of the house .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 13]: ` Glad to see you , sir , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 17]: ` You 'll find us rough , sir , but you 'll find us ready . '
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 20]: I thanked him , and replied that I was sure I should be happy in such a delightful place .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 9]: ` How 's your Ma , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 4]: said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 9]: ` Did you leave her pretty jolly ? '
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 32]: I gave Mr. Peggotty to understand that she was as jolly as I could wish , and that she desired her compliments -- which was a polite fiction on my part .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 17]: ` I 'm much obleeged to her , I 'm sure , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 47]: ` Well , sir , if you can make out here , fur a fortnut , ` long wi ' her , ' nodding at his sister , ` and Ham , and little Em ` ly , we shall be proud of your company . '
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 38]: Having done the honours of his house in this hospitable manner , Mr. Peggotty went out to wash himself in a kettleful of hot water , remarking that ` cold would never get his muck off ' .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 51]: He soon returned , greatly improved in appearance ; but so rubicund , that I could n't help thinking his face had this in common with the lobsters , crabs , and crawfish , -- that it went into the hot water very black , and came out very red .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 39]: After tea , when the door was shut and all was made snug -LRB- the nights being cold and misty now -RRB- , it seemed to me the most delicious retreat that the imagination of man could conceive .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 52]: To hear the wind getting up out at sea , to know that the fog was creeping over the desolate flat outside , and to look at the fire , and think that there was no house near but this one , and this one a boat , was like enchantment .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 41]: Little Em ` ly had overcome her shyness , and was sitting by my side upon the lowest and least of the lockers , which was just large enough for us two , and just fitted into the chimney corner .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 17]: Mrs. Peggotty with the white apron , was knitting on the opposite side of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 29]: Peggotty at her needlework was as much at home with St. Paul 's and the bit of wax-candle , as if they had never known any other roof .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 43]: Ham , who had been giving me my first lesson in all-fours , was trying to recollect a scheme of telling fortunes with the dirty cards , and was printing off fishy impressions of his thumb on all the cards he turned .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 7]: Mr. Peggotty was smoking his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 11]: I felt it was a time for conversation and confidence .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 5]: ` Mr. Peggotty ! '
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 9]: says I. ` Sir , ' says he .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 21]: ` Did you give your son the name of Ham , because you lived in a sort of ark ? '
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 18]: Mr. Peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea , but answered : ` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 8]: I never giv him no name . '
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 10]: ` Who gave him that name , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 14]: said I , putting question number two of the catechism to Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 17]: ` Why , sir , his father giv it him , ' said Mr. Peggotty . '
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 8]: I thought you were his father ! '
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 13]: ` My brother Joe was his father , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 7]: ` Dead , Mr. Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 8]: I hinted , after a respectful pause .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 8]: ` Drowndead , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 30]: I was very much surprised that Mr. Peggotty was not Ham 's father , and began to wonder whether I was mistaken about his relationship to anybody else there .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 21]: I was so curious to know , that I made up my mind to have it out with Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 14]: ` Little Em ` ly , ' I said , glancing at her .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 14]: ` She is your daughter , is n't she , Mr. Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 5]: ` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 10]: My brother-in-law , Tom , was her father . '
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 7]: I could n't help it . '
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 7]: - Dead , Mr. Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 8]: I hinted , after another respectful silence .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 8]: ` Drowndead , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 28]: I felt the difficulty of resuming the subject , but had not got to the bottom of it yet , and must get to the bottom somehow .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 15]: So I said : ` Have n't you ANY children , Mr. Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 13]: ` No , master , ' he answered with a short laugh .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 8]: ` I 'm a bacheldore . ' '
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 4]: A bachelor ! '
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 5]: I said , astonished .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 11]: ` Why , who 's that , Mr. Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 11]: pointing to the person in the apron who was knitting .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 11]: ` That 's Missis Gummidge , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 7]: ` Gummidge , Mr. Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 48]: But at this point Peggotty -- I mean my own peculiar Peggotty -- made such impressive motions to me not to ask any more questions , that I could only sit and look at all the silent company , until it was time to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 65]: Then , in the privacy of my own little cabin , she informed me that Ham and Em ` ly were an orphan nephew and niece , whom my host had at different times adopted in their childhood , when they were left destitute : and that Mrs. Gummidge was the widow of his partner in a boat , who had died very poor .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 27]: He was but a poor man himself , said Peggotty , but as good as gold and as true as steel -- those were her similes .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 91]: The only subject , she informed me , on which he ever showed a violent temper or swore an oath , was this generosity of his ; and if it were ever referred to , by any one of them , he struck the table a heavy blow with his right hand -LRB- had split it on one such occasion -RRB- , and swore a dreadful oath that he would be ` Gormed ' if he did n't cut and run for good , if it was ever mentioned again .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 40]: It appeared , in answer to my inquiries , that nobody had the least idea of the etymology of this terrible verb passive to be gormed ; but that they all regarded it as constituting a most solemn imprecation .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 68]: I was very sensible of my entertainer 's goodness , and listened to the women 's going to bed in another little crib like mine at the opposite end of the boat , and to him and Ham hanging up two hammocks for themselves on the hooks I had noticed in the roof , in a very luxurious state of mind , enhanced by my being sleepy .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 39]: As slumber gradually stole upon me , I heard the wind howling out at sea and coming on across the flat so fiercely , that I had a lazy apprehension of the great deep rising in the night .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 35]: But I bethought myself that I was in a boat , after all ; and that a man like Mr. Peggotty was not a bad person to have on board if anything did happen .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 9]: Nothing happened , however , worse than morning .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 34]: Almost as soon as it shone upon the oyster-shell frame of my mirror I was out of bed , and out with little Em ` ly , picking up stones upon the beach .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 11]: ` You 're quite a sailor , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 7]: I said to Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 59]: I do n't know that I supposed anything of the kind , but I felt it an act of gallantry to say something ; and a shining sail close to us made such a pretty little image of itself , at the moment , in her bright eye , that it came into my head to say this .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 22]: ` No , ' replied Em ` ly , shaking her head , ` I 'm afraid of the sea . '
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 4]: ` Afraid ! '
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 20]: I said , with a becoming air of boldness , and looking very big at the mighty ocean . '
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 5]: I a n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 12]: but it 's cruel , ' said Em ` ly . '
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 12]: I have seen it very cruel to some of our men .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 19]: I have seen it tear a boat as big as our house , all to pieces . ' '
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 18]: I hope it was n't the boat that -- ' ` That father was drownded in ? '
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 5]: said Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 11]: Not that one , I never see that boat . '
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 5]: ` Nor him ? '
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 4]: I asked her .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 8]: Little Em ` ly shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 6]: ` Not to remember ! '
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 5]: Here was a coincidence !
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 82]: I immediately went into an explanation how I had never seen my own father ; and how my mother and I had always lived by ourselves in the happiest state imaginable , and lived so then , and always meant to live so ; and how my father 's grave was in the churchyard near our house , and shaded by a tree , beneath the boughs of which I had walked and heard the birds sing many a pleasant morning .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 17]: But there were some differences between Em ` ly 's orphanhood and mine , it appeared .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 32]: She had lost her mother before her father ; and where her father 's grave was no one knew , except that it was somewhere in the depths of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 55]: ` Besides , ' said Em ` ly , as she looked about for shells and pebbles , ` your father was a gentleman and your mother is a lady ; and my father was a fisherman and my mother was a fisherman 's daughter , and my uncle Dan is a fisherman . '
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 10]: ` Dan is Mr. Peggotty , is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 19]: said I. ` Uncle Dan -- yonder , ' answered Em ` ly , nodding at the boat-house .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 4]: I mean him .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 11]: He must be very good , I should think ? '
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 4]: ` Good ? '
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 5]: said Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 49]: ` If I was ever to be a lady , I 'd give him a sky-blue coat with diamond buttons , nankeen trousers , a red velvet waistcoat , a cocked hat , a large gold watch , a silver pipe , and a box of money . '
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 14]: I said I had no doubt that Mr. Peggotty well deserved these treasures .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 49]: I must acknowledge that I felt it difficult to picture him quite at his ease in the raiment proposed for him by his grateful little niece , and that I was particularly doubtful of the policy of the cocked hat ; but I kept these sentiments to myself .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 27]: Little Em ` ly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration of these articles , as if they were a glorious vision .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 11]: We went on again , picking up shells and pebbles .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 10]: ` You would like to be a lady ? '
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 14]: Emily looked at me , and laughed and nodded ` yes ' . '
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 7]: I should like it very much .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 9]: We would all be gentlefolks together , then .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 12]: Me , and uncle , and Ham , and Mrs. Gummidge .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 12]: We would n't mind then , when there comes stormy weather .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 10]: -- Not for our own sakes , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 27]: We would for the poor fishermen 's , to be sure , and we 'd help 'em with money when they come to any hurt . '
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 17]: This seemed to me to be a very satisfactory and therefore not at all improbable picture .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 37]: I expressed my pleasure in the contemplation of it , and little Em ` ly was emboldened to say , shyly , ` Do n't you think you are afraid of the sea , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 42]: It was quiet enough to reassure me , but I have no doubt if I had seen a moderately large wave come tumbling in , I should have taken to my heels , with an awful recollection of her drowned relations .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 61]: However , I said ` No , ' and I added , ` You do n't seem to be either , though you say you are , ' -- for she was walking much too near the brink of a sort of old jetty or wooden causeway we had strolled upon , and I was afraid of her falling over .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 16]: ` I 'm not afraid in this way , ' said little Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 27]: ` But I wake when it blows , and tremble to think of Uncle Dan and Ham and believe I hear 'em crying out for help .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 13]: That 's why I should like so much to be a lady .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 9]: But I 'm not afraid in this way .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 4]: Not a bit .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 4]: Look here ! '
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 35]: She started from my side , and ran along a jagged timber which protruded from the place we stood upon , and overhung the deep water at some height , without the least defence .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 66]: The incident is so impressed on my remembrance , that if I were a draughtsman I could draw its form here , I dare say , accurately as it was that day , and little Em ` ly springing forward to her destruction -LRB- as it appeared to me -RRB- , with a look that I have never forgotten , directed far out to sea .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 44]: The light , bold , fluttering little figure turned and came back safe to me , and I soon laughed at my fears , and at the cry I had uttered ; fruitlessly in any case , for there was no one near .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 85]: But there have been times since , in my manhood , many times there have been , when I have thought , Is it possible , among the possibilities of hidden things , that in the sudden rashness of the child and her wild look so far off , there was any merciful attraction of her into danger , any tempting her towards him permitted on the part of her dead father , that her life might have a chance of ending that day ?
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 64]: There has been a time since when I have wondered whether , if the life before her could have been revealed to me at a glance , and so revealed as that a child could fully comprehend it , and if her preservation could have depended on a motion of my hand , I ought to have held it up to save her .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 65]: There has been a time since -- I do not say it lasted long , but it has been -- when I have asked myself the question , would it have been better for little Em ` ly to have had the waters close above her head that morning in my sight ; and when I have answered Yes , it would have been .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 5]: This may be premature .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 10]: I have set it down too soon , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 5]: But let it stand .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 70]: We strolled a long way , and loaded ourselves with things that we thought curious , and put some stranded starfish carefully back into the water -- I hardly know enough of the race at this moment to be quite certain whether they had reason to feel obliged to us for doing so , or the reverse -- and then made our way home to Mr. Peggotty 's dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 25]: We stopped under the lee of the lobster-outhouse to exchange an innocent kiss , and went in to breakfast glowing with health and pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 11]: ` Like two young mavishes , ' Mr. Peggotty said .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 22]: I knew this meant , in our local dialect , like two young thrushes , and received it as a compliment .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 12]: Of course I was in love with little Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 43]: I am sure I loved that baby quite as truly , quite as tenderly , with greater purity and more disinterestedness , than can enter into the best love of a later time of life , high and ennobling as it is .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 27]: I am sure my fancy raised up something round that blue-eyed mite of a child , which etherealized , and made a very angel of her .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 41]: If , any sunny forenoon , she had spread a little pair of wings and flown away before my eyes , I do n't think I should have regarded it as much more than I had had reason to expect .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 20]: We used to walk about that dim old flat at Yarmouth in a loving manner , hours and hours .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 27]: The days sported by us , as if Time had not grown up himself yet , but were a child too , and always at play .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 31]: I told Em ` ly I adored her , and that unless she confessed she adored me I should be reduced to the necessity of killing myself with a sword .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 13]: She said she did , and I have no doubt she did .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 34]: As to any sense of inequality , or youthfulness , or other difficulty in our way , little Em ` ly and I had no such trouble , because we had no future .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 16]: We made no more provision for growing older , than we did for growing younger .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 34]: We were the admiration of Mrs. Gummidge and Peggotty , who used to whisper of an evening when we sat , lovingly , on our little locker side by side , ` Lor !
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 6]: was n't it beautiful ! '
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 21]: Mr. Peggotty smiled at us from behind his pipe , and Ham grinned all the evening and did nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 32]: They had something of the sort of pleasure in us , I suppose , that they might have had in a pretty toy , or a pocket model of the Colosseum .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 33]: I soon found out that Mrs. Gummidge did not always make herself so agreeable as she might have been expected to do , under the circumstances of her residence with Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 26]: Mrs. Gummidge 's was rather a fretful disposition , and she whimpered more sometimes than was comfortable for other parties in so small an establishment .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 46]: I was very sorry for her ; but there were moments when it would have been more agreeable , I thought , if Mrs. Gummidge had had a convenient apartment of her own to retire to , and had stopped there until her spirits revived .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 12]: Mr. Peggotty went occasionally to a public-house called The Willing Mind .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 59]: I discovered this , by his being out on the second or third evening of our visit , and by Mrs. Gummidge 's looking up at the Dutch clock , between eight and nine , and saying he was there , and that , what was more , she had known in the morning he would go there .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 26]: Mrs. Gummidge had been in a low state all day , and had burst into tears in the forenoon , when the fire smoked . '
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 31]: I am a lone lorn creetur ' , ' were Mrs. Gummidge 's words , when that unpleasant occurrence took place , ` and everythink goes contrary with me . '
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 39]: ` Oh , it 'll soon leave off , ' said Peggotty -- I again mean our Peggotty -- ` and besides , you know , it 's not more disagreeable to you than to us . ' '
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 10]: I feel it more , ' said Mrs. Gummidge .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 13]: It was a very cold day , with cutting blasts of wind .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 40]: Mrs. Gummidge 's peculiar corner of the fireside seemed to me to be the warmest and snuggest in the place , as her chair was certainly the easiest , but it did n't suit her that day at all .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 25]: She was constantly complaining of the cold , and of its occasioning a visitation in her back which she called ` the creeps ' .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 29]: At last she shed tears on that subject , and said again that she was ' a lone lorn creetur ' and everythink went contrary with her ' .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 11]: ` It is certainly very cold , ' said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 9]: ` Everybody must feel it so . ' '
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 13]: I feel it more than other people , ' said Mrs. Gummidge .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 26]: So at dinner ; when Mrs. Gummidge was always helped immediately after me , to whom the preference was given as a visitor of distinction .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 15]: The fish were small and bony , and the potatoes were a little burnt .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 38]: We all acknowledged that we felt this something of a disappointment ; but Mrs. Gummidge said she felt it more than we did , and shed tears again , and made that former declaration with great bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 29]: Accordingly , when Mr. Peggotty came home about nine o'clock , this unfortunate Mrs. Gummidge was knitting in her corner , in a very wretched and miserable condition .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 6]: Peggotty had been working cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 29]: Ham had been patching up a great pair of waterboots ; and I , with little Em ` ly by my side , had been reading to them .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 22]: Mrs. Gummidge had never made any other remark than a forlorn sigh , and had never raised her eyes since tea .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 21]: ` Well , Mates , ' said Mr. Peggotty , taking his seat , ` and how are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 26]: We all said something , or looked something , to welcome him , except Mrs. Gummidge , who only shook her head over her knitting .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 6]: ` What 's amiss ? '
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 11]: said Mr. Peggotty , with a clap of his hands .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 8]: ` Cheer up , old Mawther ! '
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 8]: -LRB- Mr. Peggotty meant old girl . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 12]: Mrs. Gummidge did not appear to be able to cheer up .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 41]: She took out an old black silk handkerchief and wiped her eyes ; but instead of putting it in her pocket , kept it out , and wiped them again , and still kept it out , ready for use .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 8]: ` What 's amiss , dame ? '
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 4]: said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 8]: ` Nothing , ' returned Mrs. Gummidge .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 14]: ` You 've come from The Willing Mind , Dan ` l ? '
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 21]: ` Why yes , I 've took a short spell at The Willing Mind tonight , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 15]: ` I 'm sorry I should drive you there , ' said Mrs. Gummidge .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 3]: ` Drive !
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 17]: I do n't want no driving , ' returned Mr. Peggotty with an honest laugh . '
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 7]: I only go too ready . '
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 18]: ` Very ready , ' said Mrs. Gummidge , shaking her head , and wiping her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 8]: ` Yes , yes , very ready .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 16]: I am sorry it should be along of me that you 're so ready . '
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 6]: ` Along o ' you !
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 9]: It a n't along o ' you ! '
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 4]: said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 11]: ` Do n't ye believe a bit on it . '
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 14]: ` Yes , yes , it is , ' cried Mrs. Gummidge . '
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 6]: I know what I am .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 29]: I know that I am a lone lorn creetur ' , and not only that everythink goes contrary with me , but that I go contrary with everybody .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 4]: Yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 14]: I feel more than other people do , and I show it more .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 7]: It 's my misfortun ' . '
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 30]: I really could n't help thinking , as I sat taking in all this , that the misfortune extended to some other members of that family besides Mrs. Gummidge .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 21]: But Mr. Peggotty made no such retort , only answering with another entreaty to Mrs. Gummidge to cheer up . '
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 17]: I a n't what I could wish myself to be , ' said Mrs. Gummidge . '
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 6]: I am far from it .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 6]: I know what I am .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 7]: My troubles has made me contrary .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 11]: I feel my troubles , and they make me contrary .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 12]: I wish I did n't feel 'em , but I do .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 14]: I wish I could be hardened to 'em , but I a n't .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 6]: I make the house uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 7]: I do n't wonder at it .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 14]: I 've made your sister so all day , and Master Davy . '
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 26]: Here I was suddenly melted , and roared out , ` No , you have n't , Mrs. Gummidge , ' in great mental distress .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 17]: ` It 's far from right that I should do it , ' said Mrs. Gummidge .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 8]: ` It a n't a fit return .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 10]: I had better go into the house and die .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 18]: I am a lone lorn creetur ' , and had much better not make myself contrary here .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 23]: If thinks must go contrary with me , and I must go contrary myself , let me go contrary in my parish .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 20]: Dan ` l , I 'd better go into the house , and die and be a riddance ! '
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 13]: Mrs. Gummidge retired with these words , and betook herself to bed .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 60]: When she was gone , Mr. Peggotty , who had not exhibited a trace of any feeling but the profoundest sympathy , looked round upon us , and nodding his head with a lively expression of that sentiment still animating his face , said in a whisper : ` She 's been thinking of the old ` un ! '
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 63]: I did not quite understand what old one Mrs. Gummidge was supposed to have fixed her mind upon , until Peggotty , on seeing me to bed , explained that it was the late Mr. Gummidge ; and that her brother always took that for a received truth on such occasions , and that it always had a moving effect upon him .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 23]: Some time after he was in his hammock that night , I heard him myself repeat to Ham , ` Poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 11]: She 's been thinking of the old ` un ! '
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 43]: And whenever Mrs. Gummidge was overcome in a similar manner during the remainder of our stay -LRB- which happened some few times -RRB- , he always said the same thing in extenuation of the circumstance , and always with the tenderest commiseration .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 36]: So the fortnight slipped away , varied by nothing but the variation of the tide , which altered Mr. Peggotty 's times of going out and coming in , and altered Ham 's engagements also .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 30]: When the latter was unemployed , he sometimes walked with us to show us the boats and ships , and once or twice he took us for a row .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 40]: I do n't know why one slight set of impressions should be more particularly associated with a place than another , though I believe this obtains with most people , in reference especially to the associations of their childhood .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 76]: I never hear the name , or read the name , of Yarmouth , but I am reminded of a certain Sunday morning on the beach , the bells ringing for church , little Em ` ly leaning on my shoulder , Ham lazily dropping stones into the water , and the sun , away at sea , just breaking through the heavy mist , and showing us the ships , like their own shadows .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 9]: At last the day came for going home .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 27]: I bore up against the separation from Mr. Peggotty and Mrs. Gummidge , but my agony of mind at leaving little Em ` ly was piercing .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 25]: We went arm-in-arm to the public-house where the carrier put up , and I promised , on the road , to write to her .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 27]: -LRB- I redeemed that promise afterwards , in characters larger than those in which apartments are usually announced in manuscript , as being to let . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 32]: We were greatly overcome at parting ; and if ever , in my life , I have had a void made in my heart , I had one made that day .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 30]: Now , all the time I had been on my visit , I had been ungrateful to my home again , and had thought little or nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 54]: But I was no sooner turned towards it , than my reproachful young conscience seemed to point that way with a ready finger ; and I felt , all the more for the sinking of my spirits , that it was my nest , and that my mother was my comforter and friend .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 42]: This gained upon me as we went along ; so that the nearer we drew , the more familiar the objects became that we passed , the more excited I was to get there , and to run into her arms .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 28]: But Peggotty , instead of sharing in those transports , tried to check them -LRB- though very kindly -RRB- , and looked confused and out of sorts .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 22]: Blunderstone Rookery would come , however , in spite of her , when the carrier 's horse pleased -- and did .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 20]: How well I recollect it , on a cold grey afternoon , with a dull sky , threatening rain !
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 22]: The door opened , and I looked , half laughing and half crying in my pleasant agitation , for my mother .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 10]: It was not she , but a strange servant .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 6]: ` Why , Peggotty ! '
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 13]: I said , ruefully , ` is n't she come home ? '
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 12]: ` Yes , yes , Master Davy , ' said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 6]: ` She 's come home .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 18]: Wait a bit , Master Davy , and I 'll -- I 'll tell you something . '
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 37]: Between her agitation , and her natural awkwardness in getting out of the cart , Peggotty was making a most extraordinary festoon of herself , but I felt too blank and strange to tell her so .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 27]: When she had got down , she took me by the hand ; led me , wondering , into the kitchen ; and shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 4]: ` Peggotty ! '
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 6]: said I , quite frightened .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 14]: ` Nothing 's the matter , bless you , Master Davy dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 9]: she answered , assuming an air of sprightliness .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 10]: ` Something 's the matter , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 5]: Where 's mama ? '
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 9]: ` Where 's mama , Master Davy ? '
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 3]: repeated Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 19]: Why has n't she come out to the gate , and what have we come in here for ?
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 5]: Oh , Peggotty ! '
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 17]: My eyes were full , and I felt as if I were going to tumble down .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 7]: ` Bless the precious boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 8]: cried Peggotty , taking hold of me .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 5]: ` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 6]: Speak , my pet ! '
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 6]: ` Not dead , too !
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 10]: Oh , she 's not dead , Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 5]: Peggotty cried out No !
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 26]: with an astonishing volume of voice ; and then sat down , and began to pant , and said I had given her a turn .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 35]: I gave her a hug to take away the turn , or to give her another turn in the right direction , and then stood before her , looking at her in anxious inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 26]: ` You see , dear , I should have told you before now , ' said Peggotty , ` but I had n't an opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 39]: I ought to have made it , perhaps , but I could n't azackly ' -- that was always the substitute for exactly , in Peggotty 's militia of words -- ` bring my mind to it . '
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 15]: ` Go on , Peggotty , ' said I , more frightened than before .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 25]: ` Master Davy , ' said Peggotty , untying her bonnet with a shaking hand , and speaking in a breathless sort of way .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 6]: ` What do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 7]: You have got a Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 7]: I trembled , and turned white .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 36]: Something -- I do n't know what , or how -- connected with the grave in the churchyard , and the raising of the dead , seemed to strike me like an unwholesome wind . '
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 9]: A new one , ' said Peggotty . '
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 5]: A new one ? '
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 3]: I repeated .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 33]: Peggotty gave a gasp , as if she were swallowing something that was very hard , and , putting out her hand , said : ` Come and see him . ' '
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 9]: I do n't want to see him . '
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 10]: - ` And your mama , ' said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 20]: I ceased to draw back , and we went straight to the best parlour , where she left me .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 18]: On one side of the fire , sat my mother ; on the other , Mr. Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 15]: My mother dropped her work , and arose hurriedly , but timidly I thought .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 12]: ` Now , Clara my dear , ' said Mr. Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 3]: ` Recollect !
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 7]: control yourself , always control yourself !
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 9]: Davy boy , how do you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 6]: I gave him my hand .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 32]: After a moment of suspense , I went and kissed my mother : she kissed me , patted me gently on the shoulder , and sat down again to her work .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 49]: I could not look at her , I could not look at him , I knew quite well that he was looking at us both ; and I turned to the window and looked out there , at some shrubs that were drooping their heads in the cold .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 12]: As soon as I could creep away , I crept upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 17]: My old dear bedroom was changed , and I was to lie a long way off .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 23]: I rambled downstairs to find anything that was like itself , so altered it all seemed ; and roamed into the yard .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 46]: I very soon started back from there , for the empty dog-kennel was filled up with a great dog -- deep mouthed and black-haired like Him -- and he was very angry at the sight of me , and sprang out to get at me .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 41]: Chapter 4 I Fall into Disgrace If the room to which my bed was removed were a sentient thing that could give evidence , I might appeal to it at this day -- who sleeps there now , I wonder !
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 15]: -- to bear witness for me what a heavy heart I carried to it .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 51]: I went up there , hearing the dog in the yard bark after me all the way while I climbed the stairs ; and , looking as blank and strange upon the room as the room looked upon me , sat down with my small hands crossed , and thought .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 7]: I thought of the oddest things .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 67]: Of the shape of the room , of the cracks in the ceiling , of the paper on the walls , of the flaws in the window-glass making ripples and dimples on the prospect , of the washing-stand being rickety on its three legs , and having a discontented something about it , which reminded me of Mrs. Gummidge under the influence of the old one .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 30]: I was crying all the time , but , except that I was conscious of being cold and dejected , I am sure I never thought why I cried .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 52]: At last in my desolation I began to consider that I was dreadfully in love with little Em ` ly , and had been torn away from her to come here where no one seemed to want me , or to care about me , half as much as she did .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 30]: This made such a very miserable piece of business of it , that I rolled myself up in a corner of the counterpane , and cried myself to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 12]: I was awoke by somebody saying ` Here he is ! '
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 6]: and uncovering my hot head .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 22]: My mother and Peggotty had come to look for me , and it was one of them who had done it .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 8]: ` Davy , ' said my mother .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 19]: I thought it was very strange that she should ask me , and answered , ` Nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 23]: I turned over on my face , I recollect , to hide my trembling lip , which answered her with greater truth .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 8]: ` Davy , ' said my mother .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 7]: ` Davy , my child ! '
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 25]: I dare say no words she could have uttered would have affected me so much , then , as her calling me her child .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 25]: I hid my tears in the bedclothes , and pressed her from me with my hand , when she would have raised me up .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 13]: ` This is your doing , Peggotty , you cruel thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 5]: said my mother . '
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 9]: I have no doubt at all about it .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 29]: How can you reconcile it to your conscience , I wonder , to prejudice my own boy against me , or against anybody who is dear to me ?
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 10]: What do you mean by it , Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 52]: Poor Peggotty lifted up her hands and eyes , and only answered , in a sort of paraphrase of the grace I usually repeated after dinner , ` Lord forgive you , Mrs. Copperfield , and for what you have said this minute , may you never be truly sorry ! '
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 13]: ` It 's enough to distract me , ' cried my mother .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 31]: ` In my honeymoon , too , when my most inveterate enemy might relent , one would think , and not envy me a little peace of mind and happiness .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 6]: Davy , you naughty boy !
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 6]: Peggotty , you savage creature !
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 6]: Oh , dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 44]: cried my mother , turning from one of us to the other , in her pettish wilful manner , ` what a troublesome world this is , when one has the most right to expect it to be as agreeable as possible ! '
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 26]: I felt the touch of a hand that I knew was neither hers nor Peggotty 's , and slipped to my feet at the bed-side .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 23]: It was Mr. Murdstone 's hand , and he kept it on my arm as he said : ` What 's this ?
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 9]: Clara , my love , have you forgotten ?
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 8]: -- Firmness , my dear ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 13]: I am very sorry , Edward , ' said my mother . '
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 14]: I meant to be very good , but I am so uncomfortable . '
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 3]: he answered .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 14]: ` That 's a bad hearing , so soon , Clara . ' '
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 33]: I say it 's very hard I should be made so now , ' returned my mother , pouting ; ` and it is -- very hard -- is n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 15]: He drew her to him , whispered in her ear , and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 53]: I knew as well , when I saw my mother 's head lean down upon his shoulder , and her arm touch his neck -- I knew as well that he could mould her pliant nature into any form he chose , as I know , now , that he did it .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 13]: ` Go you below , my love , ' said Mr. Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 10]: ` David and I will come down , together .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 39]: My friend , ' turning a darkening face on Peggotty , when he had watched my mother out , and dismissed her with a nod and a smile ; ` do you know your mistress 's name ? '
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 24]: ` She has been my mistress a long time , sir , ' answered Peggotty , ' I ought to know it . '
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 9]: ` That 's true , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 23]: ` But I thought I heard you , as I came upstairs , address her by a name that is not hers .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 8]: She has taken mine , you know .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 6]: Will you remember that ? '
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 37]: Peggotty , with some uneasy glances at me , curtseyed herself out of the room without replying ; seeing , I suppose , that she was expected to go , and had no excuse for remaining .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 31]: When we two were left alone , he shut the door , and sitting on a chair , and holding me standing before him , looked steadily into my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 13]: I felt my own attracted , no less steadily , to his .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 24]: As I recall our being opposed thus , face to face , I seem again to hear my heart beat fast and high .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 39]: ` David , ' he said , making his lips thin , by pressing them together , ` if I have an obstinate horse or dog to deal with , what do you think I do ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 7]: I do n't know . ' '
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 5]: I beat him . '
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 26]: I had answered in a kind of breathless whisper , but I felt , in my silence , that my breath was shorter now . '
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 8]: I make him wince , and smart .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 31]: I say to myself , `` I 'll conquer that fellow '' ; and if it were to cost him all the blood he had , I should do it .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 8]: What is that upon your face ? '
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 7]: ` Dirt , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 13]: He knew it was the mark of tears as well as I .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 32]: But if he had asked the question twenty times , each time with twenty blows , I believe my baby heart would have burst before I would have told him so .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 37]: ` You have a good deal of intelligence for a little fellow , ' he said , with a grave smile that belonged to him , ` and you understood me very well , I see .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 13]: Wash that face , sir , and come down with me . '
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 28]: He pointed to the washing-stand , which I had made out to be like Mrs. Gummidge , and motioned me with his head to obey him directly .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 30]: I had little doubt then , and I have less doubt now , that he would have knocked me down without the least compunction , if I had hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 46]: ` Clara , my dear , ' he said , when I had done his bidding , and he walked me into the parlour , with his hand still on my arm ; ` you will not be made uncomfortable any more , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 9]: We shall soon improve our youthful humours . '
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 34]: God help me , I might have been improved for my whole life , I might have been made another creature perhaps , for life , by a kind word at that season .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 57]: A word of encouragement and explanation , of pity for my childish ignorance , of welcome home , of reassurance to me that it was home , might have made me dutiful to him in my heart henceforth , instead of in my hypocritical outside , and might have made me respect instead of hate him .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 66]: I thought my mother was sorry to see me standing in the room so scared and strange , and that , presently , when I stole to a chair , she followed me with her eyes more sorrowfully still -- missing , perhaps , some freedom in my childish tread -- but the word was not spoken , and the time for it was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 8]: We dined alone , we three together .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 30]: He seemed to be very fond of my mother -- I am afraid I liked him none the better for that -- and she was very fond of him .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 28]: I gathered from what they said , that an elder sister of his was coming to stay with them , and that she was expected that evening .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 81]: I am not certain whether I found out then , or afterwards , that , without being actively concerned in any business , he had some share in , or some annual charge upon the profits of , a wine-merchant 's house in London , with which his family had been connected from his great-grandfather 's time , and in which his sister had a similar interest ; but I may mention it in this place , whether or no .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 53]: After dinner , when we were sitting by the fire , and I was meditating an escape to Peggotty without having the hardihood to slip away , lest it should offend the master of the house , a coach drove up to the garden-gate and he went out to receive the visitor .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 5]: My mother followed him .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 46]: I was timidly following her , when she turned round at the parlour door , in the dusk , and taking me in her embrace as she had been used to do , whispered me to love my new father and be obedient to him .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 56]: She did this hurriedly and secretly , as if it were wrong , but tenderly ; and , putting out her hand behind her , held mine in it , until we came near to where he was standing in the garden , where she let mine go , and drew hers through his arm .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 66]: It was Miss Murdstone who was arrived , and a gloomy-looking lady she was ; dark , like her brother , whom she greatly resembled in face and voice ; and with very heavy eyebrows , nearly meeting over her large nose , as if , being disabled by the wrongs of her sex from wearing whiskers , she had carried them to that account .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 21]: She brought with her two uncompromising hard black boxes , with her initials on the lids in hard brass nails .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 45]: When she paid the coachman she took her money out of a hard steel purse , and she kept the purse in a very jail of a bag which hung upon her arm by a heavy chain , and shut up like a bite .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 19]: I had never , at that time , seen such a metallic lady altogether as Miss Murdstone was .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 25]: She was brought into the parlour with many tokens of welcome , and there formally recognized my mother as a new and near relation .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 18]: Then she looked at me , and said : ` Is that your boy , sister-in-law ? '
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 5]: My mother acknowledged me .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 16]: ` Generally speaking , ' said Miss Murdstone , ' I do n't like boys .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 7]: How d'ye do , boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 43]: Under these encouraging circumstances , I replied that I was very well , and that I hoped she was the same ; with such an indifferent grace , that Miss Murdstone disposed of me in two words : ` Wants manner ! '
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 92]: Having uttered which , with great distinctness , she begged the favour of being shown to her room , which became to me from that time forth a place of awe and dread , wherein the two black boxes were never seen open or known to be left unlocked , and where -LRB- for I peeped in once or twice when she was out -RRB- numerous little steel fetters and rivets , with which Miss Murdstone embellished herself when she was dressed , generally hung upon the looking-glass in formidable array .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 23]: As well as I could make out , she had come for good , and had no intention of ever going again .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 35]: She began to ` help ' my mother next morning , and was in and out of the store-closet all day , putting things to rights , and making havoc in the old arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 31]: Almost the first remarkable thing I observed in Miss Murdstone was , her being constantly haunted by a suspicion that the servants had a man secreted somewhere on the premises .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 43]: Under the influence of this delusion , she dived into the coal-cellar at the most untimely hours , and scarcely ever opened the door of a dark cupboard without clapping it to again , in the belief that she had got him .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 21]: Though there was nothing very airy about Miss Murdstone , she was a perfect Lark in point of getting up .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 26]: She was up -LRB- and , as I believe to this hour , looking for that man -RRB- before anybody in the house was stirring .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 44]: Peggotty gave it as her opinion that she even slept with one eye open ; but I could not concur in this idea ; for I tried it myself after hearing the suggestion thrown out , and found it could n't be done .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 18]: On the very first morning after her arrival she was up and ringing her bell at cock-crow .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 65]: When my mother came down to breakfast and was going to make the tea , Miss Murdstone gave her a kind of peck on the cheek , which was her nearest approach to a kiss , and said : ` Now , Clara , my dear , I am come here , you know , to relieve you of all the trouble I can .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 38]: You 're much too pretty and thoughtless ' -- my mother blushed but laughed , and seemed not to dislike this character -- ` to have any duties imposed upon you that can be undertaken by me .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 28]: If you 'll be so good as give me your keys , my dear , I 'll attend to all this sort of thing in future . '
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 38]: From that time , Miss Murdstone kept the keys in her own little jail all day , and under her pillow all night , and my mother had no more to do with them than I had .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 17]: My mother did not suffer her authority to pass from her without a shadow of protest .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 39]: One night when Miss Murdstone had been developing certain household plans to her brother , of which he signified his approbation , my mother suddenly began to cry , and said she thought she might have been consulted .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 4]: ` Clara ! '
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 5]: said Mr. Murdstone sternly .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 3]: ` Clara !
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 6]: I wonder at you . '
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 15]: ` Oh , it 's very well to say you wonder , Edward ! '
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 26]: cried my mother , ` and it 's very well for you to talk about firmness , but you would n't like it yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 21]: Firmness , I may observe , was the grand quality on which both Mr. and Miss Murdstone took their stand .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 56]: However I might have expressed my comprehension of it at that time , if I had been called upon , I nevertheless did clearly comprehend in my own way , that it was another name for tyranny ; and for a certain gloomy , arrogant , devil 's humour , that was in them both .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 13]: The creed , as I should state it now , was this .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 40]: Mr. Murdstone was firm ; nobody in his world was to be so firm as Mr. Murdstone ; nobody else in his world was to be firm at all , for everybody was to be bent to his firmness .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 6]: Miss Murdstone was an exception .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 18]: She might be firm , but only by relationship , and in an inferior and tributary degree .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 6]: My mother was another exception .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 27]: She might be firm , and must be ; but only in bearing their firmness , and firmly believing there was no other firmness upon earth .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 25]: ` It 's very hard , ' said my mother , ` that in my own house -- ' ` My own house ? '
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 4]: repeated Mr. Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 4]: ` Clara ! '
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 49]: ` OUR own house , I mean , ' faltered my mother , evidently frightened - ' I hope you must know what I mean , Edward -- it 's very hard that in YOUR own house I may not have a word to say about domestic matters .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 12]: I am sure I managed very well before we were married .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 29]: There 's evidence , ' said my mother , sobbing ; ` ask Peggotty if I did n't do very well when I was n't interfered with ! '
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 17]: ` Edward , ' said Miss Murdstone , ` let there be an end of this .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 5]: I go tomorrow . '
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 13]: ` Jane Murdstone , ' said her brother , ` be silent !
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 20]: How dare you to insinuate that you do n't know my character better than your words imply ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 30]: I am sure , ' my poor mother went on , at a grievous disadvantage , and with many tears , ' I do n't want anybody to go .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 13]: I should be very miserable and unhappy if anybody was to go .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 6]: I do n't ask much .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 5]: I am not unreasonable .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 8]: I only want to be consulted sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 25]: I am very much obliged to anybody who assists me , and I only want to be consulted as a mere form , sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 42]: I thought you were pleased , once , with my being a little inexperienced and girlish , Edward -- I am sure you said so -- but you seem to hate me for it now , you are so severe . '
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 19]: ` Edward , ' said Miss Murdstone , again , ` let there be an end of this .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 5]: I go tomorrow . '
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 9]: ` Jane Murdstone , ' thundered Mr. Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 6]: ` Will you be silent ?
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 5]: How dare you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 16]: Miss Murdstone made a jail-delivery of her pocket-handkerchief , and held it before her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 17]: ` Clara , ' he continued , looking at my mother , ` you surprise me !
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 4]: You astound me !
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 40]: Yes , I had a satisfaction in the thought of marrying an inexperienced and artless person , and forming her character , and infusing into it some amount of that firmness and decision of which it stood in need .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 65]: But when Jane Murdstone is kind enough to come to my assistance in this endeavour , and to assume , for my sake , a condition something like a housekeeper 's , and when she meets with a base return -- ' ` Oh , pray , pray , Edward , ' cried my mother , ` do n't accuse me of being ungrateful .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 8]: I am sure I am not ungrateful .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 8]: No one ever said I was before .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 9]: I have many faults , but not that .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 9]: Oh , do n't , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 38]: ` When Jane Murdstone meets , I say , ' he went on , after waiting until my mother was silent , ` with a base return , that feeling of mine is chilled and altered . '
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 11]: ` Do n't , my love , say that ! '
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 6]: implored my mother very piteously .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 8]: ` Oh , do n't , Edward !
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 8]: I ca n't bear to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 8]: Whatever I am , I am affectionate .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 6]: I know I am affectionate .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 15]: I would n't say it , if I was n't sure that I am .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 3]: Ask Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 12]: I am sure she 'll tell you I 'm affectionate . '
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 28]: ` There is no extent of mere weakness , Clara , ' said Mr. Murdstone in reply , ` that can have the least weight with me .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 5]: You lose breath . '
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 22]: ` Pray let us be friends , ' said my mother , ' I could n't live under coldness or unkindness .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 5]: I am so sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 34]: I have a great many defects , I know , and it 's very good of you , Edward , with your strength of mind , to endeavour to correct them for me .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 9]: Jane , I do n't object to anything .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 22]: I should be quite broken-hearted if you thought of leaving -- ' My mother was too much overcome to go on .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 25]: ` Jane Murdstone , ' said Mr. Murdstone to his sister , ` any harsh words between us are , I hope , uncommon .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 15]: It is not my fault that so unusual an occurrence has taken place tonight .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 8]: I was betrayed into it by another .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 6]: Nor is it your fault .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 8]: You were betrayed into it by another .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 8]: Let us both try to forget it .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 30]: And as this , ' he added , after these magnanimous words , ` is not a fit scene for the boy -- David , go to bed ! '
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 16]: I could hardly find the door , through the tears that stood in my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 49]: I was so sorry for my mother 's distress ; but I groped my way out , and groped my way up to my room in the dark , without even having the heart to say good night to Peggotty , or to get a candle from her .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 39]: When her coming up to look for me , an hour or so afterwards , awoke me , she said that my mother had gone to bed poorly , and that Mr. and Miss Murdstone were sitting alone .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 23]: Going down next morning rather earlier than usual , I paused outside the parlour door , on hearing my mother 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 24]: She was very earnestly and humbly entreating Miss Murdstone 's pardon , which that lady granted , and a perfect reconciliation took place .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 93]: I never knew my mother afterwards to give an opinion on any matter , without first appealing to Miss Murdstone , or without having first ascertained by some sure means , what Miss Murdstone 's opinion was ; and I never saw Miss Murdstone , when out of temper -LRB- she was infirm that way -RRB- , move her hand towards her bag as if she were going to take out the keys and offer to resign them to my mother , without seeing that my mother was in a terrible fright .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 21]: The gloomy taint that was in the Murdstone blood , darkened the Murdstone religion , which was austere and wrathful .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 45]: I have thought , since , that its assuming that character was a necessary consequence of Mr. Murdstone 's firmness , which would n't allow him to let anybody off from the utmost weight of the severest penalties he could find any excuse for .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 29]: Be this as it may , I well remember the tremendous visages with which we used to go to church , and the changed air of the place .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 27]: Again , the dreaded Sunday comes round , and I file into the old pew first , like a guarded captive brought to a condemned service .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 37]: Again , Miss Murdstone , in a black velvet gown , that looks as if it had been made out of a pall , follows close upon me ; then my mother ; then her husband .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 12]: There is no Peggotty now , as in the old time .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 22]: Again , I listen to Miss Murdstone mumbling the responses , and emphasizing all the dread words with a cruel relish .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 29]: Again , I see her dark eyes roll round the church when she says ` miserable sinners ' , as if she were calling all the congregation names .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 30]: Again , I catch rare glimpses of my mother , moving her lips timidly between the two , with one of them muttering at each ear like low thunder .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 40]: Again , I wonder with a sudden fear whether it is likely that our good old clergyman can be wrong , and Mr. and Miss Murdstone right , and that all the angels in Heaven can be destroying angels .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 29]: Again , if I move a finger or relax a muscle of my face , Miss Murdstone pokes me with her prayer-book , and makes my side ache .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 25]: Yes , and again , as we walk home , I note some neighbours looking at my mother and at me , and whispering .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 53]: Again , as the three go on arm-in-arm , and I linger behind alone , I follow some of those looks , and wonder if my mother 's step be really not so light as I have seen it , and if the gaiety of her beauty be really almost worried away .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 42]: Again , I wonder whether any of the neighbours call to mind , as I do , how we used to walk home together , she and I ; and I wonder stupidly about that , all the dreary dismal day .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 15]: There had been some talk on occasions of my going to boarding - school .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 18]: Mr. and Miss Murdstone had originated it , and my mother had of course agreed with them .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 11]: Nothing , however , was concluded on the subject yet .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 10]: In the meantime , I learnt lessons at home .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 7]: Shall I ever forget those lessons !
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 48]: They were presided over nominally by my mother , but really by Mr. Murdstone and his sister , who were always present , and found them a favourable occasion for giving my mother lessons in that miscalled firmness , which was the bane of both our lives .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 11]: I believe I was kept at home for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 22]: I had been apt enough to learn , and willing enough , when my mother and I had lived alone together .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 11]: I can faintly remember learning the alphabet at her knee .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 47]: To this day , when I look upon the fat black letters in the primer , the puzzling novelty of their shapes , and the easy good-nature of O and Q and S , seem to present themselves again before me as they used to do .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 10]: But they recall no feeling of disgust or reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 39]: On the contrary , I seem to have walked along a path of flowers as far as the crocodile-book , and to have been cheered by the gentleness of my mother 's voice and manner all the way .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 25]: But these solemn lessons which succeeded those , I remember as the death-blow of my peace , and a grievous daily drudgery and misery .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 39]: They were very long , very numerous , very hard - perfectly unintelligible , some of them , to me -- and I was generally as much bewildered by them as I believe my poor mother was herself .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 16]: Let me remember how it used to be , and bring one morning back again .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 21]: I come into the second-best parlour after breakfast , with my books , and an exercise-book , and a slate .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 48]: My mother is ready for me at her writing-desk , but not half so ready as Mr. Murdstone in his easy-chair by the window -LRB- though he pretends to be reading a book -RRB- , or as Miss Murdstone , sitting near my mother stringing steel beads .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 44]: The very sight of these two has such an influence over me , that I begin to feel the words I have been at infinite pains to get into my head , all sliding away , and going I do n't know where .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 11]: I wonder where they do go , by the by ?
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 9]: I hand the first book to my mother .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 13]: Perhaps it is a grammar , perhaps a history , or geography .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 32]: I take a last drowning look at the page as I give it into her hand , and start off aloud at a racing pace while I have got it fresh .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 6]: I trip over a word .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 5]: Mr. Murdstone looks up .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 6]: I trip over another word .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 5]: Miss Murdstone looks up .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 11]: I redden , tumble over half-a-dozen words , and stop .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 32]: I think my mother would show me the book if she dared , but she does not dare , and she says softly : ` Oh , Davy , Davy ! '
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 17]: ` Now , Clara , ' says Mr. Murdstone , ` be firm with the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 12]: Do n't say , `` Oh , Davy , Davy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 4]: That 's childish .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 13]: He knows his lesson , or he does not know it . '
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 14]: ` He does NOT know it , ' Miss Murdstone interposes awfully . '
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 13]: I am really afraid he does not , ' says my mother .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 30]: ` Then , you see , Clara , ' returns Miss Murdstone , ` you should just give him the book back , and make him know it . '
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 23]: ` Yes , certainly , ' says my mother ; ` that is what I intend to do , my dear Jane .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 15]: Now , Davy , try once more , and do n't be stupid . '
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 28]: I obey the first clause of the injunction by trying once more , but am not so successful with the second , for I am very stupid .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 26]: I tumble down before I get to the old place , at a point where I was all right before , and stop to think .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 9]: But I ca n't think about the lesson .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 50]: I think of the number of yards of net in Miss Murdstone 's cap , or of the price of Mr. Murdstone 's dressing-gown , or any such ridiculous problem that I have no business with , and do n't want to have anything at all to do with .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 17]: Mr. Murdstone makes a movement of impatience which I have been expecting for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 6]: Miss Murdstone does the same .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 29]: My mother glances submissively at them , shuts the book , and lays it by as an arrear to be worked out when my other tasks are done .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 18]: There is a pile of these arrears very soon , and it swells like a rolling snowball .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 11]: The bigger it gets , the more stupid I get .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 37]: The case is so hopeless , and I feel that I am wallowing in such a bog of nonsense , that I give up all idea of getting out , and abandon myself to my fate .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 23]: The despairing way in which my mother and I look at each other , as I blunder on , is truly melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 32]: But the greatest effect in these miserable lessons is when my mother -LRB- thinking nobody is observing her -RRB- tries to give me the cue by the motion of her lips .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 30]: At that instant , Miss Murdstone , who has been lying in wait for nothing else all along , says in a deep warning voice : ` Clara ! '
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 10]: My mother starts , colours , and smiles faintly .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 34]: Mr. Murdstone comes out of his chair , takes the book , throws it at me or boxes my ears with it , and turns me out of the room by the shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 22]: Even when the lessons are done , the worst is yet to happen , in the shape of an appalling sum .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 51]: This is invented for me , and delivered to me orally by Mr. Murdstone , and begins , ` If I go into a cheesemonger 's shop , and buy five thousand double-Gloucester cheeses at fourpence-halfpenny each , present payment ' -- at which I see Miss Murdstone secretly overjoyed .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 61]: I pore over these cheeses without any result or enlightenment until dinner-time , when , having made a Mulatto of myself by getting the dirt of the slate into the pores of my skin , I have a slice of bread to help me out with the cheeses , and am considered in disgrace for the rest of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 21]: It seems to me , at this distance of time , as if my unfortunate studies generally took this course .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 35]: I could have done very well if I had been without the Murdstones ; but the influence of the Murdstones upon me was like the fascination of two snakes on a wretched young bird .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 87]: Even when I did get through the morning with tolerable credit , there was not much gained but dinner ; for Miss Murdstone never could endure to see me untasked , and if I rashly made any show of being unemployed , called her brother 's attention to me by saying , ` Clara , my dear , there 's nothing like work -- give your boy an exercise ' ; which caused me to be clapped down to some new labour , there and then .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 60]: As to any recreation with other children of my age , I had very little of that ; for the gloomy theology of the Murdstones made all children out to be a swarm of little vipers -LRB- though there WAS a child once set in the midst of the Disciples -RRB- , and held that they contaminated one another .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 30]: The natural result of this treatment , continued , I suppose , for some six months or more , was to make me sullen , dull , and dogged .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 24]: I was not made the less so by my sense of being daily more and more shut out and alienated from my mother .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 13]: I believe I should have been almost stupefied but for one circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 4]: It was this .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 37]: My father had left a small collection of books in a little room upstairs , to which I had access -LRB- for it adjoined my own -RRB- and which nobody else in our house ever troubled .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 45]: From that blessed little room , Roderick Random , Peregrine Pickle , Humphrey Clinker , Tom Jones , the Vicar of Wakefield , Don Quixote , Gil Blas , and Robinson Crusoe , came out , a glorious host , to keep me company .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 59]: They kept alive my fancy , and my hope of something beyond that place and time , -- they , and the Arabian Nights , and the Tales of the Genii , -- and did me no harm ; for whatever harm was in some of them was not there for me ; I knew nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 32]: It is astonishing to me now , how I found time , in the midst of my porings and blunderings over heavier themes , to read those books as I did .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 55]: It is curious to me how I could ever have consoled myself under my small troubles -LRB- which were great troubles to me -RRB- , by impersonating my favourite characters in them -- as I did -- and by putting Mr. and Miss Murdstone into all the bad ones -- which I did too .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 21]: I have been Tom Jones -LRB- a child 's Tom Jones , a harmless creature -RRB- for a week together .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 20]: I have sustained my own idea of Roderick Random for a month at a stretch , I verily believe .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 88]: I had a greedy relish for a few volumes of Voyages and Travels -- I forget what , now -- that were on those shelves ; and for days and days I can remember to have gone about my region of our house , armed with the centre-piece out of an old set of boot-trees -- the perfect realization of Captain Somebody , of the Royal British Navy , in danger of being beset by savages , and resolved to sell his life at a great price .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 16]: The Captain never lost dignity , from having his ears boxed with the Latin Grammar .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 31]: I did ; but the Captain was a Captain and a hero , in despite of all the grammars of all the languages in the world , dead or alive .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 9]: This was my only and my constant comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 40]: When I think of it , the picture always rises in my mind , of a summer evening , the boys at play in the churchyard , and I sitting on my bed , reading as if for life .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 45]: Every barn in the neighbourhood , every stone in the church , and every foot of the churchyard , had some association of its own , in my mind , connected with these books , and stood for some locality made famous in them .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 53]: I have seen Tom Pipes go climbing up the church-steeple ; I have watched Strap , with the knapsack on his back , stopping to rest himself upon the wicket-gate ; and I know that Commodore Trunnion held that club with Mr. Pickle , in the parlour of our little village alehouse .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 32]: The reader now understands , as well as I do , what I was when I came to that point of my youthful history to which I am now coming again .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 61]: One morning when I went into the parlour with my books , I found my mother looking anxious , Miss Murdstone looking firm , and Mr. Murdstone binding something round the bottom of a cane -- a lithe and limber cane , which he left off binding when I came in , and poised and switched in the air . '
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 20]: I tell you , Clara , ' said Mr. Murdstone , ' I have been often flogged myself . '
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 13]: ` To be sure ; of course , ' said Miss Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 14]: ` Certainly , my dear Jane , ' faltered my mother , meekly .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 13]: ` But -- but do you think it did Edward good ? '
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 12]: ` Do you think it did Edward harm , Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 6]: asked Mr. Murdstone , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 11]: ` That 's the point , ' said his sister .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 19]: To this my mother returned , ` Certainly , my dear Jane , ' and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 24]: I felt apprehensive that I was personally interested in this dialogue , and sought Mr. Murdstone 's eye as it lighted on mine .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 32]: ` Now , David , ' he said -- and I saw that cast again as he said it -- ` you must be far more careful today than usual . '
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 36]: He gave the cane another poise , and another switch ; and having finished his preparation of it , laid it down beside him , with an impressive look , and took up his book .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 15]: This was a good freshener to my presence of mind , as a beginning .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 65]: I felt the words of my lessons slipping off , not one by one , or line by line , but by the entire page ; I tried to lay hold of them ; but they seemed , if I may so express it , to have put skates on , and to skim away from me with a smoothness there was no checking .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 9]: We began badly , and went on worse .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 30]: I had come in with an idea of distinguishing myself rather , conceiving that I was very well prepared ; but it turned out to be quite a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 22]: Book after book was added to the heap of failures , Miss Murdstone being firmly watchful of us all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 29]: And when we came at last to the five thousand cheeses -LRB- canes he made it that day , I remember -RRB- , my mother burst out crying .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 4]: ` Clara ! '
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 10]: said Miss Murdstone , in her warning voice . '
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 18]: I am not quite well , my dear Jane , I think , ' said my mother .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 50]: I saw him wink , solemnly , at his sister , as he rose and said , taking up the cane : ` Why , Jane , we can hardly expect Clara to bear , with perfect firmness , the worry and torment that David has occasioned her today .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 5]: That would be stoical .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 17]: Clara is greatly strengthened and improved , but we can hardly expect so much from her .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 12]: David , you and I will go upstairs , boy . '
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 15]: As he took me out at the door , my mother ran towards us .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 7]: Miss Murdstone said , ` Clara !
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 7]: are you a perfect fool ? '
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 3]: and interfered .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 15]: I saw my mother stop her ears then , and I heard her crying .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 40]: He walked me up to my room slowly and gravely -- I am certain he had a delight in that formal parade of executing justice -- and when we got there , suddenly twisted my head under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 4]: ` Mr. Murdstone !
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 3]: Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 5]: I cried to him .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 4]: ` Do n't !
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 6]: Pray do n't beat me !
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 21]: I have tried to learn , sir , but I ca n't learn while you and Miss Murdstone are by .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 6]: I ca n't indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 10]: ` Ca n't you , indeed , David ? '
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 7]: ` We 'll try that . '
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 30]: He had my head as in a vice , but I twined round him somehow , and stopped him for a moment , entreating him not to beat me .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 46]: It was only a moment that I stopped him , for he cut me heavily an instant afterwards , and in the same instant I caught the hand with which he held me in my mouth , between my teeth , and bit it through .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 11]: It sets my teeth on edge to think of it .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 15]: He beat me then , as if he would have beaten me to death .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 29]: Above all the noise we made , I heard them running up the stairs , and crying out -- I heard my mother crying out -- and Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 38]: Then he was gone ; and the door was locked outside ; and I was lying , fevered and hot , and torn , and sore , and raging in my puny way , upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 22]: How well I recollect , when I became quiet , what an unnatural stillness seemed to reign through the whole house !
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 21]: How well I remember , when my smart and passion began to cool , how wicked I began to feel !
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 15]: I sat listening for a long while , but there was not a sound .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 28]: I crawled up from the floor , and saw my face in the glass , so swollen , red , and ugly that it almost frightened me .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 27]: My stripes were sore and stiff , and made me cry afresh , when I moved ; but they were nothing to the guilt I felt .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 20]: It lay heavier on my breast than if I had been a most atrocious criminal , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 63]: It had begun to grow dark , and I had shut the window -LRB- I had been lying , for the most part , with my head upon the sill , by turns crying , dozing , and looking listlessly out -RRB- , when the key was turned , and Miss Murdstone came in with some bread and meat , and milk .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 30]: These she put down upon the table without a word , glaring at me the while with exemplary firmness , and then retired , locking the door after her .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 16]: Long after it was dark I sat there , wondering whether anybody else would come .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 32]: When this appeared improbable for that night , I undressed , and went to bed ; and , there , I began to wonder fearfully what would be done to me .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 11]: Whether it was a criminal act that I had committed ?
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 13]: Whether I should be taken into custody , and sent to prison ?
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 11]: Whether I was at all in danger of being hanged ?
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 35]: I never shall forget the waking , next morning ; the being cheerful and fresh for the first moment , and then the being weighed down by the stale and dismal oppression of remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 52]: Miss Murdstone reappeared before I was out of bed ; told me , in so many words , that I was free to walk in the garden for half an hour and no longer ; and retired , leaving the door open , that I might avail myself of that permission .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 18]: I did so , and did so every morning of my imprisonment , which lasted five days .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 97]: If I could have seen my mother alone , I should have gone down on my knees to her and besought her forgiveness ; but I saw no one , Miss Murdstone excepted , during the whole time -- except at evening prayers in the parlour ; to which I was escorted by Miss Murdstone after everybody else was placed ; where I was stationed , a young outlaw , all alone by myself near the door ; and whence I was solemnly conducted by my jailer , before any one arose from the devotional posture .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 45]: I only observed that my mother was as far off from me as she could be , and kept her face another way so that I never saw it ; and that Mr. Murdstone 's hand was bound up in a large linen wrapper .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 16]: The length of those five days I can convey no idea of to any one .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 10]: They occupy the place of years in my remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 268]: The way in which I listened to all the incidents of the house that made themselves audible to me ; the ringing of bells , the opening and shutting of doors , the murmuring of voices , the footsteps on the stairs ; to any laughing , whistling , or singing , outside , which seemed more dismal than anything else to me in my solitude and disgrace -- the uncertain pace of the hours , especially at night , when I would wake thinking it was morning , and find that the family were not yet gone to bed , and that all the length of night had yet to come -- the depressed dreams and nightmares I had -- the return of day , noon , afternoon , evening , when the boys played in the churchyard , and I watched them from a distance within the room , being ashamed to show myself at the window lest they should know I was a prisoner -- the strange sensation of never hearing myself speak -- the fleeting intervals of something like cheerfulness , which came with eating and drinking , and went away with it -- the setting in of rain one evening , with a fresh smell , and its coming down faster and faster between me and the church , until it and gathering night seemed to quench me in gloom , and fear , and remorse -- all this appears to have gone round and round for years instead of days , it is so vividly and strongly stamped on my remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 21]: On the last night of my restraint , I was awakened by hearing my own name spoken in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 25]: I started up in bed , and putting out my arms in the dark , said : ` Is that you , Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 50]: There was no immediate answer , but presently I heard my name again , in a tone so very mysterious and awful , that I think I should have gone into a fit , if it had not occurred to me that it must have come through the keyhole .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 28]: I groped my way to the door , and putting my own lips to the keyhole , whispered : ` Is that you , Peggotty dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 12]: ` Yes , my own precious Davy , ' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 16]: ` Be as soft as a mouse , or the Cat 'll hear us . '
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 24]: I understood this to mean Miss Murdstone , and was sensible of the urgency of the case ; her room being close by .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 8]: ` How 's mama , dear Peggotty ?
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 8]: Is she very angry with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 24]: I could hear Peggotty crying softly on her side of the keyhole , as I was doing on mine , before she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 4]: Not very . '
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 13]: ` What is going to be done with me , Peggotty dear ?
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 5]: Do you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 3]: ` School .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 9]: Near London , ' was Peggotty 's answer .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 58]: I was obliged to get her to repeat it , for she spoke it the first time quite down my throat , in consequence of my having forgotten to take my mouth away from the keyhole and put my ear there ; and though her words tickled me a good deal , I did n't hear them .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 6]: ` When , Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 4]: ` Tomorrow . '
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 17]: ` Is that the reason why Miss Murdstone took the clothes out of my drawers ? '
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 13]: which she had done , though I have forgotten to mention it .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 4]: ` Box . '
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 8]: ` Sha n't I see mama ? '
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 4]: ` Morning . '
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 54]: Then Peggotty fitted her mouth close to the keyhole , and delivered these words through it with as much feeling and earnestness as a keyhole has ever been the medium of communicating , I will venture to assert : shooting in each broken little sentence in a convulsive little burst of its own .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 5]: ` Davy , dear .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 11]: If I ai n't been azackly as intimate with you .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 8]: Lately , as I used to be .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 10]: It ai n't because I do n't love you .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 10]: just as well and more , my pretty poppet .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 10]: It 's because I thought it better for you .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 6]: And for someone else besides .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 9]: Davy , my darling , are you listening ?
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 5]: Can you hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 6]: ` Ye-ye-ye-yes , Peggotty ! '
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 3]: I sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 5]: ` My own ! '
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 7]: said Peggotty , with infinite compassion .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 9]: ` What I want to say , is .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 7]: That you must never forget me .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 7]: For I 'll never forget you .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 13]: And I 'll take as much care of your mama , Davy .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 7]: As ever I took of you .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 7]: And I wo n't leave her .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 15]: The day may come when she 'll be glad to lay her poor head .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 11]: On her stupid , cross old Peggotty 's arm again .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 10]: And I 'll write to you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 7]: Though I ai n't no scholar .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 22]: And I 'll -- I 'll -- ' Peggotty fell to kissing the keyhole , as she could n't kiss me .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 8]: ` Thank you , dear Peggotty ! '
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 8]: said I. ` Oh , thank you !
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 3]: Thank you !
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 9]: Will you promise me one thing , Peggotty ?
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 46]: Will you write and tell Mr. Peggotty and little Em ` ly , and Mrs. Gummidge and Ham , that I am not so bad as they might suppose , and that I sent 'em all my love - especially to little Em ` ly ?
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 10]: Will you , if you please , Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 40]: The kind soul promised , and we both of us kissed the keyhole with the greatest affection -- I patted it with my hand , I recollect , as if it had been her honest face -- and parted .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 21]: From that night there grew up in my breast a feeling for Peggotty which I can not very well define .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 44]: She did not replace my mother ; no one could do that ; but she came into a vacancy in my heart , which closed upon her , and I felt towards her something I have never felt for any other human being .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 43]: It was a sort of comical affection , too ; and yet if she had died , I can not think what I should have done , or how I should have acted out the tragedy it would have been to me .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 30]: In the morning Miss Murdstone appeared as usual , and told me I was going to school ; which was not altogether such news to me as she supposed .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 24]: She also informed me that when I was dressed , I was to come downstairs into the parlour , and have my breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 29]: There , I found my mother , very pale and with red eyes : into whose arms I ran , and begged her pardon from my suffering soul .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 6]: ` Oh , Davy ! '
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 9]: ` That you could hurt anyone I love !
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 10]: Try to be better , pray to be better !
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 24]: I forgive you ; but I am so grieved , Davy , that you should have such bad passions in your heart . '
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 24]: They had persuaded her that I was a wicked fellow , and she was more sorry for that than for my going away .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 5]: I felt it sorely .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 24]: I tried to eat my parting breakfast , but my tears dropped upon my bread - and-butter , and trickled into my tea .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 27]: I saw my mother look at me sometimes , and then glance at the watchful Miss Murdstone , and than look down , or look away .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 8]: ` Master Copperfield 's box there ! '
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 12]: said Miss Murdstone , when wheels were heard at the gate .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 18]: I looked for Peggotty , but it was not she ; neither she nor Mr. Murdstone appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 12]: My former acquaintance , the carrier , was at the door .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 13]: the box was taken out to his cart , and lifted in .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 4]: ` Clara ! '
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 9]: said Miss Murdstone , in her warning note .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 12]: ` Ready , my dear Jane , ' returned my mother .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 5]: ` Good-bye , Davy .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 8]: You are going for your own good .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 5]: Good-bye , my child .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 15]: You will come home in the holidays , and be a better boy . '
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 4]: ` Clara ! '
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 4]: Miss Murdstone repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 18]: ` Certainly , my dear Jane , ' replied my mother , who was holding me . '
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 8]: I forgive you , my dear boy .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 5]: God bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 4]: ` Clara ! '
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 4]: Miss Murdstone repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 51]: Miss Murdstone was good enough to take me out to the cart , and to say on the way that she hoped I would repent , before I came to a bad end ; and then I got into the cart , and the lazy horse walked off with it .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 31]: Chapter 5 I Am Sent Away from Home We might have gone about half a mile , and my pocket-handkerchief was quite wet through , when the carrier stopped short .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 25]: Looking out to ascertain for what , I saw , to My amazement , Peggotty burst from a hedge and climb into the cart .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 39]: She took me in both her arms , and squeezed me to her stays until the pressure on my nose was extremely painful , though I never thought of that till afterwards when I found it very tender .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 8]: Not a single word did Peggotty speak .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 50]: Releasing one of her arms , she put it down in her pocket to the elbow , and brought out some paper bags of cakes which she crammed into my pockets , and a purse which she put into my hand , but not one word did she say .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 39]: After another and a final squeeze with both arms , she got down from the cart and ran away ; and , my belief is , and has always been , without a solitary button on her gown .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 23]: I picked up one , of several that were rolling about , and treasured it as a keepsake for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 16]: The carrier looked at me , as if to inquire if she were coming back .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 11]: I shook my head , and said I thought not .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 19]: ` Then come up , ' said the carrier to the lazy horse ; who came up accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 53]: Having by this time cried as much as I possibly could , I began to think it was of no use crying any more , especially as neither Roderick Random , nor that Captain in the Royal British Navy , had ever cried , that I could remember , in trying situations .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 26]: The carrier , seeing me in this resolution , proposed that my pocket - handkerchief should be spread upon the horse 's back to dry .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 17]: I thanked him , and assented ; and particularly small it looked , under those circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 9]: I had now leisure to examine the purse .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 33]: It was a stiff leather purse , with a snap , and had three bright shillings in it , which Peggotty had evidently polished up with whitening , for my greater delight .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 31]: But its most precious contents were two half-crowns folded together in a bit of paper , on which was written , in my mother 's hand , ` For Davy .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 5]: With my love . '
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 55]: I was so overcome by this , that I asked the carrier to be so good as to reach me my pocket-handkerchief again ; but he said he thought I had better do without it , and I thought I really had , so I wiped my eyes on my sleeve and stopped myself .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 24]: For good , too ; though , in consequence of my previous emotions , I was still occasionally seized with a stormy sob .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 22]: After we had jogged on for some little time , I asked the carrier if he was going all the way .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 7]: ` All the way where ? '
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 4]: inquired the carrier .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 7]: ` There , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 6]: ` Where 's there ? '
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 4]: inquired the carrier .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 8]: ` Near London , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 33]: ` Why that horse , ' said the carrier , jerking the rein to point him out , ` would be deader than pork afore he got over half the ground . '
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 10]: ` Are you only going to Yarmouth then ? '
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 11]: ` That 's about it , ' said the carrier .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 25]: ` And there I shall take you to the stage-cutch , and the stage-cutch that 'll take you to -- wherever it is . '
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 84]: As this was a great deal for the carrier -LRB- whose name was Mr. Barkis -RRB- to say -- he being , as I observed in a former chapter , of a phlegmatic temperament , and not at all conversational -- I offered him a cake as a mark of attention , which he ate at one gulp , exactly like an elephant , and which made no more impression on his big face than it would have done on an elephant 's .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 9]: ` Did SHE make 'em , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 26]: said Mr. Barkis , always leaning forward , in his slouching way , on the footboard of the cart with an arm on each knee .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 10]: ` Peggotty , do you mean , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 4]: said Mr. Barkis .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 4]: ` Her . '
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 13]: She makes all our pastry , and does all our cooking . '
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 6]: ` Do she though ? '
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 4]: said Mr. Barkis .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 16]: He made up his mouth as if to whistle , but he did n't whistle .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 26]: He sat looking at the horse 's ears , as if he saw something new there ; and sat so , for a considerable time .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 17]: By and by , he said : ` No sweethearts , I b ` lieve ? '
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 10]: ` Sweetmeats did you say , Mr. Barkis ? '
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 20]: For I thought he wanted something else to eat , and had pointedly alluded to that description of refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 8]: ` Hearts , ' said Mr. Barkis .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 11]: ` Sweet hearts ; no person walks with her ! '
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 5]: ` With Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 4]: ` Her . '
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 5]: ` Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 7]: She never had a sweetheart . '
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 8]: ` Did n't she , though ! '
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 4]: said Mr. Barkis .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 25]: Again he made up his mouth to whistle , and again he did n't whistle , but sat looking at the horse 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 33]: ` So she makes , ' said Mr. Barkis , after a long interval of reflection , ` all the apple parsties , and doos all the cooking , do she ? '
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 8]: I replied that such was the fact .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 3]: ` Well .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 11]: I 'll tell you what , ' said Mr. Barkis .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 12]: ` P'raps you might be writin ' to her ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 11]: I shall certainly write to her , ' I rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 10]: he said , slowly turning his eyes towards me .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 26]: If you was writin ' to her , p ` raps you 'd recollect to say that Barkis was willin ' ; would you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 12]: ` That Barkis is willing , ' I repeated , innocently .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 8]: ` Is that all the message ? '
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 9]: ` Ye-es , ' he said , considering .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 3]: ` Ye-es .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 6]: Barkis is willin ' . '
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 43]: ` But you will be at Blunderstone again tomorrow , Mr. Barkis , ' I said , faltering a little at the idea of my being far away from it then , and could give your own message so much better . '
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 35]: As he repudiated this suggestion , however , with a jerk of his head , and once more confirmed his previous request by saying , with profound gravity , ` Barkis is willin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 12]: That 's the message , ' I readily undertook its transmission .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 42]: While I was waiting for the coach in the hotel at Yarmouth that very afternoon , I procured a sheet of paper and an inkstand , and wrote a note to Peggotty , which ran thus : ` My dear Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 6]: I have come here safe .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 4]: Barkis is willing .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 5]: My love to mama .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 3]: Yours affectionately .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 2]: P.S. .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 14]: He says he particularly wants you to know -- BARKIS IS WILLING . '
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 43]: When I had taken this commission on myself prospectively , Mr. Barkis relapsed into perfect silence ; and I , feeling quite worn out by all that had happened lately , lay down on a sack in the cart and fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 57]: I slept soundly until we got to Yarmouth ; which was so entirely new and strange to me in the inn-yard to which we drove , that I at once abandoned a latent hope I had had of meeting with some of Mr. Peggotty 's family there , perhaps even with little Em ` ly herself .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 41]: The coach was in the yard , shining very much all over , but without any horses to it as yet ; and it looked in that state as if nothing was more unlikely than its ever going to London .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 81]: I was thinking this , and wondering what would ultimately become of my box , which Mr. Barkis had put down on the yard-pavement by the pole -LRB- he having driven up the yard to turn his cart -RRB- , and also what would ultimately become of me , when a lady looked out of a bow-window where some fowls and joints of meat were hanging up , and said : ` Is that the little gentleman from Blunderstone ? '
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 9]: ` Yes , ma'am , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 5]: ` What name ? '
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 4]: inquired the lady .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 9]: ` Copperfield , ma'am , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 11]: ` That wo n't do , ' returned the lady .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 14]: ` Nobody 's dinner is paid for here , in that name . '
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 8]: ` Is it Murdstone , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 25]: ` If you 're Master Murdstone , ' said the lady , ` why do you go and give another name , first ? '
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 22]: I explained to the lady how it was , who than rang a bell , and called out , ` William !
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 5]: show the coffee-room ! '
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 37]: upon which a waiter came running out of a kitchen on the opposite side of the yard to show it , and seemed a good deal surprised when he was only to show it to me .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 13]: It was a large long room with some large maps in it .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 28]: I doubt if I could have felt much stranger if the maps had been real foreign countries , and I cast away in the middle of them .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 61]: I felt it was taking a liberty to sit down , with my cap in my hand , on the corner of the chair nearest the door ; and when the waiter laid a cloth on purpose for me , and put a set of castors on it , I think I must have turned red all over with modesty .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 31]: He brought me some chops , and vegetables , and took the covers off in such a bouncing manner that I was afraid I must have given him some offence .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 27]: But he greatly relieved my mind by putting a chair for me at the table , and saying , very affably , ` Now , six-foot !
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 4]: come on ! '
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 63]: I thanked him , and took my seat at the board ; but found it extremely difficult to handle my knife and fork with anything like dexterity , or to avoid splashing myself with the gravy , while he was standing opposite , staring so hard , and making me blush in the most dreadful manner every time I caught his eye .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 22]: After watching me into the second chop , he said : ` There 's half a pint of ale for you .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 7]: Will you have it now ? '
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 10]: I thanked him and said , ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 28]: Upon which he poured it out of a jug into a large tumbler , and held it up against the light , and made it look beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 5]: ` My eye ! '
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 12]: ` It seems a good deal , do n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 15]: ` It does seem a good deal , ' I answered with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 14]: For it was quite delightful to me , to find him so pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 44]: He was a twinkling-eyed , pimple-faced man , with his hair standing upright all over his head ; and as he stood with one arm a-kimbo , holding up the glass to the light with the other hand , he looked quite friendly .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 30]: ` There was a gentleman here , yesterday , ' he said -- ' a stout gentleman , by the name of Topsawyer -- perhaps you know him ? '
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 34]: ` No , ' I said , ' I do n't think -- ' ` In breeches and gaiters , broad-brimmed hat , grey coat , speckled choker , ' said the waiter .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 59]: ` No , ' I said bashfully , ' I have n't the pleasure -- ' ` He came in here , ' said the waiter , looking at the light through the tumbler , ` ordered a glass of this ale -- WOULD order it -- I told him not -- drank it , and fell dead .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 7]: It was too old for him .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 13]: It ought n't to be drawn ; that 's the fact . '
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 23]: I was very much shocked to hear of this melancholy accident , and said I thought I had better have some water .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 39]: ` Why you see , ' said the waiter , still looking at the light through the tumbler , with one of his eyes shut up , ` our people do n't like things being ordered and left .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 4]: It offends 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 10]: But I 'll drink it , if you like .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 11]: I 'm used to it , and use is everything .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 22]: I do n't think it 'll hurt me , if I throw my head back , and take it off quick .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 4]: Shall I ? '
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 27]: I replied that he would much oblige me by drinking it , if he thought he could do it safely , but by no means otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 42]: When he did throw his head back , and take it off quick , I had a horrible fear , I confess , of seeing him meet the fate of the lamented Mr. Topsawyer , and fall lifeless on the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 7]: But it did n't hurt him .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 13]: On the contrary , I thought he seemed the fresher for it .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 8]: ` What have we got here ? '
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 10]: he said , putting a fork into my dish .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 5]: ` Not chops ? '
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 7]: ` Chops , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 7]: ` Lord bless my soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 12]: he exclaimed , ' I did n't know they were chops .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 18]: Why , a chop 's the very thing to take off the bad effects of that beer !
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 6]: Ai n't it lucky ? '
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 33]: So he took a chop by the bone in one hand , and a potato in the other , and ate away with a very good appetite , to my extreme satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 20]: He afterwards took another chop , and another potato ; and after that , another chop and another potato .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 33]: When we had done , he brought me a pudding , and having set it before me , seemed to ruminate , and to become absent in his mind for some moments .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 7]: ` How 's the pie ? '
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 6]: he said , rousing himself .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 11]: ` It 's a pudding , ' I made answer .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 4]: ` Pudding ! '
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 10]: ` Why , bless me , so it is !
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 3]: What ! '
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 5]: looking at it nearer .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 13]: ` You do n't mean to say it 's a batter-pudding ! '
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 8]: ` Yes , it is indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 21]: ` Why , a batter-pudding , ' he said , taking up a table-spoon , ` is my favourite pudding !
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 5]: Ai n't that lucky ?
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 17]: Come on , little ` un , and let 's see who 'll get most . '
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 6]: The waiter certainly got most .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 51]: He entreated me more than once to come in and win , but what with his table-spoon to my tea-spoon , his dispatch to my dispatch , and his appetite to my appetite , I was left far behind at the first mouthful , and had no chance with him .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 32]: I never saw anyone enjoy a pudding so much , I think ; and he laughed , when it was all gone , as if his enjoyment of it lasted still .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 27]: Finding him so very friendly and companionable , it was then that I asked for the pen and ink and paper , to write to Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 21]: He not only brought it immediately , but was good enough to look over me while I wrote the letter .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 16]: When I had finished it , he asked me where I was going to school .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 14]: I said , ` Near London , ' which was all I knew .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 4]: my eye ! '
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 15]: he said , looking very low-spirited , ' I am sorry for that . '
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 4]: ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 4]: I asked him .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 6]: ` Oh , Lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 29]: he said , shaking his head , ` that 's the school where they broke the boy 's ribs -- two ribs -- a little boy he was .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 18]: I should say he was -- let me see -- how old are you , about ? '
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 8]: I told him between eight and nine .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 11]: ` That 's just his age , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 34]: ` He was eight years and six months old when they broke his first rib ; eight years and eight months old when they broke his second , and did for him . '
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 26]: I could not disguise from myself , or from the waiter , that this was an uncomfortable coincidence , and inquired how it was done .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 22]: His answer was not cheering to my spirits , for it consisted of two dismal words , ` With whopping . '
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 49]: The blowing of the coach-horn in the yard was a seasonable diversion , which made me get up and hesitatingly inquire , in the mingled pride and diffidence of having a purse -LRB- which I took out of my pocket -RRB- , if there were anything to pay .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 12]: ` There 's a sheet of letter-paper , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 11]: ` Did you ever buy a sheet of letter-paper ? '
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 9]: I could not remember that I ever had .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 16]: ` It 's dear , ' he said , ` on account of the duty .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 2]: Threepence .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 11]: That 's the way we 're taxed in this country .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 9]: There 's nothing else , except the waiter .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 5]: Never mind the ink .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 6]: I lose by that . '
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 30]: ` What should you -- what should I -- how much ought I to -- what would it be right to pay the waiter , if you please ? '
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 5]: I stammered , blushing .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 29]: ` If I had n't a family , and that family had n't the cowpock , ' said the waiter , ' I would n't take a sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 31]: If I did n't support a aged pairint , and a lovely sister , ' -- here the waiter was greatly agitated -- ' I would n't take a farthing .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 27]: If I had a good place , and was treated well here , I should beg acceptance of a trifle , instead of taking of it .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 22]: But I live on broken wittles -- and I sleep on the coals ' -- here the waiter burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 26]: I was very much concerned for his misfortunes , and felt that any recognition short of ninepence would be mere brutality and hardness of heart .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 36]: Therefore I gave him one of my three bright shillings , which he received with much humility and veneration , and spun up with his thumb , directly afterwards , to try the goodness of .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 35]: It was a little disconcerting to me , to find , when I was being helped up behind the coach , that I was supposed to have eaten all the dinner without any assistance .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 31]: I discovered this , from overhearing the lady in the bow-window say to the guard , ` Take care of that child , George , or he 'll burst ! '
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 24]: and from observing that the women-servants who were about the place came out to look and giggle at me as a young phenomenon .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 34]: My unfortunate friend the waiter , who had quite recovered his spirits , did not appear to be disturbed by this , but joined in the general admiration without being at all confused .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 70]: If I had any doubt of him , I suppose this half awakened it ; but I am inclined to believe that with the simple confidence of a child , and the natural reliance of a child upon superior years -LRB- qualities I am very sorry any children should prematurely change for worldly wisdom -RRB- , I had no serious mistrust of him on the whole , even then .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 54]: I felt it rather hard , I must own , to be made , without deserving it , the subject of jokes between the coachman and guard as to the coach drawing heavy behind , on account of my sitting there , and as to the greater expediency of my travelling by waggon .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 60]: The story of my supposed appetite getting wind among the outside passengers , they were merry upon it likewise ; and asked me whether I was going to be paid for , at school , as two brothers or three , and whether I was contracted for , or went upon the regular terms ; with other pleasant questions .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 55]: But the worst of it was , that I knew I should be ashamed to eat anything , when an opportunity offered , and that , after a rather light dinner , I should remain hungry all night -- for I had left my cakes behind , at the hotel , in my hurry .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 5]: My apprehensions were realized .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 36]: When we stopped for supper I could n't muster courage to take any , though I should have liked it very much , but sat by the fire and said I did n't want anything .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 78]: This did not save me from more jokes , either ; for a husky-voiced gentleman with a rough face , who had been eating out of a sandwich-box nearly all the way , except when he had been drinking out of a bottle , said I was like a boa-constrictor who took enough at one meal to last him a long time ; after which , he actually brought a rash out upon himself with boiled beef .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 23]: We had started from Yarmouth at three o'clock in the afternoon , and we were due in London about eight next morning .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 12]: It was Mid-summer weather , and the evening was very pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 63]: When we passed through a village , I pictured to myself what the insides of the houses were like , and what the inhabitants were about ; and when boys came running after us , and got up behind and swung there for a little way , I wondered whether their fathers were alive , and whether they Were happy at home .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 30]: I had plenty to think of , therefore , besides my mind running continually on the kind of place I was going to -- which was an awful speculation .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 71]: Sometimes , I remember , I resigned myself to thoughts of home and Peggotty ; and to endeavouring , in a confused blind way , to recall how I had felt , and what sort of boy I used to be , before I bit Mr. Murdstone : which I could n't satisfy myself about by any means , I seemed to have bitten him in such a remote antiquity .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 51]: The night was not so pleasant as the evening , for it got chilly ; and being put between two gentlemen -LRB- the rough-faced one and another -RRB- to prevent my tumbling off the coach , I was nearly smothered by their falling asleep , and completely blocking me up .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 18]: They squeezed me so hard sometimes , that I could not help crying out , ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 5]: If you please ! '
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 14]: -- which they did n't like at all , because it woke them .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 34]: Opposite me was an elderly lady in a great fur cloak , who looked in the dark more like a haystack than a lady , she was wrapped up to such a degree .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 42]: This lady had a basket with her , and she had n't known what to do with it , for a long time , until she found that on account of my legs being short , it could go underneath me .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 65]: It cramped and hurt me so , that it made me perfectly miserable ; but if I moved in the least , and made a glass that was in the basket rattle against something else -LRB- as it was sure to do -RRB- , she gave me the cruellest poke with her foot , and said , ` Come , do n't YOU fidget .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 11]: YOUR bones are young enough , I 'm sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 15]: At last the sun rose , and then my companions seemed to sleep easier .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 29]: The difficulties under which they had laboured all night , and which had found utterance in the most terrific gasps and snorts , are not to be conceived .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 20]: As the sun got higher , their sleep became lighter , and so they gradually one by one awoke .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 35]: I recollect being very much surprised by the feint everybody made , then , of not having been to sleep at all , and by the uncommon indignation with which everyone repelled the charge .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 53]: I labour under the same kind of astonishment to this day , having invariably observed that of all human weaknesses , the one to which our common nature is the least disposed to confess -LRB- I can not imagine why -RRB- is the weakness of having gone to sleep in a coach .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 70]: What an amazing place London was to me when I saw it in the distance , and how I believed all the adventures of all my favourite heroes to be constantly enacting and re-enacting there , and how I vaguely made it out in my own mind to be fuller of wonders and wickedness than all the cities of the earth , I need not stop here to relate .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 27]: We approached it by degrees , and got , in due time , to the inn in the Whitechapel district , for which we were bound .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 37]: I forget whether it was the Blue Bull , or the Blue Boar ; but I know it was the Blue Something , and that its likeness was painted up on the back of the coach .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 49]: The guard 's eye lighted on me as he was getting down , and he said at the booking-office door : ` Is there anybody here for a yoongster booked in the name of Murdstone , from Bloonderstone , Sooffolk , to be left till called for ? '
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 3]: Nobody answered .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 18]: ` Try Copperfield , if you please , sir , ' said I , looking helplessly down .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 37]: ` Is there anybody here for a yoongster , booked in the name of Murdstone , from Bloonderstone , Sooffolk , but owning to the name of Copperfield , to be left till called for ? '
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 4]: said the guard .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 5]: IS there anybody ? '
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 4]: There was nobody .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 51]: I looked anxiously around ; but the inquiry made no impression on any of the bystanders , if I except a man in gaiters , with one eye , who suggested that they had better put a brass collar round my neck , and tie me up in the stable .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 30]: A ladder was brought , and I got down after the lady , who was like a haystack : not daring to stir , until her basket was removed .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 47]: The coach was clear of passengers by that time , the luggage was very soon cleared out , the horses had been taken out before the luggage , and now the coach itself was wheeled and backed off by some hostlers , out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 15]: Still , nobody appeared , to claim the dusty youngster from Blunderstone , Suffolk .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 54]: More solitary than Robinson Crusoe , who had nobody to look at him and see that he was solitary , I went into the booking-office , and , by invitation of the clerk on duty , passed behind the counter , and sat down on the scale at which they weighed the luggage .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 43]: Here , as I sat looking at the parcels , packages , and books , and inhaling the smell of stables -LRB- ever since associated with that morning -RRB- , a procession of most tremendous considerations began to march through my mind .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 17]: Supposing nobody should ever fetch me , how long would they consent to keep me there ?
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 11]: Would they keep me long enough to spend seven shillings ?
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 58]: Should I sleep at night in one of those wooden bins , with the other luggage , and wash myself at the pump in the yard in the morning ; or should I be turned out every night , and expected to come again to be left till called for , when the office opened next day ?
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 27]: Supposing there was no mistake in the case , and Mr. Murdstone had devised this plan to get rid of me , what should I do ?
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 27]: If they allowed me to remain there until my seven shillings were spent , I could n't hope to remain there when I began to starve .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 24]: That would obviously be inconvenient and unpleasant to the customers , besides entailing on the Blue Whatever-it-was , the risk of funeral expenses .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 48]: If I started off at once , and tried to walk back home , how could I ever find my way , how could I ever hope to walk so far , how could I make sure of anyone but Peggotty , even if I got back ?
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 40]: If I found out the nearest proper authorities , and offered myself to go for a soldier , or a sailor , I was such a little fellow that it was most likely they would n't take me in .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 24]: These thoughts , and a hundred other such thoughts , turned me burning hot , and made me giddy with apprehension and dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 47]: I was in the height of my fever when a man entered and whispered to the clerk , who presently slanted me off the scale , and pushed me over to him , as if I were weighed , bought , delivered , and paid for .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 23]: As I went out of the office , hand in hand with this new acquaintance , I stole a look at him .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 51]: He was a gaunt , sallow young man , with hollow cheeks , and a chin almost as black as Mr. Murdstone 's ; but there the likeness ended , for his whiskers were shaved off , and his hair , instead of being glossy , was rusty and dry .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 39]: He was dressed in a suit of black clothes which were rather rusty and dry too , and rather short in the sleeves and legs ; and he had a white neck-kerchief on , that was not over-clean .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 31]: I did not , and do not , suppose that this neck-kerchief was all the linen he wore , but it was all he showed or gave any hint of .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 8]: ` You 're the new boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 9]: ` Yes , sir , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 5]: I supposed I was .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 5]: I did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 15]: ` I 'm one of the masters at Salem House , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 11]: I made him a bow and felt very much overawed .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 43]: I was so ashamed to allude to a commonplace thing like my box , to a scholar and a master at Salem House , that we had gone some little distance from the yard before I had the hardihood to mention it .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 34]: We turned back , on my humbly insinuating that it might be useful to me hereafter ; and he told the clerk that the carrier had instructions to call for it at noon .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 28]: ` If you please , sir , ' I said , when we had accomplished about the same distance as before , ` is it far ? '
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 11]: ` It 's down by Blackheath , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 8]: ` Is that far , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 4]: I diffidently asked .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 11]: ` It 's a good step , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 8]: ` We shall go by the stage-coach .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 7]: It 's about six miles . '
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 24]: I was so faint and tired , that the idea of holding out for six miles more , was too much for me .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 36]: I took heart to tell him that I had had nothing all night , and that if he would allow me to buy something to eat , I should be very much obliged to him .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 77]: He appeared surprised at this -- I see him stop and look at me now -- and after considering for a few moments , said he wanted to call on an old person who lived not far off , and that the best way would be for me to buy some bread , or whatever I liked best that was wholesome , and make my breakfast at her house , where we could get some milk .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 56]: Accordingly we looked in at a baker 's window , and after I had made a series of proposals to buy everything that was bilious in the shop , and he had rejected them one by one , we decided in favour of a nice little loaf of brown bread , which cost me threepence .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 50]: Then , at a grocer 's shop , we bought an egg and a slice of streaky bacon ; which still left what I thought a good deal of change , out of the second of the bright shillings , and made me consider London a very cheap place .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 95]: These provisions laid in , we went on through a great noise and uproar that confused my weary head beyond description , and over a bridge which , no doubt , was London Bridge -LRB- indeed I think he told me so , but I was half asleep -RRB- , until we came to the poor person 's house , which was a part of some alms-houses , as I knew by their look , and by an inscription on a stone over the gate which said they were established for twenty-five poor women .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 69]: The Master at Salem House lifted the latch of one of a number of little black doors that were all alike , and had each a little diamond-paned window on one side , and another little diamond - paned window above ; and we went into the little house of one of these poor old women , who was blowing a fire to make a little saucepan boil .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 30]: On seeing the master enter , the old woman stopped with the bellows on her knee , and said something that I thought sounded like ` My Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 24]: but on seeing me come in too , she got up , and rubbing her hands made a confused sort of half curtsey .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 17]: ` Can you cook this young gentleman 's breakfast for him , if you please ? '
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 7]: said the Master at Salem House .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 5]: ` Can I ? '
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 5]: said the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 8]: ` Yes can I , sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 8]: ` How 's Mrs. Fibbitson today ? '
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 40]: said the Master , looking at another old woman in a large chair by the fire , who was such a bundle of clothes that I feel grateful to this hour for not having sat upon her by mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 14]: ` Ah , she 's poorly , ' said the first old woman .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 9]: ` It 's one of her bad days .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 29]: If the fire was to go out , through any accident , I verily believe she 'd go out too , and never come to life again . '
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 12]: As they looked at her , I looked at her also .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 17]: Although it was a warm day , she seemed to think of nothing but the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 71]: I fancied she was jealous even of the saucepan on it ; and I have reason to know that she took its impressment into the service of boiling my egg and broiling my bacon , in dudgeon ; for I saw her , with my own discomfited eyes , shake her fist at me once , when those culinary operations were going on , and no one else was looking .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 54]: The sun streamed in at the little window , but she sat with her own back and the back of the large chair towards it , screening the fire as if she were sedulously keeping IT warm , instead of it keeping her warm , and watching it in a most distrustful manner .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 36]: The completion of the preparations for my breakfast , by relieving the fire , gave her such extreme joy that she laughed aloud -- and a very unmelodious laugh she had , I must say .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 31]: I sat down to my brown loaf , my egg , and my rasher of bacon , with a basin of milk besides , and made a most delicious meal .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 32]: While I was yet in the full enjoyment of it , the old woman of the house said to the Master : ` Have you got your flute with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 15]: ` Have a blow at it , ' said the old woman , coaxingly .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 4]: ` Do ! '
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 36]: The Master , upon this , put his hand underneath the skirts of his coat , and brought out his flute in three pieces , which he screwed together , and began immediately to play .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 24]: My impression is , after many years of consideration , that there never can have been anybody in the world who played worse .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 19]: He made the most dismal sounds I have ever heard produced by any means , natural or artificial .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 77]: I do n't know what the tunes were -- if there were such things in the performance at all , which I doubt -- but the influence of the strain upon me was , first , to make me think of all my sorrows until I could hardly keep my tears back ; then to take away my appetite ; and lastly , to make me so sleepy that I could n't keep my eyes open .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 20]: They begin to close again , and I begin to nod , as the recollection rises fresh upon me .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 79]: Once more the little room , with its open corner cupboard , and its square-backed chairs , and its angular little staircase leading to the room above , and its three peacock 's feathers displayed over the mantelpiece -- I remember wondering when I first went in , what that peacock would have thought if he had known what his finery was doomed to come to -- fades from before me , and I nod , and sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 21]: The flute becomes inaudible , the wheels of the coach are heard instead , and I am on my journey .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 46]: The coach jolts , I wake with a start , and the flute has come back again , and the Master at Salem House is sitting with his legs crossed , playing it dolefully , while the old woman of the house looks on delighted .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 37]: She fades in her turn , and he fades , and all fades , and there is no flute , no Master , no Salem House , no David Copperfield , no anything but heavy sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 62]: I dreamed , I thought , that once while he was blowing into this dismal flute , the old woman of the house , who had gone nearer and nearer to him in her ecstatic admiration , leaned over the back of his chair and gave him an affectionate squeeze round the neck , which stopped his playing for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 67]: I was in the middle state between sleeping and waking , either then or immediately afterwards ; for , as he resumed -- it was a real fact that he had stopped playing - I saw and heard the same old woman ask Mrs. Fibbitson if it was n't delicious -LRB- meaning the flute -RRB- , to which Mrs. Fibbitson replied , ` Ay , ay !
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 3]: yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 22]: and nodded at the fire : to which , I am persuaded , she gave the credit of the whole performance .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 35]: When I seemed to have been dozing a long while , the Master at Salem House unscrewed his flute into the three pieces , put them up as before , and took me away .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 68]: We found the coach very near at hand , and got upon the roof ; but I was so dead sleepy , that when we stopped on the road to take up somebody else , they put me inside where there were no passengers , and where I slept profoundly , until I found the coach going at a footpace up a steep hill among green leaves .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 12]: Presently , it stopped , and had come to its destination .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 31]: A short walk brought us -- I mean the Master and me -- to Salem House , which was enclosed with a high brick wall , and looked very dull .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 71]: Over a door in this wall was a board with SALEM HousE upon it ; and through a grating in this door we were surveyed when we rang the bell by a surly face , which I found , on the door being opened , belonged to a stout man with a bull-neck , a wooden leg , overhanging temples , and his hair cut close all round his head .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 10]: ` The new boy , ' said the Master .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 38]: The man with the wooden leg eyed me all over -- it did n't take long , for there was not much of me -- and locked the gate behind us , and took out the key .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 21]: We were going up to the house , among some dark heavy trees , when he called after my conductor .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 4]: ` Hallo ! '
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 29]: We looked back , and he was standing at the door of a little lodge , where he lived , with a pair of boots in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 3]: ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 30]: The cobbler 's been , ' he said , ` since you 've been out , Mr. Mell , and he says he ca n't mend 'em any more .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 21]: He says there ai n't a bit of the original boot left , and he wonders you expect it . '
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 41]: With these words he threw the boots towards Mr. Mell , who went back a few paces to pick them up , and looked at them -LRB- very disconsolately , I was afraid -RRB- , as we went on together .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 40]: I observed then , for the first time , that the boots he had on were a good deal the worse for wear , and that his stocking was just breaking out in one place , like a bud .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 17]: Salem House was a square brick building with wings ; of a bare and unfurnished appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 34]: All about it was so very quiet , that I said to Mr. Mell I supposed the boys were out ; but he seemed surprised at my not knowing that it was holiday-time .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 10]: That all the boys were at their several homes .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 44]: That Mr. Creakle , the proprietor , was down by the sea-side with Mrs. and Miss Creakle ; and that I was sent in holiday-time as a punishment for my misdoing , all of which he explained to me as we went along .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 23]: I gazed upon the schoolroom into which he took me , as the most forlorn and desolate place I had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 5]: I see it now .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 26]: A long room with three long rows of desks , and six of forms , and bristling all round with pegs for hats and slates .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 11]: Scraps of old copy-books and exercises litter the dirty floor .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 17]: Some silkworms ' houses , made of the same materials , are scattered over the desks .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 41]: Two miserable little white mice , left behind by their owner , are running up and down in a fusty castle made of pasteboard and wire , looking in all the corners with their red eyes for anything to eat .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 40]: A bird , in a cage very little bigger than himself , makes a mournful rattle now and then in hopping on his perch , two inches high , or dropping from it ; but neither sings nor chirps .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 23]: There is a strange unwholesome smell upon the room , like mildewed corduroys , sweet apples wanting air , and rotten books .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 42]: There could not well be more ink splashed about it , if it had been roofless from its first construction , and the skies had rained , snowed , hailed , and blown ink through the varying seasons of the year .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 32]: Mr. Mell having left me while he took his irreparable boots upstairs , I went softly to the upper end of the room , observing all this as I crept along .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 29]: Suddenly I came upon a pasteboard placard , beautifully written , which was lying on the desk , and bore these words : ` TAKE CARE OF HIM .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 4]: HE BITES . '
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 16]: I got upon the desk immediately , apprehensive of at least a great dog underneath .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 18]: But , though I looked all round with anxious eyes , I could see nothing of him .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 24]: I was still engaged in peering about , when Mr. Mell came back , and asked me what I did up there ? '
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 24]: I beg your pardon , sir , ' says I , ` if you please , I 'm looking for the dog . '
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 4]: ` Dog ? '
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 3]: he says .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 5]: ` What dog ? '
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 10]: ` Is n't it a dog , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 8]: ` Is n't what a dog ? '
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 15]: ` That 's to be taken care of , sir ; that bites . '
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 18]: ` No , Copperfield , ' says he , gravely , ` that 's not a dog .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 5]: That 's a boy .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 14]: My instructions are , Copperfield , to put this placard on your back .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 18]: I am sorry to make such a beginning with you , but I must do it . '
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 42]: With that he took me down , and tied the placard , which was neatly constructed for the purpose , on my shoulders like a knapsack ; and wherever I went , afterwards , I had the consolation of carrying it .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 11]: What I suffered from that placard , nobody can imagine .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 21]: Whether it was possible for people to see me or not , I always fancied that somebody was reading it .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 25]: It was no relief to turn round and find nobody ; for wherever my back was , there I imagined somebody always to be .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 11]: That cruel man with the wooden leg aggravated my sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 42]: He was in authority ; and if he ever saw me leaning against a tree , or a wall , or the house , he roared out from his lodge door in a stupendous voice , ` Hallo , you sir !
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 3]: You Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 12]: Show that badge conspicuous , or I 'll report you ! '
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 105]: The playground was a bare gravelled yard , open to all the back of the house and the offices ; and I knew that the servants read it , and the butcher read it , and the baker read it ; that everybody , in a word , who came backwards and forwards to the house , of a morning when I was ordered to walk there , read that I was to be taken care of , for I bit , I recollect that I positively began to have a dread of myself , as a kind of wild boy who did bite .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 21]: There was an old door in this playground , on which the boys had a custom of carving their names .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 8]: It was completely covered with such inscriptions .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 42]: In my dread of the end of the vacation and their coming back , I could not read a boy 's name , without inquiring in what tone and with what emphasis HE would read , ` Take care of him .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 4]: He bites . '
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 40]: There was one boy -- a certain J. Steerforth -- who cut his name very deep and very often , who , I conceived , would read it in a rather strong voice , and afterwards pull my hair .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 27]: There was another boy , one Tommy Traddles , who I dreaded would make game of it , and pretend to be dreadfully frightened of me .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 15]: There was a third , George Demple , who I fancied would sing it .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 62]: I have looked , a little shrinking creature , at that door , until the owners of all the names -- there were five-and-forty of them in the school then , Mr. Mell said -- seemed to send me to Coventry by general acclamation , and to cry out , each in his own way , ` Take care of him .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 4]: He bites ! '
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 13]: It was the same with the places at the desks and forms .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 29]: It was the same with the groves of deserted bedsteads I peeped at , on my way to , and when I was in , my own bed .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 76]: I remember dreaming night after night , of being with my mother as she used to be , or of going to a party at Mr. Peggotty 's , or of travelling outside the stage-coach , or of dining again with my unfortunate friend the waiter , and in all these circumstances making people scream and stare , by the unhappy disclosure that I had nothing on but my little night-shirt , and that placard .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 26]: In the monotony of my life , and in my constant apprehension of the re-opening of the school , it was such an insupportable affliction !
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 33]: I had long tasks every day to do with Mr. Mell ; but I did them , there being no Mr. and Miss Murdstone here , and got through them without disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 25]: Before , and after them , I walked about -- supervised , as I have mentioned , by the man with the wooden leg .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 58]: How vividly I call to mind the damp about the house , the green cracked flagstones in the court , an old leaky water-butt , and the discoloured trunks of some of the grim trees , which seemed to have dripped more in the rain than other trees , and to have blown less in the sun !
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 30]: At one we dined , Mr. Mell and I , at the upper end of a long bare dining-room , full of deal tables , and smelling of fat .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 27]: Then , we had more tasks until tea , which Mr. Mell drank out of a blue teacup , and I out of a tin pot .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 54]: All day long , and until seven or eight in the evening , Mr. Mell , at his own detached desk in the schoolroom , worked hard with pen , ink , ruler , books , and writing - paper , making out the bills -LRB- as I found -RRB- for last half-year .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 47]: When he had put up his things for the night he took out his flute , and blew at it , until I almost thought he would gradually blow his whole being into the large hole at the top , and ooze away at the keys .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 33]: I picture my small self in the dimly-lighted rooms , sitting with my head upon my hand , listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell , and conning tomorrow 's lessons .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 49]: I picture myself with my books shut up , still listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell , and listening through it to what used to be at home , and to the blowing of the wind on Yarmouth flats , and feeling very sad and solitary .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 26]: I picture myself going up to bed , among the unused rooms , and sitting on my bed-side crying for a comfortable word from Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 86]: I picture myself coming downstairs in the morning , and looking through a long ghastly gash of a staircase window at the school-bell hanging on the top of an out-house with a weathercock above it ; and dreading the time when it shall ring J. Steerforth and the rest to work : which is only second , in my foreboding apprehensions , to the time when the man with the wooden leg shall unlock the rusty gate to give admission to the awful Mr. Creakle .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 30]: I can not think I was a very dangerous character in any of these aspects , but in all of them I carried the same warning on my back .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 16]: Mr. Mell never said much to me , but he was never harsh to me .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 12]: I suppose we were company to each other , without talking .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 34]: I forgot to mention that he would talk to himself sometimes , and grin , and clench his fist , and grind his teeth , and pull his hair in an unaccountable manner .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 21]: But he had these peculiarities : and at first they frightened me , though I soon got used to them .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 53]: Chapter 6 I Enlarge My Circle of Acquaintance I HAD led this life about a month , when the man with the wooden leg began to stump about with a mop and a bucket of water , from which I inferred that preparations were making to receive Mr. Creakle and the boys .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 87]: I was not mistaken ; for the mop came into the schoolroom before long , and turned out Mr. Mell and me , who lived where we could , and got on how we could , for some days , during which we were always in the way of two or three young women , who had rarely shown themselves before , and were so continually in the midst of dust that I sneezed almost as much as if Salem House had been a great snuff-box .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 17]: One day I was informed by Mr. Mell that Mr. Creakle would be home that evening .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 14]: In the evening , after tea , I heard that he was come .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 18]: Before bedtime , I was fetched by the man with the wooden leg to appear before him .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 61]: Mr. Creakle 's part of the house was a good deal more comfortable than ours , and he had a snug bit of garden that looked pleasant after the dusty playground , which was such a desert in miniature , that I thought no one but a camel , or a dromedary , could have felt at home in it .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 93]: It seemed to me a bold thing even to take notice that the passage looked comfortable , as I went on my way , trembling , to Mr. Creakle 's presence : which so abashed me , when I was ushered into it , that I hardly saw Mrs. Creakle or Miss Creakle -LRB- who were both there , in the parlour -RRB- , or anything but Mr. Creakle , a stout gentleman with a bunch of watch-chain and seals , in an arm-chair , with a tumbler and bottle beside him .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 4]: ` So ! '
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 4]: said Mr. Creakle .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 13]: ` This is the young gentleman whose teeth are to be filed !
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 5]: Turn him round . '
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 45]: The wooden-legged man turned me about so as to exhibit the placard ; and having afforded time for a full survey of it , turned me about again , with my face to Mr. Creakle , and posted himself at Mr. Creakle 's side .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 36]: Mr. Creakle 's face was fiery , and his eyes were small , and deep in his head ; he had thick veins in his forehead , a little nose , and a large chin .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 37]: He was bald on the top of his head ; and had some thin wet-looking hair that was just turning grey , brushed across each temple , so that the two sides interlaced on his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 24]: But the circumstance about him which impressed me most , was , that he had no voice , but spoke in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 57]: The exertion this cost him , or the consciousness of talking in that feeble way , made his angry face so much more angry , and his thick veins so much thicker , when he spoke , that I am not surprised , on looking back , at this peculiarity striking me as his chief one .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 8]: ` Now , ' said Mr. Creakle .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 10]: ` What 's the report of this boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 17]: ` There 's nothing against him yet , ' returned the man with the wooden leg .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 8]: ` There has been no opportunity . '
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 7]: I thought Mr. Creakle was disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 31]: I thought Mrs. and Miss Creakle -LRB- at whom I now glanced for the first time , and who were , both , thin and quiet -RRB- were not disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 7]: ` Come here , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 8]: said Mr. Creakle , beckoning to me .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 5]: ` Come here ! '
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 13]: said the man with the wooden leg , repeating the gesture . '
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 36]: I have the happiness of knowing your father-in-law , ' whispered Mr. Creakle , taking me by the ear ; ` and a worthy man he is , and a man of a strong character .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 9]: He knows me , and I know him .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 5]: Do YOU know me ?
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 3]: Hey ? '
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 11]: said Mr. Creakle , pinching my ear with ferocious playfulness .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 15]: ` Not yet , sir , ' I said , flinching with the pain .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 4]: ` Not yet ?
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 3]: Hey ? '
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 4]: repeated Mr. Creakle .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 6]: ` But you will soon .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 3]: Hey ? '
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 5]: ` You will soon .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 3]: Hey ? '
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 8]: repeated the man with the wooden leg .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 22]: I afterwards found that he generally acted , with his strong voice , as Mr. Creakle 's interpreter to the boys .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 17]: I was very much frightened , and said , I hoped so , if he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 20]: I felt , all this while , as if my ear were blazing ; he pinched it so hard .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 33]: ` I 'll tell you what I am , ' whispered Mr. Creakle , letting it go at last , with a screw at parting that brought the water into my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 8]: ` I 'm a Tartar . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 12]: A Tartar , ' said the man with the wooden leg .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 39]: ` When I say I 'll do a thing , I do it , ' said Mr. Creakle ; ` and when I say I will have a thing done , I will have it done . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 23]: - Will have a thing done , I will have it done , ' repeated the man with the wooden leg . '
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 11]: I am a determined character , ' said Mr. Creakle .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 7]: ` That 's what I am .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 5]: I do my duty .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 6]: That 's what I do .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 30]: My flesh and blood ' -- he looked at Mrs. Creakle as he said this -- ` when it rises against me , is not my flesh and blood .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 4]: I discard it .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 19]: Has that fellow ' -- to the man with the wooden leg -- ` been here again ? '
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 8]: ` No , ' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 8]: ` No , ' said Mr. Creakle .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 5]: ` He knows better .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 4]: He knows me .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 5]: Let him keep away .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 31]: I say let him keep away , ' said Mr. Creakle , striking his hand upon the table , and looking at Mrs. Creakle , ` for he knows me .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 18]: Now you have begun to know me too , my young friend , and you may go .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 5]: Take him away . '
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 33]: I was very glad to be ordered away , for Mrs. and Miss Creakle were both wiping their eyes , and I felt as uncomfortable for them as I did for myself .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 44]: But I had a petition on my mind which concerned me so nearly , that I could n't help saying , though I wondered at my own courage : ` If you please , sir -- ' Mr. Creakle whispered , ` Hah !
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 5]: What 's this ? '
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 18]: and bent his eyes upon me , as if he would have burnt me up with them .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 134]: ` If you please , sir , ' I faltered , ` if I might be allowed -LRB- I am very sorry indeed , sir , for what I did -RRB- to take this writing off , before the boys come back -- ' Whether Mr. Creakle was in earnest , or whether he only did it to frighten me , I do n't know , but he made a burst out of his chair , before which I precipitately retreated , without waiting for the escort Of the man with the wooden leg , and never once stopped until I reached my own bedroom , where , finding I was not pursued , I went to bed , as it was time , and lay quaking , for a couple of hours .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 7]: Next morning Mr. Sharp came back .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 13]: Mr. Sharp was the first master , and superior to Mr. Mell .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 21]: Mr. Mell took his meals with the boys , but Mr. Sharp dined and supped at Mr. Creakle 's table .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 40]: He was a limp , delicate-looking gentleman , I thought , with a good deal of nose , and a way of carrying his head on one side , as if it were a little too heavy for him .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 47]: His hair was very smooth and wavy ; but I was informed by the very first boy who came back that it was a wig -LRB- a second-hand one HE said -RRB- , and that Mr. Sharp went out every Saturday afternoon to get it curled .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 15]: It was no other than Tommy Traddles who gave me this piece of intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 8]: He was the first boy who returned .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 35]: He introduced himself by informing me that I should find his name on the right - hand corner of the gate , over the top-bolt ; upon that I said , ` Traddles ? '
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 24]: to which he replied , ` The same , ' and then he asked me for a full account of myself and family .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 13]: It was a happy circumstance for me that Traddles came back first .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 50]: He enjoyed my placard so much , that he saved me from the embarrassment of either disclosure or concealment , by presenting me to every other boy who came back , great or small , immediately on his arrival , in this form of introduction , ` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 6]: Here 's a game ! '
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 27]: Happily , too , the greater part of the boys came back low-spirited , and were not so boisterous at my expense as I had expected .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 50]: Some of them certainly did dance about me like wild Indians , and the greater part could not resist the temptation of pretending that I was a dog , and patting and soothing me , lest I should bite , and saying , ` Lie down , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 5]: and calling me Towzer .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 29]: This was naturally confusing , among so many strangers , and cost me some tears , but on the whole it was much better than I had anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 19]: I was not considered as being formally received into the school , however , until J. Steerforth arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 34]: Before this boy , who was reputed to be a great scholar , and was very good-looking , and at least half-a-dozen years my senior , I was carried as before a magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 43]: He inquired , under a shed in the playground , into the particulars of my punishment , and was pleased to express his opinion that it was ' a jolly shame ' ; for which I became bound to him ever afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 10]: ` What money have you got , Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 18]: he said , walking aside with me when he had disposed of my affair in these terms .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 6]: I told him seven shillings .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 17]: ` You had better give it to me to take care of , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 10]: ` At least , you can if you like .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 10]: You need n't if you do n't like . '
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 23]: I hastened to comply with his friendly suggestion , and opening Peggotty 's purse , turned it upside down into his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 10]: ` Do you want to spend anything now ? '
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 4]: he asked me .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 9]: ` No thank you , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 15]: ` You can , if you like , you know , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 6]: ` Say the word . '
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 12]: ` No , thank you , sir , ' I repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 30]: ` Perhaps you 'd like to spend a couple of shillings or so , in a bottle of currant wine by and by , up in the bedroom ? '
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 11]: ` You belong to my bedroom , I find . '
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 20]: It certainly had not occurred to me before , but I said , Yes , I should like that .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 8]: ` Very good , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 21]: ` You 'll be glad to spend another shilling or so , in almond cakes , I dare say ? '
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 12]: I said , Yes , I should like that , too .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 17]: ` And another shilling or so in biscuits , and another in fruit , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 4]: said Steerforth . '
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 12]: I say , young Copperfield , you 're going it ! '
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 18]: I smiled because he smiled , but I was a little troubled in my mind , too .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 16]: ` We must make it stretch as far as we can ; that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 11]: I 'll do the best in my power for you .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 17]: I can go out when I like , and I 'll smuggle the prog in . '
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 31]: With these words he put the money in his pocket , and kindly told me not to make myself uneasy ; he would take care it should be all right .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 57]: He was as good as his word , if that were all right which I had a secret misgiving was nearly all wrong -- for I feared it was a waste of my mother 's two half-crowns -- though I had preserved the piece of paper they were wrapped in : which was a precious saving .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 46]: When we went upstairs to bed , he produced the whole seven shillings ` worth , and laid it out on my bed in the moonlight , saying : ` There you are , young Copperfield , and a royal spread you 've got . '
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 33]: I could n't think of doing the honours of the feast , at my time of life , while he was by ; my hand shook at the very thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 69]: I begged him to do me the favour of presiding ; and my request being seconded by the other boys who were in that room , he acceded to it , and sat upon my pillow , handing round the viands -- with perfect fairness , I must say -- and dispensing the currant wine in a little glass without a foot , which was his own property .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 28]: As to me , I sat on his left hand , and the rest were grouped about us , on the nearest beds and on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 91]: How well I recollect our sitting there , talking in whispers ; or their talking , and my respectfully listening , I ought rather to say ; the moonlight falling a little way into the room , through the window , painting a pale window on the floor , and the greater part of us in shadow , except when Steerforth dipped a match into a phosphorus-box , when he wanted to look for anything on the board , and shed a blue glare over us that was gone directly !
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 79]: A certain mysterious feeling , consequent on the darkness , the secrecy of the revel , and the whisper in which everything was said , steals over me again , and I listen to all they tell me with a vague feeling of solemnity and awe , which makes me glad that they are all so near , and frightens me -LRB- though I feign to laugh -RRB- when Traddles pretends to see a ghost in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 15]: I heard all kinds of things about the school and all belonging to it .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 59]: I heard that Mr. Creakle had not preferred his claim to being a Tartar without reason ; that he was the sternest and most severe of masters ; that he laid about him , right and left , every day of his life , charging in among the boys like a trooper , and slashing away , unmercifully .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 68]: That he knew nothing himself , but the art of slashing , being more ignorant -LRB- J. Steerforth said -RRB- than the lowest boy in the school ; that he had been , a good many years ago , a small hop-dealer in the Borough , and had taken to the schooling business after being bankrupt in hops , and making away with Mrs. Creakle 's money .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 16]: With a good deal more of that sort , which I wondered how they knew .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 77]: I heard that the man with the wooden leg , whose name was Tungay , was an obstinate barbarian who had formerly assisted in the hop business , but had come into the scholastic line with Mr. Creakle , in consequence , as was supposed among the boys , of his having broken his leg in Mr. Creakle 's service , and having done a deal of dishonest work for him , and knowing his secrets .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 41]: I heard that with the single exception of Mr. Creakle , Tungay considered the whole establishment , masters and boys , as his natural enemies , and that the only delight of his life was to be sour and malicious .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 62]: I heard that Mr. Creakle had a son , who had not been Tungay 's friend , and who , assisting in the school , had once held some remonstrance with his father on an occasion when its discipline was very cruelly exercised , and was supposed , besides , to have protested against his father 's usage of his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 31]: I heard that Mr. Creakle had turned him out of doors , in consequence ; and that Mrs. and Miss Creakle had been in a sad way , ever since .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 36]: But the greatest wonder that I heard of Mr. Creakle was , there being one boy in the school on whom he never ventured to lay a hand , and that boy being J. Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 23]: Steerforth himself confirmed this when it was stated , and said that he should like to begin to see him do it .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 68]: On being asked by a mild boy -LRB- not me -RRB- how he would proceed if he did begin to see him do it , he dipped a match into his phosphorus-box on purpose to shed a glare over his reply , and said he would commence by knocking him down with a blow on the forehead from the seven-and-sixpenny ink-bottle that was always on the mantelpiece .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 11]: We sat in the dark for some time , breathless .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 56]: I heard that Mr. Sharp and Mr. Mell were both supposed to be wretchedly paid ; and that when there was hot and cold meat for dinner at Mr. Creakle 's table , Mr. Sharp was always expected to say he preferred cold ; which was again corroborated by J. Steerforth , the only parlour-boarder .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 46]: I heard that Mr. Sharp 's wig did n't fit him ; and that he need n't be so ` bounceable ' -- somebody else said ` bumptious ' -- about it , because his own red hair was very plainly to be seen behind .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 47]: I heard that one boy , who was a coal-merchant 's son , came as a set-off against the coal-bill , and was called , on that account , ` Exchange or Barter ' -- a name selected from the arithmetic book as expressing this arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 18]: I heard that the table beer was a robbery of parents , and the pudding an imposition .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 58]: I heard that Miss Creakle was regarded by the school in general as being in love with Steerforth ; and I am sure , as I sat in the dark , thinking of his nice voice , and his fine face , and his easy manner , and his curling hair , I thought it very likely .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 43]: I heard that Mr. Mell was not a bad sort of fellow , but had n't a sixpence to bless himself with ; and that there was no doubt that old Mrs. Mell , his mother , was as poor as job .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 17]: I thought of my breakfast then , and what had sounded like ` My Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 18]: but I was , I am glad to remember , as mute as a mouse about it .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 18]: The hearing of all this , and a good deal more , outlasted the banquet some time .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 40]: The greater part of the guests had gone to bed as soon as the eating and drinking were over ; and we , who had remained whispering and listening half-undressed , at last betook ourselves to bed , too .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 11]: ` Good night , young Copperfield , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 9]: ` I 'll take care of you . '
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 12]: ` You 're very kind , ' I gratefully returned . '
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 9]: I am very much obliged to you . '
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 12]: ` You have n't got a sister , have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 5]: said Steerforth , yawning .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 7]: ` No , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 10]: ` That 's a pity , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 26]: ` If you had had one , I should think she would have been a pretty , timid , little , bright-eyed sort of girl .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 8]: I should have liked to know her .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 7]: Good night , young Copperfield . '
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 10]: ` Good night , sir , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 46]: I thought of him very much after I went to bed , and raised myself , I recollect , to look at him where he lay in the moonlight , with his handsome face turned up , and his head reclining easily on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 26]: He was a person of great power in my eyes ; that was , of course , the reason of my mind running on him .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 11]: No veiled future dimly glanced upon him in the moonbeams .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 21]: There was no shadowy picture of his footsteps , in the garden that I dreamed of walking in all night .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 17]: Chapter 7 My ` First Half ' at Salem House School began in earnest next day .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 50]: A profound impression was made upon me , I remember , by the roar of voices in the schoolroom suddenly becoming hushed as death when Mr. Creakle entered after breakfast , and stood in the doorway looking round upon us like a giant in a story-book surveying his captives .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 8]: Tungay stood at Mr. Creakle 's elbow .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 15]: He had no occasion , I thought , to cry out ` Silence ! '
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 13]: so ferociously , for the boys were all struck speechless and motionless .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 16]: Mr. Creakle was seen to speak , and Tungay was heard , to this effect .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 11]: ` Now , boys , this is a new half .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 12]: Take care what you 're about , in this new half .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 20]: Come fresh up to the lessons , I advise you , for I come fresh up to the punishment .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 5]: I wo n't flinch .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 23]: It will be of no use your rubbing yourselves ; you wo n't rub the marks out that I shall give you .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 9]: Now get to work , every boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 41]: When this dreadful exordium was over , and Tungay had stumped out again , Mr. Creakle came to where I sat , and told me that if I were famous for biting , he was famous for biting , too .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 20]: He then showed me the cane , and asked me what I thought of THAT , for a tooth ?
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 8]: Was it a sharp tooth , hey ?
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 8]: Was it a double tooth , hey ?
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 8]: Had it a deep prong , hey ?
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 6]: Did it bite , hey ?
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 4]: Did it bite ?
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 40]: At every question he gave me a fleshy cut with it that made me writhe ; so I was very soon made free of Salem House -LRB- as Steerforth said -RRB- , and was very soon in tears also .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 18]: Not that I mean to say these were special marks of distinction , which only I received .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 34]: On the contrary , a large majority of the boys -LRB- especially the smaller ones -RRB- were visited with similar instances of notice , as Mr. Creakle made the round of the schoolroom .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 46]: Half the establishment was writhing and crying , before the day 's work began ; and how much of it had writhed and cried before the day 's work was over , I am really afraid to recollect , lest I should seem to exaggerate .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 20]: I should think there never can have been a man who enjoyed his profession more than Mr. Creakle did .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 20]: He had a delight in cutting at the boys , which was like the satisfaction of a craving appetite .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 43]: I am confident that he could n't resist a chubby boy , especially ; that there was a fascination in such a subject , which made him restless in his mind , until he had scored and marked him for the day .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 10]: I was chubby myself , and ought to know .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 97]: I am sure when I think of the fellow now , my blood rises against him with the disinterested indignation I should feel if I could have known all about him without having ever been in his power ; but it rises hotly , because I know him to have been an incapable brute , who had no more right to be possessed of the great trust he held , than to be Lord High Admiral , or Commander-in-Chief -- in either of which capacities it is probable that he would have done infinitely less mischief .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 15]: Miserable little propitiators of a remorseless Idol , how abject we were to him !
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 29]: What a launch in life I think it now , on looking back , to be so mean and servile to a man of such parts and pretensions !
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 49]: Here I sit at the desk again , watching his eye -- humbly watching his eye , as he rules a ciphering-book for another victim whose hands have just been flattened by that identical ruler , and who is trying to wipe the sting out with a pocket-handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 6]: I have plenty to do .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 45]: I do n't watch his eye in idleness , but because I am morbidly attracted to it , in a dread desire to know what he will do next , and whether it will be my turn to suffer , or somebody else 's .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 20]: A lane of small boys beyond me , with the same interest in his eye , watch it too .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 13]: I think he knows it , though he pretends he do n't .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 31]: He makes dreadful mouths as he rules the ciphering-book ; and now he throws his eye sideways down our lane , and we all droop over our books and tremble .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 9]: A moment afterwards we are again eyeing him .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 15]: An unhappy culprit , found guilty of imperfect exercise , approaches at his command .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 14]: The culprit falters excuses , and professes a determination to do better tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 40]: Mr. Creakle cuts a joke before he beats him , and we laugh at it , -- miserable little dogs , we laugh , with our visages as white as ashes , and our hearts sinking into our boots .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 14]: Here I sit at the desk again , on a drowsy summer afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 18]: A buzz and hum go up around me , as if the boys were so many bluebottles .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 33]: A cloggy sensation of the lukewarm fat of meat is upon me -LRB- we dined an hour or two ago -RRB- , and my head is as heavy as so much lead .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 10]: I would give the world to go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 59]: I sit with my eye on Mr. Creakle , blinking at him like a young owl ; when sleep overpowers me for a minute , he still looms through my slumber , ruling those ciphering-books , until he softly comes behind me and wakes me to plainer perception of him , with a red ridge across my back .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 22]: Here I am in the playground , with my eye still fascinated by him , though I ca n't see him .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 26]: The window at a little distance from which I know he is having his dinner , stands for him , and I eye that instead .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 16]: If he shows his face near it , mine assumes an imploring and submissive expression .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 29]: If he looks out through the glass , the boldest boy -LRB- Steerforth excepted -RRB- stops in the middle of a shout or yell , and becomes contemplative .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 22]: One day , Traddles -LRB- the most unfortunate boy in the world -RRB- breaks that window accidentally , with a ball .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 29]: I shudder at this moment with the tremendous sensation of seeing it done , and feeling that the ball has bounded on to Mr. Creakle 's sacred head .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 3]: Poor Traddles !
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 31]: In a tight sky-blue suit that made his arms and legs like German sausages , or roly-poly puddings , he was the merriest and most miserable of all the boys .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 46]: He was always being caned -- I think he was caned every day that half-year , except one holiday Monday when he was only ruler 'd on both hands -- and was always going to write to his uncle about it , and never did .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 38]: After laying his head on the desk for a little while , he would cheer up , somehow , begin to laugh again , and draw skeletons all over his slate , before his eyes were dry .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 43]: I used at first to wonder what comfort Traddles found in drawing skeletons ; and for some time looked upon him as a sort of hermit , who reminded himself by those symbols of mortality that caning could n't last for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 19]: But I believe he only did it because they were easy , and did n't want any features .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 24]: He was very honourable , Traddles was , and held it as a solemn duty in the boys to stand by one another .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 31]: He suffered for this on several occasions ; and particularly once , when Steerforth laughed in church , and the Beadle thought it was Traddles , and took him out .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 15]: I see him now , going away in custody , despised by the congregation .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 40]: He never said who was the real offender , though he smarted for it next day , and was imprisoned so many hours that he came forth with a whole churchyard-full of skeletons swarming all over his Latin Dictionary .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 6]: But he had his reward .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 22]: Steerforth said there was nothing of the sneak in Traddles , and we all felt that to be the highest praise .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 35]: For my part , I could have gone through a good deal -LRB- though I was much less brave than Traddles , and nothing like so old -RRB- to have won such a recompense .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 24]: To see Steerforth walk to church before us , arm-in-arm with Miss Creakle , was one of the great sights of my life .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 51]: I did n't think Miss Creakle equal to little Em ` ly in point of beauty , and I did n't love her -LRB- I did n't dare -RRB- ; but I thought her a young lady of extraordinary attractions , and in point of gentility not to be surpassed .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 35]: When Steerforth , in white trousers , carried her parasol for her , I felt proud to know him ; and believed that she could not choose but adore him with all her heart .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 26]: Mr. Sharp and Mr. Mell were both notable personages in my eyes ; but Steerforth was to them what the sun was to two stars .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 27]: Steerforth continued his protection of me , and proved a very useful friend ; since nobody dared to annoy one whom he honoured with his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 75]: He could n't -- or at all events he did n't -- defend me from Mr. Creakle , who was very severe with me ; but whenever I had been treated worse than usual , he always told me that I wanted a little of his pluck , and that he would n't have stood it himself ; which I felt he intended for encouragement , and considered to be very kind of him .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 19]: There was one advantage , and only one that I know of , in Mr. Creakle 's severity .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 48]: He found my placard in his way when he came up or down behind the form on which I sat , and wanted to make a cut at me in passing ; for this reason it was soon taken off , and I saw it no more .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 30]: An accidental circumstance cemented the intimacy between Steerforth and me , in a manner that inspired me with great pride and satisfaction , though it sometimes led to inconvenience .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 45]: It happened on one occasion , when he was doing me the honour of talking to me in the playground , that I hazarded the observation that something or somebody -- I forget what now -- was like something or somebody in Peregrine Pickle .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 26]: He said nothing at the time ; but when I was going to bed at night , asked me if I had got that book ?
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 28]: I told him no , and explained how it was that I had read it , and all those other books of which I have made mention .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 8]: ` And do you recollect them ? '
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 3]: Steerforth said .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 23]: ` Oh yes , ' I replied ; I had a good memory , and I believed I recollected them very well .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 22]: ` Then I tell you what , young Copperfield , ' said Steerforth , ` you shall tell 'em to me .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 21]: I ca n't get to sleep very early at night , and I generally wake rather early in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 9]: We 'll go over 'em one after another .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 11]: We 'll make some regular Arabian Nights of it . '
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 19]: I felt extremely flattered by this arrangement , and we commenced carrying it into execution that very evening .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 74]: What ravages I committed on my favourite authors in the course of my interpretation of them , I am not in a condition to say , and should be very unwilling to know ; but I had a profound faith in them , and I had , to the best of my belief , a simple , earnest manner of narrating what I did narrate ; and these qualities went a long way .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 52]: The drawback was , that I was often sleepy at night , or out of spirits and indisposed to resume the story ; and then it was rather hard work , and it must be done ; for to disappoint or to displease Steerforth was of course out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 88]: In the morning , too , when I felt weary , and should have enjoyed another hour 's repose very much , it was a tiresome thing to be roused , like the Sultana Scheherazade , and forced into a long story before the getting-up bell rang ; but Steerforth was resolute ; and as he explained to me , in return , my sums and exercises , and anything in my tasks that was too hard for me , I was no loser by the transaction .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 8]: Let me do myself justice , however .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 19]: I was moved by no interested or selfish motive , nor was I moved by fear of him .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 13]: I admired and loved him , and his approval was return enough .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 21]: It was so precious to me that I look back on these trifles , now , with an aching heart .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 36]: Steerforth was considerate , too ; and showed his consideration , in one particular instance , in an unflinching manner that was a little tantalizing , I suspect , to poor Traddles and the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 12]: Peggotty 's promised letter -- what a comfortable letter it was !
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 31]: -- arrived before ` the half ' was many weeks old ; and with it a cake in a perfect nest of oranges , and two bottles of cowslip wine .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 22]: This treasure , as in duty bound , I laid at the feet of Steerforth , and begged him to dispense .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 32]: ` Now , I 'll tell you what , young Copperfield , ' said he : ` the wine shall be kept to wet your whistle when you are story-telling . '
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 20]: I blushed at the idea , and begged him , in my modesty , not to think of it .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 35]: But he said he had observed I was sometimes hoarse -- a little roopy was his exact expression -- and it should be , every drop , devoted to the purpose he had mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 44]: Accordingly , it was locked up in his box , and drawn off by himself in a phial , and administered to me through a piece of quill in the cork , when I was supposed to be in want of a restorative .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 93]: Sometimes , to make it a more sovereign specific , he was so kind as to squeeze orange juice into it , or to stir it up with ginger , or dissolve a peppermint drop in it ; and although I can not assert that the flavour was improved by these experiments , or that it was exactly the compound one would have chosen for a stomachic , the last thing at night and the first thing in the morning , I drank it gratefully and was very sensible of his attention .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 21]: We seem , to me , to have been months over Peregrine , and months more over the other stories .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 26]: The institution never flagged for want of a story , I am certain ; and the wine lasted out almost as well as the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 64]: Poor Traddles -- I never think of that boy but with a strange disposition to laugh , and with tears in my eyes -- was a sort of chorus , in general ; and affected to be convulsed with mirth at the comic parts , and to be overcome with fear when there was any passage of an alarming character in the narrative .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 9]: This rather put me out , very often .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 90]: It was a great jest of his , I recollect , to pretend that he could n't keep his teeth from chattering , whenever mention was made of an Alguazill in connexion with the adventures of Gil Blas ; and I remember that when Gil Blas met the captain of the robbers in Madrid , this unlucky joker counterfeited such an ague of terror , that he was overheard by Mr. Creakle , who was prowling about the passage , and handsomely flogged for disorderly conduct in the bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 36]: Whatever I had within me that was romantic and dreamy , was encouraged by so much story-telling in the dark ; and in that respect the pursuit may not have been very profitable to me .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 49]: But the being cherished as a kind of plaything in my room , and the consciousness that this accomplishment of mine was bruited about among the boys , and attracted a good deal of notice to me though I was the youngest there , stimulated me to exertion .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 29]: In a school carried on by sheer cruelty , whether it is presided over by a dunce or not , there is not likely to be much learnt .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 58]: I believe our boys were , generally , as ignorant a set as any schoolboys in existence ; they were too much troubled and knocked about to learn ; they could no more do that to advantage , than any one can do anything to advantage in a life of constant misfortune , torment , and worry .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 60]: But my little vanity , and Steerforth 's help , urged me on somehow ; and without saving me from much , if anything , in the way of punishment , made me , for the time I was there , an exception to the general body , insomuch that I did steadily pick up some crumbs of knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 23]: In this I was much assisted by Mr. Mell , who had a liking for me that I am grateful to remember .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 32]: It always gave me pain to observe that Steerforth treated him with systematic disparagement , and seldom lost an occasion of wounding his feelings , or inducing others to do so .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 71]: This troubled me the more for a long time , because I had soon told Steerforth , from whom I could no more keep such a secret , than I could keep a cake or any other tangible possession , about the two old women Mr. Mell had taken me to see ; and I was always afraid that Steerforth would let it out , and twit him with it .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 56]: We little thought , any one of us , I dare say , when I ate my breakfast that first morning , and went to sleep under the shadow of the peacock 's feathers to the sound of the flute , what consequences would come of the introduction into those alms-houses of my insignificant person .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 20]: But the visit had its unforeseen consequences ; and of a serious sort , too , in their way .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 37]: One day when Mr. Creakle kept the house from indisposition , which naturally diffused a lively joy through the school , there was a good deal of noise in the course of the morning 's work .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 76]: The great relief and satisfaction experienced by the boys made them difficult to manage ; and though the dreaded Tungay brought his wooden leg in twice or thrice , and took notes of the principal offenders ' names , no great impression was made by it , as they were pretty sure of getting into trouble tomorrow , do what they would , and thought it wise , no doubt , to enjoy themselves today .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 11]: It was , properly , a half-holiday ; being Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 48]: But as the noise in the playground would have disturbed Mr. Creakle , and the weather was not favourable for going out walking , we were ordered into school in the afternoon , and set some lighter tasks than usual , which were made for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 38]: It was the day of the week on which Mr. Sharp went out to get his wig curled ; so Mr. Mell , who always did the drudgery , whatever it was , kept school by himself .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 52]: If I could associate the idea of a bull or a bear with anyone so mild as Mr. Mell , I should think of him , in connexion with that afternoon when the uproar was at its height , as of one of those animals , baited by a thousand dogs .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 48]: I recall him bending his aching head , supported on his bony hand , over the book on his desk , and wretchedly endeavouring to get on with his tiresome work , amidst an uproar that might have made the Speaker of the House of Commons giddy .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 87]: Boys started in and out of their places , playing at puss in the corner with other boys ; there were laughing boys , singing boys , talking boys , dancing boys , howling boys ; boys shuffled with their feet , boys whirled about him , grinning , making faces , mimicking him behind his back and before his eyes ; mimicking his poverty , his boots , his coat , his mother , everything belonging to him that they should have had consideration for .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 4]: ` Silence ! '
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 16]: cried Mr. Mell , suddenly rising up , and striking his desk with the book .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 6]: ` What does this mean !
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 7]: It 's impossible to bear it .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 4]: It 's maddening .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 11]: How can you do it to me , boys ? '
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 48]: It was my book that he struck his desk with ; and as I stood beside him , following his eye as it glanced round the room , I saw the boys all stop , some suddenly surprised , some half afraid , and some sorry perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 20]: Steerforth 's place was at the bottom of the school , at the opposite end of the long room .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 40]: He was lounging with his back against the wall , and his hands in his pockets , and looked at Mr. Mell with his mouth shut up as if he were whistling , when Mr. Mell looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 7]: ` Silence , Mr. Steerforth ! '
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 4]: said Mr. Mell .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 11]: ` Silence yourself , ' said Steerforth , turning red .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 8]: ` Whom are you talking to ? '
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 9]: ` Sit down , ' said Mr. Mell .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 16]: ` Sit down yourself , ' said Steerforth , ` and mind your business . '
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 49]: There was a titter , and some applause ; but Mr. Mell was so white , that silence immediately succeeded ; and one boy , who had darted out behind him to imitate his mother again , changed his mind , and pretended to want a pen mended .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 82]: ` If you think , Steerforth , ' said Mr. Mell , ` that I am not acquainted with the power you can establish over any mind here ' -- he laid his hand , without considering what he did -LRB- as I supposed -RRB- , upon my head -- ` or that I have not observed you , within a few minutes , urging your juniors on to every sort of outrage against me , you are mistaken . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 32]: I do n't give myself the trouble of thinking at all about you , ' said Steerforth , coolly ; ` so I 'm not mistaken , as it happens . '
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 38]: ` And when you make use of your position of favouritism here , sir , ' pursued Mr. Mell , with his lip trembling very much , ` to insult a gentleman -- ' ' A what ?
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 6]: -- where is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 11]: Here somebody cried out , ` Shame , J. Steerforth !
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 4]: Too bad ! '
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 16]: It was Traddles ; whom Mr. Mell instantly discomfited by bidding him hold his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 63]: - ` To insult one who is not fortunate in life , sir , and who never gave you the least offence , and the many reasons for not insulting whom you are old enough and wise enough to understand , ' said Mr. Mell , with his lips trembling more and more , ` you commit a mean and base action .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 13]: You can sit down or stand up as you please , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 6]: Copperfield , go on . '
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 19]: ` Young Copperfield , ' said Steerforth , coming forward up the room , ` stop a bit .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 12]: I tell you what , Mr. Mell , once for all .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 24]: When you take the liberty of calling me mean or base , or anything of that sort , you are an impudent beggar .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 22]: You are always a beggar , you know ; but when you do that , you are an impudent beggar . '
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 32]: I am not clear whether he was going to strike Mr. Mell , or Mr. Mell was going to strike him , or there was any such intention on either side .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 50]: I saw a rigidity come upon the whole school as if they had been turned into stone , and found Mr. Creakle in the midst of us , with Tungay at his side , and Mrs. and Miss Creakle looking in at the door as if they were frightened .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 25]: Mr. Mell , with his elbows on his desk and his face in his hands , sat , for some moments , quite still .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 44]: ` Mr. Mell , ' said Mr. Creakle , shaking him by the arm ; and his whisper was so audible now , that Tungay felt it unnecessary to repeat his words ; ` you have not forgotten yourself , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 29]: ` No , sir , no , ' returned the Master , showing his face , and shaking his head , and rubbing his hands in great agitation .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 5]: ` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 27]: I have remembered myself , I -- no , Mr. Creakle , I have not forgotten myself , I -- I have remembered myself , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 17]: I -- I -- could wish you had remembered me a little sooner , Mr. Creakle .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 17]: It -- it -- would have been more kind , sir , more just , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 10]: It would have saved me something , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 33]: Mr. Creakle , looking hard at Mr. Mell , put his hand on Tungay 's shoulder , and got his feet upon the form close by , and sat upon the desk .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 59]: After still looking hard at Mr. Mell from his throne , as he shook his head , and rubbed his hands , and remained in the same state of agitation , Mr. Creakle turned to Steerforth , and said : ` Now , sir , as he do n't condescend to tell me , what is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 22]: Steerforth evaded the question for a little while ; looking in scorn and anger on his opponent , and remaining silent .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 34]: I could not help thinking even in that interval , I remember , what a noble fellow he was in appearance , and how homely and plain Mr. Mell looked opposed to him .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 13]: ` What did he mean by talking about favourites , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 5]: said Steerforth at length .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 4]: ` Favourites ? '
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 13]: repeated Mr. Creakle , with the veins in his forehead swelling quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 7]: ` Who talked about favourites ? '
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 8]: ` He did , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 14]: ` And pray , what did you mean by that , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 11]: demanded Mr. Creakle , turning angrily on his assistant . '
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 38]: I meant , Mr. Creakle , ' he returned in a low voice , ` as I said ; that no pupil had a right to avail himself of his position of favouritism to degrade me . '
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 6]: ` To degrade YOU ? '
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 4]: said Mr. Creakle .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 4]: ` My stars !
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 65]: But give me leave to ask you , Mr. What 's - your-name ' ; and here Mr. Creakle folded his arms , cane and all , upon his chest , and made such a knot of his brows that his little eyes were hardly visible below them ; ` whether , when you talk about favourites , you showed proper respect to me ?
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 35]: To me , sir , ' said Mr. Creakle , darting his head at him suddenly , and drawing it back again , ` the principal of this establishment , and your employer . '
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 20]: ` It was not judicious , sir , I am willing to admit , ' said Mr. Mell . '
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 14]: I should not have done so , if I had been cool . '
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 5]: Here Steerforth struck in .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 24]: ` Then he said I was mean , and then he said I was base , and then I called him a beggar .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 16]: If I had been cool , perhaps I should n't have called him a beggar .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 16]: But I did , and I am ready to take the consequences of it . '
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 25]: Without considering , perhaps , whether there were any consequences to be taken , I felt quite in a glow at this gallant speech .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 26]: It made an impression on the boys too , for there was a low stir among them , though no one spoke a word . '
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 55]: I am surprised , Steerforth -- although your candour does you honour , ' said Mr. Creakle , ` does you honour , certainly -- I am surprised , Steerforth , I must say , that you should attach such an epithet to any person employed and paid in Salem House , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 6]: Steerforth gave a short laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 19]: ` That 's not an answer , sir , ' said Mr. Creakle , ` to my remark .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 11]: I expect more than that from you , Steerforth . '
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 28]: If Mr. Mell looked homely , in my eyes , before the handsome boy , it would be quite impossible to say how homely Mr. Creakle looked .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 10]: ` Let him deny it , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 11]: ` Deny that he is a beggar , Steerforth ? '
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 4]: cried Mr. Creakle .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 10]: ` Why , where does he go a-begging ? '
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 19]: ` If he is not a beggar himself , his near relation 's one , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 8]: ` It 's all the same . '
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 17]: He glanced at me , and Mr. Mell 's hand gently patted me upon the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 25]: I looked up with a flush upon my face and remorse in my heart , but Mr. Mell 's eyes were fixed on Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 16]: He continued to pat me kindly on the shoulder , but he looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 44]: ` Since you expect me , Mr. Creakle , to justify myself , ' said Steerforth , ` and to say what I mean , -- what I have to say is , that his mother lives on charity in an alms-house . '
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 38]: Mr. Mell still looked at him , and still patted me kindly on the shoulder , and said to himself , in a whisper , if I heard right : ` Yes , I thought so . '
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 28]: Mr. Creakle turned to his assistant , with a severe frown and laboured politeness : ` Now , you hear what this gentleman says , Mr. Mell .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 18]: Have the goodness , if you please , to set him right before the assembled school . '
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 32]: ` He is right , sir , without correction , ' returned Mr. Mell , in the midst of a dead silence ; ` what he has said is true . '
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 46]: ` Be so good then as declare publicly , will you , ' said Mr. Creakle , putting his head on one side , and rolling his eyes round the school , ` whether it ever came to my knowledge until this moment ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 9]: I believe not directly , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 12]: ` Why , you know not , ' said Mr. Creakle .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 9]: ` Do n't you , man ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 18]: I apprehend you never supposed my worldly circumstances to be very good , ' replied the assistant .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 17]: ` You know what my position is , and always has been , here . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 42]: I apprehend , if you come to that , ' said Mr. Creakle , with his veins swelling again bigger than ever , ` that you 've been in a wrong position altogether , and mistook this for a charity school .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 11]: Mr. Mell , we 'll part , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 6]: The sooner the better . '
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 19]: ` There is no time , ' answered Mr. Mell , rising , ` like the present . '
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 7]: ` Sir , to you ! '
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 5]: said Mr. Creakle . '
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 34]: I take my leave of you , Mr. Creakle , and all of you , ' said Mr. Mell , glancing round the room , and again patting me gently on the shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 26]: ` James Steerforth , the best wish I can leave you is that you may come to be ashamed of what you have done today .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 28]: At present I would prefer to see you anything rather than a friend , to me , or to anyone in whom I feel an interest . '
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 47]: Once more he laid his hand upon my shoulder ; and then taking his flute and a few books from his desk , and leaving the key in it for his successor , he went out of the school , with his property under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 74]: Mr. Creakle then made a speech , through Tungay , in which he thanked Steerforth for asserting -LRB- though perhaps too warmly -RRB- the independence and respectability of Salem House ; and which he wound up by shaking hands with Steerforth , while we gave three cheers -- I did not quite know what for , but I supposed for Steerforth , and so joined in them ardently , though I felt miserable .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 42]: Mr. Creakle then caned Tommy Traddles for being discovered in tears , instead of cheers , on account of Mr. Mell 's departure ; and went back to his sofa , or his bed , or wherever he had come from .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 19]: We were left to ourselves now , and looked very blank , I recollect , on one another .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 81]: For myself , I felt so much self-reproach and contrition for my part in what had happened , that nothing would have enabled me to keep back my tears but the fear that Steerforth , who often looked at me , I saw , might think it unfriendly -- or , I should rather say , considering our relative ages , and the feeling with which I regarded him , undutiful -- if I showed the emotion which distressed me .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 17]: He was very angry with Traddles , and said he was glad he had caught it .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 35]: Poor Traddles , who had passed the stage of lying with his head upon the desk , and was relieving himself as usual with a burst of skeletons , said he did n't care .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 5]: Mr. Mell was ill-used .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 10]: ` Who has ill-used him , you girl ? '
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 10]: ` Why , you have , ' returned Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 7]: ` What have I done ? '
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 7]: ` What have you done ? '
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 3]: retorted Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 12]: ` Hurt his feelings , and lost him his situation . '
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 5]: ` His feelings ? '
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 4]: repeated Steerforth disdainfully .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 16]: ` His feelings will soon get the better of it , I 'll be bound .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 10]: His feelings are not like yours , Miss Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 15]: As to his situation -- which was a precious one , was n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 21]: -- do you suppose I am not going to write home , and take care that he gets some money ?
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 3]: Polly ? '
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 33]: We thought this intention very noble in Steerforth , whose mother was a widow , and rich , and would do almost anything , it was said , that he asked her .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 63]: We were all extremely glad to see Traddles so put down , and exalted Steerforth to the skies : especially when he told us , as he condescended to do , that what he had done had been done expressly for us , and for our cause ; and that he had conferred a great boon upon us by unselfishly doing it .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 66]: But I must say that when I was going on with a story in the dark that night , Mr. Mell 's old flute seemed more than once to sound mournfully in my ears ; and that when at last Steerforth was tired , and I lay down in my bed , I fancied it playing so sorrowfully somewhere , that I was quite wretched .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 46]: I soon forgot him in the contemplation of Steerforth , who , in an easy amateur way , and without any book -LRB- he seemed to me to know everything by heart -RRB- , took some of his classes until a new master was found .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 30]: The new master came from a grammar school ; and before he entered on his duties , dined in the parlour one day , to be introduced to Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 14]: Steerforth approved of him highly , and told us he was a Brick .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 49]: Without exactly understanding what learned distinction was meant by this , I respected him greatly for it , and had no doubt whatever of his superior knowledge : though he never took the pains with me -- not that I was anybody -- that Mr. Mell had taken .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 26]: There was only one other event in this half-year , out of the daily school-life , that made an impression upon me which still survives .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 6]: It survives for many reasons .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 43]: One afternoon , when we were all harassed into a state of dire confusion , and Mr. Creakle was laying about him dreadfully , Tungay came in , and called out in his usual strong way : ` Visitors for Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 76]: A few words were interchanged between him and Mr. Creakle , as , who the visitors were , and what room they were to be shown into ; and then I , who had , according to custom , stood up on the announcement being made , and felt quite faint with astonishment , was told to go by the back stairs and get a clean frill on , before I repaired to the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 77]: These orders I obeyed , in such a flutter and hurry of my young spirits as I had never known before ; and when I got to the parlour door , and the thought came into my head that it might be my mother -- I had only thought of Mr. or Miss Murdstone until then -- I drew back my hand from the lock , and stopped to have a sob before I went in .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 47]: At first I saw nobody ; but feeling a pressure against the door , I looked round it , and there , to my amazement , were Mr. Peggotty and Ham , ducking at me with their hats , and squeezing one another against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 25]: I could not help laughing ; but it was much more in the pleasure of seeing them , than at the appearance they made .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 26]: We shook hands in a very cordial way ; and I laughed and laughed , until I pulled out my pocket-handkerchief and wiped my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 34]: Mr. Peggotty -LRB- who never shut his mouth once , I remember , during the visit -RRB- showed great concern when he saw me do this , and nudged Ham to say something .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 12]: ` Cheer up , Mas ' r Davy bor ' ! '
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 8]: said Ham , in his simpering way .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 9]: ` Why , how you have growed ! '
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 6]: ` Am I grown ? '
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 7]: I said , drying my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 25]: I was not crying at anything in particular that I know of ; but somehow it made me cry , to see old friends .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 10]: ` Growed , Mas ' r Davy bor ' ?
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 6]: Ai n't he growed ! '
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 3]: said Ham .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 7]: ` Ai n't he growed ! '
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 4]: said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 26]: They made me laugh again by laughing at each other , and then we all three laughed until I was in danger of crying again .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 12]: ` Do you know how mama is , Mr. Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 13]: ` And how my dear , dear , old Peggotty is ? '
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 8]: ` Oncommon , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 12]: ` And little Em ` ly , and Mrs. Gummidge ? '
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 10]: ` On -- common , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 5]: There was a silence .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 39]: Mr. Peggotty , to relieve it , took two prodigious lobsters , and an enormous crab , and a large canvas bag of shrimps , out of his pockets , and piled them up in Ham 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 34]: ` You see , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` knowing as you was partial to a little relish with your wittles when you was along with us , we took the liberty .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 9]: The old Mawther biled 'em , she did .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 5]: Mrs. Gummidge biled 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 41]: Yes , ' said Mr. Peggotty , slowly , who I thought appeared to stick to the subject on account of having no other subject ready , ` Mrs. Gummidge , I do assure you , she biled 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 58]: I expressed my thanks ; and Mr. Peggotty , after looking at Ham , who stood smiling sheepishly over the shellfish , without making any attempt to help him , said : ` We come , you see , the wind and tide making in our favour , in one of our Yarmouth lugs to Gravesen ' .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 62]: My sister she wrote to me the name of this here place , and wrote to me as if ever I chanced to come to Gravesen ' , I was to come over and inquire for Mas ' r Davy and give her dooty , humbly wishing him well and reporting of the fam ` ly as they was oncommon toe-be-sure .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 42]: Little Em ` ly , you see , she 'll write to my sister when I go back , as I see you and as you was similarly oncommon , and so we make it quite a merry - go-rounder . '
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 26]: I was obliged to consider a little before I understood what Mr. Peggotty meant by this figure , expressive of a complete circle of intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 39]: I then thanked him heartily ; and said , with a consciousness of reddening , that I supposed little Em ` ly was altered too , since we used to pick up shells and pebbles on the beach ?
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 23]: ` She 's getting to be a woman , that 's wot she 's getting to be , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 5]: ` Ask HIM . '
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 16]: He meant Ham , who beamed with delight and assent over the bag of shrimps .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 6]: ` Her pretty face ! '
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 12]: said Mr. Peggotty , with his own shining like a light .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 5]: ` Her learning ! '
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 3]: said Ham .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 5]: ` Her writing ! '
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 4]: said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 9]: ` Why it 's as black as jet !
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 13]: And so large it is , you might see it anywheres . '
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 21]: It was perfectly delightful to behold with what enthusiasm Mr. Peggotty became inspired when he thought of his little favourite .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 26]: He stands before me again , his bluff hairy face irradiating with a joyful love and pride , for which I can find no description .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 19]: His honest eyes fire up , and sparkle , as if their depths were stirred by something bright .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 7]: His broad chest heaves with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 33]: His strong loose hands clench themselves , in his earnestness ; and he emphasizes what he says with a right arm that shows , in my pigmy view , like a sledge-hammer .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 8]: Ham was quite as earnest as he .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 62]: I dare say they would have said much more about her , if they had not been abashed by the unexpected coming in of Steerforth , who , seeing me in a corner speaking with two strangers , stopped in a song he was singing , and said : ' I did n't know you were here , young Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 19]: -LRB- for it was not the usual visiting room -RRB- and crossed by us on his way out .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 49]: I am not sure whether it was in the pride of having such a friend as Steerforth , or in the desire to explain to him how I came to have such a friend as Mr. Peggotty , that I called to him as he was going away .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 21]: But I said , modestly -- Good Heaven , how it all comes back to me this long time afterwards !
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 12]: -- ` Do n't go , Steerforth , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 29]: These are two Yarmouth boatmen -- very kind , good people -- who are relations of my nurse , and have come from Gravesend to see me . '
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 6]: ` Aye , aye ? '
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 6]: said Steerforth , returning . '
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 7]: I am glad to see them .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 6]: How are you both ? '
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 34]: There was an ease in his manner -- a gay and light manner it was , but not swaggering -- which I still believe to have borne a kind of enchantment with it .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 74]: I still believe him , in virtue of this carriage , his animal spirits , his delightful voice , his handsome face and figure , and , for aught I know , of some inborn power of attraction besides -LRB- which I think a few people possess -RRB- , to have carried a spell with him to which it was a natural weakness to yield , and which not many persons could withstand .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 26]: I could not but see how pleased they were with him , and how they seemed to open their hearts to him in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 52]: ` You must let them know at home , if you please , Mr. Peggotty , ' I said , ` when that letter is sent , that Mr. Steerforth is very kind to me , and that I do n't know what I should ever do here without him . '
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 4]: ` Nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 5]: said Steerforth , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 12]: ` You must n't tell them anything of the sort . '
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 48]: ` And if Mr. Steerforth ever comes into Norfolk or Suffolk , Mr. Peggotty , ' I said , ` while I am there , you may depend upon it I shall bring him to Yarmouth , if he will let me , to see your house .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 10]: You never saw such a good house , Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 9]: It 's made out of a boat ! '
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 11]: ` Made out of a boat , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 16]: ` It 's the right sort of a house for such a thorough-built boatman . '
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 19]: ` So 't is , sir , so 't is , sir , ' said Ham , grinning .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 13]: ` You 're right , young gen ` l 'm ` n !
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 15]: Mas ' r Davy bor ' , gen ` l 'm 'n' s right .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 6]: A thorough - built boatman !
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 4]: Hor , hor !
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 9]: That 's what he is , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 23]: Mr. Peggotty was no less pleased than his nephew , though his modesty forbade him to claim a personal compliment so vociferously .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 34]: ` Well , sir , ' he said , bowing and chuckling , and tucking in the ends of his neckerchief at his breast : ' I thankee , sir , I thankee !
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 13]: I do my endeavours in my line of life , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 17]: ` The best of men can do no more , Mr. Peggotty , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 7]: He had got his name already .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 34]: ` I 'll pound it , it 's wot you do yourself , sir , ' said Mr. Peggotty , shaking his head , ` and wot you do well -- right well !
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 5]: I thankee , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 15]: I 'm obleeged to you , sir , for your welcoming manner of me .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 23]: I 'm rough , sir , but I 'm ready -- least ways , I hope I 'm ready , you unnerstand .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 33]: My house ai n't much for to see , sir , but it 's hearty at your service if ever you should come along with Mas ' r Davy to see it .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 68]: I 'm a reg ` lar Dodman , I am , ' said Mr. Peggotty , by which he meant snail , and this was in allusion to his being slow to go , for he had attempted to go after every sentence , and had somehow or other come back again ; ` but I wish you both well , and I wish you happy ! '
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 15]: Ham echoed this sentiment , and we parted with them in the heartiest manner .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 36]: I was almost tempted that evening to tell Steerforth about pretty little Em ` ly , but I was too timid of mentioning her name , and too much afraid of his laughing at me .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 39]: I remember that I thought a good deal , and in an uneasy sort of way , about Mr. Peggotty having said that she was getting on to be a woman ; but I decided that was nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 32]: We transported the shellfish , or the ` relish ' as Mr. Peggotty had modestly called it , up into our room unobserved , and made a great supper that evening .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 10]: But Traddles could n't get happily out of it .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 14]: He was too unfortunate even to come through a supper like anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 65]: He was taken ill in the night -- quite prostrate he was -- in consequence of Crab ; and after being drugged with black draughts and blue pills , to an extent which Demple -LRB- whose father was a doctor -RRB- said was enough to undermine a horse 's constitution , received a caning and six chapters of Greek Testament for refusing to confess .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 137]: The rest of the half-year is a jumble in my recollection of the daily strife and struggle of our lives ; of the waning summer and the changing season ; of the frosty mornings when we were rung out of bed , and the cold , cold smell of the dark nights when we were rung into bed again ; of the evening schoolroom dimly lighted and indifferently warmed , and the morning schoolroom which was nothing but a great shivering-machine ; of the alternation of boiled beef with roast beef , and boiled mutton with roast mutton ; of clods of bread-and-butter , dog 's - eared lesson-books , cracked slates , tear-blotted copy-books , canings , rulerings , hair-cuttings , rainy Sundays , suet-puddings , and a dirty atmosphere of ink , surrounding all .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 37]: I well remember though , how the distant idea of the holidays , after seeming for an immense time to be a stationary speck , began to come towards us , and to grow and grow .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 61]: How from counting months , we came to weeks , and then to days ; and how I then began to be afraid that I should not be sent for and when I learnt from Steerforth that I had been sent for , and was certainly to go home , had dim forebodings that I might break my leg first .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 47]: How the breaking-up day changed its place fast , at last , from the week after next to next week , this week , the day after tomorrow , tomorrow , today , tonight -- when I was inside the Yarmouth mail , and going home .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 21]: I had many a broken sleep inside the Yarmouth mail , and many an incoherent dream of all these things .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 49]: But when I awoke at intervals , the ground outside the window was not the playground of Salem House , and the sound in my ears was not the sound of Mr. Creakle giving it to Traddles , but the sound of the coachman touching up the horses .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 5]: Chapter 8 My Holidays .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 46]: Especially One Happy Afternoon When we arrived before day at the inn where the mail stopped , which was not the inn where my friend the waiter lived , I was shown up to a nice little bedroom , with DOLPHIN painted on the door .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 49]: Very cold I was , I know , notwithstanding the hot tea they had given me before a large fire downstairs ; and very glad I was to turn into the Dolphin 's bed , pull the Dolphin 's blankets round my head , and go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 16]: Mr. Barkis the carrier was to call for me in the morning at nine o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 28]: I got up at eight , a little giddy from the shortness of my night 's rest , and was ready for him before the appointed time .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 37]: He received me exactly as if not five minutes had elapsed since we were last together , and I had only been into the hotel to get change for sixpence , or something of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 30]: As soon as I and my box were in the cart , and the carrier seated , the lazy horse walked away with us all at his accustomed pace .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 21]: ` You look very well , Mr. Barkis , ' I said , thinking he would like to know it .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 38]: Mr. Barkis rubbed his cheek with his cuff , and then looked at his cuff as if he expected to find some of the bloom upon it ; but made no other acknowledgement of the compliment . '
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 19]: I gave your message , Mr. Barkis , ' I said : ' I wrote to Peggotty . '
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 4]: said Mr. Barkis .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 9]: Mr. Barkis seemed gruff , and answered drily .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 10]: ` Was n't it right , Mr. Barkis ? '
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 8]: I asked , after a little hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 10]: ` Why , no , ' said Mr. Barkis .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 6]: ` Not the message ? '
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 24]: ` The message was right enough , perhaps , ' said Mr. Barkis ; ` but it come to an end there . '
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 20]: Not understanding what he meant , I repeated inquisitively : ` Came to an end , Mr. Barkis ? '
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 15]: ` Nothing come of it , ' he explained , looking at me sideways .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 5]: ` No answer . '
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 14]: ` There was an answer expected , was there , Mr. Barkis ? '
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 7]: said I , opening my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 9]: For this was a new light to me .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 42]: ` When a man says he 's willin ' , ' said Mr. Barkis , turning his glance slowly on me again , ` it 's as much as to say , that man 's a-waitin ' for a answer . '
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 7]: ` Well , Mr. Barkis ? '
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 32]: ` Well , ' said Mr. Barkis , carrying his eyes back to his horse 's ears ; ` that man 's been a-waitin ' for a answer ever since . '
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 11]: ` Have you told her so , Mr. Barkis ? '
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 15]: ` No -- no , ' growled Mr. Barkis , reflecting about it . '
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 13]: I ai n't got no call to go and tell her so .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 20]: I never said six words to her myself , I ai n't a-goin ' to tell her so . '
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 13]: ` Would you like me to do it , Mr. Barkis ? '
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 5]: said I , doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 32]: ` You might tell her , if you would , ' said Mr. Barkis , with another slow look at me , ` that Barkis was a-waitin ' for a answer .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 9]: Says you - what name is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 5]: ` Her name ? '
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 11]: said Mr. Barkis , with a nod of his head .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 4]: ` Peggotty . '
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 4]: ` Chrisen name ?
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 7]: Or nat ` ral name ? '
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 4]: said Mr. Barkis .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 10]: ` Oh , it 's not her Christian name .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 7]: Her Christian name is Clara . '
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 6]: ` Is it though ? '
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 4]: said Mr. Barkis .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 23]: He seemed to find an immense fund of reflection in this circumstance , and sat pondering and inwardly whistling for some time .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 5]: he resumed at length .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 7]: ` Says you , `` Peggotty !
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 9]: Barkis is waitin ' for a answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 11]: Says she , perhaps , `` Answer to what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 11]: Says you , `` To what I told you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 6]: `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 3]: says she .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 11]: `` Barkis is willin ' , '' says you . '
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 23]: This extremely artful suggestion Mr. Barkis accompanied with a nudge of his elbow that gave me quite a stitch in my side .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 59]: After that , he slouched over his horse in his usual manner ; and made no other reference to the subject except , half an hour afterwards , taking a piece of chalk from his pocket , and writing up , inside the tilt of the cart , ` Clara Peggotty ' -- apparently as a private memorandum .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 47]: Ah , what a strange feeling it was to be going home when it was not home , and to find that every object I looked at , reminded me of the happy old home , which was like a dream I could never dream again !
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 68]: The days when my mother and I and Peggotty were all in all to one another , and there was no one to come between us , rose up before me so sorrowfully on the road , that I am not sure I was glad to be there -- not sure but that I would rather have remained away , and forgotten it in Steerforth 's company .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 43]: But there I was ; and soon I was at our house , where the bare old elm-trees wrung their many hands in the bleak wintry air , and shreds of the old rooks ' - nests drifted away upon the wind .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 14]: The carrier put my box down at the garden-gate , and left me .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 33]: I walked along the path towards the house , glancing at the windows , and fearing at every step to see Mr. Murdstone or Miss Murdstone lowering out of one of them .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 37]: No face appeared , however ; and being come to the house , and knowing how to open the door , before dark , without knocking , I went in with a quiet , timid step .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 36]: God knows how infantine the memory may have been , that was awakened within me by the sound of my mother 's voice in the old parlour , when I set foot in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 8]: She was singing in a low tone .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 24]: I think I must have lain in her arms , and heard her singing so to me when I was but a baby .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 30]: The strain was new to me , and yet it was so old that it filled my heart brim-full ; like a friend come back from a long absence .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 22]: I believed , from the solitary and thoughtful way in which my mother murmured her song , that she was alone .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 8]: And I went softly into the room .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 20]: She was sitting by the fire , suckling an infant , whose tiny hand she held against her neck .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 16]: Her eyes were looking down upon its face , and she sat singing to it .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 13]: I was so far right , that she had no other companion .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 13]: I spoke to her , and she started , and cried out .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 15]: But seeing me , she called me her dear Davy , her own boy !
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 44]: and coming half across the room to meet me , kneeled down upon the ground and kissed me , and laid my head down on her bosom near the little creature that was nestling there , and put its hand to my lips .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 6]: I wish I had died .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 14]: I wish I had died then , with that feeling in my heart !
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 15]: I should have been more fit for Heaven than I ever have been since .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 14]: ` He is your brother , ' said my mother , fondling me .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 7]: ` Davy , my pretty boy !
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 5]: My poor child ! '
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 15]: Then she kissed me more and more , and clasped me round the neck .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 32]: This she was doing when Peggotty came running in , and bounced down on the ground beside us , and went mad about us both for a quarter of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 20]: It seemed that I had not been expected so soon , the carrier being much before his usual time .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 27]: It seemed , too , that Mr. and Miss Murdstone had gone out upon a visit in the neighbourhood , and would not return before night .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 7]: I had never hoped for this .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 34]: I had never thought it possible that we three could be together undisturbed , once more ; and I felt , for the time , as if the old days were come back .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 7]: We dined together by the fireside .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 26]: Peggotty was in attendance to wait upon us , but my mother would n't let her do it , and made her dine with us .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 48]: I had my own old plate , with a brown view of a man-of-war in full sail upon it , which Peggotty had hoarded somewhere all the time I had been away , and would not have had broken , she said , for a hundred pounds .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 24]: I had my own old mug with David on it , and my own old little knife and fork that would n't cut .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 44]: While we were at table , I thought it a favourable occasion to tell Peggotty about Mr. Barkis , who , before I had finished what I had to tell her , began to laugh , and throw her apron over her face .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 8]: ` Peggotty , ' said my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 34]: Peggotty only laughed the more , and held her apron tight over her face when my mother tried to pull it away , and sat as if her head were in a bag .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 11]: ` What are you doing , you stupid creature ? '
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 6]: said my mother , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 8]: ` Oh , drat the man ! '
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 3]: cried Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 8]: ` He wants to marry me . '
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 16]: ` It would be a very good match for you ; would n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 4]: said my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 9]: I do n't know , ' said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 6]: ` Do n't ask me .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 12]: I would n't have him if he was made of gold .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 8]: Nor I would n't have anybody . '
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 16]: ` Then , why do n't you tell him so , you ridiculous thing ? '
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 4]: said my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 15]: ` Tell him so , ' retorted Peggotty , looking out of her apron .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 12]: ` He has never said a word to me about it .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 4]: He knows better .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 21]: If he was to make so bold as say a word to me , I should slap his face . '
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 60]: Her own was as red as ever I saw it , or any other face , I think ; but she only covered it again , for a few moments at a time , when she was taken with a violent fit of laughter ; and after two or three of those attacks , went on with her dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 21]: I remarked that my mother , though she smiled when Peggotty looked at her , became more serious and thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 10]: I had seen at first that she was changed .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 34]: Her face was very pretty still , but it looked careworn , and too delicate ; and her hand was so thin and white that it seemed to me to be almost transparent .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 25]: But the change to which I now refer was superadded to this : it was in her manner , which became anxious and fluttered .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 36]: At last she said , putting out her hand , and laying it affectionately on the hand of her old servant , ` Peggotty , dear , you are not going to be married ? '
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 6]: ` Me , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 5]: returned Peggotty , staring .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 8]: ` Lord bless you , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 6]: ` Not just yet ? '
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 6]: said my mother , tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 4]: ` Never ! '
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 3]: cried Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 17]: My mother took her hand , and said : ` Do n't leave me , Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 4]: Stay with me .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 9]: It will not be for long , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 9]: What should I ever do without you ! '
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 9]: ` Me leave you , my precious ! '
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 3]: cried Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 10]: ` Not for all the world and his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 13]: Why , what 's put that in your silly little head ? '
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 18]: -- For Peggotty had been used of old to talk to my mother sometimes like a child .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 22]: But my mother made no answer , except to thank her , and Peggotty went running on in her own fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 5]: ` Me leave you ?
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 6]: I think I see myself .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 6]: Peggotty go away from you ?
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 9]: I should like to catch her at it !
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 26]: No , no , no , ' said Peggotty , shaking her head , and folding her arms ; ` not she , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 27]: It is n't that there ai n't some Cats that would be well enough pleased if she did , but they sha 'n' t be pleased .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 5]: They shall be aggravated .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 14]: I 'll stay with you till I am a cross cranky old woman .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 55]: And when I 'm too deaf , and too lame , and too blind , and too mumbly for want of teeth , to be of any use at all , even to be found fault with , than I shall go to my Davy , and ask him to take me in . '
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 30]: ` And , Peggotty , ' says I , ' I shall be glad to see you , and I 'll make you as welcome as a queen . '
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 7]: ` Bless your dear heart ! '
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 4]: cried Peggotty . '
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 6]: I know you will ! '
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 13]: And she kissed me beforehand , in grateful acknowledgement of my hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 20]: After that , she covered her head up with her apron again and had another laugh about Mr. Barkis .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 17]: After that , she took the baby out of its little cradle , and nursed it .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 40]: After that , she cleared the dinner table ; after that , came in with another cap on , and her work-box , and the yard-measure , and the bit of wax-candle , all just the same as ever .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 10]: We sat round the fire , and talked delightfully .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 18]: I told them what a hard master Mr. Creakle was , and they pitied me very much .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 31]: I told them what a fine fellow Steerforth was , and what a patron of mine , and Peggotty said she would walk a score of miles to see him .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 18]: I took the little baby in my arms when it was awake , and nursed it lovingly .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 75]: When it was asleep again , I crept close to my mother 's side according to my old custom , broken now a long time , and sat with my arms embracing her waist , and my little red cheek on her shoulder , and once more felt her beautiful hair drooping over me -- like an angel 's wing as I used to think , I recollect -- and was very happy indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 111]: While I sat thus , looking at the fire , and seeing pictures in the red-hot coals , I almost believed that I had never been away ; that Mr. and Miss Murdstone were such pictures , and would vanish when the fire got low ; and that there was nothing real in all that I remembered , save my mother , Peggotty , and I. Peggotty darned away at a stocking as long as she could see , and then sat with it drawn on her left hand like a glove , and her needle in her right , ready to take another stitch whenever there was a blaze .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 33]: I can not conceive whose stockings they can have been that Peggotty was always darning , or where such an unfailing supply of stockings in want of darning can have come from .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 27]: From my earliest infancy she seems to have been always employed in that class of needlework , and never by any chance in any other . '
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 32]: I wonder , ' said Peggotty , who was sometimes seized with a fit of wondering on some most unexpected topic , ` what 's become of Davy 's great-aunt ? '
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 6]: ` Lor , Peggotty ! '
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 17]: observed my mother , rousing herself from a reverie , ` what nonsense you talk ! '
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 15]: ` Well , but I really do wonder , ma'am , ' said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 13]: ` What can have put such a person in your head ? '
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 4]: inquired my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 14]: ` Is there nobody else in the world to come there ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 33]: I do n't know how it is , ' said Peggotty , ` unless it 's on account of being stupid , but my head never can pick and choose its people .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 22]: They come and they go , and they do n't come and they do n't go , just as they like .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 9]: I wonder what 's become of her ? '
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 9]: ` How absurd you are , Peggotty ! '
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 4]: returned my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 13]: ` One would suppose you wanted a second visit from her . '
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 5]: ` Lord forbid ! '
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 3]: cried Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 23]: ` Well then , do n't talk about such uncomfortable things , there 's a good soul , ' said my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 21]: ` Miss Betsey is shut up in her cottage by the sea , no doubt , and will remain there .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 15]: At all events , she is not likely ever to trouble us again . '
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 3]: mused Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 10]: ` No , that ai n't likely at all .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 18]: -- I wonder , if she was to die , whether she 'd leave Davy anything ? '
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 20]: ` Good gracious me , Peggotty , ' returned my mother , ` what a nonsensical woman you are !
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 21]: when you know that she took offence at the poor dear boy 's ever being born at all . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 16]: I suppose she would n't be inclined to forgive him now , ' hinted Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 12]: ` Why should she be inclined to forgive him now ? '
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 7]: said my mother , rather sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 16]: ` Now that he 's got a brother , I mean , ' said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 18]: My mother immediately began to cry , and wondered how Peggotty dared to say such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 26]: ` As if this poor little innocent in its cradle had ever done any harm to you or anybody else , you jealous thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 14]: ` You had much better go and marry Mr. Barkis , the carrier .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 7]: Why do n't you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 16]: I should make Miss Murdstone happy , if I was to , ' said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 11]: ` What a bad disposition you have , Peggotty ! '
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 4]: returned my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 19]: ` You are as jealous of Miss Murdstone as it is possible for a ridiculous creature to be .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 18]: You want to keep the keys yourself , and give out all the things , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 9]: I should n't be surprised if you did .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 16]: When you know that she only does it out of kindness and the best intentions !
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 13]: You know she does , Peggotty -- you know it well . '
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 14]: Peggotty muttered something to the effect of ` Bother the best intentions ! '
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 21]: and something else to the effect that there was a little too much of the best intentions going on . '
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 16]: I know what you mean , you cross thing , ' said my mother . '
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 8]: I understand you , Peggotty , perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 16]: You know I do , and I wonder you do n't colour up like fire .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 7]: But one point at a time .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 18]: Miss Murdstone is the point now , Peggotty , and you sha 'n' t escape from it .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 34]: Have n't you heard her say , over and over again , that she thinks I am too thoughtless and too -- a -- a -- ' ` Pretty , ' suggested Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 31]: ` Well , ' returned my mother , half laughing , ` and if she is so silly as to say so , can I be blamed for it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 11]: ` No one says you can , ' said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 11]: ` No , I should hope not , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 4]: returned my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 121]: ` Have n't you heard her say , over and over again , that on this account she wished to spare me a great deal of trouble , which she thinks I am not suited for , and which I really do n't know myself that I AM suited for ; and is n't she up early and late , and going to and fro continually -- and does n't she do all sorts of things , and grope into all sorts of places , coal-holes and pantries and I do n't know where , that ca n't be very agreeable -- and do you mean to insinuate that there is not a sort of devotion in that ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 11]: I do n't insinuate at all , ' said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 11]: ` You do , Peggotty , ' returned my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 11]: ` You never do anything else , except your work .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 5]: You are always insinuating .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 5]: You revel in it .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 23]: And when you talk of Mr. Murdstone 's good intentions -- ' ' I never talked of 'em , ' said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 15]: ` No , Peggotty , ' returned my mother , ` but you insinuated .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 9]: That 's what I told you just now .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 7]: That 's the worst of you .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 4]: You WILL insinuate .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 18]: I said , at the moment , that I understood you , and you see I did .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 54]: When you talk of Mr. Murdstone 's good intentions , and pretend to slight them -LRB- for I do n't believe you really do , in your heart , Peggotty -RRB- , you must be as well convinced as I am how good they are , and how they actuate him in everything .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 53]: If he seems to have been at all stern with a certain person , Peggotty -- you understand , and so I am sure does Davy , that I am not alluding to anybody present -- it is solely because he is satisfied that it is for a certain person 's benefit .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 21]: He naturally loves a certain person , on my account ; and acts solely for a certain person 's good .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 40]: He is better able to judge of it than I am ; for I very well know that I am a weak , light , girlish creature , and that he is a firm , grave , serious man .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 84]: And he takes , ' said my mother , with the tears which were engendered in her affectionate nature , stealing down her face , ` he takes great pains with me ; and I ought to be very thankful to him , and very submissive to him even in my thoughts ; and when I am not , Peggotty , I worry and condemn myself , and feel doubtful of my own heart , and do n't know what to do . '
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 18]: Peggotty sat with her chin on the foot of the stocking , looking silently at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 32]: ` There , Peggotty , ' said my mother , changing her tone , ` do n't let us fall out with one another , for I could n't bear it .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 17]: You are my true friend , I know , if I have any in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 61]: When I call you a ridiculous creature , or a vexatious thing , or anything of that sort , Peggotty , I only mean that you are my true friend , and always have been , ever since the night when Mr. Copperfield first brought me home here , and you came out to the gate to meet me . '
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 22]: Peggotty was not slow to respond , and ratify the treaty of friendship by giving me one of her best hugs .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 56]: I think I had some glimpses of the real character of this conversation at the time ; but I am sure , now , that the good creature originated it , and took her part in it , merely that my mother might comfort herself with the little contradictory summary in which she had indulged .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 29]: The design was efficacious ; for I remember that my mother seemed more at ease during the rest of the evening , and that Peggotty observed her less .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 79]: When we had had our tea , and the ashes were thrown up , and the candles snuffed , I read Peggotty a chapter out of the Crocodile Book , in remembrance of old times -- she took it out of her pocket : I do n't know whether she had kept it there ever since -- and then we talked about Salem House , which brought me round again to Steerforth , who was my great subject .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 35]: We were very happy ; and that evening , as the last of its race , and destined evermore to close that volume of my life , will never pass out of my memory .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 13]: It was almost ten o'clock before we heard the sound of wheels .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 40]: We all got up then ; and my mother said hurriedly that , as it was so late , and Mr. and Miss Murdstone approved of early hours for young people , perhaps I had better go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 17]: I kissed her , and went upstairs with my candle directly , before they came in .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 41]: It appeared to my childish fancy , as I ascended to the bedroom where I had been imprisoned , that they brought a cold blast of air into the house which blew away the old familiar feeling like a feather .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 31]: I felt uncomfortable about going down to breakfast in the morning , as I had never set eyes on Mr. Murdstone since the day when I committed my memorable offence .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 39]: However , as it must be done , I went down , after two or three false starts half-way , and as many runs back on tiptoe to my own room , and presented myself in the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 19]: He was standing before the fire with his back to it , while Miss Murdstone made the tea .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 17]: He looked at me steadily as I entered , but made no sign of recognition whatever .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 23]: I went up to him , after a moment of confusion , and said : ' I beg your pardon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 19]: I am very sorry for what I did , and I hope you will forgive me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 15]: I am glad to hear you are sorry , David , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 12]: The hand he gave me was the hand I had bitten .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 38]: I could not restrain my eye from resting for an instant on a red spot upon it ; but it was not so red as I turned , when I met that sinister expression in his face .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 9]: ` How do you do , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 6]: I said to Miss Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 7]: ` Ah , dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 14]: sighed Miss Murdstone , giving me the tea-caddy scoop instead of her fingers .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 9]: ` How long are the holidays ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 6]: A month , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 6]: ` Counting from when ? '
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 7]: ` From today , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 4]: said Miss Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 9]: ` Then here 's one day off . '
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 24]: She kept a calendar of the holidays in this way , and every morning checked a day off in exactly the same manner .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 32]: She did it gloomily until she came to ten , but when she got into two figures she became more hopeful , and , as the time advanced , even jocular .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 34]: It was on this very first day that I had the misfortune to throw her , though she was not subject to such weakness in general , into a state of violent consternation .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 41]: I came into the room where she and my mother were sitting ; and the baby -LRB- who was only a few weeks old -RRB- being on my mother 's lap , I took it very carefully in my arms .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 14]: Suddenly Miss Murdstone gave such a scream that I all but dropped it .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 6]: ` My dear Jane ! '
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 4]: cried my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 11]: ` Good heavens , Clara , do you see ? '
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 4]: exclaimed Miss Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 9]: ` See what , my dear Jane ? '
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 8]: said my mother ; ` where ? '
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 7]: ` He 's got it ! '
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 4]: cried Miss Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 9]: ` The boy has got the baby ! '
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 24]: She was limp with horror ; but stiffened herself to make a dart at me , and take it out of my arms .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 21]: Then , she turned faint ; and was so very ill that they were obliged to give her cherry brandy .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 56]: I was solemnly interdicted by her , on her recovery , from touching my brother any more on any pretence whatever ; and my poor mother , who , I could see , wished otherwise , meekly confirmed the interdict , by saying : ` No doubt you are right , my dear Jane . '
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 41]: On another occasion , when we three were together , this same dear baby -- it was truly dear to me , for our mother 's sake -- was the innocent occasion of Miss Murdstone 's going into a passion .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 22]: My mother , who had been looking at its eyes as it lay upon her lap , said : ` Davy !
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 4]: come here ! '
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 5]: and looked at mine .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 10]: I saw Miss Murdstone lay her beads down . '
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 16]: I declare , ' said my mother , gently , ` they are exactly alike .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 6]: I suppose they are mine .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 9]: I think they are the colour of mine .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 7]: But they are wonderfully alike . '
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 10]: ` What are you talking about , Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 4]: said Miss Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 37]: ` My dear Jane , ' faltered my mother , a little abashed by the harsh tone of this inquiry , ' I find that the baby 's eyes and Davy 's are exactly alike . '
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 4]: ` Clara ! '
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 16]: said Miss Murdstone , rising angrily , ` you are a positive fool sometimes . '
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 11]: ` My dear Jane , ' remonstrated my mother . '
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 9]: A positive fool , ' said Miss Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 13]: ` Who else could compare my brother 's baby with your boy ?
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 7]: They are not at all alike .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 5]: They are exactly unlike .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 8]: They are utterly dissimilar in all respects .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 8]: I hope they will ever remain so .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 13]: I will not sit here , and hear such comparisons made . '
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 14]: With that she stalked out , and made the door bang after her .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 12]: In short , I was not a favourite with Miss Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 54]: In short , I was not a favourite there with anybody , not even with myself ; for those who did like me could not show it , and those who did not , showed it so plainly that I had a sensitive consciousness of always appearing constrained , boorish , and dull .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 13]: I felt that I made them as uncomfortable as they made me .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 36]: If I came into the room where they were , and they were talking together and my mother seemed cheerful , an anxious cloud would steal over her face from the moment of my entrance .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 13]: If Mr. Murdstone were in his best humour , I checked him .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 12]: If Miss Murdstone were in her worst , I intensified it .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 76]: I had perception enough to know that my mother was the victim always ; that she was afraid to speak to me or to be kind to me , lest she should give them some offence by her manner of doing so , and receive a lecture afterwards ; that she was not only ceaselessly afraid of her own offending , but of my offending , and uneasily watched their looks if I only moved .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 49]: Therefore I resolved to keep myself as much out of their way as I could ; and many a wintry hour did I hear the church clock strike , when I was sitting in my cheerless bedroom , wrapped in my little great-coat , poring over a book .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 16]: In the evening , sometimes , I went and sat with Peggotty in the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 12]: There I was comfortable , and not afraid of being myself .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 12]: But neither of these resources was approved of in the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 11]: The tormenting humour which was dominant there stopped them both .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 30]: I was still held to be necessary to my poor mother 's training , and , as one of her trials , could not be suffered to absent myself .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 38]: ` David , ' said Mr. Murdstone , one day after dinner when I was going to leave the room as usual ; ' I am sorry to observe that you are of a sullen disposition . '
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 8]: ` As sulky as a bear ! '
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 4]: said Miss Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 9]: I stood still , and hung my head .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 25]: ` Now , David , ' said Mr. Murdstone , ' a sullen obdurate disposition is , of all tempers , the worst . '
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 29]: ` And the boy 's is , of all such dispositions that ever I have seen , ' remarked his sister , ` the most confirmed and stubborn .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 15]: I think , my dear Clara , even you must observe it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 40]: I beg your pardon , my dear Jane , ' said my mother , ` but are you quite sure -- I am certain you 'll excuse me , my dear Jane -- that you understand Davy ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 28]: I should be somewhat ashamed of myself , Clara , ' returned Miss Murdstone , ` if I could not understand the boy , or any boy .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 18]: I do n't profess to be profound ; but I do lay claim to common sense . '
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 27]: ` No doubt , my dear Jane , ' returned my mother , ` your understanding is very vigorous -- ' ` Oh dear , no !
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 15]: Pray do n't say that , Clara , ' interposed Miss Murdstone , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 20]: ` But I am sure it is , ' resumed my mother ; ` and everybody knows it is .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 47]: I profit so much by it myself , in many ways -- at least I ought to -- that no one can be more convinced of it than myself ; and therefore I speak with great diffidence , my dear Jane , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 26]: ` We 'll say I do n't understand the boy , Clara , ' returned Miss Murdstone , arranging the little fetters on her wrists .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 18]: ` We 'll agree , if you please , that I do n't understand him at all .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 8]: He is much too deep for me .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 17]: But perhaps my brother 's penetration may enable him to have some insight into his character .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 22]: And I believe my brother was speaking on the subject when we -- not very decently - interrupted him . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 34]: I think , Clara , ' said Mr. Murdstone , in a low grave voice , ` that there may be better and more dispassionate judges of such a question than you . '
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 26]: ` Edward , ' replied my mother , timidly , ` you are a far better judge of all questions than I pretend to be .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 6]: Both you and Jane are .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 18]: I only said -- ' ` You only said something weak and inconsiderate , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 20]: ` Try not to do it again , my dear Clara , and keep a watch upon yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 25]: My mother 's lips moved , as if she answered ` Yes , my dear Edward , ' but she said nothing aloud . '
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 35]: I was sorry , David , I remarked , ' said Mr. Murdstone , turning his head and his eyes stiffly towards me , ` to observe that you are of a sullen disposition .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 21]: This is not a character that I can suffer to develop itself beneath my eyes without an effort at improvement .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 10]: You must endeavour , sir , to change it .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 11]: We must endeavour to change it for you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 12]: I beg your pardon , sir , ' I faltered . '
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 13]: I have never meant to be sullen since I came back . '
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 12]: ` Do n't take refuge in a lie , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 23]: he returned so fiercely , that I saw my mother involuntarily put out her trembling hand as if to interpose between us .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 13]: ` You have withdrawn yourself in your sullenness to your own room .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 14]: You have kept your own room when you ought to have been here .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 20]: You know now , once for all , that I require you to be here , and not there .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 11]: Further , that I require you to bring obedience here .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 6]: You know me , David .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 7]: I will have it done . '
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 8]: Miss Murdstone gave a hoarse chuckle . '
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 29]: I will have a respectful , prompt , and ready bearing towards myself , ' he continued , ` and towards Jane Murdstone , and towards your mother .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 20]: I will not have this room shunned as if it were infected , at the pleasure of a child .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 4]: Sit down . '
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 14]: He ordered me like a dog , and I obeyed like a dog .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 10]: ` One thing more , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 13]: I observe that you have an attachment to low and common company .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 8]: You are not to associate with servants .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 17]: The kitchen will not improve you , in the many respects in which you need improvement .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 46]: Of the woman who abets you , I say nothing -- since you , Clara , ' addressing my mother in a lower voice , ` from old associations and long-established fancies , have a weakness respecting her which is not yet overcome . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 8]: A most unaccountable delusion it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 5]: cried Miss Murdstone . '
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 32]: I only say , ' he resumed , addressing me , ` that I disapprove of your preferring such company as Mistress Peggotty , and that it is to be abandoned .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 27]: Now , David , you understand me , and you know what will be the consequence if you fail to obey me to the letter . '
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 27]: I knew well -- better perhaps than he thought , as far as my poor mother was concerned -- and I obeyed him to the letter .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 35]: I retreated to my own room no more ; I took refuge with Peggotty no more ; but sat wearily in the parlour day after day , looking forward to night , and bedtime .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 68]: What irksome constraint I underwent , sitting in the same attitude hours upon hours , afraid to move an arm or a leg lest Miss Murdstone should complain -LRB- as she did on the least pretence -RRB- of my restlessness , and afraid to move an eye lest she should light on some look of dislike or scrutiny that would find new cause for complaint in mine !
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 82]: What intolerable dulness to sit listening to the ticking of the clock ; and watching Miss Murdstone 's little shiny steel beads as she strung them ; and wondering whether she would ever be married , and if so , to what sort of unhappy man ; and counting the divisions in the moulding of the chimney-piece ; and wandering away , with my eyes , to the ceiling , among the curls and corkscrews in the paper on the wall !
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 63]: What walks I took alone , down muddy lanes , in the bad winter weather , carrying that parlour , and Mr. and Miss Murdstone in it , everywhere : a monstrous load that I was obliged to bear , a daymare that there was no possibility of breaking in , a weight that brooded on my wits , and blunted them !
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 54]: What meals I had in silence and embarrassment , always feeling that there were a knife and fork too many , and that mine ; an appetite too many , and that mine ; a plate and chair too many , and those mine ; a somebody too many , and that I !
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 94]: What evenings , when the candles came , and I was expected to employ myself , but , not daring to read an entertaining book , pored over some hard-headed , harder-hearted treatise on arithmetic ; when the tables of weights and measures set themselves to tunes , as ` Rule Britannia ' , or ` Away with Melancholy ' ; when they would n't stand still to be learnt , but would go threading my grandmother 's needle through my unfortunate head , in at one ear and out at the other !
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 83]: What yawns and dozes I lapsed into , in spite of all my care ; what starts I came out of concealed sleeps with ; what answers I never got , to little observations that I rarely made ; what a blank space I seemed , which everybody overlooked , and yet was in everybody 's way ; what a heavy relief it was to hear Miss Murdstone hail the first stroke of nine at night , and order me to bed !
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 24]: Thus the holidays lagged away , until the morning came when Miss Murdstone said : ` Here 's the last day off ! '
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 12]: and gave me the closing cup of tea of the vacation .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 7]: I was not sorry to go .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 27]: I had lapsed into a stupid state ; but I was recovering a little and looking forward to Steerforth , albeit Mr. Creakle loomed behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 23]: Again Mr. Barkis appeared at the gate , and again Miss Murdstone in her warning voice , said : ` Clara ! '
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 12]: when my mother bent over me , to bid me farewell .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 39]: I kissed her , and my baby brother , and was very sorry then ; but not sorry to go away , for the gulf between us was there , and the parting was there , every day .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 33]: And it is not so much the embrace she gave me , that lives in my mind , though it was as fervent as could be , as what followed the embrace .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 15]: I was in the carrier 's cart when I heard her calling to me .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 24]: I looked out , and she stood at the garden-gate alone , holding her baby up in her arms for me to see .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 36]: It was cold still weather ; and not a hair of her head , nor a fold of her dress , was stirred , as she looked intently at me , holding up her child .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 5]: So I lost her .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 36]: So I saw her afterwards , in my sleep at school -- a silent presence near my bed -- looking at me with the same intent face -- holding up her baby in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 27]: Chapter 9 I have a Memorable Birthday I PASS over all that happened at school , until the anniversary of my birthday came round in March .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 15]: Except that Steerforth was more to be admired than ever , I remember nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 41]: He was going away at the end of the half-year , if not sooner , and was more spirited and independent than before in my eyes , and therefore more engaging than before ; but beyond this I remember nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 27]: The great remembrance by which that time is marked in my mind , seems to have swallowed up all lesser recollections , and to exist alone .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 30]: It is even difficult for me to believe that there was a gap of full two months between my return to Salem House and the arrival of that birthday .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 42]: I can only understand that the fact was so , because I know it must have been so ; otherwise I should feel convinced that there was no interval , and that the one occasion trod upon the other 's heels .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 11]: How well I recollect the kind of day it was !
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 84]: I smell the fog that hung about the place ; I see the hoar frost , ghostly , through it ; I feel my rimy hair fall clammy on my cheek ; I look along the dim perspective of the schoolroom , with a sputtering candle here and there to light up the foggy morning , and the breath of the boys wreathing and smoking in the raw cold as they blow upon their fingers , and tap their feet upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 33]: It was after breakfast , and we had been summoned in from the playground , when Mr. Sharp entered and said : ` David Copperfield is to go into the parlour . '
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 13]: I expected a hamper from Peggotty , and brightened at the order .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 33]: Some of the boys about me put in their claim not to be forgotten in the distribution of the good things , as I got out of my seat with great alacrity .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 12]: ` Do n't hurry , David , ' said Mr. Sharp .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 14]: ` There 's time enough , my boy , do n't hurry . '
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 30]: I might have been surprised by the feeling tone in which he spoke , if I had given it a thought ; but I gave it none until afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 38]: I hurried away to the parlour ; and there I found Mr. Creakle , sitting at his breakfast with the cane and a newspaper before him , and Mrs. Creakle with an opened letter in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 4]: But no hamper .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 22]: ` David Copperfield , ' said Mrs. Creakle , leading me to a sofa , and sitting down beside me . '
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 9]: I want to speak to you very particularly .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 11]: I have something to tell you , my child . '
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 32]: Mr. Creakle , at whom of course I looked , shook his head without looking at me , and stopped up a sigh with a very large piece of buttered toast .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 29]: ` You are too young to know how the world changes every day , ' said Mrs. Creakle , ` and how the people in it pass away .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 37]: But we all have to learn it , David ; some of us when we are young , some of us when we are old , some of us at all times of our lives . '
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 6]: I looked at her earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 30]: ` When you came away from home at the end of the vacation , ' said Mrs. Creakle , after a pause , ` were they all well ? '
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 11]: After another pause , ` Was your mama well ? '
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 20]: I trembled without distinctly knowing why , and still looked at her earnestly , making no attempt to answer .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 25]: ` Because , ' said she , ' I grieve to tell you that I hear this morning your mama is very ill . '
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 21]: A mist rose between Mrs. Creakle and me , and her figure seemed to move in it for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 17]: Then I felt the burning tears run down my face , and it was steady again .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 11]: ` She is very dangerously ill , ' she added .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 5]: I knew all now .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 6]: ` She is dead . '
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 9]: There was no need to tell me so .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 19]: I had already broken out into a desolate cry , and felt an orphan in the wide world .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 7]: She was very kind to me .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 29]: She kept me there all day , and left me alone sometimes ; and I cried , and wore myself to sleep , and awoke and cried again .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 35]: When I could cry no more , I began to think ; and then the oppression on my breast was heaviest , and my grief a dull pain that there was no ease for .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 24]: And yet my thoughts were idle ; not intent on the calamity that weighed upon my heart , but idly loitering near it .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 10]: I thought of our house shut up and hushed .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 31]: I thought of the little baby , who , Mrs. Creakle said , had been pining away for some time , and who , they believed , would die too .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 29]: I thought of my father 's grave in the churchyard , by our house , and of my mother lying there beneath the tree I knew so well .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 30]: I stood upon a chair when I was left alone , and looked into the glass to see how red my eyes were , and how sorrowful my face .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 56]: I considered , after some hours were gone , if my tears were really hard to flow now , as they seemed to be , what , in connexion with my loss , it would affect me most to think of when I drew near home -- for I was going home to the funeral .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 28]: I am sensible of having felt that a dignity attached to me among the rest of the boys , and that I was important in my affliction .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 12]: If ever child were stricken with sincere grief , I was .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 29]: But I remember that this importance was a kind of satisfaction to me , when I walked in the playground that afternoon while the boys were in school .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 33]: When I saw them glancing at me out of the windows , as they went up to their classes , I felt distinguished , and looked more melancholy , and walked slower .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 44]: When school was over , and they came out and spoke to me , I felt it rather good in myself not to be proud to any of them , and to take exactly the same notice of them all , as before .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 39]: I was to go home next night ; not by the mail , but by the heavy night-coach , which was called the Farmer , and was principally used by country-people travelling short intermediate distances upon the road .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 16]: We had no story-telling that evening , and Traddles insisted on lending me his pillow .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 65]: I do n't know what good he thought it would do me , for I had one of my own : but it was all he had to lend , poor fellow , except a sheet of letter-paper full of skeletons ; and that he gave me at parting , as a soother of my sorrows and a contribution to my peace of mind .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 9]: I left Salem House upon the morrow afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 13]: I little thought then that I left it , never to return .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 22]: We travelled very slowly all night , and did not get into Yarmouth before nine or ten o'clock in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 67]: I looked out for Mr. Barkis , but he was not there ; and instead of him a fat , short-winded , merry-looking , little old man in black , with rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees of his breeches , black stockings , and a broad-brimmed hat , came puffing up to the coach window , and said : ` Master Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 35]: ` Will you come with me , young sir , if you please , ' he said , opening the door , ` and I shall have the pleasure of taking you home . '
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 42]: I put my hand in his , wondering who he was , and we walked away to a shop in a narrow street , on which was written OMER , DRAPER , TAILOR , HABERDASHER , FUNERAL FURNISHER , & c .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 29]: It was a close and stifling little shop ; full of all sorts of clothing , made and unmade , including one window full of beaver-hats and bonnets .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 46]: We went into a little back-parlour behind the shop , where we found three young women at work on a quantity of black materials , which were heaped upon the table , and little bits and cuttings of which were littered all over the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 33]: There was a good fire in the room , and a breathless smell of warm black crape -- I did not know what the smell was then , but I know now .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 30]: The three young women , who appeared to be very industrious and comfortable , raised their heads to look at me , and then went on with their work .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 6]: Stitch , stitch , stitch .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 45]: At the same time there came from a workshop across a little yard outside the window , a regular sound of hammering that kept a kind of tune : RAT -- tat-tat , RAT -- tat-tat , RAT -- tat-tat , without any variation .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 15]: ` Well , ' said my conductor to one of the three young women .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 10]: ` How do you get on , Minnie ? '
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 19]: ` We shall be ready by the trying-on time , ' she replied gaily , without looking up .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 10]: ` Do n't you be afraid , father . '
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 14]: Mr. Omer took off his broad-brimmed hat , and sat down and panted .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 23]: He was so fat that he was obliged to pant some time before he could say : ` That 's right . '
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 4]: ` Father ! '
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 5]: said Minnie , playfully .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 9]: ` What a porpoise you do grow ! '
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 23]: ` Well , I do n't know how it is , my dear , ' he replied , considering about it . '
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 6]: I am rather so . '
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 15]: ` You are such a comfortable man , you see , ' said Minnie .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 8]: ` You take things so easy . '
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 15]: ` No use taking 'em otherwise , my dear , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 10]: ` No , indeed , ' returned his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 11]: ` We are all pretty gay here , thank Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 8]: Ai n't we , father ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 12]: I hope so , my dear , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 18]: ` As I have got my breath now , I think I 'll measure this young scholar .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 11]: Would you walk into the shop , Master Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 50]: I preceded Mr. Omer , in compliance with his request ; and after showing me a roll of cloth which he said was extra super , and too good mourning for anything short of parents , he took my various dimensions , and put them down in a book .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 44]: While he was recording them he called my attention to his stock in trade , and to certain fashions which he said had ` just come up ' , and to certain other fashions which he said had ` just gone out ' .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 22]: ` And by that sort of thing we very often lose a little mint of money , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 8]: ` But fashions are like human beings .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 27]: They come in , nobody knows when , why , or how ; and they go out , nobody knows when , why , or how .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 21]: Everything is like life , in my opinion , if you look at it in that point of view . '
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 38]: I was too sorrowful to discuss the question , which would possibly have been beyond me under any circumstances ; and Mr. Omer took me back into the parlour , breathing with some difficulty on the way .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 23]: He then called down a little break-neck range of steps behind a door : ` Bring up that tea and bread-and-butter ! '
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 49]: which , after some time , during which I sat looking about me and thinking , and listening to the stitching in the room and the tune that was being hammered across the yard , appeared on a tray , and turned out to be for me . '
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 55]: I have been acquainted with you , ' said Mr. Omer , after watching me for some minutes , during which I had not made much impression on the breakfast , for the black things destroyed my appetite , ' I have been acquainted with you a long time , my young friend . '
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 7]: ` Have you , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 11]: ` All your life , ' said Mr. Omer . '
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 6]: I may say before it .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 7]: I knew your father before you .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 19]: He was five foot nine and a half , and he lays in five-and-twen-ty foot of ground . '
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 18]: ` RAT -- tat-tat , RAT -- tat-tat , RAT -- tat-tat , ' across the yard .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 25]: ` He lays in five and twen-ty foot of ground , if he lays in a fraction , ' said Mr. Omer , pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 15]: ` It was either his request or her direction , I forget which . '
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 13]: ` Do you know how my little brother is , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 6]: Mr. Omer shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 14]: ` RAT -- tat-tat , RAT -- tat-tat , RAT -- tat-tat . '
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 13]: ` He is in his mother 's arms , ' said he .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 7]: ` Oh , poor little fellow !
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 5]: Is he dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 16]: ` Do n't mind it more than you can help , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 6]: The baby 's dead . '
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 9]: My wounds broke out afresh at this intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 43]: I left the scarcely-tasted breakfast , and went and rested my head on another table , in a corner of the little room , which Minnie hastily cleared , lest I should spot the mourning that was lying there with my tears .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 47]: She was a pretty , good-natured girl , and put my hair away from my eyes with a soft , kind touch ; but she was very cheerful at having nearly finished her work and being in good time , and was so different from me !
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 19]: Presently the tune left off , and a good-looking young fellow came across the yard into the room .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 29]: He had a hammer in his hand , and his mouth was full of little nails , which he was obliged to take out before he could speak .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 6]: ` Well , Joram ! '
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 4]: said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 8]: ` How do you get on ? '
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 8]: ` All right , ' said Joram .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 6]: ` Done , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 15]: Minnie coloured a little , and the other two girls smiled at one another .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 18]: you were at it by candle-light last night , when I was at the club , then ?
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 4]: Were you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 9]: said Mr. Omer , shutting up one eye .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' said Joram .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 31]: ` As you said we could make a little trip of it , and go over together , if it was done , Minnie and me -- and you . '
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 22]: I thought you were going to leave me out altogether , ' said Mr. Omer , laughing till he coughed . '
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 29]: - As you was so good as to say that , ' resumed the young man , ` why I turned to with a will , you see .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 11]: Will you give me your opinion of it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 10]: I will , ' said Mr. Omer , rising .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 32]: ` My dear ' ; and he stopped and turned to me : ` would you like to see your -- ' ` No , father , ' Minnie interposed . '
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 15]: I thought it might be agreeable , my dear , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 8]: ` But perhaps you 're right . '
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 23]: I ca n't say how I knew it was my dear , dear mother 's coffin that they went to look at .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 17]: I had never heard one making ; I had never seen one that I know of .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 36]: - but it came into my mind what the noise was , while it was going on ; and when the young man entered , I am sure I knew what he had been doing .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 42]: The work being now finished , the two girls , whose names I had not heard , brushed the shreds and threads from their dresses , and went into the shop to put that to rights , and wait for customers .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 18]: Minnie stayed behind to fold up what they had made , and pack it in two baskets .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 15]: This she did upon her knees , humming a lively little tune the while .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 56]: Joram , who I had no doubt was her lover , came in and stole a kiss from her while she was busy -LRB- he did n't appear to mind me , at all -RRB- , and said her father was gone for the chaise , and he must make haste and get himself ready .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 61]: Then he went out again ; and then she put her thimble and scissors in her pocket , and stuck a needle threaded with black thread neatly in the bosom of her gown , and put on her outer clothing smartly , at a little glass behind the door , in which I saw the reflection of her pleased face .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 29]: All this I observed , sitting at the table in the corner with my head leaning on my hand , and my thoughts running on very different things .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 31]: The chaise soon came round to the front of the shop , and the baskets being put in first , I was put in next , and those three followed .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 30]: I remember it as a kind of half chaise-cart , half pianoforte-van , painted of a sombre colour , and drawn by a black horse with a long tail .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 9]: There was plenty of room for us all .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 44]: I do not think I have ever experienced so strange a feeling in my life -LRB- I am wiser now , perhaps -RRB- as that of being with them , remembering how they had been employed , and seeing them enjoy the ride .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 31]: I was not angry with them ; I was more afraid of them , as if I were cast away among creatures with whom I had no community of nature .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 5]: They were very cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 51]: The old man sat in front to drive , and the two young people sat behind him , and whenever he spoke to them leaned forward , the one on one side of his chubby face and the other on the other , and made a great deal of him .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 48]: They would have talked to me too , but I held back , and moped in my corner ; scared by their love-making and hilarity , though it was far from boisterous , and almost wondering that no judgement came upon them for their hardness of heart .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 32]: So , when they stopped to bait the horse , and ate and drank and enjoyed themselves , I could touch nothing that they touched , but kept my fast unbroken .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 43]: So , when we reached home , I dropped out of the chaise behind , as quickly as possible , that I might not be in their company before those solemn windows , looking blindly on me like closed eyes once bright .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 45]: And oh , how little need I had had to think what would move me to tears when I came back -- seeing the window of my mother 's room , and next it that which , in the better time , was mine !
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 21]: I was in Peggotty 's arms before I got to the door , and she took me into the house .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 33]: Her grief burst out when she first saw me ; but she controlled it soon , and spoke in whispers , and walked softly , as if the dead could be disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 15]: She had not been in bed , I found , for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 10]: She sat up at night still , and watched .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 21]: As long as her poor dear pretty was above the ground , she said , she would never desert her .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 32]: Mr. Murdstone took no heed of me when I went into the parlour where he was , but sat by the fireside , weeping silently , and pondering in his elbow-chair .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 42]: Miss Murdstone , who was busy at her writing-desk , which was covered with letters and papers , gave me her cold finger-nails , and asked me , in an iron whisper , if I had been measured for my mourning .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 7]: I said : ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 18]: ` And your shirts , ' said Miss Murdstone ; ` have you brought 'em home ? '
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 5]: ` Yes , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 9]: I have brought home all my clothes . '
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 12]: This was all the consolation that her firmness administered to me .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 48]: I do not doubt that she had a choice pleasure in exhibiting what she called her self-command , and her firmness , and her strength of mind , and her common sense , and the whole diabolical catalogue of her unamiable qualities , on such an occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 29]: She was particularly proud of her turn for business ; and she showed it now in reducing everything to pen and ink , and being moved by nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 62]: All the rest of that day , and from morning to night afterwards , she sat at that desk , scratching composedly with a hard pen , speaking in the same imperturbable whisper to everybody ; never relaxing a muscle of her face , or softening a tone of her voice , or appearing with an atom of her dress astray .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 15]: Her brother took a book sometimes , but never read it that I saw .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 40]: He would open it and look at it as if he were reading , but would remain for a whole hour without turning the leaf , and then put it down and walk to and fro in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 19]: I used to sit with folded hands watching him , and counting his footsteps , hour after hour .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 12]: He very seldom spoke to her , and never to me .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 19]: He seemed to be the only restless thing , except the clocks , in the whole motionless house .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 63]: In these days before the funeral , I saw but little of Peggotty , except that , in passing up or down stairs , I always found her close to the room where my mother and her baby lay , and except that she came to me every night , and sat by my bed 's head while I went to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 46]: A day or two before the burial -- I think it was a day or two before , but I am conscious of confusion in my mind about that heavy time , with nothing to mark its progress -- she took me into the room .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 57]: I only recollect that underneath some white covering on the bed , with a beautiful cleanliness and freshness all around it , there seemed to me to lie embodied the solemn stillness that was in the house ; and that when she would have turned the cover gently back , I cried : ` Oh no !
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 4]: oh no ! '
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 5]: and held her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 14]: If the funeral had been yesterday , I could not recollect it better .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 60]: The very air of the best parlour , when I went in at the door , the bright condition of the fire , the shining of the wine in the decanters , the patterns of the glasses and plates , the faint sweet smell of cake , the odour of Miss Murdstone 's dress , and our black clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 14]: Mr. Chillip is in the room , and comes to speak to me .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 8]: ` And how is Master David ? '
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 5]: he says , kindly .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 8]: I can not tell him very well .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 12]: I give him my hand , which he holds in his .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 14]: says Mr. Chillip , meekly smiling , with something shining in his eye .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 9]: ` Our little friends grow up around us .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 10]: They grow out of our knowledge , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 11]: This is to Miss Murdstone , who makes no reply .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 11]: ` There is a great improvement here , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 4]: says Mr. Chillip .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 34]: Miss Murdstone merely answers with a frown and a formal bend : Mr. Chillip , discomfited , goes into a corner , keeping me with him , and opens his mouth no more .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 26]: I remark this , because I remark everything that happens , not because I care about myself , or have done since I came home .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 19]: And now the bell begins to sound , and Mr. Omer and another come to make us ready .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 28]: As Peggotty was wont to tell me , long ago , the followers of my father to the same grave were made ready in the same room .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 16]: There are Mr. Murdstone , our neighbour Mr. Grayper , Mr. Chillip , and I .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 56]: When we go out to the door , the Bearers and their load are in the garden ; and they move before us down the path , and past the elms , and through the gate , and into the churchyard , where I have so often heard the birds sing on a summer morning .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 6]: We stand around the grave .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 25]: The day seems different to me from every other day , and the light not of the same colour -- of a sadder colour .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 64]: Now there is a solemn hush , which we have brought from home with what is resting in the mould ; and while we stand bareheaded , I hear the voice of the clergyman , sounding remote in the open air , and yet distinct and plain , saying : ' I am the Resurrection and the Life , saith the Lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 54]: Then I hear sobs ; and , standing apart among the lookers-on , I see that good and faithful servant , whom of all the people upon earth I love the best , and unto whom my childish heart is certain that the Lord will one day say : ` Well done . '
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 45]: There are many faces that I know , among the little crowd ; faces that I knew in church , when mine was always wondering there ; faces that first saw my mother , when she came to the village in her youthful bloom .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 49]: I do not mind them -- I mind nothing but my grief - and yet I see and know them all ; and even in the background , far away , see Minnie looking on , and her eye glancing on her sweetheart , who is near me .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 18]: It is over , and the earth is filled in , and we turn to come away .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 39]: Before us stands our house , so pretty and unchanged , so linked in my mind with the young idea of what is gone , that all my sorrow has been nothing to the sorrow it calls forth .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 48]: But they take me on ; and Mr. Chillip talks to me ; and when we get home , puts some water to my lips ; and when I ask his leave to go up to my room , dismisses me with the gentleness of a woman .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 11]: All this , I say , is yesterday 's event .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 29]: Events of later date have floated from me to the shore where all forgotten things will reappear , but this stands like a high rock in the ocean .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 12]: I knew that Peggotty would come to me in my room .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 14]: The Sabbath stillness of the time -LRB- the day was so like Sunday !
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 11]: I have forgotten that -RRB- was suited to us both .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 58]: She sat down by my side upon my little bed ; and holding my hand , and sometimes putting it to her lips , and sometimes smoothing it with hers , as she might have comforted my little brother , told me , in her way , all that she had to tell concerning what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 16]: ` She was never well , ' said Peggotty , ` for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 11]: She was uncertain in her mind , and not happy .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 28]: When her baby was born , I thought at first she would get better , but she was more delicate , and sunk a little every day .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 55]: She used to like to sit alone before her baby came , and then she cried ; but afterwards she used to sing to it -- so soft , that I once thought , when I heard her , it was like a voice up in the air , that was rising away . '
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 28]: I think she got to be more timid , and more frightened-like , of late ; and that a hard word was like a blow to her .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 9]: But she was always the same to me .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 15]: She never changed to her foolish Peggotty , did n't my sweet girl . '
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 14]: Here Peggotty stopped , and softly beat upon my hand a little while .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 25]: ` The last time that I saw her like her own old self , was the night when you came home , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 21]: The day you went away , she said to me , `` I never shall see my pretty darling again .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 14]: Something tells me so , that tells the truth , I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 38]: ` She tried to hold up after that ; and many a time , when they told her she was thoughtless and light-hearted , made believe to be so ; but it was all a bygone then .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 53]: She never told her husband what she had told me -- she was afraid of saying it to anybody else -- till one night , a little more than a week before it happened , when she said to him : `` My dear , I think I am dying . '' '
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 25]: `` It 's off my mind now , Peggotty , '' she told me , when I laid her in her bed that night .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 28]: `` He will believe it more and more , poor fellow , every day for a few days to come ; and then it will be past .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 5]: I am very tired .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 17]: If this is sleep , sit by me while I sleep : do n't leave me .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 6]: God bless both my children !
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 10]: God protect and keep my fatherless boy ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 10]: I never left her afterwards , ' said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 60]: ` She often talked to them two downstairs -- for she loved them ; she could n't bear not to love anyone who was about her -- but when they went away from her bed-side , she always turned to me , as if there was rest where Peggotty was , and never fell asleep in any other way .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 42]: ` On the last night , in the evening , she kissed me , and said : `` If my baby should die too , Peggotty , please let them lay him in my arms , and bury us together . ''
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 17]: -LRB- It was done ; for the poor lamb lived but a day beyond her . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 41]: `` Let my dearest boy go with us to our resting-place , '' she said , `` and tell him that his mother , when she lay here , blessed him not once , but a thousand times . '' '
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 13]: Another silence followed this , and another gentle beating on my hand .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 39]: ` It was pretty far in the night , ' said Peggotty , ` when she asked me for some drink ; and when she had taken it , gave me such a patient smile , the dear !
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 4]: -- so beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 67]: ` Daybreak had come , and the sun was rising , when she said to me , how kind and considerate Mr. Copperfield had always been to her , and how he had borne with her , and told her , when she doubted herself , that a loving heart was better and stronger than wisdom , and that he was a happy man in hers .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 25]: `` Peggotty , my dear , '' she said then , `` put me nearer to you , '' for she was very weak .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 37]: `` Lay your good arm underneath my neck , '' she said , `` and turn me to you , for your face is going far off , and I want it to be near . ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 11]: I put it as she asked ; and oh Davy !
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 45]: the time had come when my first parting words to you were true -- when she was glad to lay her poor head on her stupid cross old Peggotty 's arm -- and she died like a child that had gone to sleep ! '
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 6]: Thus ended Peggotty 's narration .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 28]: From the moment of my knowing of the death of my mother , the idea of her as she had been of late had vanished from me .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 44]: I remembered her , from that instant , only as the young mother of my earliest impressions , who had been used to wind her bright curls round and round her finger , and to dance with me at twilight in the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 29]: What Peggotty had told me now , was so far from bringing me back to the later period , that it rooted the earlier image in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 10]: It may be curious , but it is true .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 20]: In her death she winged her way back to her calm untroubled youth , and cancelled all the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 38]: The mother who lay in the grave , was the mother of my infancy ; the little creature in her arms , was myself , as I had once been , hushed for ever on her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 45]: Chapter 10 I Become Neglected , and Am Provided for The first act of business Miss Murdstone performed when the day of the solemnity was over , and light was freely admitted into the house , was to give Peggotty a month 's warning .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 30]: Much as Peggotty would have disliked such a service , I believe she would have retained it , for my sake , in preference to the best upon earth .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 23]: She told me we must part , and told me why ; and we condoled with one another , in all sincerity .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 18]: As to me or my future , not a word was said , or a step taken .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 23]: Happy they would have been , I dare say , if they could have dismissed me at a month 's warning too .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 32]: I mustered courage once , to ask Miss Murdstone when I was going back to school ; and she answered dryly , she believed I was not going back at all .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 6]: I was told nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 34]: I was very anxious to know what was going to be done with me , and so was Peggotty ; but neither she nor I could pick up any information on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 44]: There was one change in my condition , which , while it relieved me of a great deal of present uneasiness , might have made me , if I had been capable of considering it closely , yet more uncomfortable about the future .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 4]: It was this .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 13]: The constraint that had been put upon me , was quite abandoned .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 37]: I was so far from being required to keep my dull post in the parlour , that on several occasions , when I took my seat there , Miss Murdstone frowned to me to go away .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 33]: I was so far from being warned off from Peggotty 's society , that , provided I was not in Mr. Murdstone 's , I was never sought out or inquired for .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 48]: At first I was in daily dread of his taking my education in hand again , or of Miss Murdstone 's devoting herself to it ; but I soon began to think that such fears were groundless , and that all I had to anticipate was neglect .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 13]: I do not conceive that this discovery gave me much pain then .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 26]: I was still giddy with the shock of my mother 's death , and in a kind of stunned state as to all tributary things .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 124]: I can recollect , indeed , to have speculated , at odd times , on the possibility of my not being taught any more , or cared for any more ; and growing up to be a shabby , moody man , lounging an idle life away , about the village ; as well as on the feasibility of my getting rid of this picture by going away somewhere , like the hero in a story , to seek my fortune : but these were transient visions , daydreams I sat looking at sometimes , as if they were faintly painted or written on the wall of my room , and which , as they melted away , left the wall blank again .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 36]: ` Peggotty , ' I said in a thoughtful whisper , one evening , when I was warming my hands at the kitchen fire , ` Mr. Murdstone likes me less than he used to .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 25]: He never liked me much , Peggotty ; but he would rather not even see me now , if he can help it . '
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 16]: ` Perhaps it 's his sorrow , ' said Peggotty , stroking my hair . '
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 11]: I am sure , Peggotty , I am sorry too .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 17]: If I believed it was his sorrow , I should not think of it at all .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 16]: But it 's not that ; oh , no , it 's not that . '
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 11]: ` How do you know it 's not that ? '
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 7]: said Peggotty , after a silence .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 13]: ` Oh , his sorrow is another and quite a different thing .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 32]: He is sorry at this moment , sitting by the fireside with Miss Murdstone ; but if I was to go in , Peggotty , he would be something besides . '
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 7]: ` What would he be ? '
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 3]: said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 16]: ` Angry , ' I answered , with an involuntary imitation of his dark frown .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 17]: ` If he was only sorry , he would n't look at me as he does .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 13]: I am only sorry , and it makes me feel kinder . '
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 19]: Peggotty said nothing for a little while ; and I warmed my hands , as silent as she .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 9]: ` Davy , ' she said at length .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 7]: ` Yes , Peggotty ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 53]: I have tried , my dear , all ways I could think of -- all the ways there are , and all the ways there ai n't , in short -- to get a suitable service here , in Blunderstone ; but there 's no such a thing , my love . '
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 17]: ` And what do you mean to do , Peggotty , ' says I , wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 13]: ` Do you mean to go and seek your fortune ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 21]: I expect I shall be forced to go to Yarmouth , ' replied Peggotty , ` and live there . '
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 24]: ` You might have gone farther off , ' I said , brightening a little , ` and been as bad as lost .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 13]: I shall see you sometimes , my dear old Peggotty , there .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 17]: You wo n't be quite at the other end of the world , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 8]: ` Contrary ways , please God ! '
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 7]: cried Peggotty , with great animation .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 24]: ` As long as you are here , my pet , I shall come over every week of my life to see you .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 10]: One day , every week of my life ! '
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 70]: I felt a great weight taken off my mind by this promise : but even this was not all , for Peggotty went on to say : ` I 'm a-going , Davy , you see , to my brother 's , first , for another fortnight 's visit -- just till I have had time to look about me , and get to be something like myself again .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 30]: Now , I have been thinking that perhaps , as they do n't want you here at present , you might be let to go along with me . '
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 41]: If anything , short of being in a different relation to every one about me , Peggotty excepted , could have given me a sense of pleasure at that time , it would have been this project of all others .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 85]: The idea of being again surrounded by those honest faces , shining welcome on me ; of renewing the peacefulness of the sweet Sunday morning , when the bells were ringing , the stones dropping in the water , and the shadowy ships breaking through the mist ; of roaming up and down with little Em ` ly , telling her my troubles , and finding charms against them in the shells and pebbles on the beach ; made a calm in my heart .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 66]: It was ruffled next moment , to be sure , by a doubt of Miss Murdstone 's giving her consent ; but even that was set at rest soon , for she came out to take an evening grope in the store-closet while we were yet in conversation , and Peggotty , with a boldness that amazed me , broached the topic on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 28]: ` The boy will be idle there , ' said Miss Murdstone , looking into a pickle-jar , ` and idleness is the root of all evil .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 20]: But , to be sure , he would be idle here -- or anywhere , in my opinion . '
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 23]: Peggotty had an angry answer ready , I could see ; but she swallowed it for my sake , and remained silent .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 39]: said Miss Murdstone , still keeping her eye on the pickles ; ` it is of more importance than anything else -- it is of paramount importance -- that my brother should not be disturbed or made uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 9]: I suppose I had better say yes . '
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 21]: I thanked her , without making any demonstration of joy , lest it should induce her to withdraw her assent .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 37]: Nor could I help thinking this a prudent course , since she looked at me out of the pickle-jar , with as great an access of sourness as if her black eyes had absorbed its contents .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 27]: However , the permission was given , and was never retracted ; for when the month was out , Peggotty and I were ready to depart .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 11]: Mr. Barkis came into the house for Peggotty 's boxes .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 21]: I had never known him to pass the garden-gate before , but on this occasion he came into the house .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 40]: And he gave me a look as he shouldered the largest box and went out , which I thought had meaning in it , if meaning could ever be said to find its way into Mr. Barkis 's visage .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 37]: Peggotty was naturally in low spirits at leaving what had been her home so many years , and where the two strong attachments of her life -- for my mother and myself -- had been formed .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 31]: She had been walking in the churchyard , too , very early ; and she got into the cart , and sat in it with her handkerchief at her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 18]: So long as she remained in this condition , Mr. Barkis gave no sign of life whatever .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 14]: He sat in his usual place and attitude like a great stuffed figure .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 24]: But when she began to look about her , and to speak to me , he nodded his head and grinned several times .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 16]: I have not the least notion at whom , or what he meant by it .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 11]: ` It 's a beautiful day , Mr. Barkis ! '
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 9]: I said , as an act of politeness .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 22]: ` It ai n't bad , ' said Mr. Barkis , who generally qualified his speech , and rarely committed himself .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 18]: ` Peggotty is quite comfortable now , Mr. Barkis , ' I remarked , for his satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 7]: ` Is she , though ? '
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 4]: said Mr. Barkis .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 25]: After reflecting about it , with a sagacious air , Mr. Barkis eyed her , and said : ` ARE you pretty comfortable ? '
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 9]: Peggotty laughed , and answered in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 9]: ` But really and truly , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 4]: Are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 19]: growled Mr. Barkis , sliding nearer to her on the seat , and nudging her with his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 4]: ` Are you ?
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 6]: Really and truly pretty comfortable ?
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 3]: Are you ?
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 3]: Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 47]: At each of these inquiries Mr. Barkis shuffled nearer to her , and gave her another nudge ; so that at last we were all crowded together in the left-hand corner of the cart , and I was so squeezed that I could hardly bear it .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 25]: Peggotty calling his attention to my sufferings , Mr. Barkis gave me a little more room at once , and got away by degrees .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 38]: But I could not help observing that he seemed to think he had hit upon a wonderful expedient for expressing himself in a neat , agreeable , and pointed manner , without the inconvenience of inventing conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 9]: He manifestly chuckled over it for some time .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 20]: By and by he turned to Peggotty again , and repeating , ` Are you pretty comfortable though ? '
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 18]: bore down upon us as before , until the breath was nearly edged out of my body .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 19]: By and by he made another descent upon us with the same inquiry , and the same result .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 32]: At length , I got up whenever I saw him coming , and standing on the foot-board , pretended to look at the prospect ; after which I did very well .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 25]: He was so polite as to stop at a public-house , expressly on our account , and entertain us with broiled mutton and beer .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 24]: Even when Peggotty was in the act of drinking , he was seized with one of those approaches , and almost choked her .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 51]: But as we drew nearer to the end of our journey , he had more to do and less time for gallantry ; and when we got on Yarmouth pavement , we were all too much shaken and jolted , I apprehend , to have any leisure for anything else .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 12]: Mr. Peggotty and Ham waited for us at the old place .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 53]: They received me and Peggotty in an affectionate manner , and shook hands with Mr. Barkis , who , with his hat on the very back of his head , and a shame-faced leer upon his countenance , and pervading his very legs , presented but a vacant appearance , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 34]: They each took one of Peggotty 's trunks , and we were going away , when Mr. Barkis solemnly made a sign to me with his forefinger to come under an archway . '
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 15]: I say , ' growled Mr. Barkis , ` it was all right . '
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 22]: I looked up into his face , and answered , with an attempt to be very profound : ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 18]: ` It did n't come to a end there , ' said Mr. Barkis , nodding confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 7]: ` It was all right . '
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 8]: Again I answered , ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 13]: ` You know who was willin ' , ' said my friend .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 10]: ` It was Barkis , and Barkis only . '
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 4]: I nodded assent .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 24]: ` It 's all right , ' said Mr. Barkis , shaking hands ; ` I 'm a friend of your ` n .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 8]: You made it all right , first .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 6]: It 's all right . '
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 60]: In his attempts to be particularly lucid , Mr. Barkis was so extremely mysterious , that I might have stood looking in his face for an hour , and most assuredly should have got as much information out of it as out of the face of a clock that had stopped , but for Peggotty 's calling me away .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 26]: As we were going along , she asked me what he had said ; and I told her he had said it was all right .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 17]: ` Like his impudence , ' said Peggotty , ` but I do n't mind that !
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 17]: Davy dear , what should you think if I was to think of being married ? '
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 21]: ` Why -- I suppose you would like me as much then , Peggotty , as you do now ? '
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 8]: I returned , after a little consideration .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 43]: Greatly to the astonishment of the passengers in the street , as well as of her relations going on before , the good soul was obliged to stop and embrace me on the spot , with many protestations of her unalterable love .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 11]: ` Tell me what should you say , darling ? '
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 15]: she asked again , when this was over , and we were walking on .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 16]: ` If you were thinking of being married -- to Mr. Barkis , Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' said Peggotty . '
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 11]: I should think it would be a very good thing .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 36]: For then you know , Peggotty , you would always have the horse and cart to bring you over to see me , and could come for nothing , and be sure of coming . '
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 8]: ` The sense of the dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 3]: cried Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 12]: ` What I have been thinking of , this month back !
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 40]: Yes , my precious ; and I think I should be more independent altogether , you see ; let alone my working with a better heart in my own house , than I could in anybody else 's now .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 20]: I do n't know what I might be fit for , now , as a servant to a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 49]: And I shall be always near my pretty 's resting-place , ' said Peggotty , musing , ` and be able to see it when I like ; and when I lie down to rest , I may be laid not far off from my darling girl ! '
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 11]: We neither of us said anything for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 52]: ` But I would n't so much as give it another thought , ' said Peggotty , cheerily ` if my Davy was anyways against it -- not if I had been asked in church thirty times three times over , and was wearing out the ring in my pocket . '
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 29]: ` Look at me , Peggotty , ' I replied ; ` and see if I am not really glad , and do n't truly wish it ! '
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 10]: As indeed I did , with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 70]: ` Well , my life , ' said Peggotty , giving me a squeeze , ' I have thought of it night and day , every way I can , and I hope the right way ; but I 'll think of it again , and speak to my brother about it , and in the meantime we 'll keep it to ourselves , Davy , you and me .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 49]: Barkis is a good plain creature , ' said Peggotty , ` and if I tried to do my duty by him , I think it would be my fault if I was n't -- if I was n't pretty comfortable , ' said Peggotty , laughing heartily .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 41]: This quotation from Mr. Barkis was so appropriate , and tickled us both so much , that we laughed again and again , and were quite in a pleasant humour when we came within view of Mr. Peggotty 's cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 38]: It looked just the same , except that it may , perhaps , have shrunk a little in my eyes ; and Mrs. Gummidge was waiting at the door as if she had stood there ever since .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 18]: All within was the same , down to the seaweed in the blue mug in my bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 47]: I went into the out-house to look about me ; and the very same lobsters , crabs , and crawfish possessed by the same desire to pinch the world in general , appeared to be in the same state of conglomeration in the same old corner .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 21]: But there was no little Em ` ly to be seen , so I asked Mr. Peggotty where she was .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 51]: ` She 's at school , sir , ' said Mr. Peggotty , wiping the heat consequent on the porterage of Peggotty 's box from his forehead ; ` she 'll be home , ' looking at the Dutch clock , ` in from twenty minutes to half-an-hour 's time .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 14]: We all on us feel the loss of her , bless ye ! '
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 4]: Mrs. Gummidge moaned .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 7]: ` Cheer up , Mawther ! '
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 5]: cried Mr. Peggotty . '
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 42]: I feel it more than anybody else , ' said Mrs. Gummidge ; ` I 'm a lone lorn creetur ' , and she used to be a ` most the only thing that did n't go contrary with me . '
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 16]: Mrs. Gummidge , whimpering and shaking her head , applied herself to blowing the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 33]: Mr. Peggotty , looking round upon us while she was so engaged , said in a low voice , which he shaded with his hand : ` The old ` un ! '
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 24]: From this I rightly conjectured that no improvement had taken place since my last visit in the state of Mrs. Gummidge 's spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 33]: Now , the whole place was , or it should have been , quite as delightful a place as ever ; and yet it did not impress me in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 7]: I felt rather disappointed with it .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 13]: Perhaps it was because little Em ` ly was not at home .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 22]: I knew the way by which she would come , and presently found myself strolling along the path to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 34]: A figure appeared in the distance before long , and I soon knew it to be Em ` ly , who was a little creature still in stature , though she was grown .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 60]: But when she drew nearer , and I saw her blue eyes looking bluer , and her dimpled face looking brighter , and her whole self prettier and gayer , a curious feeling came over me that made me pretend not to know her , and pass by as if I were looking at something a long way off .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 16]: I have done such a thing since in later life , or I am mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 10]: Little Em ` ly did n't care a bit .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 20]: She saw me well enough ; but instead of turning round and calling after me , ran away laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 25]: This obliged me to run after her , and she ran so fast that we were very near the cottage before I caught her .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 11]: ` Oh , it 's you , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 6]: said little Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 27]: ` Why , you knew who it was , Em ` ly , ' said I. ` And did n't YOU know who it was ? '
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 5]: said Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 39]: I was going to kiss her , but she covered her cherry lips with her hands , and said she was n't a baby now , and ran away , laughing more than ever , into the house .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 20]: She seemed to delight in teasing me , which was a change in her I wondered at very much .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 66]: The tea table was ready , and our little locker was put out in its old place , but instead of coming to sit by me , she went and bestowed her company upon that grumbling Mrs. Gummidge : and on Mr. Peggotty 's inquiring why , rumpled her hair all over her face to hide it , and could do nothing but laugh . '
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 8]: A little puss , it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 11]: said Mr. Peggotty , patting her with his great hand .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 6]: ` So sh ' is !
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 6]: so sh ' is ! '
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 3]: cried Ham .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 14]: ` Mas ' r Davy bor ' , so sh ' is ! '
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 28]: and he sat and chuckled at her for some time , in a state of mingled admiration and delight , that made his face a burning red .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 43]: Little Em ` ly was spoiled by them all , in fact ; and by no one more than Mr. Peggotty himself , whom she could have coaxed into anything , by only going and laying her cheek against his rough whisker .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 27]: That was my opinion , at least , when I saw her do it ; and I held Mr. Peggotty to be thoroughly in the right .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 31]: But she was so affectionate and sweet-natured , and had such a pleasant manner of being both sly and shy at once , that she captivated me more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 61]: She was tender-hearted , too ; for when , as we sat round the fire after tea , an allusion was made by Mr. Peggotty over his pipe to the loss I had sustained , the tears stood in her eyes , and she looked at me so kindly across the table , that I felt quite thankful to her .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 29]: said Mr. Peggotty , taking up her curls , and running them over his hand like water , ` here 's another orphan , you see , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 33]: And here , ' said Mr. Peggotty , giving Ham a backhanded knock in the chest , ` is another of 'em , though he do n't look much like it . '
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 33]: ` If I had you for my guardian , Mr. Peggotty , ' said I , shaking my head , ' I do n't think I should FEEL much like it . '
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 12]: ` Well said , Mas ' r Davy bor ' ! '
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 7]: cried Ham , in an ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 3]: ` Hoorah !
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 3]: Well said !
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 6]: Nor more you would n't !
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 2]: Hor !
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 3]: Hor ! '
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 21]: -- Here he returned Mr. Peggotty 's back-hander , and little Em ` ly got up and kissed Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 10]: ` And how 's your friend , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 6]: said Mr. Peggotty to me .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 4]: ` Steerforth ? '
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 9]: said I. ` That 's the name ! '
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 9]: cried Mr. Peggotty , turning to Ham . '
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 10]: I knowed it was something in our way . '
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 13]: ` You said it was Rudderford , ' observed Ham , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 4]: retorted Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 12]: ` And ye steer with a rudder , do n't ye ?
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 6]: It ai n't fur off .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 7]: How is he , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 15]: ` He was very well indeed when I came away , Mr. Peggotty . '
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 7]: ` There 's a friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 9]: said Mr. Peggotty , stretching out his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 12]: ` There 's a friend , if you talk of friends !
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 20]: Why , Lord love my heart alive , if it ai n't a treat to look at him ! '
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 11]: ` He is very handsome , is he not ? '
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 10]: said I , my heart warming with this praise .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 4]: ` Handsome ! '
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 4]: cried Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 26]: ` He stands up to you like -- like a -- why I do n't know what he do n't stand up to you like .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 6]: He 's so bold ! '
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 3]: ` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 32]: That 's just his character , ' said I. ` He 's as brave as a lion , and you ca n't think how frank he is , Mr. Peggotty . '
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 43]: ` And I do suppose , now , ' said Mr. Peggotty , looking at me through the smoke of his pipe , ` that in the way of book-larning he 'd take the wind out of a ` most anything . '
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 14]: ` Yes , ' said I , delighted ; ` he knows everything .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 6]: He is astonishingly clever . '
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 7]: ` There 's a friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 12]: murmured Mr. Peggotty , with a grave toss of his head .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 24]: ` Nothing seems to cost him any trouble , ' said I. ` He knows a task if he only looks at it .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 9]: He is the best cricketer you ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 20]: He will give you almost as many men as you like at draughts , and beat you easily . '
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 21]: Mr. Peggotty gave his head another toss , as much as to say : ` Of course he will . '
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 40]: ` He is such a speaker , ' I pursued , ` that he can win anybody over ; and I do n't know what you 'd say if you were to hear him sing , Mr. Peggotty . '
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 23]: Mr. Peggotty gave his head another toss , as much as to say : ' I have no doubt of it . '
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 42]: ` Then , he 's such a generous , fine , noble fellow , ' said I , quite carried away by my favourite theme , ` that it 's hardly possible to give him as much praise as he deserves .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 31]: I am sure I can never feel thankful enough for the generosity with which he has protected me , so much younger and lower in the school than himself . '
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 54]: I was running on , very fast indeed , when my eyes rested on little Em ` ly 's face , which was bent forward over the table , listening with the deepest attention , her breath held , her blue eyes sparkling like jewels , and the colour mantling in her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 39]: She looked so extraordinarily earnest and pretty , that I stopped in a sort of wonder ; and they all observed her at the same time , for as I stopped , they laughed and looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 20]: 'Em ` ly is like me , ' said Peggotty , ` and would like to see him . '
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 25]: Em ` ly was confused by our all observing her , and hung down her head , and her face was covered with blushes .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 49]: Glancing up presently through her stray curls , and seeing that we were all looking at her still -LRB- I am sure I , for one , could have looked at her for hours -RRB- , she ran away , and kept away till it was nearly bedtime .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 30]: I lay down in the old little bed in the stern of the boat , and the wind came moaning on across the flat as it had done before .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 58]: But I could not help fancying , now , that it moaned of those who were gone ; and instead of thinking that the sea might rise in the night and float the boat away , I thought of the sea that had risen , since I last heard those sounds , and drowned my happy home .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 43]: I recollect , as the wind and water began to sound fainter in my ears , putting a short clause into my prayers , petitioning that I might grow up to marry little Em ` ly , and so dropping lovingly asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 33]: The days passed pretty much as they had passed before , except -- it was a great exception - that little Em ` ly and I seldom wandered on the beach now .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 22]: She had tasks to learn , and needle-work to do ; and was absent during a great part of each day .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 20]: But I felt that we should not have had those old wanderings , even if it had been otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 24]: Wild and full of childish whims as Em ` ly was , she was more of a little woman than I had supposed .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 19]: She seemed to have got a great distance away from me , in little more than a year .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 40]: She liked me , but she laughed at me , and tormented me ; and when I went to meet her , stole home another way , and was laughing at the door when I came back , disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 29]: The best times were when she sat quietly at work in the doorway , and I sat on the wooden step at her feet , reading to her .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 68]: It seems to me , at this hour , that I have never seen such sunlight as on those bright April afternoons ; that I have never seen such a sunny little figure as I used to see , sitting in the doorway of the old boat ; that I have never beheld such sky , such water , such glorified ships sailing away into golden air .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 32]: On the very first evening after our arrival , Mr. Barkis appeared in an exceedingly vacant and awkward condition , and with a bundle of oranges tied up in a handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 50]: As he made no allusion of any kind to this property , he was supposed to have left it behind him by accident when he went away ; until Ham , running after him to restore it , came back with the information that it was intended for Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 38]: After that occasion he appeared every evening at exactly the same hour , and always with a little bundle , to which he never alluded , and which he regularly put behind the door and left there .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 13]: These offerings of affection were of a most various and eccentric description .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 52]: Among them I remember a double set of pigs ' trotters , a huge pin-cushion , half a bushel or so of apples , a pair of jet earrings , some Spanish onions , a box of dominoes , a canary bird and cage , and a leg of pickled pork .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 17]: Mr. Barkis 's wooing , as I remember it , was altogether of a peculiar kind .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 34]: He very seldom said anything ; but would sit by the fire in much the same attitude as he sat in his cart , and stare heavily at Peggotty , who was opposite .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 39]: One night , being , as I suppose , inspired by love , he made a dart at the bit of wax-candle she kept for her thread , and put it in his waistcoat-pocket and carried it off .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 39]: After that , his great delight was to produce it when it was wanted , sticking to the lining of his pocket , in a partially melted state , and pocket it again when it was done with .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 19]: He seemed to enjoy himself very much , and not to feel at all called upon to talk .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 63]: Even when he took Peggotty out for a walk on the flats , he had no uneasiness on that head , I believe ; contenting himself with now and then asking her if she was pretty comfortable ; and I remember that sometimes , after he was gone , Peggotty would throw her apron over her face , and laugh for half-an-hour .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 42]: Indeed , we were all more or less amused , except that miserable Mrs. Gummidge , whose courtship would appear to have been of an exactly parallel nature , she was so continually reminded by these transactions of the old one .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 45]: At length , when the term of my visit was nearly expired , it was given out that Peggotty and Mr. Barkis were going to make a day 's holiday together , and that little Em ` ly and I were to accompany them .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 24]: I had but a broken sleep the night before , in anticipation of the pleasure of a whole day with Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 34]: We were all astir betimes in the morning ; and while we were yet at breakfast , Mr. Barkis appeared in the distance , driving a chaise-cart towards the object of his affections .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 68]: Peggotty was dressed as usual , in her neat and quiet mourning ; but Mr. Barkis bloomed in a new blue coat , of which the tailor had given him such good measure , that the cuffs would have rendered gloves unnecessary in the coldest weather , while the collar was so high that it pushed his hair up on end on the top of his head .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 12]: His bright buttons , too , were of the largest size .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 19]: Rendered complete by drab pantaloons and a buff waistcoat , I thought Mr. Barkis a phenomenon of respectability .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 44]: When we were all in a bustle outside the door , I found that Mr. Peggotty was prepared with an old shoe , which was to be thrown after us for luck , and which he offered to Mrs. Gummidge for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 18]: It had better be done by somebody else , Dan ` l , ' said Mrs. Gummidge .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 31]: ` I 'm a lone lorn creetur ' myself , and everythink that reminds me of creetur 's that ai n't lone and lorn , goes contrary with me . '
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 7]: ` Come , old gal ! '
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 4]: cried Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 7]: ` Take and heave it . '
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 18]: ` No , Dan ` l , ' returned Mrs. Gummidge , whimpering and shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 11]: ` If I felt less , I could do more .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 32]: You do n't feel like me , Dan ` l ; thinks do n't go contrary with you , nor you with them ; you had better do it yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 58]: But here Peggotty , who had been going about from one to another in a hurried way , kissing everybody , called out from the cart , in which we all were by this time -LRB- Em ` ly and I on two little chairs , side by side -RRB- , that Mrs. Gummidge must do it .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 62]: So Mrs. Gummidge did it ; and , I am sorry to relate , cast a damp upon the festive character of our departure , by immediately bursting into tears , and sinking subdued into the arms of Ham , with the declaration that she knowed she was a burden , and had better be carried to the House at once .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 16]: Which I really thought was a sensible idea , that Ham might have acted on .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 52]: Away we went , however , on our holiday excursion ; and the first thing we did was to stop at a church , where Mr. Barkis tied the horse to some rails , and went in with Peggotty , leaving little Em ` ly and me alone in the chaise .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 46]: I took that occasion to put my arm round Em ` ly 's waist , and propose that as I was going away so very soon now , we should determine to be very affectionate to one another , and very happy , all day .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 48]: Little Em ` ly consenting , and allowing me to kiss her , I became desperate ; informing her , I recollect , that I never could love another , and that I was prepared to shed the blood of anybody who should aspire to her affections .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 11]: How merry little Em ` ly made herself about it !
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 53]: With what a demure assumption of being immensely older and wiser than I , the fairy little woman said I was ' a silly boy ' ; and then laughed so charmingly that I forgot the pain of being called by that disparaging name , in the pleasure of looking at her .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 27]: Mr. Barkis and Peggotty were a good while in the church , but came out at last , and then we drove away into the country .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 51]: As we were going along , Mr. Barkis turned to me , and said , with a wink , -- by the by , I should hardly have thought , before , that he could wink : ` What name was it as I wrote up in the cart ? '
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 8]: ` Clara Peggotty , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 21]: ` What name would it be as I should write up now , if there was a tilt here ? '
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 7]: ` Clara Peggotty , again ? '
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 3]: I suggested .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 6]: ` Clara Peggotty BARKIS ! '
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 15]: he returned , and burst into a roar of laughter that shook the chaise .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 19]: In a word , they were married , and had gone into the church for no other purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 28]: Peggotty was resolved that it should be quietly done ; and the clerk had given her away , and there had been no witnesses of the ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 46]: She was a little confused when Mr. Barkis made this abrupt announcement of their union , and could not hug me enough in token of her unimpaired affection ; but she soon became herself again , and said she was very glad it was over .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 32]: We drove to a little inn in a by-road , where we were expected , and where we had a very comfortable dinner , and passed the day with great satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 80]: If Peggotty had been married every day for the last ten years , she could hardly have been more at her ease about it ; it made no sort of difference in her : she was just the same as ever , and went out for a stroll with little Em ` ly and me before tea , while Mr. Barkis philosophically smoked his pipe , and enjoyed himself , I suppose , with the contemplation of his happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 61]: If so , it sharpened his appetite ; for I distinctly call to mind that , although he had eaten a good deal of pork and greens at dinner , and had finished off with a fowl or two , he was obliged to have cold boiled bacon for tea , and disposed of a large quantity without any emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 22]: I have often thought , since , what an odd , innocent , out-of-the-way kind of wedding it must have been !
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 26]: We got into the chaise again soon after dark , and drove cosily back , looking up at the stars , and talking about them .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 17]: I was their chief exponent , and opened Mr. Barkis 's mind to an amazing extent .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 66]: I told him all I knew , but he would have believed anything I might have taken it into my head to impart to him ; for he had a profound veneration for my abilities , and informed his wife in my hearing , on that very occasion , that I was ' a young Roeshus ' -- by which I think he meant prodigy .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 48]: When we had exhausted the subject of the stars , or rather when I had exhausted the mental faculties of Mr. Barkis , little Em ` ly and I made a cloak of an old wrapper , and sat under it for the rest of the journey .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 7]: Ah , how I loved her !
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 76]: What happiness -LRB- I thought -RRB- if we were married , and were going away anywhere to live among the trees and in the fields , never growing older , never growing wiser , children ever , rambling hand in hand through sunshine and among flowery meadows , laying down our heads on moss at night , in a sweet sleep of purity and peace , and buried by the birds when we were dead !
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 35]: Some such picture , with no real world in it , bright with the light of our innocence , and vague as the stars afar off , was in my mind all the way .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 24]: I am glad to think there were two such guileless hearts at Peggotty 's marriage as little Em ` ly 's and mine .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 18]: I am glad to think the Loves and Graces took such airy forms in its homely procession .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 34]: Well , we came to the old boat again in good time at night ; and there Mr. and Mrs. Barkis bade us good-bye , and drove away snugly to their own home .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 15]: I felt then , for the first time , that I had lost Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 26]: I should have gone to bed with a sore heart indeed under any other roof but that which sheltered little Em ` ly 's head .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 31]: Mr. Peggotty and Ham knew what was in my thoughts as well as I did , and were ready with some supper and their hospitable faces to drive it away .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 33]: Little Em ` ly came and sat beside me on the locker for the only time in all that visit ; and it was altogether a wonderful close to a wonderful day .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 23]: It was a night tide ; and soon after we went to bed , Mr. Peggotty and Ham went out to fish .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 57]: I felt very brave at being left alone in the solitary house , the protector of Em ` ly and Mrs. Gummidge , and only wished that a lion or a serpent , or any ill-disposed monster , would make an attack upon us , that I might destroy him , and cover myself with glory .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 31]: But as nothing of the sort happened to be walking about on Yarmouth flats that night , I provided the best substitute I could by dreaming of dragons until morning .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 32]: With morning came Peggotty ; who called to me , as usual , under my window as if Mr. Barkis the carrier had been from first to last a dream too .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 18]: After breakfast she took me to her own home , and a beautiful little home it was .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 63]: Of all the moveables in it , I must have been impressed by a certain old bureau of some dark wood in the parlour -LRB- the tile-floored kitchen was the general sitting-room -RRB- , with a retreating top which opened , let down , and became a desk , within which was a large quarto edition of Foxe 's Book of Martyrs .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 61]: This precious volume , of which I do not recollect one word , I immediately discovered and immediately applied myself to ; and I never visited the house afterwards , but I kneeled on a chair , opened the casket where this gem was enshrined , spread my arms over the desk , and fell to devouring the book afresh .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 45]: I was chiefly edified , I am afraid , by the pictures , which were numerous , and represented all kinds of dismal horrors ; but the Martyrs and Peggotty 's house have been inseparable in my mind ever since , and are now .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 75]: I took leave of Mr. Peggotty , and Ham , and Mrs. Gummidge , and little Em ` ly , that day ; and passed the night at Peggotty 's , in a little room in the roof -LRB- with the Crocodile Book on a shelf by the bed 's head -RRB- which was to be always mine , Peggotty said , and should always be kept for me in exactly the same state .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 40]: ` Young or old , Davy dear , as long as I am alive and have this house over my head , ' said Peggotty , ` you shall find it as if I expected you here directly minute .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 49]: I shall keep it every day , as I used to keep your old little room , my darling ; and if you was to go to China , you might think of it as being kept just the same , all the time you were away . '
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 26]: I felt the truth and constancy of my dear old nurse , with all my heart , and thanked her as well as I could .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 50]: That was not very well , for she spoke to me thus , with her arms round my neck , in the morning , and I was going home in the morning , and I went home in the morning , with herself and Mr. Barkis in the cart .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 60]: They left me at the gate , not easily or lightly ; and it was a strange sight to me to see the cart go on , taking Peggotty away , and leaving me under the old elm-trees looking at the house , in which there was no face to look on mine with love or liking any more .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 20]: And now I fell into a state of neglect , which I can not look back upon without compassion .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 53]: I fell at once into a solitary condition , - apart from all friendly notice , apart from the society of all other boys of my own age , apart from all companionship but my own spiritless thoughts , -- which seems to cast its gloom upon this paper as I write .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 19]: What would I have given , to have been sent to the hardest school that ever was kept !
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 11]: -- to have been taught something , anyhow , anywhere !
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 7]: No such hope dawned upon me .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 15]: They disliked me ; and they sullenly , sternly , steadily , overlooked me .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 21]: I think Mr. Murdstone 's means were straitened at about this time ; but it is little to the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 35]: He could not bear me ; and in putting me from him he tried , as I believe , to put away the notion that I had any claim upon him -- and succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 6]: I was not actively ill-used .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 32]: I was not beaten , or starved ; but the wrong that was done to me had no intervals of relenting , and was done in a systematic , passionless manner .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 17]: Day after day , week after week , month after month , I was coldly neglected .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 54]: I wonder sometimes , when I think of it , what they would have done if I had been taken with an illness ; whether I should have lain down in my lonely room , and languished through it in my usual solitary way , or whether anybody would have helped me out .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 27]: When Mr. and Miss Murdstone were at home , I took my meals with them ; in their absence , I ate and drank by myself .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 39]: At all times I lounged about the house and neighbourhood quite disregarded , except that they were jealous of my making any friends : thinking , perhaps , that if I did , I might complain to someone .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 104]: For this reason , though Mr. Chillip often asked me to go and see him -LRB- he was a widower , having , some years before that , lost a little small light-haired wife , whom I can just remember connecting in my own thoughts with a pale tortoise-shell cat -RRB- , it was but seldom that I enjoyed the happiness of passing an afternoon in his closet of a surgery ; reading some book that was new to me , with the smell of the whole Pharmacopoeia coming up my nose , or pounding something in a mortar under his mild directions .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 23]: For the same reason , added no doubt to the old dislike of her , I was seldom allowed to visit Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 50]: Faithful to her promise , she either came to see me , or met me somewhere near , once every week , and never empty-handed ; but many and bitter were the disappointments I had , in being refused permission to pay a visit to her at her house .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 69]: Some few times , however , at long intervals , I was allowed to go there ; and then I found out that Mr. Barkis was something of a miser , or as Peggotty dutifully expressed it , was ' a little near ' , and kept a heap of money in a box under his bed , which he pretended was only full of coats and trousers .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 49]: In this coffer , his riches hid themselves with such a tenacious modesty , that the smallest instalments could only be tempted out by artifice ; so that Peggotty had to prepare a long and elaborate scheme , a very Gunpowder Plot , for every Saturday 's expenses .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 43]: All this time I was so conscious of the waste of any promise I had given , and of my being utterly neglected , that I should have been perfectly miserable , I have no doubt , but for the old books .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 34]: They were my only comfort ; and I was as true to them as they were to me , and read them over and over I do n't know how many times more .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 47]: I now approach a period of my life , which I can never lose the remembrance of , while I remember anything : and the recollection of which has often , without my invocation , come before me like a ghost , and haunted happier times .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 46]: I had been out , one day , loitering somewhere , in the listless , meditative manner that my way of life engendered , when , turning the corner of a lane near our house , I came upon Mr. Murdstone walking with a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 18]: I was confused , and was going by them , when the gentleman cried : ` What !
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 3]: Brooks ! '
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 12]: ` No , sir , David Copperfield , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 6]: ` Do n't tell me .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 9]: You are Brooks , ' said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 7]: ` You are Brooks of Sheffield .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 6]: That 's your name . '
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 11]: At these words , I observed the gentleman more attentively .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 42]: His laugh coming to my remembrance too , I knew him to be Mr. Quinion , whom I had gone over to Lowestoft with Mr. Murdstone to see , before - it is no matter -- I need not recall when .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 18]: ` And how do you get on , and where are you being educated , Brooks ? '
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 4]: said Mr. Quinion .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 19]: He had put his hand upon my shoulder , and turned me about , to walk with them .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 15]: I did not know what to reply , and glanced dubiously at Mr. Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 13]: ` He is at home at present , ' said the latter .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 8]: ` He is not being educated anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 10]: I do n't know what to do with him .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 7]: He is a difficult subject . '
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 31]: That old , double look was on me for a moment ; and then his eyes darkened with a frown , as it turned , in its aversion , elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 12]: said Mr. Quinion , looking at us both , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 5]: ` Fine weather ! '
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 37]: Silence ensued , and I was considering how I could best disengage my shoulder from his hand , and go away , when he said : ' I suppose you are a pretty sharp fellow still ?
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 5]: Eh , Brooks ? '
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 3]: ` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 12]: He is sharp enough , ' said Mr. Murdstone , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 8]: ` You had better let him go .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 10]: He will not thank you for troubling him . '
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 19]: On this hint , Mr. Quinion released me , and I made the best of my way home .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 29]: Looking back as I turned into the front garden , I saw Mr. Murdstone leaning against the wicket of the churchyard , and Mr. Quinion talking to him .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 17]: They were both looking after me , and I felt that they were speaking of me .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 9]: Mr. Quinion lay at our house that night .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 29]: After breakfast , the next morning , I had put my chair away , and was going out of the room , when Mr. Murdstone called me back .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 17]: He then gravely repaired to another table , where his sister sat herself at her desk .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 24]: Mr. Quinion , with his hands in his pockets , stood looking out of window ; and I stood looking at them all .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 27]: ` David , ' said Mr. Murdstone , ` to the young this is a world for action ; not for moping and droning in . '
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 11]: - ` As you do , ' added his sister .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 13]: ` Jane Murdstone , leave it to me , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 23]: I say , David , to the young this is a world for action , and not for moping and droning in .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 52]: It is especially so for a young boy of your disposition , which requires a great deal of correcting ; and to which no greater service can be done than to force it to conform to the ways of the working world , and to bend it and break it . '
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 22]: ` For stubbornness wo n't do here , ' said his sister ` What it wants is , to be crushed .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 6]: And crushed it must be .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 6]: Shall be , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 32]: He gave her a look , half in remonstrance , half in approval , and went on : ' I suppose you know , David , that I am not rich .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 9]: At any rate , you know it now .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 8]: You have received some considerable education already .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 37]: Education is costly ; and even if it were not , and I could afford it , I am of opinion that it would not be at all advantageous to you to be kept at school .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 23]: What is before you , is a fight with the world ; and the sooner you begin it , the better . '
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 29]: I think it occurred to me that I had already begun it , in my poor way : but it occurs to me now , whether or no .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 16]: ` You have heard the `` counting-house '' mentioned sometimes , ' said Mr. Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 7]: ` The counting-house , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 3]: I repeated .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 15]: ` Of Murdstone and Grinby , in the wine trade , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 41]: I suppose I looked uncertain , for he went on hastily : ` You have heard the `` counting-house '' mentioned , or the business , or the cellars , or the wharf , or something about it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 28]: I think I have heard the business mentioned , sir , ' I said , remembering what I vaguely knew of his and his sister 's resources .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 9]: ` But I do n't know when . '
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 11]: ` It does not matter when , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 8]: ` Mr. Quinion manages that business . '
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 14]: I glanced at the latter deferentially as he stood looking out of window .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 35]: ` Mr. Quinion suggests that it gives employment to some other boys , and that he sees no reason why it should n't , on the same terms , give employment to you . '
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 26]: ` He having , ' Mr. Quinion observed in a low voice , and half turning round , ` no other prospect , Murdstone . '
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 44]: Mr. Murdstone , with an impatient , even an angry gesture , resumed , without noticing what he had said : ` Those terms are , that you will earn enough for yourself to provide for your eating and drinking , and pocket-money .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 15]: Your lodging -LRB- which I have arranged for -RRB- will be paid by me .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 22]: So will your washing -- ' ' - Which will be kept down to my estimate , ' said his sister .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 34]: ` Your clothes will be looked after for you , too , ' said Mr. Murdstone ; ` as you will not be able , yet awhile , to get them for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 24]: So you are now going to London , David , with Mr. Quinion , to begin the world on your own account . '
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 24]: ` In short , you are provided for , ' observed his sister ; ` and will please to do your duty . '
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 29]: Though I quite understood that the purpose of this announcement was to get rid of me , I have no distinct remembrance whether it pleased or frightened me .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 26]: My impression is , that I was in a state of confusion about it , and , oscillating between the two points , touched neither .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 22]: Nor had I much time for the clearing of my thoughts , as Mr. Quinion was to go upon the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 61]: Behold me , on the morrow , in a much-worn little white hat , with a black crape round it for my mother , a black jacket , and a pair of hard , stiff corduroy trousers -- which Miss Murdstone considered the best armour for the legs in that fight with the world which was now to come off .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 48]: behold me so attired , and with my little worldly all before me in a small trunk , sitting , a lone lorn child -LRB- as Mrs. Gummidge might have said -RRB- , in the post-chaise that was carrying Mr. Quinion to the London coach at Yarmouth !
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 44]: See , how our house and church are lessening in the distance ; how the grave beneath the tree is blotted out by intervening objects ; how the spire points upwards from my old playground no more , and the sky is empty !
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 63]: Chapter 11 I Begin Life on My Own Account , and Do n't Like it I know enough of the world now , to have almost lost the capacity of being much surprised by anything ; but it is matter of some surprise to me , even now , that I can have been so easily thrown away at such an age .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 42]: A child of excellent abilities , and with strong powers of observation , quick , eager , delicate , and soon hurt bodily or mentally , it seems wonderful to me that nobody should have made any sign in my behalf .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 26]: But none was made ; and I became , at ten years old , a little labouring hind in the service of Murdstone and Grinby .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 10]: Murdstone and Grinby 's warehouse was at the waterside .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 6]: It was down in Blackfriars .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 40]: Modern improvements have altered the place ; but it was the last house at the bottom of a narrow street , curving down hill to the river , with some stairs at the end , where people took boat .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 39]: It was a crazy old house with a wharf of its own , abutting on the water when the tide was in , and on the mud when the tide was out , and literally overrun with rats .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 67]: Its panelled rooms , discoloured with the dirt and smoke of a hundred years , I dare say ; its decaying floors and staircase ; the squeaking and scuffling of the old grey rats down in the cellars ; and the dirt and rottenness of the place ; are things , not of many years ago , in my mind , but of the present instant .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 33]: They are all before me , just as they were in the evil hour when I went among them for the first time , with my trembling hand in Mr. Quinion 's .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 32]: Murdstone and Grinby 's trade was among a good many kinds of people , but an important branch of it was the supply of wines and spirits to certain packet ships .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 27]: I forget now where they chiefly went , but I think there were some among them that made voyages both to the East and West Indies .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 46]: I know that a great many empty bottles were one of the consequences of this traffic , and that certain men and boys were employed to examine them against the light , and reject those that were flawed , and to rinse and wash them .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 43]: When the empty bottles ran short , there were labels to be pasted on full ones , or corks to be fitted to them , or seals to be put upon the corks , or finished bottles to be packed in casks .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 18]: All this work was my work , and of the boys employed upon it I was one .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 11]: There were three or four of us , counting me .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 47]: My working place was established in a corner of the warehouse , where Mr. Quinion could see me , when he chose to stand up on the bottom rail of his stool in the counting-house , and look at me through a window above the desk .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 31]: Hither , on the first morning of my so auspiciously beginning life on my own account , the oldest of the regular boys was summoned to show me my business .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 17]: His name was Mick Walker , and he wore a ragged apron and a paper cap .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 26]: He informed me that his father was a bargeman , and walked , in a black velvet head-dress , in the Lord Mayor 's Show .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 27]: He also informed me that our principal associate would be another boy whom he introduced by the -- to me -- extraordinary name of Mealy Potatoes .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 40]: I discovered , however , that this youth had not been christened by that name , but that it had been bestowed upon him in the warehouse , on account of his complexion , which was pale or mealy .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 49]: Mealy 's father was a waterman , who had the additional distinction of being a fireman , and was engaged as such at one of the large theatres ; where some young relation of Mealy 's -- I think his little sister -- did Imps in the Pantomimes .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 64]: No words can express the secret agony of my soul as I sunk into this companionship ; compared these henceforth everyday associates with those of my happier childhood -- not to say with Steerforth , Traddles , and the rest of those boys ; and felt my hopes of growing up to be a learned and distinguished man , crushed in my bosom .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 85]: The deep remembrance of the sense I had , of being utterly without hope now ; of the shame I felt in my position ; of the misery it was to my young heart to believe that day by day what I had learned , and thought , and delighted in , and raised my fancy and my emulation up by , would pass away from me , little by little , never to be brought back any more ; can not be written .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 50]: As often as Mick Walker went away in the course of that forenoon , I mingled my tears with the water in which I was washing the bottles ; and sobbed as if there were a flaw in my own breast , and it were in danger of bursting .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 36]: The counting-house clock was at half past twelve , and there was general preparation for going to dinner , when Mr. Quinion tapped at the counting-house window , and beckoned to me to go in .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 62]: I went in , and found there a stoutish , middle-aged person , in a brown surtout and black tights and shoes , with no more hair upon his head -LRB- which was a large one , and very shining -RRB- than there is upon an egg , and with a very extensive face , which he turned full upon me .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 13]: His clothes were shabby , but he had an imposing shirt-collar on .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 52]: He carried a jaunty sort of a stick , with a large pair of rusty tassels to it ; and a quizzing-glass hung outside his coat , -- for ornament , I afterwards found , as he very seldom looked through it , and could n't see anything when he did .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 18]: ` This , ' said Mr. Quinion , in allusion to myself , ` is he . '
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 38]: ` This , ' said the stranger , with a certain condescending roll in his voice , and a certain indescribable air of doing something genteel , which impressed me very much , ` is Master Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 10]: I hope I see you well , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 12]: I said I was very well , and hoped he was .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 41]: I was sufficiently ill at ease , Heaven knows ; but it was not in my nature to complain much at that time of my life , so I said I was very well , and hoped he was . '
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 15]: I am , ' said the stranger , ` thank Heaven , quite well .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 98]: I have received a letter from Mr. Murdstone , in which he mentions that he would desire me to receive into an apartment in the rear of my house , which is at present unoccupied -- and is , in short , to be let as a -- in short , ' said the stranger , with a smile and in a burst of confidence , ` as a bedroom -- the young beginner whom I have now the pleasure to -- ' and the stranger waved his hand , and settled his chin in his shirt-collar .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 13]: ` This is Mr. Micawber , ' said Mr. Quinion to me .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 4]: ` Ahem ! '
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 11]: said the stranger , ` that is my name . '
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 16]: ` Mr. Micawber , ' said Mr. Quinion , ` is known to Mr. Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 14]: He takes orders for us on commission , when he can get any .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 26]: He has been written to by Mr. Murdstone , on the subject of your lodgings , and he will receive you as a lodger . '
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 17]: ` My address , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` is Windsor Terrace , City Road .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 29]: I -- in short , ' said Mr. Micawber , with the same genteel air , and in another burst of confidence -- ' I live there . '
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 6]: I made him a bow .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 90]: ` Under the impression , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` that your peregrinations in this metropolis have not as yet been extensive , and that you might have some difficulty in penetrating the arcana of the Modern Babylon in the direction of the City Road , -- in short , ' said Mr. Micawber , in another burst of confidence , ` that you might lose yourself -- I shall be happy to call this evening , and install you in the knowledge of the nearest way . '
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 21]: I thanked him with all my heart , for it was friendly in him to offer to take that trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 25]: ` At what hour , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` shall I -- ' ` At about eight , ' said Mr. Quinion .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 11]: ` At about eight , ' said Mr. Micawber . '
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 11]: I beg to wish you good day , Mr. Quinion .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 7]: I will intrude no longer . '
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 32]: So he put on his hat , and went out with his cane under his arm : very upright , and humming a tune when he was clear of the counting-house .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 34]: Mr. Quinion then formally engaged me to be as useful as I could in the warehouse of Murdstone and Grinby , at a salary , I think , of six shillings a week .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 11]: I am not clear whether it was six or seven .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 23]: I am inclined to believe , from my uncertainty on this head , that it was six at first and seven afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 48]: He paid me a week down -LRB- from his own pocket , I believe -RRB- , and I gave Mealy sixpence out of it to get my trunk carried to Windsor Terrace that night : it being too heavy for my strength , small as it was .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 38]: I paid sixpence more for my dinner , which was a meat pie and a turn at a neighbouring pump ; and passed the hour which was allowed for that meal , in walking about the streets .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 12]: At the appointed time in the evening , Mr. Micawber reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 70]: I washed my hands and face , to do the greater honour to his gentility , and we walked to our house , as I suppose I must now call it , together ; Mr. Micawber impressing the name of streets , and the shapes of corner houses upon me , as we went along , that I might find my way back , easily , in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 81]: Arrived at this house in Windsor Terrace -LRB- which I noticed was shabby like himself , but also , like himself , made all the show it could -RRB- , he presented me to Mrs. Micawber , a thin and faded lady , not at all young , who was sitting in the parlour -LRB- the first floor was altogether unfurnished , and the blinds were kept down to delude the neighbours -RRB- , with a baby at her breast .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 38]: This baby was one of twins ; and I may remark here that I hardly ever , in all my experience of the family , saw both the twins detached from Mrs. Micawber at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 8]: One of them was always taking refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 21]: There were two other children ; Master Micawber , aged about four , and Miss Micawber , aged about three .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 56]: These , and a dark-complexioned young woman , with a habit of snorting , who was servant to the family , and informed me , before half an hour had expired , that she was ' a Orfling ' , and came from St. Luke 's workhouse , in the neighbourhood , completed the establishment .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 40]: My room was at the top of the house , at the back : a close chamber ; stencilled all over with an ornament which my young imagination represented as a blue muffin ; and very scantily furnished . '
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 57]: I never thought , ' said Mrs. Micawber , when she came up , twin and all , to show me the apartment , and sat down to take breath , ` before I was married , when I lived with papa and mama , that I should ever find it necessary to take a lodger .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 17]: But Mr. Micawber being in difficulties , all considerations of private feeling must give way . '
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 9]: I said : ` Yes , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 34]: ` Mr. Micawber 's difficulties are almost overwhelming just at present , ' said Mrs. Micawber ; ` and whether it is possible to bring him through them , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 44]: When I lived at home with papa and mama , I really should have hardly understood what the word meant , in the sense in which I now employ it , but experientia does it , -- as papa used to say . '
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 27]: I can not satisfy myself whether she told me that Mr. Micawber had been an officer in the Marines , or whether I have imagined it .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 24]: I only know that I believe to this hour that he WAS in the Marines once upon a time , without knowing why .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 28]: He was a sort of town traveller for a number of miscellaneous houses , now ; but made little or nothing of it , I am afraid .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 36]: ` If Mr. Micawber 's creditors will not give him time , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` they must take the consequences ; and the sooner they bring it to an issue the better .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 30]: Blood can not be obtained from a stone , neither can anything on account be obtained at present -LRB- not to mention law expenses -RRB- from Mr. Micawber . '
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 70]: I never can quite understand whether my precocious self-dependence confused Mrs. Micawber in reference to my age , or whether she was so full of the subject that she would have talked about it to the very twins if there had been nobody else to communicate with , but this was the strain in which she began , and she went on accordingly all the time I knew her .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 4]: Poor Mrs. Micawber !
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 20]: She said she had tried to exert herself , and so , I have no doubt , she had .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 71]: The centre of the street door was perfectly covered with a great brass-plate , on which was engraved ` Mrs. Micawber 's Boarding Establishment for Young Ladies ' : but I never found that any young lady had ever been to school there ; or that any young lady ever came , or proposed to come ; or that the least preparation was ever made to receive any young lady .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 14]: The only visitors I ever saw , or heard of , were creditors .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 16]: THEY used to come at all hours , and some of them were quite ferocious .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 39]: One dirty-faced man , I think he was a boot-maker , used to edge himself into the passage as early as seven o'clock in the morning , and call up the stairs to Mr. Micawber -- ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 9]: You ai n't out yet , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 6]: Pay us , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 11]: Do n't hide , you know ; that 's mean .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 10]: I would n't be mean if I was you .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 6]: Pay us , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 8]: You just pay us , d'ye hear ?
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 59]: Receiving no answer to these taunts , he would mount in his wrath to the words ` swindlers ' and ` robbers ' ; and these being ineffectual too , would sometimes go to the extremity of crossing the street , and roaring up at the windows of the second floor , where he knew Mr. Micawber was .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 72]: At these times , Mr. Micawber would be transported with grief and mortification , even to the length -LRB- as I was once made aware by a scream from his wife -RRB- of making motions at himself with a razor ; but within half-an-hour afterwards , he would polish up his shoes with extraordinary pains , and go out , humming a tune with a greater air of gentility than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 7]: Mrs. Micawber was quite as elastic .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 48]: I have known her to be thrown into fainting fits by the king 's taxes at three o'clock , and to eat lamb chops , breaded , and drink warm ale -LRB- paid for with two tea-spoons that had gone to the pawnbroker 's -RRB- at four .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 93]: On one occasion , when an execution had just been put in , coming home through some chance as early as six o'clock , I saw her lying -LRB- of course with a twin -RRB- under the grate in a swoon , with her hair all torn about her face ; but I never knew her more cheerful than she was , that very same night , over a veal cutlet before the kitchen fire , telling me stories about her papa and mama , and the company they used to keep .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 15]: In this house , and with this family , I passed my leisure time .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 18]: My own exclusive breakfast of a penny loaf and a pennyworth of milk , I provided myself .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 33]: I kept another small loaf , and a modicum of cheese , on a particular shelf of a particular cupboard , to make my supper on when I came back at night .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 37]: This made a hole in the six or seven shillings , I know well ; and I was out at the warehouse all day , and had to support myself on that money all the week .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 49]: From Monday morning until Saturday night , I had no advice , no counsel , no encouragement , no consolation , no assistance , no support , of any kind , from anyone , that I can call to mind , as I hope to go to heaven !
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 18]: I was so young and childish , and so little qualified -- how could I be otherwise ?
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 59]: -- to undertake the whole charge of my own existence , that often , in going to Murdstone and Grinby 's , of a morning , I could not resist the stale pastry put out for sale at half-price at the pastrycooks ' doors , and spent in that the money I should have kept for my dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 18]: Then , I went without my dinner , or bought a roll or a slice of pudding .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 17]: I remember two pudding shops , between which I was divided , according to my finances .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 26]: One was in a court close to St. Martin 's Church -- at the back of the church , -- which is now removed altogether .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 33]: The pudding at that shop was made of currants , and was rather a special pudding , but was dear , twopennyworth not being larger than a pennyworth of more ordinary pudding .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 21]: A good shop for the latter was in the Strand -- somewhere in that part which has been rebuilt since .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 27]: It was a stout pale pudding , heavy and flabby , and with great flat raisins in it , stuck in whole at wide distances apart .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 21]: It came up hot at about my time every day , and many a day did I dine off it .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 68]: When I dined regularly and handsomely , I had a saveloy and a penny loaf , or a fourpenny plate of red beef from a cook 's shop ; or a plate of bread and cheese and a glass of beer , from a miserable old public-house opposite our place of business , called the Lion , or the Lion and something else that I have forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 60]: Once , I remember carrying my own bread -LRB- which I had brought from home in the morning -RRB- under my arm , wrapped in a piece of paper , like a book , and going to a famous alamode beef-house near Drury Lane , and ordering a ` small plate ' of that delicacy to eat with it .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 45]: What the waiter thought of such a strange little apparition coming in all alone , I do n't know ; but I can see him now , staring at me as I ate my dinner , and bringing up the other waiter to look .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 17]: I gave him a halfpenny for himself , and I wish he had n't taken it .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 10]: We had half-an-hour , I think , for tea .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 22]: When I had money enough , I used to get half-a-pint of ready-made coffee and a slice of bread and butter .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 40]: When I had none , I used to look at a venison shop in Fleet Street ; or I have strolled , at such a time , as far as Covent Garden Market , and stared at the pineapples .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 21]: I was fond of wandering about the Adelphi , because it was a mysterious place , with those dark arches .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 45]: I see myself emerging one evening from some of these arches , on a little public-house close to the river , with an open space before it , where some coal-heavers were dancing ; to look at whom I sat down upon a bench .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 8]: I wonder what they thought of me !
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 47]: I was such a child , and so little , that frequently when I went into the bar of a strange public-house for a glass of ale or porter , to moisten what I had had for dinner , they were afraid to give it me .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 35]: I remember one hot evening I went into the bar of a public-house , and said to the landlord : ` What is your best -- your very best -- ale a glass ? '
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 7]: For it was a special occasion .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 6]: I do n't know what .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 7]: It may have been my birthday .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 19]: ` Twopence-halfpenny , ' says the landlord , ` is the price of the Genuine Stunning ale . '
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 34]: ` Then , ' says I , producing the money , ` just draw me a glass of the Genuine Stunning , if you please , with a good head to it . '
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 42]: The landlord looked at me in return over the bar , from head to foot , with a strange smile on his face ; and instead of drawing the beer , looked round the screen and said something to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 21]: She came out from behind it , with her work in her hand , and joined him in surveying me .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 11]: Here we stand , all three , before me now .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 36]: The landlord in his shirt-sleeves , leaning against the bar window-frame ; his wife looking over the little half-door ; and I , in some confusion , looking up at them from outside the partition .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 35]: They asked me a good many questions ; as , what my name was , how old I was , where I lived , how I was employed , and how I came there .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 21]: To all of which , that I might commit nobody , I invented , I am afraid , appropriate answers .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 64]: They served me with the ale , though I suspect it was not the Genuine Stunning ; and the landlord 's wife , opening the little half-door of the bar , and bending down , gave me my money back , and gave me a kiss that was half admiring and half compassionate , but all womanly and good , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 23]: I know I do not exaggerate , unconsciously and unintentionally , the scantiness of my resources or the difficulties of my life .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 26]: I know that if a shilling were given me by Mr. Quinion at any time , I spent it in a dinner or a tea .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 21]: I know that I worked , from morning until night , with common men and boys , a shabby child .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 14]: I know that I lounged about the streets , insufficiently and unsatisfactorily fed .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 34]: I know that , but for the mercy of God , I might easily have been , for any care that was taken of me , a little robber or a little vagabond .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 12]: Yet I held some station at Murdstone and Grinby 's too .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 67]: Besides that Mr. Quinion did what a careless man so occupied , and dealing with a thing so anomalous , could , to treat me as one upon a different footing from the rest , I never said , to man or boy , how it was that I came to be there , or gave the least indication of being sorry that I was there .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 39]: That I suffered in secret , and that I suffered exquisitely , no one ever knew but I. How much I suffered , it is , as I have said already , utterly beyond my power to tell .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 13]: But I kept my own counsel , and I did my work .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 33]: I knew from the first , that , if I could not do my work as well as any of the rest , I could not hold myself above slight and contempt .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 17]: I soon became at least as expeditious and as skilful as either of the other boys .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 22]: Though perfectly familiar with them , my conduct and manner were different enough from theirs to place a space between us .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 22]: They and the men generally spoke of me as ` the little gent ' , or ` the young Suffolker . '
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 83]: A certain man named Gregory , who was foreman of the packers , and another named Tipp , who was the carman , and wore a red jacket , used to address me sometimes as ` David ' : but I think it was mostly when we were very confidential , and when I had made some efforts to entertain them , over our work , with some results of the old readings ; which were fast perishing out of my remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 22]: Mealy Potatoes uprose once , and rebelled against my being so distinguished ; but Mick Walker settled him in no time .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 20]: My rescue from this kind of existence I considered quite hopeless , and abandoned , as such , altogether .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 58]: I am solemnly convinced that I never for one hour was reconciled to it , or was otherwise than miserably unhappy ; but I bore it ; and even to Peggotty , partly for the love of her and partly for shame , never in any letter -LRB- though many passed between us -RRB- revealed the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 15]: Mr. Micawber 's difficulties were an addition to the distressed state of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 40]: In my forlorn state I became quite attached to the family , and used to walk about , busy with Mrs. Micawber 's calculations of ways and means , and heavy with the weight of Mr. Micawber 's debts .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 96]: On a Saturday night , which was my grand treat , - partly because it was a great thing to walk home with six or seven shillings in my pocket , looking into the shops and thinking what such a sum would buy , and partly because I went home early , -- Mrs. Micawber would make the most heart-rending confidences to me ; also on a Sunday morning , when I mixed the portion of tea or coffee I had bought over-night , in a little shaving-pot , and sat late at my breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 40]: It was nothing at all unusual for Mr. Micawber to sob violently at the beginning of one of these Saturday night conversations , and sing about jack 's delight being his lovely Nan , towards the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 57]: I have known him come home to supper with a flood of tears , and a declaration that nothing was now left but a jail ; and go to bed making a calculation of the expense of putting bow-windows to the house , ` in case anything turned up ' , which was his favourite expression .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 8]: And Mrs. Micawber was just the same .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 32]: A curious equality of friendship , originating , I suppose , in our respective circumstances , sprung up between me and these people , notwithstanding the ludicrous disparity in our years .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 56]: But I never allowed myself to be prevailed upon to accept any invitation to eat and drink with them out of their stock -LRB- knowing that they got on badly with the butcher and baker , and had often not too much for themselves -RRB- , until Mrs. Micawber took me into her entire confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 44]: This she did one evening as follows : ` Master Copperfield , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ' I make no stranger of you , and therefore do not hesitate to say that Mr. Micawber 's difficulties are coming to a crisis . '
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 23]: It made me very miserable to hear it , and I looked at Mrs. Micawber 's red eyes with the utmost sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 42]: ` With the exception of the heel of a Dutch cheese -- which is not adapted to the wants of a young family ' -- said Mrs. Micawber , ` there is really not a scrap of anything in the larder .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 24]: I was accustomed to speak of the larder when I lived with papa and mama , and I use the word almost unconsciously .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 18]: What I mean to express is , that there is nothing to eat in the house . '
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 7]: I said , in great concern .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 55]: I had two or three shillings of my week 's money in my pocket -- from which I presume that it must have been on a Wednesday night when we held this conversation -- and I hastily produced them , and with heartfelt emotion begged Mrs. Micawber to accept of them as a loan .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 26]: But that lady , kissing me , and making me put them back in my pocket , replied that she could n't think of it .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 20]: ` No , my dear Master Copperfield , ' said she , ` far be it from my thoughts !
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 32]: But you have a discretion beyond your years , and can render me another kind of service , if you will ; and a service I will thankfully accept of . '
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 9]: I begged Mrs. Micawber to name it . '
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 13]: I have parted with the plate myself , ' said Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 30]: ` Six tea , two salt , and a pair of sugars , I have at different times borrowed money on , in secret , with my own hands .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 27]: But the twins are a great tie ; and to me , with my recollections , of papa and mama , these transactions are very painful .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 12]: There are still a few trifles that we could part with .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 45]: Mr. Micawber 's feelings would never allow him to dispose of them ; and Clickett ' -- this was the girl from the workhouse -- ` being of a vulgar mind , would take painful liberties if so much confidence was reposed in her .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 28]: Master Copperfield , if I might ask you -- ' I understood Mrs. Micawber now , and begged her to make use of me to any extent .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 35]: I began to dispose of the more portable articles of property that very evening ; and went out on a similar expedition almost every morning , before I went to Murdstone and Grinby 's .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 22]: Mr. Micawber had a few books on a little chiffonier , which he called the library ; and those went first .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 43]: I carried them , one after another , to a bookstall in the City Road -- one part of which , near our house , was almost all bookstalls and bird shops then -- and sold them for whatever they would bring .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 33]: The keeper of this bookstall , who lived in a little house behind it , used to get tipsy every night , and to be violently scolded by his wife every morning .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 103]: More than once , when I went there early , I had audience of him in a turn-up bedstead , with a cut in his forehead or a black eye , bearing witness to his excesses over-night -LRB- I am afraid he was quarrelsome in his drink -RRB- , and he , with a shaking hand , endeavouring to find the needful shillings in one or other of the pockets of his clothes , which lay upon the floor , while his wife , with a baby in her arms and her shoes down at heel , never left off rating him .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 53]: Sometimes he had lost his money , and then he would ask me to call again ; but his wife had always got some -- had taken his , I dare say , while he was drunk -- and secretly completed the bargain on the stairs , as we went down together .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 16]: At the pawnbroker 's shop , too , I began to be very well known .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 51]: The principal gentleman who officiated behind the counter , took a good deal of notice of me ; and often got me , I recollect , to decline a Latin noun or adjective , or to conjugate a Latin verb , in his ear , while he transacted my business .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 31]: After all these occasions Mrs. Micawber made a little treat , which was generally a supper ; and there was a peculiar relish in these meals which I well remember .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 32]: At last Mr. Micawber 's difficulties came to a crisis , and he was arrested early one morning , and carried over to the King 's Bench Prison in the Borough .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 36]: He told me , as he went out of the house , that the God of day had now gone down upon him -- and I really thought his heart was broken and mine too .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 21]: But I heard , afterwards , that he was seen to play a lively game at skittles , before noon .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 24]: On the first Sunday after he was taken there , I was to go and see him , and have dinner with him .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 51]: I was to ask my way to such a place , and just short of that place I should see such another place , and just short of that I should see a yard , which I was to cross , and keep straight on until I saw a turnkey .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 23]: All this I did ; and when at last I did see a turnkey -LRB- poor little fellow that I was ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 41]: , and thought how , when Roderick Random was in a debtors ' prison , there was a man there with nothing on him but an old rug , the turnkey swam before my dimmed eyes and my beating heart .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 29]: Mr. Micawber was waiting for me within the gate , and we went up to his room -LRB- top story but one -RRB- , and cried very much .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 57]: He solemnly conjured me , I remember , to take warning by his fate ; and to observe that if a man had twenty pounds a-year for his income , and spent nineteen pounds nineteen shillings and sixpence , he would be happy , but that if he spent twenty pounds one he would be miserable .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 33]: After which he borrowed a shilling of me for porter , gave me a written order on Mrs. Micawber for the amount , and put away his pocket-handkerchief , and cheered up .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 57]: We sat before a little fire , with two bricks put within the rusted grate , one on each side , to prevent its burning too many coals ; until another debtor , who shared the room with Mr. Micawber , came in from the bakehouse with the loin of mutton which was our joint-stock repast .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 39]: Then I was sent up to ` Captain Hopkins ' in the room overhead , with Mr. Micawber 's compliments , and I was his young friend , and would Captain Hopkins lend me a knife and fork .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 16]: Captain Hopkins lent me the knife and fork , with his compliments to Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 25]: There was a very dirty lady in his little room , and two wan girls , his daughters , with shock heads of hair .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 20]: I thought it was better to borrow Captain Hopkins 's knife and fork , than Captain Hopkins 's comb .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 29]: The Captain himself was in the last extremity of shabbiness , with large whiskers , and an old , old brown great-coat with no other coat below it .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 59]: I saw his bed rolled up in a corner ; and what plates and dishes and pots he had , on a shelf ; and I divined -LRB- God knows how -RRB- that though the two girls with the shock heads of hair were Captain Hopkins 's children , the dirty lady was not married to Captain Hopkins .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 42]: My timid station on his threshold was not occupied more than a couple of minutes at most ; but I came down again with all this in my knowledge , as surely as the knife and fork were in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 13]: There was something gipsy-like and agreeable in the dinner , after all .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 28]: I took back Captain Hopkins 's knife and fork early in the afternoon , and went home to comfort Mrs. Micawber with an account of my visit .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 25]: She fainted when she saw me return , and made a little jug of egg-hot afterwards to console us while we talked it over .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 28]: I do n't know how the household furniture came to be sold for the family benefit , or who sold it , except that I did not .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 26]: Sold it was , however , and carried away in a van ; except the bed , a few chairs , and the kitchen table .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 43]: With these possessions we encamped , as it were , in the two parlours of the emptied house in Windsor Terrace ; Mrs. Micawber , the children , the Orfling , and myself ; and lived in those rooms night and day .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 18]: I have no idea for how long , though it seems to me for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 22]: At last Mrs. Micawber resolved to move into the prison , where Mr. Micawber had now secured a room to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 78]: So I took the key of the house to the landlord , who was very glad to get it ; and the beds were sent over to the King 's Bench , except mine , for which a little room was hired outside the walls in the neighbourhood of that Institution , very much to my satisfaction , since the Micawbers and I had become too used to one another , in our troubles , to part .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 14]: The Orfling was likewise accommodated with an inexpensive lodging in the same neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 49]: Mine was a quiet back-garret with a sloping roof , commanding a pleasant prospect of a timberyard ; and when I took possession of it , with the reflection that Mr. Micawber 's troubles had come to a crisis at last , I thought it quite a paradise .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 36]: All this time I was working at Murdstone and Grinby 's in the same common way , and with the same common companions , and with the same sense of unmerited degradation as at first .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 47]: But I never , happily for me no doubt , made a single acquaintance , or spoke to any of the many boys whom I saw daily in going to the warehouse , in coming from it , and in prowling about the streets at meal-times .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 20]: I led the same secretly unhappy life ; but I led it in the same lonely , self-reliant manner .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 74]: The only changes I am conscious of are , firstly , that I had grown more shabby , and secondly , that I was now relieved of much of the weight of Mr. and Mrs. Micawber 's cares ; for some relatives or friends had engaged to help them at their present pass , and they lived more comfortably in the prison than they had lived for a long while out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 22]: I used to breakfast with them now , in virtue of some arrangement , of which I have forgotten the details .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 93]: I forget , too , at what hour the gates were opened in the morning , admitting of my going in ; but I know that I was often up at six o'clock , and that my favourite lounging-place in the interval was old London Bridge , where I was wont to sit in one of the stone recesses , watching the people going by , or to look over the balustrades at the sun shining in the water , and lighting up the golden flame on the top of the Monument .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 36]: The Orfling met me here sometimes , to be told some astonishing fictions respecting the wharves and the Tower ; of which I can say no more than that I hope I believed them myself .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 39]: In the evening I used to go back to the prison , and walk up and down the parade with Mr. Micawber ; or play casino with Mrs. Micawber , and hear reminiscences of her papa and mama .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 14]: Whether Mr. Murdstone knew where I was , I am unable to say .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 10]: I never told them at Murdstone and Grinby 's .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 93]: Mr. Micawber 's affairs , although past their crisis , were very much involved by reason of a certain ` Deed ' , of which I used to hear a great deal , and which I suppose , now , to have been some former composition with his creditors , though I was so far from being clear about it then , that I am conscious of having confounded it with those demoniacal parchments which are held to have , once upon a time , obtained to a great extent in Germany .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 68]: At last this document appeared to be got out of the way , somehow ; at all events it ceased to be the rock-ahead it had been ; and Mrs. Micawber informed me that ` her family ' had decided that Mr. Micawber should apply for his release under the Insolvent Debtors Act , which would set him free , she expected , in about six weeks .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 52]: ` And then , ' said Mr. Micawber , who was present , ' I have no doubt I shall , please Heaven , begin to be beforehand with the world , and to live in a perfectly new manner , if -- in short , if anything turns up . '
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 47]: By way of going in for anything that might be on the cards , I call to mind that Mr. Micawber , about this time , composed a petition to the House of Commons , praying for an alteration in the law of imprisonment for debt .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 75]: I set down this remembrance here , because it is an instance to myself of the manner in which I fitted my old books to my altered life , and made stories for myself , out of the streets , and out of men and women ; and how some main points in the character I shall unconsciously develop , I suppose , in writing my life , were gradually forming all this while .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 22]: There was a club in the prison , in which Mr. Micawber , as a gentleman , was a great authority .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 23]: Mr. Micawber had stated his idea of this petition to the club , and the club had strongly approved of the same .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 101]: Wherefore Mr. Micawber -LRB- who was a thoroughly good-natured man , and as active a creature about everything but his own affairs as ever existed , and never so happy as when he was busy about something that could never be of any profit to him -RRB- set to work at the petition , invented it , engrossed it on an immense sheet of paper , spread it out on a table , and appointed a time for all the club , and all within the walls if they chose , to come up to his room and sign it .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 62]: When I heard of this approaching ceremony , I was so anxious to see them all come in , one after another , though I knew the greater part of them already , and they me , that I got an hour 's leave of absence from Murdstone and Grinby 's , and established myself in a corner for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 69]: As many of the principal members of the club as could be got into the small room without filling it , supported Mr. Micawber in front of the petition , while my old friend Captain Hopkins -LRB- who had washed himself , to do honour to so solemn an occasion -RRB- stationed himself close to it , to read it to all who were unacquainted with its contents .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 37]: The door was then thrown open , and the general population began to come in , in a long file : several waiting outside , while one entered , affixed his signature , and went out .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 16]: To everybody in succession , Captain Hopkins said : ` Have you read it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 5]: -- ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 11]: -- ` Would you like to hear it read ? '
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 27]: If he weakly showed the least disposition to hear it , Captain Hopkins , in a loud sonorous voice , gave him every word of it .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 23]: The Captain would have read it twenty thousand times , if twenty thousand people would have heard him , one by one .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 86]: I remember a certain luscious roll he gave to such phrases as ` The people 's representatives in Parliament assembled , ' ` Your petitioners therefore humbly approach your honourable house , ' ` His gracious Majesty 's unfortunate subjects , ' as if the words were something real in his mouth , and delicious to taste ; Mr. Micawber , meanwhile , listening with a little of an author 's vanity , and contemplating -LRB- not severely -RRB- the spikes on the opposite wall .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 74]: As I walked to and fro daily between Southwark and Blackfriars , and lounged about at meal-times in obscure streets , the stones of which may , for anything I know , be worn at this moment by my childish feet , I wonder how many of these people were wanting in the crowd that used to come filing before me in review again , to the echo of Captain Hopkins 's voice !
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 38]: When my thoughts go back , now , to that slow agony of my youth , I wonder how much of the histories I invented for such people hangs like a mist of fancy over well-remembered facts !
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 42]: When I tread the old ground , I do not wonder that I seem to see and pity , going on before me , an innocent romantic boy , making his imaginative world out of such strange experiences and sordid things !
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 46]: Chapter 12 Liking Life on My Own Account No Better , I Form a Great Resolution In due time , Mr. Micawber 's petition was ripe for hearing ; and that gentleman was ordered to be discharged under the Act , to my great joy .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 42]: His creditors were not implacable ; and Mrs. Micawber informed me that even the revengeful boot-maker had declared in open court that he bore him no malice , but that when money was owing to him he liked to be paid .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 9]: He said he thought it was human nature .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 35]: M r Micawber returned to the King 's Bench when his case was over , as some fees were to be settled , and some formalities observed , before he could be actually released .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 37]: The club received him with transport , and held an harmonic meeting that evening in his honour ; while Mrs. Micawber and I had a lamb 's fry in private , surrounded by the sleeping family .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 44]: ` On such an occasion I will give you , Master Copperfield , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` in a little more flip , ' for we had been having some already , ` the memory of my papa and mama . '
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 8]: ` Are they dead , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 11]: I inquired , after drinking the toast in a wine-glass .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 28]: ` My mama departed this life , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` before Mr. Micawber 's difficulties commenced , or at least before they became pressing .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 21]: My papa lived to bail Mr. Micawber several times , and then expired , regretted by a numerous circle . '
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 21]: Mrs. Micawber shook her head , and dropped a pious tear upon the twin who happened to be in hand .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 58]: As I could hardly hope for a more favourable opportunity of putting a question in which I had a near interest , I said to Mrs. Micawber : ` May I ask , ma'am , what you and Mr. Micawber intend to do , now that Mr. Micawber is out of his difficulties , and at liberty ?
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 6]: Have you settled yet ? '
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 51]: ` My family , ' said Mrs. Micawber , who always said those two words with an air , though I never could discover who came under the denomination , ` my family are of opinion that Mr. Micawber should quit London , and exert his talents in the country .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 13]: Mr. Micawber is a man of great talent , Master Copperfield . '
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 8]: I said I was sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 10]: ` Of great talent , ' repeated Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 29]: ` My family are of opinion , that , with a little interest , something might be done for a man of his ability in the Custom House .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 21]: The influence of my family being local , it is their wish that Mr. Micawber should go down to Plymouth .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 13]: They think it indispensable that he should be upon the spot . '
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 8]: ` That he may be ready ? '
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 3]: I suggested .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 8]: ` Exactly , ' returned Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 15]: ` That he may be ready -- in case of anything turning up . '
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 10]: ` And do you go too , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 40]: The events of the day , in combination with the twins , if not with the flip , had made Mrs. Micawber hysterical , and she shed tears as she replied : ' I never will desert Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 30]: Mr. Micawber may have concealed his difficulties from me in the first instance , but his sanguine temper may have led him to expect that he would overcome them .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 45]: The pearl necklace and bracelets which I inherited from mama , have been disposed of for less than half their value ; and the set of coral , which was the wedding gift of my papa , has been actually thrown away for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 8]: But I never will desert Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 3]: No ! '
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 16]: cried Mrs. Micawber , more affected than before , ' I never will do it !
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 9]: It 's of no use asking me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 21]: I felt quite uncomfortable -- as if Mrs. Micawber supposed I had asked her to do anything of the sort !
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 9]: -- and sat looking at her in alarm .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 7]: ` Mr. Micawber has his faults .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 9]: I do not deny that he is improvident .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 41]: I do not deny that he has kept me in the dark as to his resources and his liabilities both , ' she went on , looking at the wall ; ` but I never will desert Mr. Micawber ! '
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 69]: Mrs. Micawber having now raised her voice into a perfect scream , I was so frightened that I ran off to the club-room , and disturbed Mr. Micawber in the act of presiding at a long table , and leading the chorus of Gee up , Dobbin , Gee ho , Dobbin , Gee up , Dobbin , Gee up , and gee ho -- o -- o !
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 44]: with the tidings that Mrs. Micawber was in an alarming state , upon which he immediately burst into tears , and came away with me with his waistcoat full of the heads and tails of shrimps , of which he had been partaking .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 7]: 'Em ma , my angel ! '
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 17]: cried Mr. Micawber , running into the room ; ` what is the matter ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 9]: I never will desert you , Micawber ! '
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 5]: ` My life ! '
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 11]: said Mr. Micawber , taking her in his arms . '
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 8]: I am perfectly aware of it . '
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 9]: ` He is the parent of my children !
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 8]: He is the father of my twins !
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 29]: He is the husband of my affections , ' cried Mrs. Micawber , struggling ; ` and I ne -- ver -- will -- desert Mr. Micawber ! '
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 45]: Mr. Micawber was so deeply affected by this proof of her devotion -LRB- as to me , I was dissolved in tears -RRB- , that he hung over her in a passionate manner , imploring her to look up , and to be calm .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 36]: But the more he asked Mrs. Micawber to look up , the more she fixed her eyes on nothing ; and the more he asked her to compose herself , the more she would n't .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 42]: Consequently Mr. Micawber was soon so overcome , that he mingled his tears with hers and mine ; until he begged me to do him the favour of taking a chair on the staircase , while he got her into bed .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 27]: I would have taken my leave for the night , but he would not hear of my doing that until the strangers ' bell should ring .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 19]: So I sat at the staircase window , until he came out with another chair and joined me .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 10]: ` How is Mrs. Micawber now , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 16]: ` Very low , ' said Mr. Micawber , shaking his head ; ` reaction .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 9]: Ah , this has been a dreadful day !
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 12]: We stand alone now -- everything is gone from us ! '
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 14]: Mr. Micawber pressed my hand , and groaned , and afterwards shed tears .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 26]: I was greatly touched , and disappointed too , for I had expected that we should be quite gay on this happy and long-looked-for occasion .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 33]: But Mr. and Mrs. Micawber were so used to their old difficulties , I think , that they felt quite shipwrecked when they came to consider that they were released from them .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 61]: All their elasticity was departed , and I never saw them half so wretched as on this night ; insomuch that when the bell rang , and Mr. Micawber walked with me to the lodge , and parted from me there with a blessing , I felt quite afraid to leave him by himself , he was so profoundly miserable .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 50]: But through all the confusion and lowness of spirits in which we had been , so unexpectedly to me , involved , I plainly discerned that Mr. and Mrs. Micawber and their family were going away from London , and that a parting between us was near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 51]: It was in my walk home that night , and in the sleepless hours which followed when I lay in bed , that the thought first occurred to me -- though I do n't know how it came into my head -- which afterwards shaped itself into a settled resolution .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 78]: I had grown to be so accustomed to the Micawbers , and had been so intimate with them in their distresses , and was so utterly friendless without them , that the prospect of being thrown upon some new shift for a lodging , and going once more among unknown people , was like being that moment turned adrift into my present life , with such a knowledge of it ready made as experience had given me .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 39]: All the sensitive feelings it wounded so cruelly , all the shame and misery it kept alive within my breast , became more poignant as I thought of this ; and I determined that the life was unendurable .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 23]: That there was no hope of escape from it , unless the escape was my own act , I knew quite well .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 88]: I rarely heard from Miss Murdstone , and never from Mr. Murdstone : but two or three parcels of made or mended clothes had come up for me , consigned to Mr. Quinion , and in each there was a scrap of paper to the effect that J. M. trusted D. C. was applying himself to business , and devoting himself wholly to his duties -- not the least hint of my ever being anything else than the common drudge into which I was fast settling down .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 34]: The very next day showed me , while my mind was in the first agitation of what it had conceived , that Mrs. Micawber had not spoken of their going away without warrant .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 28]: They took a lodging in the house where I lived , for a week ; at the expiration of which time they were to start for Plymouth .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 44]: Mr. Micawber himself came down to the counting-house , in the afternoon , to tell Mr. Quinion that he must relinquish me on the day of his departure , and to give me a high character , which I am sure I deserved .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 54]: And Mr. Quinion , calling in Tipp the carman , who was a married man , and had a room to let , quartered me prospectively on him -- by our mutual consent , as he had every reason to think ; for I said nothing , though my resolution was now taken .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 37]: I passed my evenings with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber , during the remaining term of our residence under the same roof ; and I think we became fonder of one another as the time went on .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 26]: On the last Sunday , they invited me to dinner ; and we had a loin of pork and apple sauce , and a pudding .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 29]: I had bought a spotted wooden horse over-night as a parting gift to little Wilkins Micawber -- that was the boy -- and a doll for little Emma .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 17]: I had also bestowed a shilling on the Orfling , who was about to be disbanded .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 21]: We had a very pleasant day , though we were all in a tender state about our approaching separation . '
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 29]: I shall never , Master Copperfield , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` revert to the period when Mr. Micawber was in difficulties , without thinking of you .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 13]: Your conduct has always been of the most delicate and obliging description .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 7]: You have never been a lodger .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 7]: You have been a friend . '
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 76]: ` My dear , ' said Mr. Micawber ; ` Copperfield , ' for so he had been accustomed to call me , of late , ` has a heart to feel for the distresses of his fellow-creatures when they are behind a cloud , and a head to plan , and a hand to -- in short , a general ability to dispose of such available property as could be made away with . '
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 22]: I expressed my sense of this commendation , and said I was very sorry we were going to lose one another .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 42]: ` My dear young friend , ' said Mr. Micawber , ' I am older than you ; a man of some experience in life , and -- and of some experience , in short , in difficulties , generally speaking .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 29]: At present , and until something turns up -LRB- which I am , I may say , hourly expecting -RRB- , I have nothing to bestow but advice .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 64]: Still my advice is so far worth taking , that -- in short , that I have never taken it myself , and am the ' -- here Mr. Micawber , who had been beaming and smiling , all over his head and face , up to the present moment , checked himself and frowned -- ` the miserable wretch you behold . '
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 6]: ` My dear Micawber ! '
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 5]: urged his wife . '
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 23]: I say , ' returned Mr. Micawber , quite forgetting himself , and smiling again , ` the miserable wretch you behold .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 13]: My advice is , never do tomorrow what you can do today .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 7]: Procrastination is the thief of time .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 4]: Collar him ! '
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 12]: ` My poor papa 's maxim , ' Mrs. Micawber observed .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 28]: ` My dear , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` your papa was very well in his way , and Heaven forbid that I should disparage him .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 50]: Take him for all in all , we ne'er shall -- in short , make the acquaintance , probably , of anybody else possessing , at his time of life , the same legs for gaiters , and able to read the same description of print , without spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 32]: But he applied that maxim to our marriage , my dear ; and that was so far prematurely entered into , in consequence , that I never recovered the expense . '
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 20]: Mr. Micawber looked aside at Mrs. Micawber , and added : ` Not that I am sorry for it .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 8]: Quite the contrary , my love . '
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 12]: After which , he was grave for a minute or so .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 18]: ` My other piece of advice , Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` you know .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 15]: Annual income twenty pounds , annual expenditure nineteen nineteen and six , result happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 16]: Annual income twenty pounds , annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six , result misery .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 32]: The blossom is blighted , the leaf is withered , the god of day goes down upon the dreary scene , and -- and in short you are for ever floored .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 5]: As I am ! '
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 30]: To make his example the more impressive , Mr. Micawber drank a glass of punch with an air of great enjoyment and satisfaction , and whistled the College Hornpipe .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 38]: I did not fail to assure him that I would store these precepts in my mind , though indeed I had no need to do so , for , at the time , they affected me visibly .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 30]: Next morning I met the whole family at the coach office , and saw them , with a desolate heart , take their places outside , at the back .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 14]: ` Master Copperfield , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` God bless you !
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 19]: I never can forget all that , you know , and I never would if I could . '
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 11]: ` Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` farewell !
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 5]: Every happiness and prosperity !
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 42]: If , in the progress of revolving years , I could persuade myself that my blighted destiny had been a warning to you , I should feel that I had not occupied another man 's place in existence altogether in vain .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 33]: In case of anything turning up -LRB- of which I am rather confident -RRB- , I shall be extremely happy if it should be in my power to improve your prospects . '
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 47]: I think , as Mrs. Micawber sat at the back of the coach , with the children , and I stood in the road looking wistfully at them , a mist cleared from her eyes , and she saw what a little creature I really was .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 49]: I think so , because she beckoned to me to climb up , with quite a new and motherly expression in her face , and put her arm round my neck , and gave me just such a kiss as she might have given to her own boy .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 26]: I had barely time to get down again before the coach started , and I could hardly see the family for the handkerchiefs they waved .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 7]: It was gone in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 52]: The Orfling and I stood looking vacantly at each other in the middle of the road , and then shook hands and said good-bye ; she going back , I suppose , to St. Luke 's workhouse , as I went to begin my weary day at Murdstone and Grinby 's .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 12]: But with no intention of passing many more weary days there .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 7]: I had resolved to run away .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 36]: -- To go , by some means or other , down into the country , to the only relation I had in the world , and tell my story to my aunt , Miss Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 18]: I have already observed that I do n't know how this desperate idea came into my brain .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 28]: But , once there , it remained there ; and hardened into a purpose than which I have never entertained a more determined purpose in my life .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 30]: I am far from sure that I believed there was anything hopeful in it , but my mind was thoroughly made up that it must be carried into execution .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 67]: Again , and again , and a hundred times again , since the night when the thought had first occurred to me and banished sleep , I had gone over that old story of my poor mother 's about my birth , which it had been one of my great delights in the old time to hear her tell , and which I knew by heart .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 45]: My aunt walked into that story , and walked out of it , a dread and awful personage ; but there was one little trait in her behaviour which I liked to dwell on , and which gave me some faint shadow of encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 79]: I could not forget how my mother had thought that she felt her touch her pretty hair with no ungentle hand ; and though it might have been altogether my mother 's fancy , and might have had no foundation whatever in fact , I made a little picture , out of it , of my terrible aunt relenting towards the girlish beauty that I recollected so well and loved so much , which softened the whole narrative .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 22]: It is very possible that it had been in my mind a long time , and had gradually engendered my determination .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 60]: As I did not even know where Miss Betsey lived , I wrote a long letter to Peggotty , and asked her , incidentally , if she remembered ; pretending that I had heard of such a lady living at a certain place I named at random , and had a curiosity to know if it were the same .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 57]: In the course of that letter , I told Peggotty that I had a particular occasion for half a guinea ; and that if she could lend me that sum until I could repay it , I should be very much obliged to her , and would tell her afterwards what I had wanted it for .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 17]: Peggotty 's answer soon arrived , and was , as usual , full of affectionate devotion .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 57]: She enclosed the half guinea -LRB- I was afraid she must have had a world of trouble to get it out of Mr. Barkis 's box -RRB- , and told me that Miss Betsey lived near Dover , but whether at Dover itself , at Hythe , Sandgate , or Folkestone , she could not say .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 44]: One of our men , however , informing me on my asking him about these places , that they were all close together , I deemed this enough for my object , and resolved to set out at the end of that week .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 72]: Being a very honest little creature , and unwilling to disgrace the memory I was going to leave behind me at Murdstone and Grinby 's , I considered myself bound to remain until Saturday night ; and , as I had been paid a week 's wages in advance when I first came there , not to present myself in the counting-house at the usual hour , to receive my stipend .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 23]: For this express reason , I had borrowed the half-guinea , that I might not be without a fund for my travelling-expenses .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 90]: Accordingly , when the Saturday night came , and we were all waiting in the warehouse to be paid , and Tipp the carman , who always took precedence , went in first to draw his money , I shook Mick Walker by the hand ; asked him , when it came to his turn to be paid , to say to Mr. Quinion that I had gone to move my box to Tipp 's ; and , bidding a last good night to Mealy Potatoes , ran away .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 55]: My box was at my old lodging , over the water , and I had written a direction for it on the back of one of our address cards that we nailed on the casks : ` Master David , to be left till called for , at the Coach Office , Dover . '
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 49]: This I had in my pocket ready to put on the box , after I should have got it out of the house ; and as I went towards my lodging , I looked about me for someone who would help me to carry it to the booking-office .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 76]: There was a long-legged young man with a very little empty donkey-cart , standing near the Obelisk , in the Blackfriars Road , whose eye I caught as I was going by , and who , addressing me as ` Sixpenn ` orth of bad ha ` pence , ' hoped ' I should know him agin to swear to ' -- in allusion , I have no doubt , to my staring at him .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 27]: I stopped to assure him that I had not done so in bad manners , but uncertain whether he might or might not like a job .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 5]: ` Wot job ? '
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 6]: said the long-legged young man .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 10]: ` To move a box , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 5]: ` Wot box ? '
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 6]: said the long-legged young man .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 27]: I told him mine , which was down that street there , and which I wanted him to take to the Dover coach office for sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 9]: ` Done with you for a tanner ! '
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 48]: said the long-legged young man , and directly got upon his cart , which was nothing but a large wooden tray on wheels , and rattled away at such a rate , that it was as much as I could do to keep pace with the donkey .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 66]: There was a defiant manner about this young man , and particularly about the way in which he chewed straw as he spoke to me , that I did not much like ; as the bargain was made , however , I took him upstairs to the room I was leaving , and we brought the box down , and put it on his cart .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 63]: Now , I was unwilling to put the direction-card on there , lest any of my landlord 's family should fathom what I was doing , and detain me ; so I said to the young man that I would be glad if he would stop for a minute , when he came to the dead-wall of the King 's Bench prison .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 56]: The words were no sooner out of my mouth , than he rattled away as if he , my box , the cart , and the donkey , were all equally mad ; and I was quite out of breath with running and calling after him , when I caught him at the place appointed .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 20]: Being much flushed and excited , I tumbled my half-guinea out of my pocket in pulling the card out .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 58]: I put it in my mouth for safety , and though my hands trembled a good deal , had just tied the card on very much to my satisfaction , when I felt myself violently chucked under the chin by the long-legged young man , and saw my half-guinea fly out of my mouth into his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 4]: ` Wot ! '
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 17]: said the young man , seizing me by my jacket collar , with a frightful grin .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 10]: ` This is a pollis case , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 9]: You 're a-going to bolt , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 15]: Come to the pollis , you young warmin , come to the pollis ! '
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 27]: ` You give me my money back , if you please , ' said I , very much frightened ; ` and leave me alone . '
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 7]: ` Come to the pollis ! '
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 5]: said the young man .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 11]: ` You shall prove it yourn to the pollis . '
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 19]: ` Give me my box and money , will you , ' I cried , bursting into tears .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 13]: The young man still replied : ` Come to the pollis ! '
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 59]: and was dragging me against the donkey in a violent manner , as if there were any affinity between that animal and a magistrate , when he changed his mind , jumped into the cart , sat upon my box , and , exclaiming that he would drive to the pollis straight , rattled away harder than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 35]: I ran after him as fast as I could , but I had no breath to call out with , and should not have dared to call out , now , if I had .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 17]: I narrowly escaped being run over , twenty times at least , in half a mile .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 52]: Now I lost him , now I saw him , now I lost him , now I was cut at with a whip , now shouted at , now down in the mud , now up again , now running into somebody 's arms , now running headlong at a post .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 105]: At length , confused by fright and heat , and doubting whether half London might not by this time be turning out for my apprehension , I left the young man to go where he would with my box and money ; and , panting and crying , but never stopping , faced about for Greenwich , which I had understood was on the Dover Road : taking very little more out of the world , towards the retreat of my aunt , Miss Betsey , than I had brought into it , on the night when my arrival gave her so much umbrage .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 46]: Chapter 13 The Sequel of My Resolution For anything I know , I may have had some wild idea of running all the way to Dover , when I gave up the pursuit of the young man with the donkey-cart , and started for Greenwich .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 51]: My scattered senses were soon collected as to that point , if I had ; for I came to a stop in the Kent Road , at a terrace with a piece of water before it , and a great foolish image in the middle , blowing a dry shell .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 36]: Here I sat down on a doorstep , quite spent and exhausted with the efforts I had already made , and with hardly breath enough to cry for the loss of my box and half-guinea .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 19]: It was by this time dark ; I heard the clocks strike ten , as I sat resting .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 13]: But it was a summer night , fortunately , and fine weather .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 26]: When I had recovered my breath , and had got rid of a stifling sensation in my throat , I rose up and went on .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 15]: In the midst of my distress , I had no notion of going back .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 21]: I doubt if I should have had any , though there had been a Swiss snow-drift in the Kent Road .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 32]: But my standing possessed of only three-halfpence in the world -LRB- and I am sure I wonder how they came to be left in my pocket on a Saturday night ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 10]: troubled me none the less because I went on .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 80]: I began to picture to myself , as a scrap of newspaper intelligence , my being found dead in a day or two , under some hedge ; and I trudged on miserably , though as fast as I could , until I happened to pass a little shop , where it was written up that ladies ' and gentlemen 's wardrobes were bought , and that the best price was given for rags , bones , and kitchen-stuff .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 72]: The master of this shop was sitting at the door in his shirt-sleeves , smoking ; and as there were a great many coats and pairs of trousers dangling from the low ceiling , and only two feeble candles burning inside to show what they were , I fancied that he looked like a man of a revengeful disposition , who had hung all his enemies , and was enjoying himself .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 27]: My late experiences with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber suggested to me that here might be a means of keeping off the wolf for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 27]: I went up the next by-street , took off my waistcoat , rolled it neatly under my arm , and came back to the shop door .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 23]: ` If you please , sir , ' I said , ' I am to sell this for a fair price . '
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 94]: Mr. Dolloby -- Dolloby was the name over the shop door , at least -- took the waistcoat , stood his pipe on its head , against the door-post , went into the shop , followed by me , snuffed the two candles with his fingers , spread the waistcoat on the counter , and looked at it there , held it up against the light , and looked at it there , and ultimately said : ` What do you call a price , now , for this here little weskit ? '
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 12]: you know best , sir , ' I returned modestly . '
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 14]: I ca n't be buyer and seller too , ' said Mr. Dolloby .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 11]: ` Put a price on this here little weskit . '
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 6]: ` Would eighteenpence be ? '
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 8]: - I hinted , after some hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 14]: Mr. Dolloby rolled it up again , and gave it me back . '
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 21]: I should rob my family , ' he said , ` if I was to offer ninepence for it . '
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 34]: This was a disagreeable way of putting the business ; because it imposed upon me , a perfect stranger , the unpleasantness of asking Mr. Dolloby to rob his family on my account .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 22]: My circumstances being so very pressing , however , I said I would take ninepence for it , if he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 11]: Mr. Dolloby , not without some grumbling , gave ninepence .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 25]: I wished him good night , and walked out of the shop the richer by that sum , and the poorer by a waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 12]: But when I buttoned my jacket , that was not much .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 50]: Indeed , I foresaw pretty clearly that my jacket would go next , and that I should have to make the best of my way to Dover in a shirt and a pair of trousers , and might deem myself lucky if I got there even in that trim .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 15]: But my mind did not run so much on this as might be supposed .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 47]: Beyond a general impression of the distance before me , and of the young man with the donkey-cart having used me cruelly , I think I had no very urgent sense of my difficulties when I once again set off with my ninepence in my pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 20]: A plan had occurred to me for passing the night , which I was going to carry into execution .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 27]: This was , to lie behind the wall at the back of my old school , in a corner where there used to be a haystack .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 49]: I imagined it would be a kind of company to have the boys , and the bedroom where I used to tell the stories , so near me : although the boys would know nothing of my being there , and the bedroom would yield me no shelter .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 29]: I had had a hard day 's work , and was pretty well jaded when I came climbing out , at last , upon the level of Blackheath .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 56]: It cost me some trouble to find out Salem House ; but I found it , and I found a haystack in the corner , and I lay down by it ; having first walked round the wall , and looked up at the windows , and seen that all was dark and silent within .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 19]: Never shall I forget the lonely sensation of first lying down , without a roof above my head !
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 70]: Sleep came upon me as it came on many other outcasts , against whom house-doors were locked , and house-dogs barked , that night -- and I dreamed of lying on my old school-bed , talking to the boys in my room ; and found myself sitting upright , with Steerforth 's name upon my lips , looking wildly at the stars that were glistening and glimmering above me .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 34]: When I remembered where I was at that untimely hour , a feeling stole upon me that made me get up , afraid of I do n't know what , and walk about .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 72]: But the fainter glimmering of the stars , and the pale light in the sky where the day was coming , reassured me : and my eyes being very heavy , I lay down again and slept -- though with a knowledge in my sleep that it was cold -- until the warm beams of the sun , and the ringing of the getting-up bell at Salem House , awoke me .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 31]: If I could have hoped that Steerforth was there , I would have lurked about until he came out alone ; but I knew he must have left long since .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 44]: Traddles still remained , perhaps , but it was very doubtful ; and I had not sufficient confidence in his discretion or good luck , however strong my reliance was on his good nature , to wish to trust him with my situation .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 61]: So I crept away from the wall as Mr. Creakle 's boys were getting up , and struck into the long dusty track which I had first known to be the Dover Road when I was one of them , and when I little expected that any eyes would ever see me the wayfarer I was now , upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 13]: What a different Sunday morning from the old Sunday morning at Yarmouth !
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 81]: In due time I heard the church-bells ringing , as I plodded on ; and I met people who were going to church ; and I passed a church or two where the congregation were inside , and the sound of singing came out into the sunshine , while the beadle sat and cooled himself in the shade of the porch , or stood beneath the yew-tree , with his hand to his forehead , glowering at me going by .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 17]: But the peace and rest of the old Sunday morning were on everything , except me .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 5]: That was the difference .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 15]: I felt quite wicked in my dirt and dust , with my tangled hair .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 47]: But for the quiet picture I had conjured up , of my mother in her youth and beauty , weeping by the fire , and my aunt relenting to her , I hardly think I should have had the courage to go on until next day .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 11]: But it always went before me , and I followed .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 29]: I got , that Sunday , through three-and-twenty miles on the straight road , though not very easily , for I was new to that kind of toil .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 30]: I see myself , as evening closes in , coming over the bridge at Rochester , footsore and tired , and eating bread that I had bought for supper .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 53]: One or two little houses , with the notice , ` Lodgings for Travellers ' , hanging out , had tempted me ; but I was afraid of spending the few pence I had , and was even more afraid of the vicious looks of the trampers I had met or overtaken .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 74]: I sought no shelter , therefore , but the sky ; and toiling into Chatham , -- which , in that night 's aspect , is a mere dream of chalk , and drawbridges , and mastless ships in a muddy river , roofed like Noah 's arks , -- crept , at last , upon a sort of grass-grown battery overhanging a lane , where a sentry was walking to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 51]: Here I lay down , near a cannon ; and , happy in the society of the sentry 's footsteps , though he knew no more of my being above him than the boys at Salem House had known of my lying by the wall , slept soundly until morning .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 44]: Very stiff and sore of foot I was in the morning , and quite dazed by the beating of drums and marching of troops , which seemed to hem me in on every side when I went down towards the long narrow street .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 41]: Feeling that I could go but a very little way that day , if I were to reserve any strength for getting to my journey 's end , I resolved to make the sale of my jacket its principal business .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 34]: Accordingly , I took the jacket off , that I might learn to do without it ; and carrying it under my arm , began a tour of inspection of the various slop-shops .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 36]: It was a likely place to sell a jacket in ; for the dealers in second-hand clothes were numerous , and were , generally speaking , on the look-out for customers at their shop doors .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 50]: But as most of them had , hanging up among their stock , an officer 's coat or two , epaulettes and all , I was rendered timid by the costly nature of their dealings , and walked about for a long time without offering my merchandise to anyone .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 27]: This modesty of mine directed my attention to the marine-store shops , and such shops as Mr. Dolloby 's , in preference to the regular dealers .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 88]: At last I found one that I thought looked promising , at the corner of a dirty lane , ending in an enclosure full of stinging-nettles , against the palings of which some second-hand sailors ' clothes , that seemed to have overflowed the shop , were fluttering among some cots , and rusty guns , and oilskin hats , and certain trays full of so many old rusty keys of so many sizes that they seemed various enough to open all the doors in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 85]: Into this shop , which was low and small , and which was darkened rather than lighted by a little window , overhung with clothes , and was descended into by some steps , I went with a palpitating heart ; which was not relieved when an ugly old man , with the lower part of his face all covered with a stubbly grey beard , rushed out of a dirty den behind it , and seized me by the hair of my head .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 22]: He was a dreadful old man to look at , in a filthy flannel waistcoat , and smelling terribly of rum .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 38]: His bedstead , covered with a tumbled and ragged piece of patchwork , was in the den he had come from , where another little window showed a prospect of more stinging-nettles , and a lame donkey .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 9]: ` Oh , what do you want ? '
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 12]: grinned this old man , in a fierce , monotonous whine .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 13]: ` Oh , my eyes and limbs , what do you want ?
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 12]: Oh , my lungs and liver , what do you want ?
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 7]: Oh , goroo , goroo ! '
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 59]: I was so much dismayed by these words , and particularly by the repetition of the last unknown one , which was a kind of rattle in his throat , that I could make no answer ; hereupon the old man , still holding me by the hair , repeated : ` Oh , what do you want ?
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 12]: Oh , my eyes and limbs , what do you want ?
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 12]: Oh , my lungs and liver , what do you want ?
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 5]: Oh , goroo ! '
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 21]: -- which he screwed out of himself , with an energy that made his eyes start in his head . '
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 20]: I wanted to know , ' I said , trembling , ` if you would buy a jacket . '
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 10]: ` Oh , let 's see the jacket ! '
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 5]: cried the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 14]: ` Oh , my heart on fire , show the jacket to us !
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 13]: Oh , my eyes and limbs , bring the jacket out ! '
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 40]: With that he took his trembling hands , which were like the claws of a great bird , out of my hair ; and put on a pair of spectacles , not at all ornamental to his inflamed eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 10]: ` Oh , how much for the jacket ? '
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 9]: cried the old man , after examining it .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 5]: ` Oh -- goroo !
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 8]: -- how much for the jacket ? '
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 10]: ` Half-a-crown , ' I answered , recovering myself .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 17]: ` Oh , my lungs and liver , ' cried the old man , ` no !
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 7]: Oh , my eyes , no !
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 7]: Oh , my limbs , no !
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 2]: Eighteenpence .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 3]: Goroo ! '
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 67]: Every time he uttered this ejaculation , his eyes seemed to be in danger of starting out ; and every sentence he spoke , he delivered in a sort of tune , always exactly the same , and more like a gust of wind , which begins low , mounts up high , and falls again , than any other comparison I can find for it .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 21]: ` Well , ' said I , glad to have closed the bargain , ` I 'll take eighteenpence . '
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 7]: ` Oh , my liver ! '
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 12]: cried the old man , throwing the jacket on a shelf .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 7]: ` Get out of the shop !
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 11]: Oh , my lungs , get out of the shop !
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 9]: Oh , my eyes and limbs -- goroo !
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 13]: -- do n't ask for money ; make it an exchange . '
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 56]: I never was so frightened in my life , before or since ; but I told him humbly that I wanted money , and that nothing else was of any use to me , but that I would wait for it , as he desired , outside , and had no wish to hurry him .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 15]: So I went outside , and sat down in the shade in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 31]: And I sat there so many hours , that the shade became sunlight , and the sunlight became shade again , and still I sat there waiting for the money .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 16]: There never was such another drunken madman in that line of business , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 55]: That he was well known in the neighbourhood , and enjoyed the reputation of having sold himself to the devil , I soon understood from the visits he received from the boys , who continually came skirmishing about the shop , shouting that legend , and calling to him to bring out his gold .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 15]: ` You ai n't poor , you know , Charley , as you pretend .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 5]: Bring out your gold .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 14]: Bring out some of the gold you sold yourself to the devil for .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 11]: It 's in the lining of the mattress , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 10]: Rip it open and let 's have some ! '
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 43]: This , and many offers to lend him a knife for the purpose , exasperated him to such a degree , that the whole day was a succession of rushes on his part , and flights on the part of the boys .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 84]: Sometimes in his rage he would take me for one of them , and come at me , mouthing as if he were going to tear me in pieces ; then , remembering me , just in time , would dive into the shop , and lie upon his bed , as I thought from the sound of his voice , yelling in a frantic way , to his own windy tune , the ` Death of Nelson ' ; with an Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 9]: before every line , and innumerable Goroos interspersed .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 45]: As if this were not bad enough for me , the boys , connecting me with the establishment , on account of the patience and perseverance with which I sat outside , half-dressed , pelted me , and used me very ill all day .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 41]: He made many attempts to induce me to consent to an exchange ; at one time coming out with a fishing-rod , at another with a fiddle , at another with a cocked hat , at another with a flute .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 31]: But I resisted all these overtures , and sat there in desperation ; each time asking him , with tears in my eyes , for my money or my jacket .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 26]: At last he began to pay me in halfpence at a time ; and was full two hours getting by easy stages to a shilling .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 9]: ` Oh , my eyes and limbs ! '
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 26]: he then cried , peeping hideously out of the shop , after a long pause , ` will you go for twopence more ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 15]: I ca n't , ' I said ; ' I shall be starved . '
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 16]: ` Oh , my lungs and liver , will you go for threepence ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 23]: I would go for nothing , if I could , ' I said , ` but I want the money badly . '
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 6]: ` Oh , go-roo ! '
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 42]: -LRB- it is really impossible to express how he twisted this ejaculation out of himself , as he peeped round the door-post at me , showing nothing but his crafty old head -RRB- ; ` will you go for fourpence ? '
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 43]: I was so faint and weary that I closed with this offer ; and taking the money out of his claw , not without trembling , went away more hungry and thirsty than I had ever been , a little before sunset .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 27]: But at an expense of threepence I soon refreshed myself completely ; and , being in better spirits then , limped seven miles upon my road .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 39]: My bed at night was under another haystack , where I rested comfortably , after having washed my blistered feet in a stream , and dressed them as well as I was able , with some cool leaves .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 22]: When I took the road again next morning , I found that it lay through a succession of hop-grounds and orchards .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 29]: It was sufficiently late in the year for the orchards to be ruddy with ripe apples ; and in a few places the hop-pickers were already at work .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 39]: I thought it all extremely beautiful , and made up my mind to sleep among the hops that night : imagining some cheerful companionship in the long perspectives of poles , with the graceful leaves twining round them .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 24]: The trampers were worse than ever that day , and inspired me with a dread that is yet quite fresh in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 45]: Some of them were most ferocious-looking ruffians , who stared at me as I went by ; and stopped , perhaps , and called after me to come back and speak to them , and when I took to my heels , stoned me .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 56]: I recollect one young fellow -- a tinker , I suppose , from his wallet and brazier -- who had a woman with him , and who faced about and stared at me thus ; and then roared to me in such a tremendous voice to come back , that I halted and looked round .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 25]: ` Come here , when you 're called , ' said the tinker , ` or I 'll rip your young body open . '
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 8]: I thought it best to go back .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 26]: As I drew nearer to them , trying to propitiate the tinker by my looks , I observed that the woman had a black eye .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 7]: ` Where are you going ? '
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 16]: said the tinker , gripping the bosom of my shirt with his blackened hand . '
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 10]: I am going to Dover , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 8]: ` Where do you come from ? '
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 20]: asked the tinker , giving his hand another turn in my shirt , to hold me more securely . '
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 9]: I come from London , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 8]: ` What lay are you upon ? '
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 4]: asked the tinker .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 7]: ` Are you a prig ? '
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 7]: ` N-no , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 9]: ` Ai n't you , by G -- ?
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 25]: If you make a brag of your honesty to me , ' said the tinker , ` I 'll knock your brains out . '
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 22]: With his disengaged hand he made a menace of striking me , and then looked at me from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 15]: ` Have you got the price of a pint of beer about you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 4]: said the tinker .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 16]: ` If you have , out with it , afore I take it away ! '
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 31]: I should certainly have produced it , but that I met the woman 's look , and saw her very slightly shake her head , and form ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 5]: with her lips . '
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 21]: I am very poor , ' I said , attempting to smile , ` and have got no money . '
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 9]: ` Why , what do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 22]: said the tinker , looking so sternly at me , that I almost feared he saw the money in my pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 4]: ` Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 3]: I stammered .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 20]: ` What do you mean , ' said the tinker , ` by wearing my brother 's silk handkerchief !
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 6]: Give it over here ! '
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 18]: And he had mine off my neck in a moment , and tossed it to the woman .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 40]: The woman burst into a fit of laughter , as if she thought this a joke , and tossed it back to me , nodded once , as slightly as before , and made the word ` Go ! '
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 4]: with her lips .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 49]: Before I could obey , however , the tinker seized the handkerchief out of my hand with a roughness that threw me away like a feather , and putting it loosely round his own neck , turned upon the woman with an oath , and knocked her down .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 75]: I never shall forget seeing her fall backward on the hard road , and lie there with her bonnet tumbled off , and her hair all whitened in the dust ; nor , when I looked back from a distance , seeing her sitting on the pathway , which was a bank by the roadside , wiping the blood from her face with a corner of her shawl , while he went on ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 52]: This adventure frightened me so , that , afterwards , when I saw any of these people coming , I turned back until I could find a hiding-place , where I remained until they had gone out of sight ; which happened so often , that I was very seriously delayed .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 41]: But under this difficulty , as under all the other difficulties of my journey , I seemed to be sustained and led on by my fanciful picture of my mother in her youth , before I came into the world .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 6]: It always kept me company .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 33]: It was there , among the hops , when I lay down to sleep ; it was with me on my waking in the morning ; it went before me all day .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 50]: I have associated it , ever since , with the sunny street of Canterbury , dozing as it were in the hot light ; and with the sight of its old houses and gateways , and the stately , grey Cathedral , with the rooks sailing round the towers .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 62]: When I came , at last , upon the bare , wide downs near Dover , it relieved the solitary aspect of the scene with hope ; and not until I reached that first great aim of my journey , and actually set foot in the town itself , on the sixth day of my flight , did it desert me .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 47]: But then , strange to say , when I stood with my ragged shoes , and my dusty , sunburnt , half-clothed figure , in the place so long desired , it seemed to vanish like a dream , and to leave me helpless and dispirited .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 15]: I inquired about my aunt among the boatmen first , and received various answers .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 79]: One said she lived in the South Foreland Light , and had singed her whiskers by doing so ; another , that she was made fast to the great buoy outside the harbour , and could only be visited at half-tide ; a third , that she was locked up in Maidstone jail for child-stealing ; a fourth , that she was seen to mount a broom in the last high wind , and make direct for Calais .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 44]: The fly-drivers , among whom I inquired next , were equally jocose and equally disrespectful ; and the shopkeepers , not liking my appearance , generally replied , without hearing what I had to say , that they had got nothing for me .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 18]: I felt more miserable and destitute than I had done at any period of my running away .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 39]: My money was all gone , I had nothing left to dispose of ; I was hungry , thirsty , and worn out ; and seemed as distant from my end as if I had remained in London .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 55]: The morning had worn away in these inquiries , and I was sitting on the step of an empty shop at a street corner , near the market-place , deliberating upon wandering towards those other places which had been mentioned , when a fly-driver , coming by with his carriage , dropped a horsecloth .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 46]: Something good-natured in the man 's face , as I handed it up , encouraged me to ask him if he could tell me where Miss Trotwood lived ; though I had asked the question so often , that it almost died upon my lips .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 7]: ` Trotwood , ' said he .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 5]: ` Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 7]: I know the name , too .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 4]: Old lady ? '
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 11]: ` Yes , ' I said , ` rather . '
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 8]: ` Pretty stiff in the back ? '
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 7]: said he , making himself upright .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 8]: I should think it very likely . '
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 6]: ` Carries a bag ? '
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 26]: said he -- ` bag with a good deal of room in it -- is gruffish , and comes down upon you , sharp ? '
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 15]: My heart sank within me as I acknowledged the undoubted accuracy of this description .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 13]: ` Why then , I tell you what , ' said he .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 39]: ` If you go up there , ' pointing with his whip towards the heights , ` and keep right on till you come to some houses facing the sea , I think you 'll hear of her .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 18]: My opinion is she wo n't stand anything , so here 's a penny for you . '
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 13]: I accepted the gift thankfully , and bought a loaf with it .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 32]: Dispatching this refreshment by the way , I went in the direction my friend had indicated , and walked on a good distance without coming to the houses he had mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 49]: At length I saw some before me ; and approaching them , went into a little shop -LRB- it was what we used to call a general shop , at home -RRB- , and inquired if they could have the goodness to tell me where Miss Trotwood lived .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 34]: I addressed myself to a man behind the counter , who was weighing some rice for a young woman ; but the latter , taking the inquiry to herself , turned round quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 5]: ` My mistress ? '
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 12]: ` What do you want with her , boy ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 18]: I want , ' I replied , ` to speak to her , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 14]: ` To beg of her , you mean , ' retorted the damsel .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 11]: ` No , ' I said , ` indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 26]: But suddenly remembering that in truth I came for no other purpose , I held my peace in confusion , and felt my face burn .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 48]: My aunt 's handmaid , as I supposed she was from what she had said , put her rice in a little basket and walked out of the shop ; telling me that I could follow her , if I wanted to know where Miss Trotwood lived .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 28]: I needed no second permission ; though I was by this time in such a state of consternation and agitation , that my legs shook under me .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 43]: I followed the young woman , and we soon came to a very neat little cottage with cheerful bow-windows : in front of it , a small square gravelled court or garden full of flowers , carefully tended , and smelling deliciously .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 13]: ` This is Miss Trotwood 's , ' said the young woman .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 16]: ` Now you know ; and that 's all I have got to say . '
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 88]: With which words she hurried into the house , as if to shake off the responsibility of my appearance ; and left me standing at the garden-gate , looking disconsolately over the top of it towards the parlour window , where a muslin curtain partly undrawn in the middle , a large round green screen or fan fastened on to the windowsill , a small table , and a great chair , suggested to me that my aunt might be at that moment seated in awful state .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 11]: My shoes were by this time in a woeful condition .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 30]: The soles had shed themselves bit by bit , and the upper leathers had broken and burst until the very shape and form of shoes had departed from them .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 37]: My hat -LRB- which had served me for a night-cap , too -RRB- was so crushed and bent , that no old battered handleless saucepan on a dunghill need have been ashamed to vie with it .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 45]: My shirt and trousers , stained with heat , dew , grass , and the Kentish soil on which I had slept -- and torn besides -- might have frightened the birds from my aunt 's garden , as I stood at the gate .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 13]: My hair had known no comb or brush since I left London .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 23]: My face , neck , and hands , from unaccustomed exposure to the air and sun , were burnt to a berry-brown .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 25]: From head to foot I was powdered almost as white with chalk and dust , as if I had come out of a lime-kiln .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 30]: In this plight , and with a strong consciousness of it , I waited to introduce myself to , and make my first impression on , my formidable aunt .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 78]: The unbroken stillness of the parlour window leading me to infer , after a while , that she was not there , I lifted up my eyes to the window above it , where I saw a florid , pleasant-looking gentleman , with a grey head , who shut up one eye in a grotesque manner , nodded his head at me several times , shook it at me as often , laughed , and went away .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 81]: I had been discomposed enough before ; but I was so much the more discomposed by this unexpected behaviour , that I was on the point of slinking off , to think how I had best proceed , when there came out of the house a lady with her handkerchief tied over her cap , and a pair of gardening gloves on her hands , wearing a gardening pocket like a toll-man 's apron , and carrying a great knife .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 35]: I knew her immediately to be Miss Betsey , for she came stalking out of the house exactly as my poor mother had so often described her stalking up our garden at Blunderstone Rookery .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 5]: ` Go away ! '
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 20]: said Miss Betsey , shaking her head , and making a distant chop in the air with her knife .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 4]: ` Go along !
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 5]: No boys here ! '
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 31]: I watched her , with my heart at my lips , as she marched to a corner of her garden , and stooped to dig up some little root there .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 31]: Then , without a scrap of courage , but with a great deal of desperation , I went softly in and stood beside her , touching her with my finger .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 11]: ` If you please , ma'am , ' I began .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 6]: She started and looked up .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 8]: ` If you please , aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 4]: ` EH ? '
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 15]: exclaimed Miss Betsey , in a tone of amazement I have never heard approached .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 13]: ` If you please , aunt , I am your nephew . '
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 6]: ` Oh , Lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 9]: And sat flat down in the garden-path . '
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 29]: I am David Copperfield , of Blunderstone , in Suffolk -- where you came , on the night when I was born , and saw my dear mama .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 9]: I have been very unhappy since she died .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 23]: I have been slighted , and taught nothing , and thrown upon myself , and put to work not fit for me .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 8]: It made me run away to you .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 29]: I was robbed at first setting out , and have walked all the way , and have never slept in a bed since I began the journey . '
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 57]: Here my self-support gave way all at once ; and with a movement of my hands , intended to show her my ragged state , and call it to witness that I had suffered something , I broke into a passion of crying , which I suppose had been pent up within me all the week .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 49]: My aunt , with every sort of expression but wonder discharged from her countenance , sat on the gravel , staring at me , until I began to cry ; when she got up in a great hurry , collared me , and took me into the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 28]: Her first proceeding there was to unlock a tall press , bring out several bottles , and pour some of the contents of each into my mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 27]: I think they must have been taken out at random , for I am sure I tasted aniseed water , anchovy sauce , and salad dressing .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 89]: When she had administered these restoratives , as I was still quite hysterical , and unable to control my sobs , she put me on the sofa , with a shawl under my head , and the handkerchief from her own head under my feet , lest I should sully the cover ; and then , sitting herself down behind the green fan or screen I have already mentioned , so that I could not see her face , ejaculated at intervals , ` Mercy on us ! '
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 8]: letting those exclamations off like minute guns .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 8]: After a time she rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 14]: ` Janet , ' said my aunt , when her servant came in .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 21]: ` Go upstairs , give my compliments to Mr. Dick , and say I wish to speak to him . '
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 35]: Janet looked a little surprised to see me lying stiffly on the sofa -LRB- I was afraid to move lest it should be displeasing to my aunt -RRB- , but went on her errand .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 32]: My aunt , with her hands behind her , walked up and down the room , until the gentleman who had squinted at me from the upper window came in laughing .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 30]: ` Mr. Dick , ' said my aunt , ` do n't be a fool , because nobody can be more discreet than you can , when you choose .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 5]: We all know that .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 12]: So do n't be a fool , whatever you are . '
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 27]: The gentleman was serious immediately , and looked at me , I thought , as if he would entreat me to say nothing about the window .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 18]: ` Mr. Dick , ' said my aunt , ` you have heard me mention David Copperfield ?
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 18]: Now do n't pretend not to have a memory , because you and I know better . '
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 5]: ` David Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 16]: said Mr. Dick , who did not appear to me to remember much about it .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 4]: ` David Copperfield ?
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 7]: Oh yes , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 5]: David , certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 17]: ` Well , ' said my aunt , ` this is his boy -- his son .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 26]: He would be as like his father as it 's possible to be , if he was not so like his mother , too . '
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 5]: ` His son ? '
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 4]: said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 5]: ` David 's son ?
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 3]: Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 19]: ` Yes , ' pursued my aunt , ` and he has done a pretty piece of business .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 5]: He has run away .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 13]: His sister , Betsey Trotwood , never would have run away . '
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 21]: My aunt shook her head firmly , confident in the character and behaviour of the girl who never was born .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 10]: you think she would n't have run away ? '
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 4]: said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 19]: ` Bless and save the man , ' exclaimed my aunt , sharply , ` how he talks !
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 8]: Do n't I know she would n't ?
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 18]: She would have lived with her god-mother , and we should have been devoted to one another .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 23]: Where , in the name of wonder , should his sister , Betsey Trotwood , have run from , or to ? '
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 8]: ` Nowhere , ' said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 36]: ` Well then , ' returned my aunt , softened by the reply , ` how can you pretend to be wool-gathering , Dick , when you are as sharp as a surgeon 's lancet ?
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 26]: Now , here you see young David Copperfield , and the question I put to you is , what shall I do with him ? '
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 9]: ` What shall you do with him ? '
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 10]: said Mr. Dick , feebly , scratching his head .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 5]: do with him ? '
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 19]: ` Yes , ' said my aunt , with a grave look , and her forefinger held up .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 8]: I want some very sound advice . '
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 52]: ` Why , if I was you , ' said Mr. Dick , considering , and looking vacantly at me , ' I should -- ' The contemplation of me seemed to inspire him with a sudden idea , and he added , briskly , ' I should wash him ! '
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 30]: ` Janet , ' said my aunt , turning round with a quiet triumph , which I did not then understand , ` Mr. Dick sets us all right .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 5]: Heat the bath ! '
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 44]: Although I was deeply interested in this dialogue , I could not help observing my aunt , Mr. Dick , and Janet , while it was in progress , and completing a survey I had already been engaged in making of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 15]: My aunt was a tall , hard-featured lady , but by no means ill-looking .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 50]: There was an inflexibility in her face , in her voice , in her gait and carriage , amply sufficient to account for the effect she had made upon a gentle creature like my mother ; but her features were rather handsome than otherwise , though unbending and austere .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 13]: I particularly noticed that she had a very quick , bright eye .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 43]: Her hair , which was grey , was arranged in two plain divisions , under what I believe would be called a mob-cap ; I mean a cap , much more common then than now , with side-pieces fastening under the chin .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 28]: Her dress was of a lavender colour , and perfectly neat ; but scantily made , as if she desired to be as little encumbered as possible .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 25]: I remember that I thought it , in form , more like a riding-habit with the superfluous skirt cut off , than anything else .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 49]: She wore at her side a gentleman 's gold watch , if I might judge from its size and make , with an appropriate chain and seals ; she had some linen at her throat not unlike a shirt-collar , and things at her wrists like little shirt-wristbands .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 123]: Mr. Dick , as I have already said , was grey-headed , and florid : I should have said all about him , in saying so , had not his head been curiously bowed -- not by age ; it reminded me of one of Mr. Creakle 's boys ' heads after a beating -- and his grey eyes prominent and large , with a strange kind of watery brightness in them that made me , in combination with his vacant manner , his submission to my aunt , and his childish delight when she praised him , suspect him of being a little mad ; though , if he were mad , how he came to be there puzzled me extremely .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 49]: He was dressed like any other ordinary gentleman , in a loose grey morning coat and waistcoat , and white trousers ; and had his watch in his fob , and his money in his pockets : which he rattled as if he were very proud of it .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 20]: Janet was a pretty blooming girl , of about nineteen or twenty , and a perfect picture of neatness .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 64]: Though I made no further observation of her at the moment , I may mention here what I did not discover until afterwards , namely , that she was one of a series of protegees whom my aunt had taken into her service expressly to educate in a renouncement of mankind , and who had generally completed their abjuration by marrying the baker .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 11]: The room was as neat as Janet or my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 119]: As I laid down my pen , a moment since , to think of it , the air from the sea came blowing in again , mixed with the perfume of the flowers ; and I saw the old-fashioned furniture brightly rubbed and polished , my aunt 's inviolable chair and table by the round green fan in the bow-window , the drugget-covered carpet , the cat , the kettle-holder , the two canaries , the old china , the punchbowl full of dried rose-leaves , the tall press guarding all sorts of bottles and pots , and , wonderfully out of keeping with the rest , my dusty self upon the sofa , taking note of everything .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 38]: Janet had gone away to get the bath ready , when my aunt , to my great alarm , became in one moment rigid with indignation , and had hardly voice to cry out , ` Janet !
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 3]: Donkeys ! '
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 98]: Upon which , Janet came running up the stairs as if the house were in flames , darted out on a little piece of green in front , and warned off two saddle-donkeys , lady-ridden , that had presumed to set hoof upon it ; while my aunt , rushing out of the house , seized the bridle of a third animal laden with a bestriding child , turned him , led him forth from those sacred precincts , and boxed the ears of the unlucky urchin in attendance who had dared to profane that hallowed ground .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 44]: To this hour I do n't know whether my aunt had any lawful right of way over that patch of green ; but she had settled it in her own mind that she had , and it was all the same to her .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 25]: The one great outrage of her life , demanding to be constantly avenged , was the passage of a donkey over that immaculate spot .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 39]: In whatever occupation she was engaged , however interesting to her the conversation in which she was taking part , a donkey turned the current of her ideas in a moment , and she was upon him straight .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 42]: Jugs of water , and watering-pots , were kept in secret places ready to be discharged on the offending boys ; sticks were laid in ambush behind the door ; sallies were made at all hours ; and incessant war prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 34]: Perhaps this was an agreeable excitement to the donkey-boys ; or perhaps the more sagacious of the donkeys , understanding how the case stood , delighted with constitutional obstinacy in coming that way .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 63]: I only know that there were three alarms before the bath was ready ; and that on the occasion of the last and most desperate of all , I saw my aunt engage , single-handed , with a sandy-headed lad of fifteen , and bump his sandy head against her own gate , before he seemed to comprehend what was the matter .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 72]: These interruptions were of the more ridiculous to me , because she was giving me broth out of a table-spoon at the time -LRB- having firmly persuaded herself that I was actually starving , and must receive nourishment at first in very small quantities -RRB- , and , while my mouth was yet open to receive the spoon , she would put it back into the basin , cry ` Janet !
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 3]: Donkeys ! '
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 7]: and go out to the assault .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 7]: The bath was a great comfort .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 38]: For I began to be sensible of acute pains in my limbs from lying out in the fields , and was now so tired and low that I could hardly keep myself awake for five minutes together .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 40]: When I had bathed , they -LRB- I mean my aunt and Janet -RRB- enrobed me in a shirt and a pair of trousers belonging to Mr. Dick , and tied me up in two or three great shawls .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 21]: What sort of bundle I looked like , I do n't know , but I felt a very hot one .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 19]: Feeling also very faint and drowsy , I soon lay down on the sofa again and fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 60]: It might have been a dream , originating in the fancy which had occupied my mind so long , but I awoke with the impression that my aunt had come and bent over me , and had put my hair away from my face , and laid my head more comfortably , and had then stood looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 77]: The words , ` Pretty fellow , ' or ` Poor fellow , ' seemed to be in my ears , too ; but certainly there was nothing else , when I awoke , to lead me to believe that they had been uttered by my aunt , who sat in the bow-window gazing at the sea from behind the green fan , which was mounted on a kind of swivel , and turned any way .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 35]: We dined soon after I awoke , off a roast fowl and a pudding ; I sitting at table , not unlike a trussed bird myself , and moving my arms with considerable difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 17]: But as my aunt had swathed me up , I made no complaint of being inconvenienced .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 48]: All this time I was deeply anxious to know what she was going to do with me ; but she took her dinner in profound silence , except when she occasionally fixed her eyes on me sitting opposite , and said , ` Mercy upon us ! '
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 10]: which did not by any means relieve my anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 65]: The cloth being drawn , and some sherry put upon the table -LRB- of which I had a glass -RRB- , my aunt sent up for Mr. Dick again , who joined us , and looked as wise as he could when she requested him to attend to my story , which she elicited from me , gradually , by a course of questions .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 43]: During my recital , she kept her eyes on Mr. Dick , who I thought would have gone to sleep but for that , and who , whensoever he lapsed into a smile , was checked by a frown from my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 34]: ` Whatever possessed that poor unfortunate Baby , that she must go and be married again , ' said my aunt , when I had finished , ' I ca n't conceive . '
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 16]: ` Perhaps she fell in love with her second husband , ' Mr. Dick suggested .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 6]: ` Fell in love ! '
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 4]: repeated my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 6]: ` What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 9]: What business had she to do it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 21]: ` Perhaps , ' Mr. Dick simpered , after thinking a little , ` she did it for pleasure . '
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 6]: ` Pleasure , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 5]: replied my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 29]: A mighty pleasure for the poor Baby to fix her simple faith upon any dog of a fellow , certain to ill-use her in some way or other .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 13]: What did she propose to herself , I should like to know !
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 6]: She had had one husband .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 21]: She had seen David Copperfield out of the world , who was always running after wax dolls from his cradle .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 28]: She had got a baby -- oh , there were a pair of babies when she gave birth to this child sitting here , that Friday night !
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 9]: -- and what more did she want ? '
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 20]: Mr. Dick secretly shook his head at me , as if he thought there was no getting over this .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 17]: ` She could n't even have a baby like anybody else , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 11]: ` Where was this child 's sister , Betsey Trotwood ?
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 3]: Not forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 6]: Do n't tell me ! '
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 6]: Mr. Dick seemed quite frightened .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 34]: ` That little man of a doctor , with his head on one side , ' said my aunt , ` Jellips , or whatever his name was , what was he about ?
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 27]: All he could do , was to say to me , like a robin redbreast -- as he is -- `` It 's a boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 3]: A boy !
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 12]: Yah , the imbecility of the whole set of 'em ! '
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 23]: The heartiness of the ejaculation startled Mr. Dick exceedingly ; and me , too , if I am to tell the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 64]: ` And then , as if this was not enough , and she had not stood sufficiently in the light of this child 's sister , Betsey Trotwood , ' said my aunt , ` she marries a second time -- goes and marries a Murderer -- or a man with a name like it -- and stands in THIS child 's light !
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 21]: And the natural consequence is , as anybody but a baby might have foreseen , that he prowls and wanders .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 17]: He 's as like Cain before he was grown up , as he can be . '
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 16]: Mr. Dick looked hard at me , as if to identify me in this character .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 28]: ` And then there 's that woman with the Pagan name , ' said my aunt , ` that Peggotty , she goes and gets married next .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 25]: Because she has not seen enough of the evil attending such things , she goes and gets married next , as the child relates .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 38]: I only hope , ' said my aunt , shaking her head , ` that her husband is one of those Poker husbands who abound in the newspapers , and will beat her well with one . '
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 21]: I could not bear to hear my old nurse so decried , and made the subject of such a wish .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 10]: I told my aunt that indeed she was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 65]: That Peggotty was the best , the truest , the most faithful , most devoted , and most self-denying friend and servant in the world ; who had ever loved me dearly , who had ever loved my mother dearly ; who had held my mother 's dying head upon her arm , on whose face my mother had imprinted her last grateful kiss .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 90]: And my remembrance of them both , choking me , I broke down as I was trying to say that her home was my home , and that all she had was mine , and that I would have gone to her for shelter , but for her humble station , which made me fear that I might bring some trouble on her - I broke down , I say , as I was trying to say so , and laid my face in my hands upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 6]: ` Well , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 21]: said my aunt , ` the child is right to stand by those who have stood by him -- Janet !
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 3]: Donkeys ! '
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 48]: I thoroughly believe that but for those unfortunate donkeys , we should have come to a good understanding ; for my aunt had laid her hand on my shoulder , and the impulse was upon me , thus emboldened , to embrace her and beseech her protection .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 67]: But the interruption , and the disorder she was thrown into by the struggle outside , put an end to all softer ideas for the present , and kept my aunt indignantly declaiming to Mr. Dick about her determination to appeal for redress to the laws of her country , and to bring actions for trespass against the whole donkey proprietorship of Dover , until tea-time .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 52]: After tea , we sat at the window -- on the look-out , as I imagined , from my aunt 's sharp expression of face , for more invaders -- until dusk , when Janet set candles , and a backgammon-board , on the table , and pulled down the blinds .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 33]: ` Now , Mr. Dick , ' said my aunt , with her grave look , and her forefinger up as before , ' I am going to ask you another question .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 6]: Look at this child . '
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 6]: ` David 's son ? '
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 11]: said Mr. Dick , with an attentive , puzzled face .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 9]: ` Exactly so , ' returned my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 11]: ` What would you do with him , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 8]: ` Do with David 's son ? '
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 4]: said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 15]: ` Ay , ' replied my aunt , ` with David 's son . '
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 4]: said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 11]: Do with -- I should put him to bed . '
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 4]: ` Janet ! '
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 15]: cried my aunt , with the same complacent triumph that I had remarked before .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 8]: ` Mr. Dick sets us all right .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 15]: If the bed is ready , we 'll take him up to it . '
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 37]: Janet reporting it to be quite ready , I was taken up to it ; kindly , but in some sort like a prisoner ; my aunt going in front and Janet bringing up the rear .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 50]: The only circumstance which gave me any new hope , was my aunt 's stopping on the stairs to inquire about a smell of fire that was prevalent there ; and janet 's replying that she had been making tinder down in the kitchen , of my old shirt .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 50]: But there were no other clothes in my room than the odd heap of things I wore ; and when I was left there , with a little taper which my aunt forewarned me would burn exactly five minutes , I heard them lock my door on the outside .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 47]: Turning these things over in my mind I deemed it possible that my aunt , who could know nothing of me , might suspect I had a habit of running away , and took precautions , on that account , to have me in safe keeping .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 26]: The room was a pleasant one , at the top of the house , overlooking the sea , on which the moon was shining brilliantly .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 80]: After I had said my prayers , and the candle had burnt out , I remember how I still sat looking at the moonlight on the water , as if I could hope to read my fortune in it , as in a bright book ; or to see my mother with her child , coming from Heaven , along that shining path , to look upon me as she had looked when I last saw her sweet face .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 49]: I remember how the solemn feeling with which at length I turned my eyes away , yielded to the sensation of gratitude and rest which the sight of the white-curtained bed -- and how much more the lying softly down upon it , nestling in the snow-white sheets !
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 3]: -- inspired .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 39]: I remember how I thought of all the solitary places under the night sky where I had slept , and how I prayed that I never might be houseless any more , and never might forget the houseless .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 28]: I remember how I seemed to float , then , down the melancholy glory of that track upon the sea , away into the world of dreams .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 64]: Chapter 14 My Aunt Makes up Her Mind About Me On going down in the morning , I found my aunt musing so profoundly over the breakfast table , with her elbow on the tray , that the contents of the urn had overflowed the teapot and were laying the whole table-cloth under water , when my entrance put her meditations to flight .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 26]: I felt sure that I had been the subject of her reflections , and was more than ever anxious to know her intentions towards me .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 15]: Yet I dared not express my anxiety , lest it should give her offence .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 25]: My eyes , however , not being so much under control as my tongue , were attracted towards my aunt very often during breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 47]: I never could look at her for a few moments together but I found her looking at me -- in an odd thoughtful manner , as if I were an immense way off , instead of being on the other side of the small round table .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 46]: When she had finished her breakfast , my aunt very deliberately leaned back in her chair , knitted her brows , folded her arms , and contemplated me at her leisure , with such a fixedness of attention that I was quite overpowered by embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 91]: Not having as yet finished my own breakfast , I attempted to hide my confusion by proceeding with it ; but my knife tumbled over my fork , my fork tripped up my knife , I chipped bits of bacon a surprising height into the air instead of cutting them for my own eating , and choked myself with my tea , which persisted in going the wrong way instead of the right one , until I gave in altogether , and sat blushing under my aunt 's close scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 4]: ` Hallo ! '
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 9]: said my aunt , after a long time .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 13]: I looked up , and met her sharp bright glance respectfully . '
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 11]: I have written to him , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 5]: ` To -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 11]: ` To your father-in-law , ' said my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 29]: I have sent him a letter that I 'll trouble him to attend to , or he and I will fall out , I can tell him ! '
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 11]: ` Does he know where I am , aunt ? '
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 6]: I inquired , alarmed . '
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 14]: I have told him , ' said my aunt , with a nod .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 12]: ` Shall I -- be -- given up to him ? '
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 4]: I faltered . '
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 10]: I do n't know , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 6]: ` We shall see . '
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 26]: I ca n't think what I shall do , ' I exclaimed , ` if I have to go back to Mr. Murdstone ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 18]: I do n't know anything about it , ' said my aunt , shaking her head . '
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 9]: I ca n't say , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 5]: We shall see . '
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 17]: My spirits sank under these words , and I became very downcast and heavy of heart .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 71]: My aunt , without appearing to take much heed of me , put on a coarse apron with a bib , which she took out of the press ; washed up the teacups with her own hands ; and , when everything was washed and set in the tray again , and the cloth folded and put on the top of the whole , rang for Janet to remove it .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 54]: She next swept up the crumbs with a little broom -LRB- putting on a pair of gloves first -RRB- , until there did not appear to be one microscopic speck left on the carpet ; next dusted and arranged the room , which was dusted and arranged to a hair ` sbreadth already .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 69]: When all these tasks were performed to her satisfaction , she took off the gloves and apron , folded them up , put them in the particular corner of the press from which they had been taken , brought out her work-box to her own table in the open window , and sat down , with the green fan between her and the light , to work . '
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 43]: I wish you 'd go upstairs , ' said my aunt , as she threaded her needle , ` and give my compliments to Mr. Dick , and I 'll be glad to know how he gets on with his Memorial . '
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 14]: I rose with all alacrity , to acquit myself of this commission . '
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 35]: I suppose , ' said my aunt , eyeing me as narrowly as she had eyed the needle in threading it , ` you think Mr. Dick a short name , eh ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 15]: I thought it was rather a short name , yesterday , ' I confessed .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 32]: ` You are not to suppose that he has n't got a longer name , if he chose to use it , ' said my aunt , with a loftier air .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 16]: ` Babley -- Mr. Richard Babley -- that 's the gentleman 's true name . '
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 58]: I was going to suggest , with a modest sense of my youth and the familiarity I had been already guilty of , that I had better give him the full benefit of that name , when my aunt went on to say : ` But do n't you call him by it , whatever you do .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 7]: He ca n't bear his name .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 7]: That 's a peculiarity of his .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 39]: Though I do n't know that it 's much of a peculiarity , either ; for he has been ill-used enough , by some that bear it , to have a mortal antipathy for it , Heaven knows .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 25]: Mr. Dick is his name here , and everywhere else , now -- if he ever went anywhere else , which he do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 17]: So take care , child , you do n't call him anything BUT Mr. Dick . '
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 62]: I promised to obey , and went upstairs with my message ; thinking , as I went , that if Mr. Dick had been working at his Memorial long , at the same rate as I had seen him working at it , through the open door , when I came down , he was probably getting on very well indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 21]: I found him still driving at it with a long pen , and his head almost laid upon the paper .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 66]: He was so intent upon it , that I had ample leisure to observe the large paper kite in a corner , the confusion of bundles of manuscript , the number of pens , and , above all , the quantity of ink -LRB- which he seemed to have in , in half-gallon jars by the dozen -RRB- , before he observed my being present .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 3]: Phoebus ! '
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 9]: said Mr. Dick , laying down his pen .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 7]: ` How does the world go ?
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 53]: I 'll tell you what , ' he added , in a lower tone , ' I should n't wish it to be mentioned , but it 's a -- ' here he beckoned to me , and put his lips close to my ear -- ` it 's a mad world .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 7]: Mad as Bedlam , boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 18]: said Mr. Dick , taking snuff from a round box on the table , and laughing heartily .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 15]: Without presuming to give my opinion on this question , I delivered my message .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 28]: ` Well , ' said Mr. Dick , in answer , ` my compliments to her , and I -- I believe I have made a start .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 32]: I think I have made a start , ' said Mr. Dick , passing his hand among his grey hair , and casting anything but a confident look at his manuscript .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 8]: ` You have been to school ? '
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 16]: ` Yes , sir , ' I answered ; ` for a short time . '
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 40]: ` Do you recollect the date , ' said Mr. Dick , looking earnestly at me , and taking up his pen to note it down , ` when King Charles the First had his head cut off ? '
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 14]: I said I believed it happened in the year sixteen hundred and forty-nine .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 21]: ` Well , ' returned Mr. Dick , scratching his ear with his pen , and looking dubiously at me .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 16]: ` So the books say ; but I do n't see how that can be .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 40]: Because , if it was so long ago , how could the people about him have made that mistake of putting some of the trouble out of his head , after it was taken off , into mine ? '
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 18]: I was very much surprised by the inquiry ; but could give no information on this point .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 38]: ` It 's very strange , ' said Mr. Dick , with a despondent look upon his papers , and with his hand among his hair again , ` that I never can get that quite right .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 8]: I never can make that perfectly clear .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 8]: But no matter , no matter ! '
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 14]: he said cheerfully , and rousing himself , ` there 's time enough !
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 15]: My compliments to Miss Trotwood , I am getting on very well indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 14]: I was going away , when he directed my attention to the kite .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 12]: ` What do you think of that for a kite ? '
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 9]: I answered that it was a beautiful one .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 15]: I should think it must have been as much as seven feet high . '
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 4]: I made it .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 16]: We 'll go and fly it , you and I , ' said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 7]: ` Do you see this ? '
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 49]: He showed me that it was covered with manuscript , very closely and laboriously written ; but so plainly , that as I looked along the lines , I thought I saw some allusion to King Charles the First 's head again , in one or two places .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 27]: ` There 's plenty of string , ' said Mr. Dick , ` and when it flies high , it takes the facts a long way .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 8]: That 's my manner of diffusing 'em .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 10]: I do n't know where they may come down .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 23]: It 's according to circumstances , and the wind , and so forth ; but I take my chance of that . '
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 40]: His face was so very mild and pleasant , and had something so reverend in it , though it was hale and hearty , that I was not sure but that he was having a good-humoured jest with me .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 16]: So I laughed , and he laughed , and we parted the best friends possible .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 15]: ` Well , child , ' said my aunt , when I went downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 11]: ` And what of Mr. Dick , this morning ? '
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 17]: I informed her that he sent his compliments , and was getting on very well indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 9]: ` What do you think of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 56]: I had some shadowy idea of endeavouring to evade the question , by replying that I thought him a very nice gentleman ; but my aunt was not to be so put off , for she laid her work down in her lap , and said , folding her hands upon it : ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 16]: Your sister Betsey Trotwood would have told me what she thought of anyone , directly .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 14]: Be as like your sister as you can , and speak out ! '
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 30]: ` Is he -- is Mr. Dick -- I ask because I do n't know , aunt -- is he at all out of his mind , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 12]: I stammered ; for I felt I was on dangerous ground .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 10]: ` Not a morsel , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 6]: ` Oh , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 4]: I observed faintly .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 34]: ` If there is anything in the world , ' said my aunt , with great decision and force of manner , ` that Mr. Dick is not , it 's that . '
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 17]: I had nothing better to offer , than another timid , ` Oh , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 13]: ` He has been CALLED mad , ' said my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 49]: I have a selfish pleasure in saying he has been called mad , or I should not have had the benefit of his society and advice for these last ten years and upwards -- in fact , ever since your sister , Betsey Trotwood , disappointed me . '
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 7]: ` So long as that ? '
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 21]: ` And nice people they were , who had the audacity to call him mad , ' pursued my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 25]: ` Mr. Dick is a sort of distant connexion of mine - it does n't matter how ; I need n't enter into that .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 19]: If it had n't been for me , his own brother would have shut him up for life .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 5]: That 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 32]: I am afraid it was hypocritical in me , but seeing that my aunt felt strongly on the subject , I tried to look as if I felt strongly too . '
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 5]: A proud fool ! '
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 64]: ` Because his brother was a little eccentric -- though he is not half so eccentric as a good many people -- he did n't like to have him visible about his house , and sent him away to some private asylum-place : though he had been left to his particular care by their deceased father , who thought him almost a natural .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 12]: And a wise man he must have been to think so !
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 7]: Mad himself , no doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 17]: Again , as my aunt looked quite convinced , I endeavoured to look quite convinced also .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 18]: ` So I stepped in , ' said my aunt , ` and made him an offer .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 29]: I said , `` Your brother 's sane -- a great deal more sane than you are , or ever will be , it is to be hoped .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 14]: Let him have his little income , and come and live with me .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 38]: I am not afraid of him , I am not proud , I am ready to take care of him , and shall not ill-treat him as some people -LRB- besides the asylum-folks -RRB- have done . ''
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 25]: After a good deal of squabbling , ' said my aunt , ' I got him ; and he has been here ever since .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 16]: He is the most friendly and amenable creature in existence ; and as for advice !
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 15]: -- But nobody knows what that man 's mind is , except myself . '
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 32]: My aunt smoothed her dress and shook her head , as if she smoothed defiance of the whole world out of the one , and shook it out of the other .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 23]: ` He had a favourite sister , ' said my aunt , ' a good creature , and very kind to him .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 12]: But she did what they all do -- took a husband .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 12]: And HE did what they all do -- made her wretched .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 21]: It had such an effect upon the mind of Mr. Dick -LRB- that 's not madness , I hope ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 24]: that , combined with his fear of his brother , and his sense of his unkindness , it threw him into a fever .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 20]: That was before he came to me , but the recollection of it is oppressive to him even now .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 15]: Did he say anything to you about King Charles the First , child ? '
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 6]: ` Yes , aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 15]: said my aunt , rubbing her nose as if she were a little vexed .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 10]: ` That 's his allegorical way of expressing it .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 34]: He connects his illness with great disturbance and agitation , naturally , and that 's the figure , or the simile , or whatever it 's called , which he chooses to use .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 12]: And why should n't he , if he thinks proper ! '
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 9]: I said : ` Certainly , aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 21]: ` It 's not a business-like way of speaking , ' said my aunt , ` nor a worldly way .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 31]: I am aware of that ; and that 's the reason why I insist upon it , that there sha n't be a word about it in his Memorial . '
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 17]: ` Is it a Memorial about his own history that he is writing , aunt ? '
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 15]: ` Yes , child , ' said my aunt , rubbing her nose again .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 35]: ` He is memorializing the Lord Chancellor , or the Lord Somebody or other -- one of those people , at all events , who are paid to be memorialized - about his affairs .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 12]: I suppose it will go in , one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 31]: He has n't been able to draw it up yet , without introducing that mode of expressing himself ; but it do n't signify ; it keeps him employed . '
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 44]: In fact , I found out afterwards that Mr. Dick had been for upwards of ten years endeavouring to keep King Charles the First out of the Memorial ; but he had been constantly getting into it , and was there now . '
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 33]: I say again , ' said my aunt , ` nobody knows what that man 's mind is except myself ; and he 's the most amenable and friendly creature in existence .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 13]: If he likes to fly a kite sometimes , what of that !
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 7]: Franklin used to fly a kite .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 17]: He was a Quaker , or something of that sort , if I am not mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 17]: And a Quaker flying a kite is a much more ridiculous object than anybody else . '
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 48]: If I could have supposed that my aunt had recounted these particulars for my especial behoof , and as a piece of confidence in me , I should have felt very much distinguished , and should have augured favourably from such a mark of her good opinion .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 46]: But I could hardly help observing that she had launched into them , chiefly because the question was raised in her own mind , and with very little reference to me , though she had addressed herself to me in the absence of anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 40]: At the same time , I must say that the generosity of her championship of poor harmless Mr. Dick , not only inspired my young breast with some selfish hope for myself , but warmed it unselfishly towards her .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 30]: I believe that I began to know that there was something about my aunt , notwithstanding her many eccentricities and odd humours , to be honoured and trusted in .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 86]: Though she was just as sharp that day as on the day before , and was in and out about the donkeys just as often , and was thrown into a tremendous state of indignation , when a young man , going by , ogled Janet at a window -LRB- which was one of the gravest misdemeanours that could be committed against my aunt 's dignity -RRB- , she seemed to me to command more of my respect , if not less of my fear .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 57]: The anxiety I underwent , in the interval which necessarily elapsed before a reply could be received to her letter to Mr. Murdstone , was extreme ; but I made an endeavour to suppress it , and to be as agreeable as I could in a quiet way , both to my aunt and Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 79]: The latter and I would have gone out to fly the great kite ; but that I had still no other clothes than the anything but ornamental garments with which I had been decorated on the first day , and which confined me to the house , except for an hour after dark , when my aunt , for my health 's sake , paraded me up and down on the cliff outside , before going to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 34]: At length the reply from Mr. Murdstone came , and my aunt informed me , to my infinite terror , that he was coming to speak to her herself on the next day .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 54]: On the next day , still bundled up in my curious habiliments , I sat counting the time , flushed and heated by the conflict of sinking hopes and rising fears within me ; and waiting to be startled by the sight of the gloomy face , whose non-arrival startled me every minute .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 32]: My aunt was a little more imperious and stern than usual , but I observed no other token of her preparing herself to receive the visitor so much dreaded by me .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 37]: She sat at work in the window , and I sat by , with my thoughts running astray on all possible and impossible results of Mr. Murdstone 's visit , until pretty late in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 71]: Our dinner had been indefinitely postponed ; but it was growing so late , that my aunt had ordered it to be got ready , when she gave a sudden alarm of donkeys , and to my consternation and amazement , I beheld Miss Murdstone , on a side-saddle , ride deliberately over the sacred piece of green , and stop in front of the house , looking about her .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 7]: ` Go along with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 14]: cried my aunt , shaking her head and her fist at the window .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 7]: ` You have no business there .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 5]: How dare you trespass ?
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 3]: Go along !
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 5]: you bold-faced thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 36]: My aunt was so exasperated by the coolness with which Miss Murdstone looked about her , that I really believe she was motionless , and unable for the moment to dart out according to custom .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 42]: I seized the opportunity to inform her who it was ; and that the gentleman now coming near the offender -LRB- for the way up was very steep , and he had dropped behind -RRB- , was Mr. Murdstone himself . '
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 9]: I do n't care who it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 18]: cried my aunt , still shaking her head and gesticulating anything but welcome from the bow-window . '
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 7]: I wo n't be trespassed upon .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 6]: I wo n't allow it .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 3]: Go away !
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 6]: Janet , turn him round .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 5]: Lead him off ! '
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 75]: and I saw , from behind my aunt , a sort of hurried battle-piece , in which the donkey stood resisting everybody , with all his four legs planted different ways , while Janet tried to pull him round by the bridle , Mr. Murdstone tried to lead him on , Miss Murdstone struck at Janet with a parasol , and several boys , who had come to see the engagement , shouted vigorously .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 104]: But my aunt , suddenly descrying among them the young malefactor who was the donkey 's guardian , and who was one of the most inveterate offenders against her , though hardly in his teens , rushed out to the scene of action , pounced upon him , captured him , dragged him , with his jacket over his head , and his heels grinding the ground , into the garden , and , calling upon Janet to fetch the constables and justices , that he might be taken , tried , and executed on the spot , held him at bay there .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 62]: This part of the business , however , did not last long ; for the young rascal , being expert at a variety of feints and dodges , of which my aunt had no conception , soon went whooping away , leaving some deep impressions of his nailed boots in the flower-beds , and taking his donkey in triumph with him .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 39]: Miss Murdstone , during the latter portion of the contest , had dismounted , and was now waiting with her brother at the bottom of the steps , until my aunt should be at leisure to receive them .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 36]: My aunt , a little ruffled by the combat , marched past them into the house , with great dignity , and took no notice of their presence , until they were announced by Janet .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 9]: ` Shall I go away , aunt ? '
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 5]: I asked , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 10]: ` No , sir , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 5]: ` Certainly not ! '
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 31]: With which she pushed me into a corner near her , and fenced Me in with a chair , as if it were a prison or a bar of justice .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 25]: This position I continued to occupy during the whole interview , and from it I now saw Mr. and Miss Murdstone enter the room .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 20]: said my aunt , ' I was not aware at first to whom I had the pleasure of objecting .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 12]: But I do n't allow anybody to ride over that turf .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 5]: I make no exceptions .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 10]: I do n't allow anybody to do it . '
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 14]: ` Your regulation is rather awkward to strangers , ' said Miss Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 5]: ` Is it ! '
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 20]: Mr. Murdstone seemed afraid of a renewal of hostilities , and interposing began : ` Miss Trotwood ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 14]: I beg your pardon , ' observed my aunt with a keen look .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 22]: ` You are the Mr. Murdstone who married the widow of my late nephew , David Copperfield , of Blunderstone Rookery !
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 12]: -- Though why Rookery , I do n't know ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 8]: I am , ' said Mr. Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 39]: ` You 'll excuse my saying , sir , ' returned my aunt , ` that I think it would have been a much better and happier thing if you had left that poor child alone . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 39]: I so far agree with what Miss Trotwood has remarked , ' observed Miss Murdstone , bridling , ` that I consider our lamented Clara to have been , in all essential respects , a mere child . '
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 48]: ` It is a comfort to you and me , ma'am , ' said my aunt , ` who are getting on in life , and are not likely to be made unhappy by our personal attractions , that nobody can say the same of us . '
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 5]: ` No doubt ! '
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 18]: returned Miss Murdstone , though , I thought , not with a very ready or gracious assent .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 30]: ` And it certainly might have been , as you say , a better and happier thing for my brother if he had never entered into such a marriage .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 10]: I have always been of that opinion . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 12]: I have no doubt you have , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 23]: ` Janet , ' ringing the bell , ` my compliments to Mr. Dick , and beg him to come down . '
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 17]: Until he came , my aunt sat perfectly upright and stiff , frowning at the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 12]: When he came , my aunt performed the ceremony of introduction .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 4]: ` Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 6]: An old and intimate friend .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 34]: On whose judgement , ' said my aunt , with emphasis , as an admonition to Mr. Dick , who was biting his forefinger and looking rather foolish , ' I rely . '
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 29]: Mr. Dick took his finger out of his mouth , on this hint , and stood among the group , with a grave and attentive expression of face .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 58]: My aunt inclined her head to Mr. Murdstone , who went on : ` Miss Trotwood : on the receipt of your letter , I considered it an act of greater justice to myself , and perhaps of more respect to you - ' ` Thank you , ' said my aunt , still eyeing him keenly .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 8]: ` You need n't mind me . '
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 23]: ` To answer it in person , however inconvenient the journey , ' pursued Mr. Murdstone , ` rather than by letter .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 43]: This unhappy boy who has run away from his friends and his occupation -- ' ` And whose appearance , ' interposed his sister , directing general attention to me in my indefinable costume , ` is perfectly scandalous and disgraceful . '
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 18]: ` Jane Murdstone , ' said her brother , ` have the goodness not to interrupt me .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 31]: This unhappy boy , Miss Trotwood , has been the occasion of much domestic trouble and uneasiness ; both during the lifetime of my late dear wife , and since .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 19]: He has a sullen , rebellious spirit ; a violent temper ; and an untoward , intractable disposition .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 15]: Both my sister and myself have endeavoured to correct his vices , but ineffectually .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 39]: And I have felt -- we both have felt , I may say ; my sister being fully in my confidence -- that it is right you should receive this grave and dispassionate assurance from our lips . '
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 47]: ` It can hardly be necessary for me to confirm anything stated by my brother , ' said Miss Murdstone ; ` but I beg to observe , that , of all the boys in the world , I believe this is the worst boy . '
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 4]: ` Strong ! '
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 6]: said my aunt , shortly .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 16]: ` But not at all too strong for the facts , ' returned Miss Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 4]: ` Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 7]: ` Well , sir ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 71]: I have my own opinions , ' resumed Mr. Murdstone , whose face darkened more and more , the more he and my aunt observed each other , which they did very narrowly , ` as to the best mode of bringing him up ; they are founded , in part , on my knowledge of him , and in part on my knowledge of my own means and resources .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 21]: I am responsible for them to myself , I act upon them , and I say no more about them .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 61]: It is enough that I place this boy under the eye of a friend of my own , in a respectable business ; that it does not please him ; that he runs away from it ; makes himself a common vagabond about the country ; and comes here , in rags , to appeal to you , Miss Trotwood .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 31]: I wish to set before you , honourably , the exact consequences -- so far as they are within my knowledge -- of your abetting him in this appeal . '
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 13]: ` But about the respectable business first , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 25]: ` If he had been your own boy , you would have put him to it , just the same , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 33]: ` If he had been my brother 's own boy , ' returned Miss Murdstone , striking in , ` his character , I trust , would have been altogether different . '
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 28]: ` Or if the poor child , his mother , had been alive , he would still have gone into the respectable business , would he ? '
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 5]: said my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 37]: I believe , ' said Mr. Murdstone , with an inclination of his head , ` that Clara would have disputed nothing which myself and my sister Jane Murdstone were agreed was for the best . '
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 9]: Miss Murdstone confirmed this with an audible murmur .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 5]: ` Unfortunate baby ! '
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 47]: Mr. Dick , who had been rattling his money all this time , was rattling it so loudly now , that my aunt felt it necessary to check him with a look , before saying : ` The poor child 's annuity died with her ? '
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 10]: ` Died with her , ' replied Mr. Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 33]: ` And there was no settlement of the little property -- the house and garden -- the what 's - its-name Rookery without any rooks in it -- upon her boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 33]: ` It had been left to her , unconditionally , by her first husband , ' Mr. Murdstone began , when my aunt caught him up with the greatest irascibility and impatience .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 14]: ` Good Lord , man , there 's no occasion to say that .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 5]: Left to her unconditionally !
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 26]: I think I see David Copperfield looking forward to any condition of any sort or kind , though it stared him point-blank in the face !
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 9]: Of course it was left to her unconditionally .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 45]: But when she married again -- when she took that most disastrous step of marrying you , in short , ' said my aunt , ` to be plain -- did no one put in a word for the boy at that time ? '
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 24]: ` My late wife loved her second husband , ma'am , ' said Mr. Murdstone , ` and trusted implicitly in him . '
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 30]: ` Your late wife , sir , was a most unworldly , most unhappy , most unfortunate baby , ' returned my aunt , shaking her head at him .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 7]: ` That 's what she was .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 12]: And now , what have you got to say next ? '
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 12]: ` Merely this , Miss Trotwood , ' he returned . '
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 33]: I am here to take David back -- to take him back unconditionally , to dispose of him as I think proper , and to deal with him as I think right .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 16]: I am not here to make any promise , or give any pledge to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 25]: You may possibly have some idea , Miss Trotwood , of abetting him in his running away , and in his complaints to you .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 21]: Your manner , which I must say does not seem intended to propitiate , induces me to think it possible .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 42]: Now I must caution you that if you abet him once , you abet him for good and all ; if you step in between him and me , now , you must step in , Miss Trotwood , for ever .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 10]: I can not trifle , or be trifled with .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 16]: I am here , for the first and last time , to take him away .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 6]: Is he ready to go ?
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 47]: If he is not -- and you tell me he is not ; on any pretence ; it is indifferent to me what -- my doors are shut against him henceforth , and yours , I take it for granted , are open to him . '
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 32]: To this address , my aunt had listened with the closest attention , sitting perfectly upright , with her hands folded on one knee , and looking grimly on the speaker .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 38]: When he had finished , she turned her eyes so as to command Miss Murdstone , without otherwise disturbing her attitude , and said : ` Well , ma'am , have YOU got anything to remark ? '
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 56]: ` Indeed , Miss Trotwood , ' said Miss Murdstone , ` all that I could say has been so well said by my brother , and all that I know to be the fact has been so plainly stated by him , that I have nothing to add except my thanks for your politeness .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 37]: For your very great politeness , I am sure , ' said Miss Murdstone ; with an irony which no more affected my aunt , than it discomposed the cannon I had slept by at Chatham .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 9]: ` And what does the boy say ? '
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 10]: ` Are you ready to go , David ? '
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 13]: I answered no , and entreated her not to let me go .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 21]: I said that neither Mr. nor Miss Murdstone had ever liked me , or had ever been kind to me .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 30]: That they had made my mama , who always loved me dearly , unhappy about me , and that I knew it well , and that Peggotty knew it .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 23]: I said that I had been more miserable than I thought anybody could believe , who only knew how young I was .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 38]: And I begged and prayed my aunt -- I forget in what terms now , but I remember that they affected me very much then -- to befriend and protect me , for my father 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 19]: ` Mr. Dick , ' said my aunt , ` what shall I do with this child ? '
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 23]: Mr. Dick considered , hesitated , brightened , and rejoined , ` Have him measured for a suit of clothes directly . '
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 24]: ` Mr. Dick , ' said my aunt triumphantly , ` give me your hand , for your common sense is invaluable . '
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 35]: Having shaken it with great cordiality , she pulled me towards her and said to Mr. Murdstone : ` You can go when you like ; I 'll take my chance with the boy .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 25]: If he 's all you say he is , at least I can do as much for him then , as you have done .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 11]: But I do n't believe a word of it . '
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 28]: ` Miss Trotwood , ' rejoined Mr. Murdstone , shrugging his shoulders , as he rose , ` if you were a gentleman -- ' ` Bah !
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 5]: Stuff and nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 8]: ` Do n't talk to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 6]: ` How exquisitely polite ! '
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 6]: exclaimed Miss Murdstone , rising .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 6]: ` Overpowering , really ! '
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 57]: ` Do you think I do n't know , ' said my aunt , turning a deaf ear to the sister , and continuing to address the brother , and to shake her head at him with infinite expression , ` what kind of life you must have led that poor , unhappy , misdirected baby ?
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 47]: Do you think I do n't know what a woeful day it was for the soft little creature when you first came in her way -- smirking and making great eyes at her , I 'll be bound , as if you could n't say boh !
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 6]: to a goose ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 8]: I never heard anything so elegant ! '
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 4]: said Miss Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 48]: ` Do you think I ca n't understand you as well as if I had seen you , ' pursued my aunt , ` now that I DO see and hear you -- which , I tell you candidly , is anything but a pleasure to me ?
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 6]: Oh yes , bless us !
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 11]: who so smooth and silky as Mr. Murdstone at first !
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 12]: The poor , benighted innocent had never seen such a man .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 6]: He was made of sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 4]: He worshipped her .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 11]: He doted on her boy -- tenderly doted on him !
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 26]: He was to be another father to him , and they were all to live together in a garden of roses , were n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 2]: Ugh !
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 8]: Get along with you , do ! '
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 5]: said my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 12]: I never heard anything like this person in my life ! '
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 4]: exclaimed Miss Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 63]: ` And when you had made sure of the poor little fool , ' said my aunt - ` God forgive me that I should call her so , and she gone where YOU wo n't go in a hurry -- because you had not done wrong enough to her and hers , you must begin to train her , must you ?
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 27]: begin to break her , like a poor caged bird , and wear her deluded life away , in teaching her to sing YOUR notes ? '
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 44]: ` This is either insanity or intoxication , ' said Miss Murdstone , in a perfect agony at not being able to turn the current of my aunt 's address towards herself ; ` and my suspicion is that it 's intoxication . '
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 28]: Miss Betsey , without taking the least notice of the interruption , continued to address herself to Mr. Murdstone as if there had been no such thing .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 30]: ` Mr. Murdstone , ' she said , shaking her finger at him , ` you were a tyrant to the simple baby , and you broke her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 38]: She was a loving baby -- I know that ; I knew it , years before you ever saw her - and through the best part of her weakness you gave her the wounds she died of .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 13]: There is the truth for your comfort , however you like it .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 13]: And you and your instruments may make the most of it . '
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 40]: ` Allow me to inquire , Miss Trotwood , ' interposed Miss Murdstone , ` whom you are pleased to call , in a choice of words in which I am not experienced , my brother 's instruments ? '
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 79]: ` It was clear enough , as I have told you , years before YOU ever saw her -- and why , in the mysterious dispensations of Providence , you ever did see her , is more than humanity can comprehend -- it was clear enough that the poor soft little thing would marry somebody , at some time or other ; but I did hope it would n't have been as bad as it has turned out .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 48]: That was the time , Mr. Murdstone , when she gave birth to her boy here , ' said my aunt ; ` to the poor child you sometimes tormented her through afterwards , which is a disagreeable remembrance and makes the sight of him odious now .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 4]: Aye , aye !
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 6]: you need n't wince ! '
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 5]: said my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 9]: I know it 's true without that . '
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 29]: He had stood by the door , all this while , observant of her with a smile upon his face , though his black eyebrows were heavily contracted .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 35]: I remarked now , that , though the smile was on his face still , his colour had gone in a moment , and he seemed to breathe as if he had been running .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 15]: ` Good day , sir , ' said my aunt , ` and good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 20]: Good day to you , too , ma'am , ' said my aunt , turning suddenly upon his sister .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 38]: ` Let me see you ride a donkey over my green again , and as sure as you have a head upon your shoulders , I 'll knock your bonnet off , and tread upon it ! '
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 38]: It would require a painter , and no common painter too , to depict my aunt 's face as she delivered herself of this very unexpected sentiment , and Miss Murdstone 's face as she heard it .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 77]: But the manner of the speech , no less than the matter , was so fiery , that Miss Murdstone , without a word in answer , discreetly put her arm through her brother 's , and walked haughtily out of the cottage ; my aunt remaining in the window looking after them ; prepared , I have no doubt , in case of the donkey 's reappearance , to carry her threat into instant execution .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 46]: No attempt at defiance being made , however , her face gradually relaxed , and became so pleasant , that I was emboldened to kiss and thank her ; which I did with great heartiness , and with both my arms clasped round her neck .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 32]: I then shook hands with Mr. Dick , who shook hands with me a great many times , and hailed this happy close of the proceedings with repeated bursts of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 24]: ` You 'll consider yourself guardian , jointly with me , of this child , Mr. Dick , ' said my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 21]: I shall be delighted , ' said Mr. Dick , ` to be the guardian of David 's son . '
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 14]: ` Very good , ' returned my aunt , ` that 's settled .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 20]: I have been thinking , do you know , Mr. Dick , that I might call him Trotwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 5]: ` Certainly , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 11]: Call him Trotwood , certainly , ' said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 8]: ` David 's son 's Trotwood . '
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 12]: ` Trotwood Copperfield , you mean , ' returned my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 7]: ` Yes , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 12]: Trotwood Copperfield , ' said Mr. Dick , a little abashed .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 79]: My aunt took so kindly to the notion , that some ready-made clothes , which were purchased for me that afternoon , were marked ` Trotwood Copperfield ' , in her own handwriting , and in indelible marking-ink , before I put them on ; and it was settled that all the other clothes which were ordered to be made for me -LRB- a complete outfit was bespoke that afternoon -RRB- should be marked in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 19]: Thus I began my new life , in a new name , and with everything new about me .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 22]: Now that the state of doubt was over , I felt , for many days , like one in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 19]: I never thought that I had a curious couple of guardians , in my aunt and Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 10]: I never thought of anything about myself , distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 49]: The two things clearest in my mind were , that a remoteness had come upon the old Blunderstone life -- which seemed to lie in the haze of an immeasurable distance ; and that a curtain had for ever fallen on my life at Murdstone and Grinby 's .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 9]: No one has ever raised that curtain since .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 23]: I have lifted it for a moment , even in this narrative , with a reluctant hand , and dropped it gladly .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 43]: The remembrance of that life is fraught with so much pain to me , with so much mental suffering and want of hope , that I have never had the courage even to examine how long I was doomed to lead it .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 18]: Whether it lasted for a year , or more , or less , I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 24]: I only know that it was , and ceased to be ; and that I have written , and there I leave it .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 38]: Chapter 15 I Make Another Beginning Mr. Dick and I soon became the best of friends , and very often , when his day 's work was done , went out together to fly the great kite .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 52]: Every day of his life he had a long sitting at the Memorial , which never made the least progress , however hard he laboured , for King Charles the First always strayed into it , sooner or later , and then it was thrown aside , and another one begun .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 63]: The patience and hope with which he bore these perpetual disappointments , the mild perception he had that there was something wrong about King Charles the First , the feeble efforts he made to keep him out , and the certainty with which he came in , and tumbled the Memorial out of all shape , made a deep impression on me .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 43]: What Mr. Dick supposed would come of the Memorial , if it were completed ; where he thought it was to go , or what he thought it was to do ; he knew no more than anybody else , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 35]: Nor was it at all necessary that he should trouble himself with such questions , for if anything were certain under the sun , it was certain that the Memorial never would be finished .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 29]: It was quite an affecting sight , I used to think , to see him with the kite when it was up a great height in the air .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 67]: What he had told me , in his room , about his belief in its disseminating the statements pasted on it , which were nothing but old leaves of abortive Memorials , might have been a fancy with him sometimes ; but not when he was out , looking up at the kite in the sky , and feeling it pull and tug at his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 10]: He never looked so serene as he did then .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 55]: I used to fancy , as I sat by him of an evening , on a green slope , and saw him watch the kite high in the quiet air , that it lifted his mind out of its confusion , and bore it -LRB- such was my boyish thought -RRB- into the skies .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 83]: As he wound the string in and it came lower and lower down out of the beautiful light , until it fluttered to the ground , and lay there like a dead thing , he seemed to wake gradually out of a dream ; and I remember to have seen him take it up , and look about him in a lost way , as if they had both come down together , so that I pitied him with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 27]: While I advanced in friendship and intimacy with Mr. Dick , I did not go backward in the favour of his staunch friend , my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 58]: She took so kindly to me , that , in the course of a few weeks , she shortened my adopted name of Trotwood into Trot ; and even encouraged me to hope , that if I went on as I had begun , I might take equal rank in her affections with my sister Betsey Trotwood .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 32]: ` Trot , ' said my aunt one evening , when the backgammon-board was placed as usual for herself and Mr. Dick , ` we must not forget your education . '
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 19]: This was my only subject of anxiety , and I felt quite delighted by her referring to it .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 12]: ` Should you like to go to school at Canterbury ? '
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 17]: I replied that I should like it very much , as it was so near her .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 8]: ` Good , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 9]: ` Should you like to go tomorrow ? '
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 32]: Being already no stranger to the general rapidity of my aunt 's evolutions , I was not surprised by the suddenness of the proposal , and said : ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 9]: ` Good , ' said my aunt again .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 25]: ` Janet , hire the grey pony and chaise tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , and pack up Master Trotwood 's clothes tonight . '
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 75]: I was greatly elated by these orders ; but my heart smote me for my selfishness , when I witnessed their effect on Mr. Dick , who was so low-spirited at the prospect of our separation , and played so ill in consequence , that my aunt , after giving him several admonitory raps on the knuckles with her dice-box , shut up the board , and declined to play with him any more .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 51]: But , on hearing from my aunt that I should sometimes come over on a Saturday , and that he could sometimes come and see me on a Wednesday , he revived ; and vowed to make another kite for those occasions , of proportions greatly surpassing the present one .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 58]: In the morning he was downhearted again , and would have sustained himself by giving me all the money he had in his possession , gold and silver too , if my aunt had not interposed , and limited the gift to five shillings , which , at his earnest petition , were afterwards increased to ten .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 32]: We parted at the garden-gate in a most affectionate manner , and Mr. Dick did not go into the house until my aunt had driven me out of sight of it .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 57]: My aunt , who was perfectly indifferent to public opinion , drove the grey pony through Dover in a masterly manner ; sitting high and stiff like a state coachman , keeping a steady eye upon him wherever he went , and making a point of not letting him have his own way in any respect .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 39]: When we came into the country road , she permitted him to relax a little , however ; and looking at me down in a valley of cushion by her side , asked me whether I was happy ?
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 14]: ` Very happy indeed , thank you , aunt , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 21]: She was much gratified ; and both her hands being occupied , patted me on the head with her whip .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 10]: ` Is it a large school , aunt ? '
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 13]: ` Why , I do n't know , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 11]: ` We are going to Mr. Wickfield 's first . '
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 8]: ` Does he keep a school ? '
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 10]: ` No , Trot , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 7]: ` He keeps an office . '
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 57]: I asked for no more information about Mr. Wickfield , as she offered none , and we conversed on other subjects until we came to Canterbury , where , as it was market-day , my aunt had a great opportunity of insinuating the grey pony among carts , baskets , vegetables , and huckster 's goods .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 57]: The hair-breadth turns and twists we made , drew down upon us a variety of speeches from the people standing about , which were not always complimentary ; but my aunt drove on with perfect indifference , and I dare say would have taken her own way with as much coolness through an enemy 's country .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 61]: At length we stopped before a very old house bulging out over the road ; a house with long low lattice-windows bulging out still farther , and beams with carved heads on the ends bulging out too , so that I fancied the whole house was leaning forward , trying to see who was passing on the narrow pavement below .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 8]: It was quite spotless in its cleanliness .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 89]: The old-fashioned brass knocker on the low arched door , ornamented with carved garlands of fruit and flowers , twinkled like a star ; the two stone steps descending to the door were as white as if they had been covered with fair linen ; and all the angles and corners , and carvings and mouldings , and quaint little panes of glass , and quainter little windows , though as old as the hills , were as pure as any snow that ever fell upon the hills .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 50]: When the pony-chaise stopped at the door , and my eyes were intent upon the house , I saw a cadaverous face appear at a small window on the ground floor -LRB- in a little round tower that formed one side of the house -RRB- , and quickly disappear .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 13]: The low arched door then opened , and the face came out .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 38]: It was quite as cadaverous as it had looked in the window , though in the grain of it there was that tinge of red which is sometimes to be observed in the skins of red-haired people .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 65]: It belonged to a red-haired person -- a youth of fifteen , as I take it now , but looking much older -- whose hair was cropped as close as the closest stubble ; who had hardly any eyebrows , and no eyelashes , and eyes of a red-brown , so unsheltered and unshaded , that I remember wondering how he went to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 65]: He was high-shouldered and bony ; dressed in decent black , with a white wisp of a neckcloth ; buttoned up to the throat ; and had a long , lank , skeleton hand , which particularly attracted my attention , as he stood at the pony 's head , rubbing his chin with it , and looking up at us in the chaise .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 11]: ` Is Mr. Wickfield at home , Uriah Heep ? '
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 36]: ` Mr. Wickfield 's at home , ma'am , ' said Uriah Heep , ` if you 'll please to walk in there ' -- pointing with his long hand to the room he meant .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 66]: We got out ; and leaving him to hold the pony , went into a long low parlour looking towards the street , from the window of which I caught a glimpse , as I went in , of Uriah Heep breathing into the pony 's nostrils , and immediately covering them with his hand , as if he were putting some spell upon him .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 66]: Opposite to the tall old chimney-piece were two portraits : one of a gentleman with grey hair -LRB- though not by any means an old man -RRB- and black eyebrows , who was looking over some papers tied together with red tape ; the other , of a lady , with a very placid and sweet expression of face , who was looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 56]: I believe I was turning about in search of Uriah 's picture , when , a door at the farther end of the room opening , a gentleman entered , at sight of whom I turned to the first-mentioned portrait again , to make quite sure that it had not come out of its frame .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 31]: But it was stationary ; and as the gentleman advanced into the light , I saw that he was some years older than when he had had his picture painted .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 15]: ` Miss Betsey Trotwood , ' said the gentleman , ` pray walk in .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 15]: I was engaged for a moment , but you 'll excuse my being busy .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 5]: You know my motive .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 8]: I have but one in life . '
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 31]: Miss Betsey thanked him , and we went into his room , which was furnished as an office , with books , papers , tin boxes , and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 43]: It looked into a garden , and had an iron safe let into the wall ; so immediately over the mantelshelf , that I wondered , as I sat down , how the sweeps got round it when they swept the chimney .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 47]: ` Well , Miss Trotwood , ' said Mr. Wickfield ; for I soon found that it was he , and that he was a lawyer , and steward of the estates of a rich gentleman of the county ; ` what wind blows you here ?
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 9]: Not an ill wind , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 9]: ` No , ' replied my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 9]: I have not come for any law . '
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 12]: ` That 's right , ma'am , ' said Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 10]: ` You had better come for anything else . '
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 14]: His hair was quite white now , though his eyebrows were still black .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 15]: He had a very agreeable face , and , I thought , was handsome .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 47]: There was a certain richness in his complexion , which I had been long accustomed , under Peggotty 's tuition , to connect with port wine ; and I fancied it was in his voice too , and referred his growing corpulency to the same cause .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 52]: He was very cleanly dressed , in a blue coat , striped waistcoat , and nankeen trousers ; and his fine frilled shirt and cambric neckcloth looked unusually soft and white , reminding my strolling fancy -LRB- I call to mind -RRB- of the plumage on the breast of a swan .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 11]: ` This is my nephew , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 16]: ` Was n't aware you had one , Miss Trotwood , ' said Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 14]: ` My grand-nephew , that is to say , ' observed my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 21]: ` Was n't aware you had a grand-nephew , I give you my word , ' said Mr. Wickfield . '
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 55]: I have adopted him , ' said my aunt , with a wave of her hand , importing that his knowledge and his ignorance were all one to her , ` and I have brought him here , to put to a school where he may be thoroughly well taught , and well treated .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 19]: Now tell me where that school is , and what it is , and all about it . '
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 21]: ` Before I can advise you properly , ' said Mr. Wickfield -- ` the old question , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 8]: What 's your motive in this ? '
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 7]: ` Deuce take the man ! '
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 4]: exclaimed my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 13]: ` Always fishing for motives , when they 're on the surface !
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 11]: Why , to make the child happy and useful . '
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 24]: ` It must be a mixed motive , I think , ' said Mr. Wickfield , shaking his head and smiling incredulously . '
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 9]: A mixed fiddlestick , ' returned my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 14]: ` You claim to have one plain motive in all you do yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 20]: You do n't suppose , I hope , that you are the only plain dealer in the world ? '
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 21]: ` Ay , but I have only one motive in life , Miss Trotwood , ' he rejoined , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 10]: ` Other people have dozens , scores , hundreds .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 5]: I have only one .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 5]: There 's the difference .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 8]: However , that 's beside the question .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 4]: The best school ?
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 10]: Whatever the motive , you want the best ? '
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 5]: My aunt nodded assent .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 24]: ` At the best we have , ' said Mr. Wickfield , considering , ` your nephew could n't board just now . '
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 12]: ` But he could board somewhere else , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 4]: suggested my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 6]: Mr. Wickfield thought I could .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 49]: After a little discussion , he proposed to take my aunt to the school , that she might see it and judge for herself ; also , to take her , with the same object , to two or three houses where he thought I could be boarded .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 38]: My aunt embracing the proposal , we were all three going out together , when he stopped and said : ` Our little friend here might have some motive , perhaps , for objecting to the arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 10]: I think we had better leave him behind ? '
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 52]: My aunt seemed disposed to contest the point ; but to facilitate matters I said I would gladly remain behind , if they pleased ; and returned into Mr. Wickfield 's office , where I sat down again , in the chair I had first occupied , to await their return .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 34]: It so happened that this chair was opposite a narrow passage , which ended in the little circular room where I had seen Uriah Heep 's pale face looking out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 49]: Uriah , having taken the pony to a neighbouring stable , was at work at a desk in this room , which had a brass frame on the top to hang paper upon , and on which the writing he was making a copy of was then hanging .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 93]: Though his face was towards me , I thought , for some time , the writing being between us , that he could not see me ; but looking that way more attentively , it made me uncomfortable to observe that , every now and then , his sleepless eyes would come below the writing , like two red suns , and stealthily stare at me for I dare say a whole minute at a time , during which his pen went , or pretended to go , as cleverly as ever .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 72]: I made several attempts to get out of their way - such as standing on a chair to look at a map on the other side of the room , and poring over the columns of a Kentish newspaper -- but they always attracted me back again ; and whenever I looked towards those two red suns , I was sure to find them , either just rising or just setting .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 22]: At length , much to my relief , my aunt and Mr. Wickfield came back , after a pretty long absence .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 35]: They were not so successful as I could have wished ; for though the advantages of the school were undeniable , my aunt had not approved of any of the boarding-houses proposed for me .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 12]: ` It 's very unfortunate , ' said my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 11]: I do n't know what to do , Trot . '
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 11]: ` It does happen unfortunately , ' said Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 15]: ` But I 'll tell you what you can do , Miss Trotwood . '
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 6]: ` What 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 4]: inquired my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 10]: ` Leave your nephew here , for the present .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 6]: He 's a quiet fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 8]: He wo n't disturb me at all .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 8]: It 's a capital house for study .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 11]: As quiet as a monastery , and almost as roomy .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 5]: Leave him here . '
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 15]: My aunt evidently liked the offer , though she was delicate of accepting it .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 14]: So did I. ` Come , Miss Trotwood , ' said Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 10]: ` This is the way out of the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 10]: It 's only a temporary arrangement , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 25]: If it do n't act well , or do n't quite accord with our mutual convenience , he can easily go to the right-about .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 15]: There will be time to find some better place for him in the meanwhile .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 14]: You had better determine to leave him here for the present ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 28]: I am very much obliged to you , ' said my aunt ; ` and so is he , I see ; but -- ' ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 11]: I know what you mean , ' cried Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 15]: ` You shall not be oppressed by the receipt of favours , Miss Trotwood .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 10]: You may pay for him , if you like .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 17]: We wo n't be hard about terms , but you shall pay if you will . '
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 30]: ` On that understanding , ' said my aunt , ` though it does n't lessen the real obligation , I shall be very glad to leave him . '
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 14]: ` Then come and see my little housekeeper , ' said Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 83]: We accordingly went up a wonderful old staircase ; with a balustrade so broad that we might have gone up that , almost as easily ; and into a shady old drawing-room , lighted by some three or four of the quaint windows I had looked up at from the street : which had old oak seats in them , that seemed to have come of the same trees as the shining oak floor , and the great beams in the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 23]: It was a prettily furnished room , with a piano and some lively furniture in red and green , and some flowers .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 71]: It seemed to be all old nooks and corners ; and in every nook and corner there was some queer little table , or cupboard , or bookcase , or seat , or something or other , that made me think there was not such another good corner in the room ; until I looked at the next one , and found it equal to it , if not better .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 17]: On everything there was the same air of retirement and cleanliness that marked the house outside .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 29]: Mr. Wickfield tapped at a door in a corner of the panelled wall , and a girl of about my own age came quickly out and kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 23]: On her face , I saw immediately the placid and sweet expression of the lady whose picture had looked at me downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 20]: It seemed to my imagination as if the portrait had grown womanly , and the original remained a child .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 40]: Although her face was quite bright and happy , there was a tranquillity about it , and about her -- a quiet , good , calm spirit -- that I never have forgotten ; that I shall never forget .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 14]: This was his little housekeeper , his daughter Agnes , Mr. Wickfield said .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 27]: When I heard how he said it , and saw how he held her hand , I guessed what the one motive of his life was .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 32]: She had a little basket-trifle hanging at her side , with keys in it ; and she looked as staid and as discreet a housekeeper as the old house could have .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 37]: She listened to her father as he told her about me , with a pleasant face ; and when he had concluded , proposed to my aunt that we should go upstairs and see my room .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 38]: We all went together , she before us : and a glorious old room it was , with more oak beams , and diamond panes ; and the broad balustrade going all the way up to it .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 25]: I can not call to mind where or when , in my childhood , I had seen a stained glass window in a church .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 7]: Nor do I recollect its subject .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 47]: But I know that when I saw her turn round , in the grave light of the old staircase , and wait for us , above , I thought of that window ; and I associated something of its tranquil brightness with Agnes Wickfield ever afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 30]: My aunt was as happy as I was , in the arrangement made for me ; and we went down to the drawing-room again , well pleased and gratified .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 68]: As she would not hear of staying to dinner , lest she should by any chance fail to arrive at home with the grey pony before dark ; and as I apprehend Mr. Wickfield knew her too well to argue any point with her ; some lunch was provided for her there , and Agnes went back to her governess , and Mr. Wickfield to his office .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 14]: So we were left to take leave of one another without any restraint .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 33]: She told me that everything would be arranged for me by Mr. Wickfield , and that I should want for nothing , and gave me the kindest words and the best advice .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 31]: ` Trot , ' said my aunt in conclusion , ` be a credit to yourself , to me , and Mr. Dick , and Heaven be with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 23]: I was greatly overcome , and could only thank her , again and again , and send my love to Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 22]: ` Never , ' said my aunt , ` be mean in anything ; never be false ; never be cruel .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 17]: Avoid those three vices , Trot , and I can always be hopeful of you . '
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 21]: I promised , as well as I could , that I would not abuse her kindness or forget her admonition .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 19]: ` The pony 's at the door , ' said my aunt , ` and I am off !
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 4]: Stay here . '
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 21]: With these words she embraced me hastily , and went out of the room , shutting the door after her .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 56]: At first I was startled by so abrupt a departure , and almost feared I had displeased her ; but when I looked into the street , and saw how dejectedly she got into the chaise , and drove away without looking up , I understood her better and did not do her that injustice .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 28]: By five o'clock , which was Mr. Wickfield 's dinner-hour , I had mustered up my spirits again , and was ready for my knife and fork .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 33]: The cloth was only laid for us two ; but Agnes was waiting in the drawing-room before dinner , went down with her father , and sat opposite to him at table .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 10]: I doubted whether he could have dined without her .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 38]: We did not stay there , after dinner , but came upstairs into the drawing-room again : in one snug corner of which , Agnes set glasses for her father , and a decanter of port wine .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 23]: I thought he would have missed its usual flavour , if it had been put there for him by any other hands .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 36]: There he sat , taking his wine , and taking a good deal of it , for two hours ; while Agnes played on the piano , worked , and talked to him and me .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 34]: He was , for the most part , gay and cheerful with us ; but sometimes his eyes rested on her , and he fell into a brooding state , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 19]: She always observed this quickly , I thought , and always roused him with a question or caress .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 13]: Then he came out of his meditation , and drank more wine .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 52]: Agnes made the tea , and presided over it ; and the time passed away after it , as after dinner , until she went to bed ; when her father took her in his arms and kissed her , and , she being gone , ordered candles in his office .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 7]: Then I went to bed too .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 68]: But in the course of the evening I had rambled down to the door , and a little way along the street , that I might have another peep at the old houses , and the grey Cathedral ; and might think of my coming through that old city on my journey , and of my passing the very house I lived in , without knowing it .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 36]: As I came back , I saw Uriah Heep shutting up the office ; and feeling friendly towards everybody , went in and spoke to him , and at parting , gave him my hand .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 10]: But oh , what a clammy hand his was !
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 10]: as ghostly to the touch as to the sight !
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 15]: I rubbed mine afterwards , to warm it , And TO RUB HIS OFF .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 26]: It was such an uncomfortable hand , that , when I went to my room , it was still cold and wet upon my memory .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 39]: Leaning out of the window , and seeing one of the faces on the beam-ends looking at me sideways , I fancied it was Uriah Heep got up there somehow , and shut him out in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 25]: Chapter 16 I Am a New Boy in More Senses than One Next morning , after breakfast , I entered on school life again .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 68]: I went , accompanied by Mr. Wickfield , to the scene of my future studies -- a grave building in a courtyard , with a learned air about it that seemed very well suited to the stray rooks and jackdaws who came down from the Cathedral towers to walk with a clerkly bearing on the grass-plot -- and was introduced to my new master , Doctor Strong .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 68]: Doctor Strong looked almost as rusty , to my thinking , as the tall iron rails and gates outside the house ; and almost as stiff and heavy as the great stone urns that flanked them , and were set up , on the top of the red-brick wall , at regular distances all round the court , like sublimated skittles , for Time to play at .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 50]: He was in his library -LRB- I mean Doctor Strong was -RRB- , with his clothes not particularly well brushed , and his hair not particularly well combed ; his knee-smalls unbraced ; his long black gaiters unbuttoned ; and his shoes yawning like two caverns on the hearth-rug .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 68]: Turning upon me a lustreless eye , that reminded me of a long-forgotten blind old horse who once used to crop the grass , and tumble over the graves , in Blunderstone churchyard , he said he was glad to see me : and then he gave me his hand ; which I did n't know what to do with , as it did nothing for itself .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 65]: But , sitting at work , not far from Doctor Strong , was a very pretty young lady -- whom he called Annie , and who was his daughter , I supposed -- who got me out of my difficulty by kneeling down to put Doctor Strong 's shoes on , and button his gaiters , which she did with great cheerfulness and quickness .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 67]: When she had finished , and we were going out to the schoolroom , I was much surprised to hear Mr. Wickfield , in bidding her good morning , address her as ` Mrs. Strong ' ; and I was wondering could she be Doctor Strong 's son 's wife , or could she be Mrs. Doctor Strong , when Doctor Strong himself unconsciously enlightened me .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 38]: ` By the by , Wickfield , ' he said , stopping in a passage with his hand on my shoulder ; ` you have not found any suitable provision for my wife 's cousin yet ? '
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 8]: ` No , ' said Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 5]: Not yet . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 42]: I could wish it done as soon as it can be done , Wickfield , ' said Doctor Strong , ` for Jack Maldon is needy , and idle ; and of those two bad things , worse things sometimes come .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 41]: What does Doctor Watts say , ' he added , looking at me , and moving his head to the time of his quotation , ' `` Satan finds some mischief still , for idle hands to do . '' '
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 41]: ` Egad , Doctor , ' returned Mr. Wickfield , ` if Doctor Watts knew mankind , he might have written , with as much truth , `` Satan finds some mischief still , for busy hands to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 19]: The busy people achieve their full share of mischief in the world , you may rely upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 26]: What have the people been about , who have been the busiest in getting money , and in getting power , this century or two ?
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 4]: No mischief ? '
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 25]: ` Jack Maldon will never be very busy in getting either , I expect , ' said Doctor Strong , rubbing his chin thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 25]: ` Perhaps not , ' said Mr. Wickfield ; ` and you bring me back to the question , with an apology for digressing .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 15]: No , I have not been able to dispose of Mr. Jack Maldon yet .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 26]: I believe , ' he said this with some hesitation , ' I penetrate your motive , and it makes the thing more difficult . '
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 30]: ` My motive , ' returned Doctor Strong , ` is to make some suitable provision for a cousin , and an old playfellow , of Annie 's . '
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 18]: ` Yes , I know , ' said Mr. Wickfield ; ` at home or abroad . '
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 4]: ` Aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 14]: replied the Doctor , apparently wondering why he emphasized those words so much .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 7]: ` At home or abroad . '
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 13]: ` Your own expression , you know , ' said Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 5]: ` Or abroad . '
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 8]: ` Surely , ' the Doctor answered .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 3]: ` Surely .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 5]: One or other . '
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 5]: ` One or other ?
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 6]: Have you no choice ? '
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 4]: asked Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 8]: ` No , ' returned the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 4]: ` No ? '
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 3]: with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 6]: ` Not the least . '
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 20]: ` No motive , ' said Mr. Wickfield , ` for meaning abroad , and not at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 9]: ` No , ' returned the Doctor . '
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 20]: I am bound to believe you , and of course I do believe you , ' said Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 17]: ` It might have simplified my office very much , if I had known it before .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 9]: But I confess I entertained another impression . '
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 71]: Doctor Strong regarded him with a puzzled and doubting look , which almost immediately subsided into a smile that gave me great encouragement ; for it was full of amiability and sweetness , and there was a simplicity in it , and indeed in his whole manner , when the studious , pondering frost upon it was got through , very attractive and hopeful to a young scholar like me .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 62]: Repeating ` no ' , and ` not the least ' , and other short assurances to the same purport , Doctor Strong jogged on before us , at a queer , uneven pace ; and we followed : Mr. Wickfield , looking grave , I observed , and shaking his head to himself , without knowing that I saw him .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 54]: The schoolroom was a pretty large hall , on the quietest side of the house , confronted by the stately stare of some half-dozen of the great urns , and commanding a peep of an old secluded garden belonging to the Doctor , where the peaches were ripening on the sunny south wall .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 50]: There were two great aloes , in tubs , on the turf outside the windows ; the broad hard leaves of which plant -LRB- looking as if they were made of painted tin -RRB- have ever since , by association , been symbolical to me of silence and retirement .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 36]: About five-and-twenty boys were studiously engaged at their books when we went in , but they rose to give the Doctor good morning , and remained standing when they saw Mr. Wickfield and me . '
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 17]: A new boy , young gentlemen , ' said the Doctor ; ` Trotwood Copperfield . '
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 18]: One Adams , who was the head-boy , then stepped out of his place and welcomed me .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 51]: He looked like a young clergyman , in his white cravat , but he was very affable and good-humoured ; and he showed me my place , and presented me to the masters , in a gentlemanly way that would have put me at my ease , if anything could .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 47]: It seemed to me so long , however , since I had been among such boys , or among any companions of my own age , except Mick Walker and Mealy Potatoes , that I felt as strange as ever I have done in my life .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 53]: I was so conscious of having passed through scenes of which they could have no knowledge , and of having acquired experiences foreign to my age , appearance , and condition as one of them , that I half believed it was an imposture to come there as an ordinary little schoolboy .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 46]: I had become , in the Murdstone and Grinby time , however short or long it may have been , so unused to the sports and games of boys , that I knew I was awkward and inexperienced in the commonest things belonging to them .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 50]: Whatever I had learnt , had so slipped away from me in the sordid cares of my life from day to night , that now , when I was examined about what I knew , I knew nothing , and was put into the lowest form of the school .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 52]: But , troubled as I was , by my want of boyish skill , and of book-learning too , I was made infinitely more uncomfortable by the consideration , that , in what I did know , I was much farther removed from my companions than in what I did not .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 23]: My mind ran upon what they would think , if they knew of my familiar acquaintance with the King 's Bench Prison ?
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 32]: Was there anything about me which would reveal my proceedings in connexion with the Micawber family -- all those pawnings , and sellings , and suppers -- in spite of myself ?
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 22]: Suppose some of the boys had seen me coming through Canterbury , wayworn and ragged , and should find me out ?
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 40]: What would they say , who made so light of money , if they could know how I had scraped my halfpence together , for the purchase of my daily saveloy and beer , or my slices of pudding ?
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 40]: How would it affect them , who were so innocent of London life , and London streets , to discover how knowing I was -LRB- and was ashamed to be -RRB- in some of the meanest phases of both ?
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 66]: All this ran in my head so much , on that first day at Doctor Strong 's , that I felt distrustful of my slightest look and gesture ; shrunk within myself whensoever I was approached by one of my new schoolfellows ; and hurried off the minute school was over , afraid of committing myself in my response to any friendly notice or advance .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 37]: But there was such an influence in Mr. Wickfield 's old house , that when I knocked at it , with my new school-books under my arm , I began to feel my uneasiness softening away .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 33]: As I went up to my airy old room , the grave shadow of the staircase seemed to fall upon my doubts and fears , and to make the past more indistinct .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 37]: I sat there , sturdily conning my books , until dinner-time -LRB- we were out of school for good at three -RRB- ; and went down , hopeful of becoming a passable sort of boy yet .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 20]: Agnes was in the drawing-room , waiting for her father , who was detained by someone in his office .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 17]: She met me with her pleasant smile , and asked me how I liked the school .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 24]: I told her I should like it very much , I hoped ; but I was a little strange to it at first .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 17]: ` You have never been to school , ' I said , ` have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 4]: ` Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 4]: Every day . '
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 14]: ` Ah , but you mean here , at your own home ? '
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 21]: ` Papa could n't spare me to go anywhere else , ' she answered , smiling and shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 13]: ` His housekeeper must be in his house , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 16]: ` He is very fond of you , I am sure , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 27]: She nodded ` Yes , ' and went to the door to listen for his coming up , that she might meet him on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 13]: But , as he was not there , she came back again .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 21]: ` Mama has been dead ever since I was born , ' she said , in her quiet way . '
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 8]: I only know her picture , downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 8]: I saw you looking at it yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 8]: Did you think whose it was ? '
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 12]: I told her yes , because it was so like herself .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 13]: ` Papa says so , too , ' said Agnes , pleased .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 3]: ` Hark !
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 6]: That 's papa now ! '
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 25]: Her bright calm face lighted up with pleasure as she went to meet him , and as they came in , hand in hand .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 26]: He greeted me cordially ; and told me I should certainly be happy under Doctor Strong , who was one of the gentlest of men .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 26]: ` There may be some , perhaps -- I do n't know that there are -- who abuse his kindness , ' said Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 12]: ` Never be one of those , Trotwood , in anything .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 37]: He is the least suspicious of mankind ; and whether that 's a merit , or whether it 's a blemish , it deserves consideration in all dealings with the Doctor , great or small . '
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 47]: He spoke , I thought , as if he were weary , or dissatisfied with something ; but I did not pursue the question in my mind , for dinner was just then announced , and we went down and took the same seats as before .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 41]: We had scarcely done so , when Uriah Heep put in his red head and his lank hand at the door , and said : ` Here 's Mr. Maldon begs the favour of a word , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 15]: I am but this moment quit of Mr. Maldon , ' said his master .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 27]: ` Yes , sir , ' returned Uriah ; ` but Mr. Maldon has come back , and he begs the favour of a word . '
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 71]: As he held the door open with his hand , Uriah looked at me , and looked at Agnes , and looked at the dishes , and looked at the plates , and looked at every object in the room , I thought , -- yet seemed to look at nothing ; he made such an appearance all the while of keeping his red eyes dutifully on his master . '
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 58]: It 's only to say , on reflection , ' observed a voice behind Uriah , as Uriah 's head was pushed away , and the speaker 's substituted -- ` pray excuse me for this intrusion -- that as it seems I have no choice in the matter , the sooner I go abroad the better .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 42]: My cousin Annie did say , when we talked of it , that she liked to have her friends within reach rather than to have them banished , and the old Doctor -- ' ` Doctor Strong , was that ? '
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 6]: Mr. Wickfield interposed , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 31]: ` Doctor Strong , of course , ' returned the other ; ' I call him the old Doctor ; it 's all the same , you know . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 10]: I do n't know , ' returned Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 23]: ` Well , Doctor Strong , ' said the other -- ` Doctor Strong was of the same mind , I believed .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 37]: But as it appears from the course you take with me he has changed his mind , why there 's no more to be said , except that the sooner I am off , the better .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 20]: Therefore , I thought I 'd come back and say , that the sooner I am off the better .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 22]: When a plunge is to be made into the water , it 's of no use lingering on the bank . '
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 28]: ` There shall be as little lingering as possible , in your case , Mr. Maldon , you may depend upon it , ' said Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 10]: ` Thank ` ee , ' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 4]: ` Much obliged .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 39]: I do n't want to look a gift-horse in the mouth , which is not a gracious thing to do ; otherwise , I dare say , my cousin Annie could easily arrange it in her own way .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 34]: I suppose Annie would only have to say to the old Doctor -- ' ` Meaning that Mrs. Strong would only have to say to her husband -- do I follow you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 4]: said Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 46]: ` Quite so , ' returned the other , ' - would only have to say , that she wanted such and such a thing to be so and so ; and it would be so and so , as a matter of course . '
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 13]: ` And why as a matter of course , Mr. Maldon ? '
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 9]: asked Mr. Wickfield , sedately eating his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 38]: ` Why , because Annie 's a charming young girl , and the old Doctor -- Doctor Strong , I mean -- is not quite a charming young boy , ' said Mr. Jack Maldon , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 9]: ` No offence to anybody , Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 19]: I only mean that I suppose some compensation is fair and reasonable in that sort of marriage . '
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 9]: ` Compensation to the lady , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 5]: asked Mr. Wickfield gravely .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 15]: ` To the lady , sir , ' Mr. Jack Maldon answered , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 66]: But appearing to remark that Mr. Wickfield went on with his dinner in the same sedate , immovable manner , and that there was no hope of making him relax a muscle of his face , he added : ` However , I have said what I came to say , and , with another apology for this intrusion , I may take myself off .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 37]: Of course I shall observe your directions , in considering the matter as one to be arranged between you and me solely , and not to be referred to , up at the Doctor 's . '
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 6]: ` Have you dined ? '
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 14]: asked Mr. Wickfield , with a motion of his hand towards the table .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 5]: ` Thank ` ee .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 17]: I am going to dine , ' said Mr. Maldon , ` with my cousin Annie .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 3]: Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 15]: Mr. Wickfield , without rising , looked after him thoughtfully as he went out .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 29]: He was rather a shallow sort of young gentleman , I thought , with a handsome face , a rapid utterance , and a confident , bold air .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 34]: And this was the first I ever saw of Mr. Jack Maldon ; whom I had not expected to see so soon , when I heard the Doctor speak of him that morning .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 21]: When we had dined , we went upstairs again , where everything went on exactly as on the previous day .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 25]: Agnes set the glasses and decanters in the same corner , and Mr. Wickfield sat down to drink , and drank a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 25]: Agnes played the piano to him , sat by him , and worked and talked , and played some games at dominoes with me .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 55]: In good time she made tea ; and afterwards , when I brought down my books , looked into them , and showed me what she knew of them -LRB- which was no slight matter , though she said it was -RRB- , and what was the best way to learn and understand them .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 27]: I see her , with her modest , orderly , placid manner , and I hear her beautiful calm voice , as I write these words .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 26]: The influence for all good , which she came to exercise over me at a later time , begins already to descend upon my breast .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 76]: I love little Em ` ly , and I do n't love Agnes -- no , not at all in that way -- but I feel that there are goodness , peace , and truth , wherever Agnes is ; and that the soft light of the coloured window in the church , seen long ago , falls on her always , and on me when I am near her , and on everything around .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 30]: The time having come for her withdrawal for the night , and she having left us , I gave Mr. Wickfield my hand , preparatory to going away myself .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 24]: But he checked me and said : ` Should you like to stay with us , Trotwood , or to go elsewhere ? '
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 10]: ` To stay , ' I answered , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 6]: ` You are sure ? '
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 5]: ` If you please .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 5]: If I may ! '
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 24]: ` Why , it 's but a dull life that we lead here , boy , I am afraid , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 11]: ` Not more dull for me than Agnes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 6]: Not dull at all ! '
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 20]: ` Than Agnes , ' he repeated , walking slowly to the great chimney-piece , and leaning against it .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 5]: ` Than Agnes ! '
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 19]: He had drank wine that evening -LRB- or I fancied it -RRB- , until his eyes were bloodshot .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 30]: Not that I could see them now , for they were cast down , and shaded by his hand ; but I had noticed them a little while before .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 17]: ` Now I wonder , ' he muttered , ` whether my Agnes tires of me .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 8]: When should I ever tire of her !
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 11]: But that 's different , that 's quite different . '
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 15]: He was musing , not speaking to me ; so I remained quiet . '
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 23]: A dull old house , ' he said , ` and a monotonous life ; but I must have her near me .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 7]: I must keep her near me .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 82]: If the thought that I may die and leave my darling , or that my darling may die and leave me , comes like a spectre , to distress my happiest hours , and is only to be drowned in -- ' He did not supply the word ; but pacing slowly to the place where he had sat , and mechanically going through the action of pouring wine from the empty decanter , set it down and paced back again .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 27]: ` If it is miserable to bear , when she is here , ' he said , ` what would it be , and she away ?
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 6]: No , no , no .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 7]: I can not try that . '
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 42]: He leaned against the chimney-piece , brooding so long that I could not decide whether to run the risk of disturbing him by going , or to remain quietly where I was , until he should come out of his reverie .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 17]: At length he aroused himself , and looked about the room until his eyes encountered mine .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 10]: ` Stay with us , Trotwood , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 20]: he said in his usual manner , and as if he were answering something I had just said . '
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 6]: I am glad of it .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 7]: You are company to us both .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 8]: It is wholesome to have you here .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 17]: Wholesome for me , wholesome for Agnes , wholesome perhaps for all of us . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 15]: I am sure it is for me , sir , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 9]: I am so glad to be here . '
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 8]: ` That 's a fine fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 4]: said Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 17]: ` As long as you are glad to be here , you shall stay here . '
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 74]: He shook hands with me upon it , and clapped me on the back ; and told me that when I had anything to do at night after Agnes had left us , or when I wished to read for my own pleasure , I was free to come down to his room , if he were there and if I desired it for company 's sake , and to sit with him .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 44]: I thanked him for his consideration ; and , as he went down soon afterwards , and I was not tired , went down too , with a book in my hand , to avail myself , for half-an-hour , of his permission .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 35]: But , seeing a light in the little round office , and immediately feeling myself attracted towards Uriah Heep , who had a sort of fascination for me , I went in there instead .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 44]: I found Uriah reading a great fat book , with such demonstrative attention , that his lank forefinger followed up every line as he read , and made clammy tracks along the page -LRB- or so I fully believed -RRB- like a snail .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 22]: ` You are working late tonight , Uriah , ' says I. ` Yes , Master Copperfield , ' says Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 59]: As I was getting on the stool opposite , to talk to him more conveniently , I observed that he had not such a thing as a smile about him , and that he could only widen his mouth and make two hard creases down his cheeks , one on each side , to stand for one . '
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 13]: I am not doing office-work , Master Copperfield , ' said Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 7]: ` What work , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 4]: I asked . '
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 15]: I am improving my legal knowledge , Master Copperfield , ' said Uriah . '
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 8]: I am going through Tidd 's Practice .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 13]: Oh , what a writer Mr. Tidd is , Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 81]: My stool was such a tower of observation , that as I watched him reading on again , after this rapturous exclamation , and following up the lines with his forefinger , I observed that his nostrils , which were thin and pointed , with sharp dints in them , had a singular and most uncomfortable way of expanding and contracting themselves -- that they seemed to twinkle instead of his eyes , which hardly ever twinkled at all . '
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 10]: I suppose you are quite a great lawyer ? '
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 11]: I said , after looking at him for some time .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 7]: ` Me , Master Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 3]: said Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 5]: ` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 8]: I 'm a very umble person . '
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 46]: It was no fancy of mine about his hands , I observed ; for he frequently ground the palms against each other as if to squeeze them dry and warm , besides often wiping them , in a stealthy way , on his pocket-handkerchief . '
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 28]: I am well aware that I am the umblest person going , ' said Uriah Heep , modestly ; ` let the other be where he may .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 9]: My mother is likewise a very umble person .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 18]: We live in a numble abode , Master Copperfield , but have much to be thankful for .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 8]: My father 's former calling was umble .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 6]: He was a sexton . '
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 7]: ` What is he now ? '
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 18]: ` He is a partaker of glory at present , Master Copperfield , ' said Uriah Heep .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 10]: ` But we have much to be thankful for .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 15]: How much have I to be thankful for in living with Mr. Wickfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 13]: I asked Uriah if he had been with Mr. Wickfield long ? '
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 34]: I have been with him , going on four year , Master Copperfield , ' said Uriah ; shutting up his book , after carefully marking the place where he had left off .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 10]: ` Since a year after my father 's death .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 12]: How much have I to be thankful for , in that !
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 36]: How much have I to be thankful for , in Mr. Wickfield 's kind intention to give me my articles , which would otherwise not lay within the umble means of mother and self ! '
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 21]: ` Then , when your articled time is over , you 'll be a regular lawyer , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 16]: said I. ` With the blessing of Providence , Master Copperfield , ' returned Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 42]: ` Perhaps you 'll be a partner in Mr. Wickfield 's business , one of these days , ' I said , to make myself agreeable ; ` and it will be Wickfield and Heep , or Heep late Wickfield . '
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 25]: ` Oh no , Master Copperfield , ' returned Uriah , shaking his head , ' I am much too umble for that ! '
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 40]: He certainly did look uncommonly like the carved face on the beam outside my window , as he sat , in his humility , eyeing me sideways , with his mouth widened , and the creases in his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 16]: ` Mr. Wickfield is a most excellent man , Master Copperfield , ' said Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 25]: ` If you have known him long , you know it , I am sure , much better than I can inform you . '
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 29]: I replied that I was certain he was ; but that I had not known him long myself , though he was a friend of my aunt 's .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 12]: ` Oh , indeed , Master Copperfield , ' said Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 12]: ` Your aunt is a sweet lady , Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 43]: He had a way of writhing when he wanted to express enthusiasm , which was very ugly ; and which diverted my attention from the compliment he had paid my relation , to the snaky twistings of his throat and body . '
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 8]: A sweet lady , Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 4]: said Uriah Heep .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 17]: ` She has a great admiration for Miss Agnes , Master Copperfield , I believe ? '
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 22]: I said , ` Yes , ' boldly ; not that I knew anything about it , Heaven forgive me ! '
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 14]: I hope you have , too , Master Copperfield , ' said Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 10]: ` But I am sure you must have . '
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 9]: ` Everybody must have , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 19]: ` Oh , thank you , Master Copperfield , ' said Uriah Heep , ` for that remark !
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 5]: It is so true !
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 12]: Umble as I am , I know it is so true !
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 9]: Oh , thank you , Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 27]: He writhed himself quite off his stool in the excitement of his feelings , and , being off , began to make arrangements for going home .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 45]: ` Mother will be expecting me , ' he said , referring to a pale , inexpressive-faced watch in his pocket , ` and getting uneasy ; for though we are very umble , Master Copperfield , we are much attached to one another .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 36]: If you would come and see us , any afternoon , and take a cup of tea at our lowly dwelling , mother would be as proud of your company as I should be . '
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 9]: I said I should be glad to come .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 33]: ` Thank you , Master Copperfield , ' returned Uriah , putting his book away upon the shelf -- ' I suppose you stop here , some time , Master Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 22]: I said I was going to be brought up there , I believed , as long as I remained at school .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 6]: ` Oh , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 4]: exclaimed Uriah . '
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 16]: I should think YOU would come into the business at last , Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 52]: I protested that I had no views of that sort , and that no such scheme was entertained in my behalf by anybody ; but Uriah insisted on blandly replying to all my assurances , ` Oh , yes , Master Copperfield , I should think you would , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 19]: and , ` Oh , indeed , Master Copperfield , I should think you would , certainly ! '
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 5]: over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 42]: Being , at last , ready to leave the office for the night , he asked me if it would suit my convenience to have the light put out ; and on my answering ` Yes , ' instantly extinguished it .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 59]: After shaking hands with me -- his hand felt like a fish , in the dark -- he opened the door into the street a very little , and crept out , and shut it , leaving me to grope my way back into the house : which cost me some trouble and a fall over his stool .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 85]: This was the proximate cause , I suppose , of my dreaming about him , for what appeared to me to be half the night ; and dreaming , among other things , that he had launched Mr. Peggotty 's house on a piratical expedition , with a black flag at the masthead , bearing the inscription ` Tidd 's Practice ' , under which diabolical ensign he was carrying me and little Em ` ly to the Spanish Main , to be drowned .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 54]: I got a little the better of my uneasiness when I went to school next day , and a good deal the better next day , and so shook it off by degrees , that in less than a fortnight I was quite at home , and happy , among my new companions .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 35]: I was awkward enough in their games , and backward enough in their studies ; but custom would improve me in the first respect , I hoped , and hard work in the second .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 21]: Accordingly , I went to work very hard , both in play and in earnest , and gained great commendation .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 45]: And , in a very little while , the Murdstone and Grinby life became so strange to me that I hardly believed in it , while my present life grew so familiar , that I seemed to have been leading it a long time .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 20]: Doctor Strong 's was an excellent school ; as different from Mr. Creakle 's as good is from evil .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 55]: It was very gravely and decorously ordered , and on a sound system ; with an appeal , in everything , to the honour and good faith of the boys , and an avowed intention to rely on their possession of those qualities unless they proved themselves unworthy of it , which worked wonders .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 23]: We all felt that we had a part in the management of the place , and in sustaining its character and dignity .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 48]: Hence , we soon became warmly attached to it - I am sure I did for one , and I never knew , in all my time , of any other boy being otherwise -- and learnt with a good will , desiring to do it credit .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 54]: We had noble games out of hours , and plenty of liberty ; but even then , as I remember , we were well spoken of in the town , and rarely did any disgrace , by our appearance or manner , to the reputation of Doctor Strong and Doctor Strong 's boys .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 91]: Some of the higher scholars boarded in the Doctor 's house , and through them I learned , at second hand , some particulars of the Doctor 's history -- as , how he had not yet been married twelve months to the beautiful young lady I had seen in the study , whom he had married for love ; for she had not a sixpence , and had a world of poor relations -LRB- so our fellows said -RRB- ready to swarm the Doctor out of house and home .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 79]: Also , how the Doctor 's cogitating manner was attributable to his being always engaged in looking out for Greek roots ; which , in my innocence and ignorance , I supposed to be a botanical furor on the Doctor 's part , especially as he always looked at the ground when he walked about , until I understood that they were roots of words , with a view to a new Dictionary which he had in contemplation .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 46]: Adams , our head-boy , who had a turn for mathematics , had made a calculation , I was informed , of the time this Dictionary would take in completing , on the Doctor 's plan , and at the Doctor 's rate of going .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 28]: He considered that it might be done in one thousand six hundred and forty-nine years , counting from the Doctor 's last , or sixty-second , birthday .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 57]: But the Doctor himself was the idol of the whole school : and it must have been a badly composed school if he had been anything else , for he was the kindest of men ; with a simple faith in him that might have touched the stone hearts of the very urns upon the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 88]: As he walked up and down that part of the courtyard which was at the side of the house , with the stray rooks and jackdaws looking after him with their heads cocked slyly , as if they knew how much more knowing they were in worldly affairs than he , if any sort of vagabond could only get near enough to his creaking shoes to attract his attention to one sentence of a tale of distress , that vagabond was made for the next two days .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 76]: It was so notorious in the house , that the masters and head-boys took pains to cut these marauders off at angles , and to get out of windows , and turn them out of the courtyard , before they could make the Doctor aware of their presence ; which was sometimes happily effected within a few yards of him , without his knowing anything of the matter , as he jogged to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 17]: Outside his own domain , and unprotected , he was a very sheep for the shearers .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 14]: He would have taken his gaiters off his legs , to give away .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 100]: In fact , there was a story current among us -LRB- I have no idea , and never had , on what authority , but I have believed it for so many years that I feel quite certain it is true -RRB- , that on a frosty day , one winter-time , he actually did bestow his gaiters on a beggar-woman , who occasioned some scandal in the neighbourhood by exhibiting a fine infant from door to door , wrapped in those garments , which were universally recognized , being as well known in the vicinity as the Cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 78]: The legend added that the only person who did not identify them was the Doctor himself , who , when they were shortly afterwards displayed at the door of a little second-hand shop of no very good repute , where such things were taken in exchange for gin , was more than once observed to handle them approvingly , as if admiring some curious novelty in the pattern , and considering them an improvement on his own .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 14]: It was very pleasant to see the Doctor with his pretty young wife .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 24]: He had a fatherly , benignant way of showing his fondness for her , which seemed in itself to express a good man .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 29]: I often saw them walking in the garden where the peaches were , and I sometimes had a nearer observation of them in the study or the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 65]: She appeared to me to take great care of the Doctor , and to like him very much , though I never thought her vitally interested in the Dictionary : some cumbrous fragments of which work the Doctor always carried in his pockets , and in the lining of his hat , and generally seemed to be expounding to her as they walked about .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 60]: I saw a good deal of Mrs. Strong , both because she had taken a liking for me on the morning of my introduction to the Doctor , and was always afterwards kind to me , and interested in me ; and because she was very fond of Agnes , and was often backwards and forwards at our house .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 28]: There was a curious constraint between her and Mr. Wickfield , I thought -LRB- of whom she seemed to be afraid -RRB- , that never wore off .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 24]: When she came there of an evening , she always shrunk from accepting his escort home , and ran away with me instead .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 34]: And sometimes , as we were running gaily across the Cathedral yard together , expecting to meet nobody , we would meet Mr. Jack Maldon , who was always surprised to see us .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 13]: Mrs. Strong 's mama was a lady I took great delight in .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 38]: Her name was Mrs. Markleham ; but our boys used to call her the Old Soldier , on account of her generalship , and the skill with which she marshalled great forces of relations against the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 40]: She was a little , sharp-eyed woman , who used to wear , when she was dressed , one unchangeable cap , ornamented with some artificial flowers , and two artificial butterflies supposed to be hovering above the flowers .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 93]: There was a superstition among us that this cap had come from France , and could only originate in the workmanship of that ingenious nation : but all I certainly know about it , is , that it always made its appearance of an evening , wheresoever Mrs. Markleham made HER appearance ; that it was carried about to friendly meetings in a Hindoo basket ; that the butterflies had the gift of trembling constantly ; and that they improved the shining hours at Doctor Strong 's expense , like busy bees .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 34]: I observed the Old Soldier -- not to adopt the name disrespectfully - to pretty good advantage , on a night which is made memorable to me by something else I shall relate .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 51]: It was the night of a little party at the Doctor 's , which was given on the occasion of Mr. Jack Maldon 's departure for India , whither he was going as a cadet , or something of that kind : Mr. Wickfield having at length arranged the business .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 11]: It happened to be the Doctor 's birthday , too .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 41]: We had had a holiday , had made presents to him in the morning , had made a speech to him through the head-boy , and had cheered him until we were hoarse , and until he had shed tears .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 26]: And now , in the evening , Mr. Wickfield , Agnes , and I , went to have tea with him in his private capacity .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 9]: Mr. Jack Maldon was there , before us .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 32]: Mrs. Strong , dressed in white , with cherry-coloured ribbons , was playing the piano , when we went in ; and he was leaning over her to turn the leaves .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 35]: The clear red and white of her complexion was not so blooming and flower-like as usual , I thought , when she turned round ; but she looked very pretty , Wonderfully pretty . '
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 47]: I have forgotten , Doctor , ' said Mrs. Strong 's mama , when we were seated , ` to pay you the compliments of the day -- though they are , as you may suppose , very far from being mere compliments in my case .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 11]: Allow me to wish you many happy returns . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 11]: I thank you , ma'am , ' replied the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 16]: ` Many , many , many , happy returns , ' said the Old Soldier .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 24]: ` Not only for your own sake , but for Annie 's , and John Maldon 's , and many other people 's .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 37]: It seems but yesterday to me , John , when you were a little creature , a head shorter than Master Copperfield , making baby love to Annie behind the gooseberry bushes in the back-garden . '
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 17]: ` My dear mama , ' said Mrs. Strong , ` never mind that now . '
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 13]: ` Annie , do n't be absurd , ' returned her mother .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 31]: ` If you are to blush to hear of such things now you are an old married woman , when are you not to blush to hear of them ? '
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 4]: ` Old ? '
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 5]: exclaimed Mr. Jack Maldon .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 3]: ` Annie ?
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 10]: ` Yes , John , ' returned the Soldier .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 8]: ` Virtually , an old married woman .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 33]: Although not old by years -- for when did you ever hear me say , or who has ever heard me say , that a girl of twenty was old by years !
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 21]: -- your cousin is the wife of the Doctor , and , as such , what I have described her .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 18]: It is well for you , John , that your cousin is the wife of the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 27]: You have found in him an influential and kind friend , who will be kinder yet , I venture to predict , if you deserve it .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 6]: I have no false pride .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 21]: I never hesitate to admit , frankly , that there are some members of our family who want a friend .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 17]: You were one yourself , before your cousin 's influence raised up one for you . '
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 31]: The Doctor , in the goodness of his heart , waved his hand as if to make light of it , and save Mr. Jack Maldon from any further reminder .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 52]: But Mrs. Markleham changed her chair for one next the Doctor 's , and putting her fan on his coat-sleeve , said : ` No , really , my dear Doctor , you must excuse me if I appear to dwell on this rather , because I feel so very strongly .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 15]: I call it quite my monomania , it is such a subject of mine .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 7]: You are a blessing to us .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 10]: You really are a Boon , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 10]: ` Nonsense , nonsense , ' said the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 16]: ` No , no , I beg your pardon , ' retorted the Old Soldier .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 23]: ` With nobody present , but our dear and confidential friend Mr. Wickfield , I can not consent to be put down .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 22]: I shall begin to assert the privileges of a mother-in-law , if you go on like that , and scold you .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 7]: I am perfectly honest and outspoken .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 24]: What I am saying , is what I said when you first overpowered me with surprise -- you remember how surprised I was ?
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 6]: -- by proposing for Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 29]: Not that there was anything so very much out of the way , in the mere fact of the proposal -- it would be ridiculous to say that !
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 53]: -- but because , you having known her poor father , and having known her from a baby six months old , I had n't thought of you in such a light at all , or indeed as a marrying man in any way , -- simply that , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 12]: ` Aye , aye , ' returned the Doctor , good-humouredly .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 5]: ` Never mind . '
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 20]: ` But I DO mind , ' said the Old Soldier , laying her fan upon his lips . '
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 5]: I mind very much .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 14]: I recall these things that I may be contradicted if I am wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 14]: Then I spoke to Annie , and I told her what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 28]: I said , `` My dear , here 's Doctor Strong has positively been and made you the subject of a handsome declaration and an offer . ''
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 8]: Did I press it in the least ?
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 21]: I said , `` Now , Annie , tell me the truth this moment ; is your heart free ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 34]: `` Mama , '' she said crying , `` I am extremely young '' -- which was perfectly true -- `` and I hardly know if I have a heart at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 21]: `` Then , my dear , '' I said , `` you may rely upon it , it 's free .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 27]: At all events , my love , '' said I , `` Doctor Strong is in an agitated state of mind , and must be answered .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 13]: He can not be kept in his present state of suspense . ''
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 18]: `` Mama , '' said Annie , still crying , `` would he be unhappy without me ?
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 21]: If he would , I honour and respect him so much , that I think I will have him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 5]: So it was settled .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 74]: And then , and not till then , I said to Annie , `` Annie , Doctor Strong will not only be your husband , but he will represent your late father : he will represent the head of our family , he will represent the wisdom and station , and I may say the means , of our family ; and will be , in short , a Boon to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 17]: I used the word at the time , and I have used it again , today .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 10]: If I have any merit it is consistency . '
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 33]: The daughter had sat quite silent and still during this speech , with her eyes fixed on the ground ; her cousin standing near her , and looking on the ground too .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 21]: She now said very softly , in a trembling voice : ` Mama , I hope you have finished ? '
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 20]: ` No , my dear Annie , ' returned the Old Soldier , ' I have not quite finished .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 15]: Since you ask me , my love , I reply that I have not .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 26]: I complain that you really are a little unnatural towards your own family ; and , as it is of no use complaining to you .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 8]: I mean to complain to your husband .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 16]: Now , my dear Doctor , do look at that silly wife of yours . '
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 25]: As the Doctor turned his kind face , with its smile of simplicity and gentleness , towards her , she drooped her head more .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 10]: I noticed that Mr. Wickfield looked at her steadily .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 92]: ` When I happened to say to that naughty thing , the other day , ' pursued her mother , shaking her head and her fan at her , playfully , ` that there was a family circumstance she might mention to you -- indeed , I think , was bound to mention -- she said , that to mention it was to ask a favour ; and that , as you were too generous , and as for her to ask was always to have , she would n't . '
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 11]: ` Annie , my dear , ' said the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 5]: ` That was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 8]: It robbed me of a pleasure . '
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 11]: ` Almost the very words I said to her ! '
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 4]: exclaimed her mother .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 41]: ` Now really , another time , when I know what she would tell you but for this reason , and wo n't , I have a great mind , my dear Doctor , to tell you myself . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 13]: I shall be glad if you will , ' returned the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 5]: ` Shall I ? '
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 4]: ` Certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 9]: ` Well , then , I will ! '
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 5]: said the Old Soldier .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 7]: ` That 's a bargain . '
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 36]: And having , I suppose , carried her point , she tapped the Doctor 's hand several times with her fan -LRB- which she kissed first -RRB- , and returned triumphantly to her former station .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 48]: Some more company coming in , among whom were the two masters and Adams , the talk became general ; and it naturally turned on Mr. Jack Maldon , and his voyage , and the country he was going to , and his various plans and prospects .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 58]: He was to leave that night , after supper , in a post-chaise , for Gravesend ; where the ship , in which he was to make the voyage , lay ; and was to be gone -- unless he came home on leave , or for his health -- I do n't know how many years .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 41]: I recollect it was settled by general consent that India was quite a misrepresented country , and had nothing objectionable in it , but a tiger or two , and a little heat in the warm part of the day .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 50]: For my own part , I looked on Mr. Jack Maldon as a modern Sindbad , and pictured him the bosom friend of all the Rajahs in the East , sitting under canopies , smoking curly golden pipes -- a mile long , if they could be straightened out .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 20]: Mrs. Strong was a very pretty singer : as I knew , who often heard her singing by herself .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 30]: But , whether she was afraid of singing before people , or was out of voice that evening , it was certain that she could n't sing at all .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 59]: She tried a duet , once , with her cousin Maldon , but could not so much as begin ; and afterwards , when she tried to sing by herself , although she began sweetly , her voice died away on a sudden , and left her quite distressed , with her head hanging down over the keys .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 36]: The good Doctor said she was nervous , and , to relieve her , proposed a round game at cards ; of which he knew as much as of the art of playing the trombone .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 40]: But I remarked that the Old Soldier took him into custody directly , for her partner ; and instructed him , as the first preliminary of initiation , to give her all the silver he had in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 40]: We had a merry game , not made the less merry by the Doctor 's mistakes , of which he committed an innumerable quantity , in spite of the watchfulness of the butterflies , and to their great aggravation .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 31]: Mrs. Strong had declined to play , on the ground of not feeling very well ; and her cousin Maldon had excused himself because he had some packing to do .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 22]: When he had done it , however , he returned , and they sat together , talking , on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 21]: From time to time she came and looked over the Doctor 's hand , and told him what to play .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 46]: She was very pale , as she bent over him , and I thought her finger trembled as she pointed out the cards ; but the Doctor was quite happy in her attention , and took no notice of this , if it were so .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 9]: At supper , we were hardly so gay .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 28]: Everyone appeared to feel that a parting of that sort was an awkward thing , and that the nearer it approached , the more awkward it was .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 21]: Mr. Jack Maldon tried to be very talkative , but was not at his ease , and made matters worse .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 28]: And they were not improved , as it appeared to me , by the Old Soldier : who continually recalled passages of Mr. Jack Maldon 's youth .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 39]: The Doctor , however , who felt , I am sure , that he was making everybody happy , was well pleased , and had no suspicion but that we were all at the utmost height of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 53]: ` Annie , my dear , ' said he , looking at his watch , and filling his glass , ` it is past your cousin jack 's time , and we must not detain him , since time and tide -- both concerned in this case -- wait for no man .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 38]: Mr. Jack Maldon , you have a long voyage , and a strange country , before you ; but many men have had both , and many men will have both , to the end of time .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 25]: The winds you are going to tempt , have wafted thousands upon thousands to fortune , and brought thousands upon thousands happily back . '
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 59]: ` It 's an affecting thing , ' said Mrs. Markleham -- ` however it 's viewed , it 's affecting , to see a fine young man one has known from an infant , going away to the other end of the world , leaving all he knows behind , and not knowing what 's before him .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 24]: A young man really well deserves constant support and patronage , ' looking at the Doctor , ` who makes such sacrifices . '
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 25]: ` Time will go fast with you , Mr. Jack Maldon , ' pursued the Doctor , ` and fast with all of us .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 23]: Some of us can hardly expect , perhaps , in the natural course of things , to greet you on your return .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 17]: The next best thing is to hope to do it , and that 's my case .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 9]: I shall not weary you with good advice .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 15]: You have long had a good model before you , in your cousin Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 10]: Imitate her virtues as nearly as you can . '
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 10]: Mrs. Markleham fanned herself , and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 22]: ` Farewell , Mr. Jack , ' said the Doctor , standing up ; on which we all stood up . '
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 17]: A prosperous voyage out , a thriving career abroad , and a happy return home ! '
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 67]: We all drank the toast , and all shook hands with Mr. Jack Maldon ; after which he hastily took leave of the ladies who were there , and hurried to the door , where he was received , as he got into the chaise , with a tremendous broadside of cheers discharged by our boys , who had assembled on the lawn for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 59]: Running in among them to swell the ranks , I was very near the chaise when it rolled away ; and I had a lively impression made upon me , in the midst of the noise and dust , of having seen Mr. Jack Maldon rattle past with an agitated face , and something cherry-coloured in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 71]: After another broadside for the Doctor , and another for the Doctor 's wife , the boys dispersed , and I went back into the house , where I found the guests all standing in a group about the Doctor , discussing how Mr. Jack Maldon had gone away , and how he had borne it , and how he had felt it , and all the rest of it .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 17]: In the midst of these remarks , Mrs. Markleham cried : ` Where 's Annie ? '
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 16]: No Annie was there ; and when they called to her , no Annie replied .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 28]: But all pressing out of the room , in a crowd , to see what was the matter , we found her lying on the hall floor .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 62]: There was great alarm at first , until it was found that she was in a swoon , and that the swoon was yielding to the usual means of recovery ; when the Doctor , who had lifted her head upon his knee , put her curls aside with his hand , and said , looking around : ` Poor Annie !
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 7]: She 's so faithful and tender-hearted !
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 20]: It 's the parting from her old playfellow and friend -- her favourite cousin - that has done this .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 5]: It 's a pity !
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 6]: I am very sorry ! '
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 55]: When she opened her eyes , and saw where she was , and that we were all standing about her , she arose with assistance : turning her head , as she did so , to lay it on the Doctor 's shoulder -- or to hide it , I do n't know which .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 66]: We went into the drawing-room , to leave her with the Doctor and her mother ; but she said , it seemed , that she was better than she had been since morning , and that she would rather be brought among us ; so they brought her in , looking very white and weak , I thought , and sat her on a sofa .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 17]: ` Annie , my dear , ' said her mother , doing something to her dress .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 4]: ` See here !
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 6]: You have lost a bow .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 15]: Will anybody be so good as find a ribbon ; a cherry-coloured ribbon ? '
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 11]: It was the one she had worn at her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 21]: We all looked for it ; I myself looked everywhere , I am certain -- but nobody could find it .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 13]: ` Do you recollect where you had it last , Annie ? '
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 4]: said her mother .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 43]: I wondered how I could have thought she looked white , or anything but burning red , when she answered that she had had it safe , a little while ago , she thought , but it was not worth looking for .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 13]: Nevertheless , it was looked for again , and still not found .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 35]: She entreated that there might be no more searching ; but it was still sought for , in a desultory way , until she was quite well , and the company took their departure .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 32]: We walked very slowly home , Mr. Wickfield , Agnes , and I -- Agnes and I admiring the moonlight , and Mr. Wickfield scarcely raising his eyes from the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 22]: When we , at last , reached our own door , Agnes discovered that she had left her little reticule behind .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 16]: Delighted to be of any service to her , I ran back to fetch it .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 17]: I went into the supper-room where it had been left , which was deserted and dark .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 39]: But a door of communication between that and the Doctor 's study , where there was a light , being open , I passed on there , to say what I wanted , and to get a candle .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 23]: The Doctor was sitting in his easy-chair by the fireside , and his young wife was on a stool at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 33]: The Doctor , with a complacent smile , was reading aloud some manuscript explanation or statement of a theory out of that interminable Dictionary , and she was looking up at him .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 10]: But with such a face as I never saw .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 41]: It was so beautiful in its form , it was so ashy pale , it was so fixed in its abstraction , it was so full of a wild , sleep-walking , dreamy horror of I do n't know what .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 34]: The eyes were wide open , and her brown hair fell in two rich clusters on her shoulders , and on her white dress , disordered by the want of the lost ribbon .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 38]: Distinctly as I recollect her look , I can not say of what it was expressive , I can not even say of what it is expressive to me now , rising again before my older judgement .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 34]: Penitence , humiliation , shame , pride , love , and trustfulness -- I see them all ; and in them all , I see that horror of I do n't know what .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 13]: My entrance , and my saying what I wanted , roused her .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 58]: It disturbed the Doctor too , for when I went back to replace the candle I had taken from the table , he was patting her head , in his fatherly way , and saying he was a merciless drone to let her tempt him into reading on ; and he would have her go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 43]: But she asked him , in a rapid , urgent manner , to let her stay -- to let her feel assured -LRB- I heard her murmur some broken words to this effect -RRB- that she was in his confidence that night .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 54]: And , as she turned again towards him , after glancing at me as I left the room and went out at the door , I saw her cross her hands upon his knee , and look up at him with the same face , something quieted , as he resumed his reading .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 29]: It made a great impression on me , and I remembered it a long time afterwards ; as I shall have occasion to narrate when the time comes .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 63]: Chapter 17 Somebody Turns up It has not occurred to me to mention Peggotty since I ran away ; but , of course , I wrote her a letter almost as soon as I was housed at Dover , and another , and a longer letter , containing all particulars fully related , when my aunt took me formally under her protection .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 21]: On my being settled at Doctor Strong 's I wrote to her again , detailing my happy condition and prospects .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 66]: I never could have derived anything like the pleasure from spending the money Mr. Dick had given me , that I felt in sending a gold half-guinea to Peggotty , per post , enclosed in this last letter , to discharge the sum I had borrowed of her : in which epistle , not before , I mentioned about the young man with the donkey-cart .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 19]: To these communications Peggotty replied as promptly , if not as concisely , as a merchant 's clerk .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 31]: Her utmost powers of expression -LRB- which were certainly not great in ink -RRB- were exhausted in the attempt to write what she felt on the subject of my journey .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 26]: Four sides of incoherent and interjectional beginnings of sentences , that had no end , except blots , were inadequate to afford her any relief .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 35]: But the blots were more expressive to me than the best composition ; for they showed me that Peggotty had been crying all over the paper , and what could I have desired more ?
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 20]: I made out , without much difficulty , that she could not take quite kindly to my aunt yet .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 14]: The notice was too short after so long a prepossession the other way .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 34]: We never knew a person , she wrote ; but to think that Miss Betsey should seem to be so different from what she had been thought to be , was a Moral !
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 6]: -- that was her word .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 69]: She was evidently still afraid of Miss Betsey , for she sent her grateful duty to her but timidly ; and she was evidently afraid of me , too , and entertained the probability of my running away again soon : if I might judge from the repeated hints she threw out , that the coach-fare to Yarmouth was always to be had of her for the asking .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 52]: She gave me one piece of intelligence which affected me very much , namely , that there had been a sale of the furniture at our old home , and that Mr. and Miss Murdstone were gone away , and the house was shut up , to be let or sold .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 49]: God knows I had no part in it while they remained there , but it pained me to think of the dear old place as altogether abandoned ; of the weeds growing tall in the garden , and the fallen leaves lying thick and wet upon the paths .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 42]: I imagined how the winds of winter would howl round it , how the cold rain would beat upon the window-glass , how the moon would make ghosts on the walls of the empty rooms , watching their solitude all night .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 39]: I thought afresh of the grave in the churchyard , underneath the tree : and it seemed as if the house were dead too , now , and all connected with my father and mother were faded away .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 10]: There was no other news in Peggotty 's letters .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 57]: Mr. Barkis was an excellent husband , she said , though still a little near ; but we all had our faults , and she had plenty -LRB- though I am sure I do n't know what they were -RRB- ; and he sent his duty , and my little bedroom was always ready for me .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 13]: Mr. Peggotty was well , and Ham was well , and Mrs. .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 28]: Gummidge was but poorly , and little Em ` ly would n't send her love , but said that Peggotty might send it , if she liked .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 35]: All this intelligence I dutifully imparted to my aunt , only reserving to myself the mention of little Em ` ly , to whom I instinctively felt that she would not very tenderly incline .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 40]: While I was yet new at Doctor Strong 's , she made several excursions over to Canterbury to see me , and always at unseasonable hours : with the view , I suppose , of taking me by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 32]: But , finding me well employed , and bearing a good character , and hearing on all hands that I rose fast in the school , she soon discontinued these visits .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 46]: I saw her on a Saturday , every third or fourth week , when I went over to Dover for a treat ; and I saw Mr. Dick every alternate Wednesday , when he arrived by stage-coach at noon , to stay until next morning .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 49]: On these occasions Mr. Dick never travelled without a leathern writing-desk , containing a supply of stationery and the Memorial ; in relation to which document he had a notion that time was beginning to press now , and that it really must be got out of hand .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 8]: Mr. Dick was very partial to gingerbread .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 52]: To render his visits the more agreeable , my aunt had instructed me to open a credit for him at a cake shop , which was hampered with the stipulation that he should not be served with more than one shilling 's - worth in the course of any one day .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 47]: This , and the reference of all his little bills at the county inn where he slept , to my aunt , before they were paid , induced me to suspect that he was only allowed to rattle his money , and not to spend it .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 33]: I found on further investigation that this was so , or at least there was an agreement between him and my aunt that he should account to her for all his disbursements .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 26]: As he had no idea of deceiving her , and always desired to please her , he was thus made chary of launching into expense .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 44]: On this point , as well as on all other possible points , Mr. Dick was convinced that my aunt was the wisest and most wonderful of women ; as he repeatedly told me with infinite secrecy , and always in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 39]: ` Trotwood , ' said Mr. Dick , with an air of mystery , after imparting this confidence to me , one Wednesday ; ` who 's the man that hides near our house and frightens her ? '
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 8]: ` Frightens my aunt , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 5]: Mr. Dick nodded . '
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 38]: I thought nothing would have frightened her , ' he said , ` for she 's -- ' here he whispered softly , ` do n't mention it -- the wisest and most wonderful of women . '
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 21]: Having said which , he drew back , to observe the effect which this description of her made upon me .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 32]: ` The first time he came , ' said Mr. Dick , ` was - let me see - sixteen hundred and forty-nine was the date of King Charles 's execution .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 10]: I think you said sixteen hundred and forty-nine ? '
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 7]: ` Yes , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 22]: I do n't know how it can be , ' said Mr. Dick , sorely puzzled and shaking his head . '
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 12]: I do n't think I am as old as that . '
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 14]: ` Was it in that year that the man appeared , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 25]: ` Why , really ' said Mr. Dick , ' I do n't see how it can have been in that year , Trotwood .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 10]: Did you get that date out of history ? '
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 7]: ` Yes , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 10]: I suppose history never lies , does it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 10]: said Mr. Dick , with a gleam of hope .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 9]: ` Oh dear , no , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 6]: I replied , most decisively .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 12]: I was ingenuous and young , and I thought so . '
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 16]: I ca n't make it out , ' said Mr. Dick , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 8]: ` There 's something wrong , somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 33]: However , it was very soon after the mistake was made of putting some of the trouble out of King Charles 's head into my head , that the man first came .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 25]: I was walking out with Miss Trotwood after tea , just at dark , and there he was , close to our house . '
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 5]: ` Walking about ? '
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 5]: ` Walking about ? '
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 4]: repeated Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 11]: ` Let me see , I must recollect a bit .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 11]: N-no , no ; he was not walking about . '
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 17]: I asked , as the shortest way to get at it , what he WAS doing .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 26]: ` Well , he was n't there at all , ' said Mr. Dick , ` until he came up behind her , and whispered .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 45]: Then she turned round and fainted , and I stood still and looked at him , and he walked away ; but that he should have been hiding ever since -LRB- in the ground or somewhere -RRB- , is the most extraordinary thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 9]: ` HAS he been hiding ever since ? '
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 17]: ` To be sure he has , ' retorted Mr. Dick , nodding his head gravely .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 9]: ` Never came out , till last night !
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 21]: We were walking last night , and he came up behind her again , and I knew him again . '
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 10]: ` And did he frighten my aunt again ? '
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 20]: ` All of a shiver , ' said Mr. Dick , counterfeiting that affection and making his teeth chatter .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 6]: ` Held by the palings .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 2]: Cried .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 36]: But , Trotwood , come here , ' getting me close to him , that he might whisper very softly ; ` why did she give him money , boy , in the moonlight ? '
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 9]: ` He was a beggar , perhaps . '
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 38]: Mr. Dick shook his head , as utterly renouncing the suggestion ; and having replied a great many times , and with great confidence , ` No beggar , no beggar , no beggar , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 89]: went on to say , that from his window he had afterwards , and late at night , seen my aunt give this person money outside the garden rails in the moonlight , who then slunk away -- into the ground again , as he thought probable -- and was seen no more : while my aunt came hurriedly and secretly back into the house , and had , even that morning , been quite different from her usual self ; which preyed on Mr. Dick 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 113]: I had not the least belief , in the outset of this story , that the unknown was anything but a delusion of Mr. Dick 's , and one of the line of that ill-fated Prince who occasioned him so much difficulty ; but after some reflection I began to entertain the question whether an attempt , or threat of an attempt , might have been twice made to take poor Mr. Dick himself from under my aunt 's protection , and whether my aunt , the strength of whose kind feeling towards him I knew from herself , might have been induced to pay a price for his peace and quiet .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 51]: As I was already much attached to Mr. Dick , and very solicitous for his welfare , my fears favoured this supposition ; and for a long time his Wednesday hardly ever came round , without my entertaining a misgiving that he would not be on the coach-box as usual .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 31]: There he always appeared , however , grey-headed , laughing , and happy ; and he never had anything more to tell of the man who could frighten my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 23]: These Wednesdays were the happiest days of Mr. Dick 's life ; they were far from being the least happy of mine .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 38]: He soon became known to every boy in the school ; and though he never took an active part in any game but kite-flying , was as deeply interested in all our sports as anyone among us .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 33]: How often have I seen him , intent upon a match at marbles or pegtop , looking on with a face of unutterable interest , and hardly breathing at the critical times !
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 50]: How often , at hare and hounds , have I seen him mounted on a little knoll , cheering the whole field on to action , and waving his hat above his grey head , oblivious of King Charles the Martyr 's head , and all belonging to it !
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 19]: How many a summer hour have I known to be but blissful minutes to him in the cricket-field !
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 37]: How many winter days have I seen him , standing blue-nosed , in the snow and east wind , looking at the boys going down the long slide , and clapping his worsted gloves in rapture !
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 15]: He was an universal favourite , and his ingenuity in little things was transcendent .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 16]: He could cut oranges into such devices as none of us had an idea of .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 14]: He could make a boat out of anything , from a skewer upwards .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 29]: He could turn cramp-bones into chessmen ; fashion Roman chariots from old court cards ; make spoked wheels out of cotton reels , and bird-cages of old wire .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 34]: But he was greatest of all , perhaps , in the articles of string and straw ; with which we were all persuaded he could do anything that could be done by hands .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 11]: Mr. Dick 's renown was not long confined to us .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 51]: After a few Wednesdays , Doctor Strong himself made some inquiries of me about him , and I told him all my aunt had told me ; which interested the Doctor so much that he requested , on the occasion of his next visit , to be presented to him .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 83]: This ceremony I performed ; and the Doctor begging Mr. Dick , whensoever he should not find me at the coach office , to come on there , and rest himself until our morning 's work was over , it soon passed into a custom for Mr. Dick to come on as a matter of course , and , if we were a little late , as often happened on a Wednesday , to walk about the courtyard , waiting for me .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 67]: Here he made the acquaintance of the Doctor 's beautiful young wife -LRB- paler than formerly , all this time ; more rarely seen by me or anyone , I think ; and not so gay , but not less beautiful -RRB- , and so became more and more familiar by degrees , until , at last , he would come into the school and wait .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 59]: He always sat in a particular corner , on a particular stool , which was called ` Dick ' , after him ; here he would sit , with his grey head bent forward , attentively listening to whatever might be going on , with a profound veneration for the learning he had never been able to acquire .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 22]: This veneration Mr. Dick extended to the Doctor , whom he thought the most subtle and accomplished philosopher of any age .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 71]: It was long before Mr. Dick ever spoke to him otherwise than bareheaded ; and even when he and the Doctor had struck up quite a friendship , and would walk together by the hour , on that side of the courtyard which was known among us as The Doctor 's Walk , Mr. Dick would pull off his hat at intervals to show his respect for wisdom and knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 42]: How it ever came about that the Doctor began to read out scraps of the famous Dictionary , in these walks , I never knew ; perhaps he felt it all the same , at first , as reading to himself .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 41]: However , it passed into a custom too ; and Mr. Dick , listening with a face shining with pride and pleasure , in his heart of hearts believed the Dictionary to be the most delightful book in the world .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 84]: As I think of them going up and down before those schoolroom windows -- the Doctor reading with his complacent smile , an occasional flourish of the manuscript , or grave motion of his head ; and Mr. Dick listening , enchained by interest , with his poor wits calmly wandering God knows where , upon the wings of hard words -- I think of it as one of the pleasantest things , in a quiet way , that I have ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 48]: I feel as if they might go walking to and fro for ever , and the world might somehow be the better for it -- as if a thousand things it makes a noise about , were not one half so good for it , or me .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 26]: Agnes was one of Mr. Dick 's friends , very soon ; and in often coming to the house , he made acquaintance with Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 77]: The friendship between himself and me increased continually , and it was maintained on this odd footing : that , while Mr. Dick came professedly to look after me as my guardian , he always consulted me in any little matter of doubt that arose , and invariably guided himself by my advice ; not only having a high respect for my native sagacity , but considering that I inherited a good deal from my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 89]: One Thursday morning , when I was about to walk with Mr. Dick from the hotel to the coach office before going back to school -LRB- for we had an hour 's school before breakfast -RRB- , I met Uriah in the street , who reminded me of the promise I had made to take tea with himself and his mother : adding , with a writhe , ` But I did n't expect you to keep it , Master Copperfield , we 're so very umble . '
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 41]: I really had not yet been able to make up my mind whether I liked Uriah or detested him ; and I was very doubtful about it still , as I stood looking him in the face in the street .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 22]: But I felt it quite an affront to be supposed proud , and said I only wanted to be asked . '
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 32]: Oh , if that 's all , Master Copperfield , ' said Uriah , ` and it really is n't our umbleness that prevents you , will you come this evening ?
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 30]: But if it is our umbleness , I hope you wo n't mind owning to it , Master Copperfield ; for we are well aware of our condition . '
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 29]: I said I would mention it to Mr. Wickfield , and if he approved , as I had no doubt he would , I would come with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 26]: So , at six o'clock that evening , which was one of the early office evenings , I announced myself as ready , to Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 18]: ` Mother will be proud , indeed , ' he said , as we walked away together .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 17]: ` Or she would be proud , if it was n't sinful , Master Copperfield . '
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 17]: ` Yet you did n't mind supposing I was proud this morning , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 10]: ` Oh dear , no , Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 3]: returned Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 8]: ` Oh , believe me , no !
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 9]: Such a thought never came into my head !
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 19]: I should n't have deemed it at all proud if you had thought US too umble for you .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 8]: Because we are so very umble . '
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 10]: ` Have you been studying much law lately ? '
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 8]: I asked , to change the subject .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 26]: ` Oh , Master Copperfield , ' he said , with an air of self-denial , ` my reading is hardly to be called study .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 18]: I have passed an hour or two in the evening , sometimes , with Mr. Tidd . '
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 8]: ` Rather hard , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 14]: said I. ` He is hard to me sometimes , ' returned Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 16]: ` But I do n't know what he might be to a gifted person . '
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 58]: After beating a little tune on his chin as he walked on , with the two forefingers of his skeleton right hand , he added : ` There are expressions , you see , Master Copperfield -- Latin words and terms -- in Mr. Tidd , that are trying to a reader of my umble attainments . '
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 10]: ` Would you like to be taught Latin ? '
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 5]: I said briskly . '
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 14]: I will teach it you with pleasure , as I learn it . '
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 18]: ` Oh , thank you , Master Copperfield , ' he answered , shaking his head . '
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 25]: I am sure it 's very kind of you to make the offer , but I am much too umble to accept it . '
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 7]: ` What nonsense , Uriah ! '
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 12]: ` Oh , indeed you must excuse me , Master Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 25]: I am greatly obliged , and I should like it of all things , I assure you ; but I am far too umble .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 24]: There are people enough to tread upon me in my lowly state , without my doing outrage to their feelings by possessing learning .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 6]: Learning ai n't for me .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 9]: A person like myself had better not aspire .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 19]: If he is to get on in life , he must get on umbly , Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 38]: I never saw his mouth so wide , or the creases in his cheeks so deep , as when he delivered himself of these sentiments : shaking his head all the time , and writhing modestly . '
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 13]: I think you are wrong , Uriah , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 22]: I dare say there are several things that I could teach you , if you would like to learn them . '
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 22]: ` Oh , I do n't doubt that , Master Copperfield , ' he answered ; ` not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 19]: But not being umble yourself , you do n't judge well , perhaps , for them that are .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 12]: I wo n't provoke my betters with knowledge , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 6]: I 'm much too umble .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 10]: Here is my umble dwelling , Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 32]: We entered a low , old-fashioned room , walked straight into from the street , and found there Mrs. Heep , who was the dead image of Uriah , only short .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 43]: She received me with the utmost humility , and apologized to me for giving her son a kiss , observing that , lowly as they were , they had their natural affections , which they hoped would give no offence to anyone .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 21]: It was a perfectly decent room , half parlour and half kitchen , but not at all a snug room .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 17]: The tea-things were set upon the table , and the kettle was boiling on the hob .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 62]: There was a chest of drawers with an escritoire top , for Uriah to read or write at of an evening ; there was Uriah 's blue bag lying down and vomiting papers ; there was a company of Uriah 's books commanded by Mr. Tidd ; there was a corner cupboard : and there were the usual articles of furniture .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 27]: I do n't remember that any individual object had a bare , pinched , spare look ; but I do remember that the whole place had .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 17]: It was perhaps a part of Mrs. Heep 's humility , that she still wore weeds .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 19]: Notwithstanding the lapse of time that had occurred since Mr. Heep 's decease , she still wore weeds .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 25]: I think there was some compromise in the cap ; but otherwise she was as weedy as in the early days of her mourning .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 36]: ` This is a day to be remembered , my Uriah , I am sure , ' said Mrs. Heep , making the tea , ` when Master Copperfield pays us a visit . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 13]: I said you 'd think so , mother , ' said Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 37]: ` If I could have wished father to remain among us for any reason , ' said Mrs. Heep , ` it would have been , that he might have known his company this afternoon . '
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 31]: I felt embarrassed by these compliments ; but I was sensible , too , of being entertained as an honoured guest , and I thought Mrs. Heep an agreeable woman .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 22]: ` My Uriah , ' said Mrs. Heep , ` has looked forward to this , sir , a long while .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 19]: He had his fears that our umbleness stood in the way , and I joined in them myself .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 21]: Umble we are , umble we have been , umble we shall ever be , ' said Mrs. Heep . '
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 23]: I am sure you have no occasion to be so , ma'am , ' I said , ` unless you like . '
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 11]: ` Thank you , sir , ' retorted Mrs. Heep .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 12]: ` We know our station and are thankful in it . '
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 36]: I found that Mrs. Heep gradually got nearer to me , and that Uriah gradually got opposite to me , and that they respectfully plied me with the choicest of the eatables on the table .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 28]: There was nothing particularly choice there , to be sure ; but I took the will for the deed , and felt that they were very attentive .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 67]: Presently they began to talk about aunts , and then I told them about mine ; and about fathers and mothers , and then I told them about mine ; and then Mrs. Heep began to talk about fathers-in-law , and then I began to tell her about mine -- but stopped , because my aunt had advised me to observe a silence on that subject .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 47]: A tender young cork , however , would have had no more chance against a pair of corkscrews , or a tender young tooth against a pair of dentists , or a little shuttlecock against two battledores , than I had against Uriah and Mrs. Heep .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 32]: They did just what they liked with me ; and wormed things out of me that I had no desire to tell , with a certainty I blush to think of .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 34]: the more especially , as in my juvenile frankness , I took some credit to myself for being so confidential and felt that I was quite the patron of my two respectful entertainers .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 12]: They were very fond of one another : that was certain .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 44]: I take it , that had its effect upon me , as a touch of nature ; but the skill with which the one followed up whatever the other said , was a touch of art which I was still less proof against .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 40]: When there was nothing more to be got out of me about myself -LRB- for on the Murdstone and Grinby life , and on my journey , I was dumb -RRB- , they began about Mr. Wickfield and Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 58]: Uriah threw the ball to Mrs. Heep , Mrs. Heep caught it and threw it back to Uriah , Uriah kept it up a little while , then sent it back to Mrs. Heep , and so they went on tossing it about until I had no idea who had got it , and was quite bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 8]: The ball itself was always changing too .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 150]: Now it was Mr. Wickfield , now Agnes , now the excellence of Mr. Wickfield , now my admiration of Agnes ; now the extent of Mr. Wickfield 's business and resources , now our domestic life after dinner ; now , the wine that Mr. Wickfield took , the reason why he took it , and the pity that it was he took so much ; now one thing , now another , then everything at once ; and all the time , without appearing to speak very often , or to do anything but sometimes encourage them a little , for fear they should be overcome by their humility and the honour of my company , I found myself perpetually letting out something or other that I had no business to let out and seeing the effect of it in the twinkling of Uriah 's dinted nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 69]: I had begun to be a little uncomfortable , and to wish myself well out of the visit , when a figure coming down the street passed the door -- it stood open to air the room , which was warm , the weather being close for the time of year -- came back again , looked in , and walked in , exclaiming loudly , ` Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 5]: Is it possible ? '
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 5]: It was Mr. Micawber !
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 33]: It was Mr. Micawber , with his eye-glass , and his walking-stick , and his shirt-collar , and his genteel air , and the condescending roll in his voice , all complete !
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 50]: ` My dear Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber , putting out his hand , ` this is indeed a meeting which is calculated to impress the mind with a sense of the instability and uncertainty of all human -- in short , it is a most extraordinary meeting .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 57]: Walking along the street , reflecting upon the probability of something turning up -LRB- of which I am at present rather sanguine -RRB- , I find a young but valued friend turn up , who is connected with the most eventful period of my life ; I may say , with the turning-point of my existence .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 12]: Copperfield , my dear fellow , how do you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 44]: I can not say -- I really can not say -- that I was glad to see Mr. Micawber there ; but I was glad to see him too , and shook hands with him , heartily , inquiring how Mrs. Micawber was .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 24]: ` Thank you , ' said Mr. Micawber , waving his hand as of old , and settling his chin in his shirt-collar .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 6]: ` She is tolerably convalescent .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 45]: The twins no longer derive their sustenance from Nature 's founts -- in short , ' said Mr. Micawber , in one of his bursts of confidence , ` they are weaned -- and Mrs. Micawber is , at present , my travelling companion .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 31]: She will be rejoiced , Copperfield , to renew her acquaintance with one who has proved himself in all respects a worthy minister at the sacred altar of friendship . '
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 10]: I said I should be delighted to see her .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 11]: ` You are very good , ' said Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 16]: Mr. Micawber then smiled , settled his chin again , and looked about him . '
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 67]: I have discovered my friend Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber genteelly , and without addressing himself particularly to anyone , ` not in solitude , but partaking of a social meal in company with a widow lady , and one who is apparently her offspring -- in short , ' said Mr. Micawber , in another of his bursts of confidence , ` her son .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 11]: I shall esteem it an honour to be presented . '
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 27]: I could do no less , under these circumstances , than make Mr. Micawber known to Uriah Heep and his mother ; which I accordingly did .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 23]: As they abased themselves before him , Mr. Micawber took a seat , and waved his hand in his most courtly manner .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 23]: ` Any friend of my friend Copperfield 's , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` has a personal claim upon myself . '
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 27]: ` We are too umble , sir , ' said Mrs. Heep , ` my son and me , to be the friends of Master Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 33]: He has been so good as take his tea with us , and we are thankful to him for his company , also to you , sir , for your notice . '
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 26]: ` Ma'am , ' returned Mr. Micawber , with a bow , ` you are very obliging : and what are you doing , Copperfield ?
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 7]: Still in the wine trade ? '
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 42]: I was excessively anxious to get Mr. Micawber away ; and replied , with my hat in my hand , and a very red face , I have no doubt , that I was a pupil at Doctor Strong 's . '
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 4]: A pupil ? '
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 9]: said Mr. Micawber , raising his eyebrows . '
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 8]: I am extremely happy to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 79]: Although a mind like my friend Copperfield 's ' -- to Uriah and Mrs. Heep -- ` does not require that cultivation which , without his knowledge of men and things , it would require , still it is a rich soil teeming with latent vegetation -- in short , ' said Mr. Micawber , smiling , in another burst of confidence , ` it is an intellect capable of getting up the classics to any extent . '
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 31]: Uriah , with his long hands slowly twining over one another , made a ghastly writhe from the waist upwards , to express his concurrence in this estimation of me .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 12]: ` Shall we go and see Mrs. Micawber , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 9]: I said , to get Mr. Micawber away .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 19]: ` If you will do her that favour , Copperfield , ' replied Mr. Micawber , rising . '
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 36]: I have no scruple in saying , in the presence of our friends here , that I am a man who has , for some years , contended against the pressure of pecuniary difficulties . '
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 22]: I knew he was certain to say something of this kind ; he always would be so boastful about his difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 10]: ` Sometimes I have risen superior to my difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 12]: Sometimes my difficulties have -- in short , have floored me .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 53]: There have been times when I have administered a succession of facers to them ; there have been times when they have been too many for me , and I have given in , and said to Mrs. Micawber , in the words of Cato , `` Plato , thou reasonest well .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 6]: It 's all up now .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 8]: I can show fight no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 63]: But at no time of my life , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` have I enjoyed a higher degree of satisfaction than in pouring my griefs -LRB- if I may describe difficulties , chiefly arising out of warrants of attorney and promissory notes at two and four months , by that word -RRB- into the bosom of my friend Copperfield . '
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 13]: Mr. Micawber closed this handsome tribute by saying , ` Mr. Heep !
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 3]: Good evening .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 3]: Mrs. Heep !
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 37]: Your servant , ' and then walking out with me in his most fashionable manner , making a good deal of noise on the pavement with his shoes , and humming a tune as we went .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 33]: It was a little inn where Mr. Micawber put up , and he occupied a little room in it , partitioned off from the commercial room , and strongly flavoured with tobacco-smoke .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 34]: I think it was over the kitchen , because a warm greasy smell appeared to come up through the chinks in the floor , and there was a flabby perspiration on the walls .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 20]: I know it was near the bar , on account of the smell of spirits and jingling of glasses .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 71]: Here , recumbent on a small sofa , underneath a picture of a race-horse , with her head close to the fire , and her feet pushing the mustard off the dumb-waiter at the other end of the room , was Mrs. Micawber , to whom Mr. Micawber entered first , saying , ` My dear , allow me to introduce to you a pupil of Doctor Strong 's . '
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 43]: I noticed , by the by , that although Mr. Micawber was just as much confused as ever about my age and standing , he always remembered , as a genteel thing , that I was a pupil of Doctor Strong 's .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 12]: Mrs. Micawber was amazed , but very glad to see me .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 28]: I was very glad to see her too , and , after an affectionate greeting on both sides , sat down on the small sofa near her .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 56]: ` My dear , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` if you will mention to Copperfield what our present position is , which I have no doubt he will like to know , I will go and look at the paper the while , and see whether anything turns up among the advertisements . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 21]: I thought you were at Plymouth , ma'am , ' I said to Mrs. Micawber , as he went out .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 17]: ` My dear Master Copperfield , ' she replied , ` we went to Plymouth . '
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 11]: ` To be on the spot , ' I hinted .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 9]: ` Just so , ' said Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 7]: ` To be on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 15]: But , the truth is , talent is not wanted in the Custom House .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 26]: The local influence of my family was quite unavailing to obtain any employment in that department , for a man of Mr. Micawber 's abilities .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 13]: They would rather NOT have a man of Mr. Micawber 's abilities .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 10]: He would only show the deficiency of the others .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 79]: Apart from which , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ' I will not disguise from you , my dear Master Copperfield , that when that branch of my family which is settled in Plymouth , became aware that Mr. Micawber was accompanied by myself , and by little Wilkins and his sister , and by the twins , they did not receive him with that ardour which he might have expected , being so newly released from captivity .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 25]: In fact , ' said Mrs. Micawber , lowering her voice , -- ` this is between ourselves -- our reception was cool . '
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' said Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 25]: ` It is truly painful to contemplate mankind in such an aspect , Master Copperfield , but our reception was , decidedly , cool .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 7]: There is no doubt about it .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 29]: In fact , that branch of my family which is settled in Plymouth became quite personal to Mr. Micawber , before we had been there a week . '
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 15]: I said , and thought , that they ought to be ashamed of themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 12]: ` Still , so it was , ' continued Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 16]: ` Under such circumstances , what could a man of Mr. Micawber 's spirit do ?
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 7]: But one obvious course was left .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 25]: To borrow , of that branch of my family , the money to return to London , and to return at any sacrifice . '
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 11]: ` Then you all came back again , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 12]: ` We all came back again , ' replied Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 46]: ` Since then , I have consulted other branches of my family on the course which it is most expedient for Mr. Micawber to take -- for I maintain that he must take some course , Master Copperfield , ' said Mrs. Micawber , argumentatively .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 22]: ` It is clear that a family of six , not including a domestic , can not live upon air . '
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 39]: ` Certainly , ma'am , ' said I. ` The opinion of those other branches of my family , ' pursued Mrs. Micawber , ` is , that Mr. Micawber should immediately turn his attention to coals . '
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 7]: ` To what , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 9]: ` To coals , ' said Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 6]: ` To the coal trade .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 28]: Mr. Micawber was induced to think , on inquiry , that there might be an opening for a man of his talent in the Medway Coal Trade .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 25]: Then , as Mr. Micawber very properly said , the first step to be taken clearly was , to come and see the Medway .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 6]: Which we came and saw .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 30]: I say `` we '' , Master Copperfield ; for I never will , ' said Mrs. Micawber with emotion , ' I never will desert Mr. Micawber . '
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 7]: I murmured my admiration and approbation .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 15]: ` We came , ' repeated Mrs. Micawber , ` and saw the Medway .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 24]: My opinion of the coal trade on that river is , that it may require talent , but that it certainly requires capital .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 13]: Talent , Mr. Micawber has ; capital , Mr. Micawber has not .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 20]: We saw , I think , the greater part of the Medway ; and that is my individual conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 25]: Being so near here , Mr. Micawber was of opinion that it would be rash not to come on , and see the Cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 37]: Firstly , on account of its being so well worth seeing , and our never having seen it ; and secondly , on account of the great probability of something turning up in a cathedral town .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 14]: We have been here , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` three days .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 52]: Nothing has , as yet , turned up ; and it may not surprise you , my dear Master Copperfield , so much as it would a stranger , to know that we are at present waiting for a remittance from London , to discharge our pecuniary obligations at this hotel .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 44]: Until the arrival of that remittance , ' said Mrs. Micawber with much feeling , ' I am cut off from my home -LRB- I allude to lodgings in Pentonville -RRB- , from my boy and girl , and from my twins . '
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 45]: I felt the utmost sympathy for Mr. and Mrs. Micawber in this anxious extremity , and said as much to Mr. Micawber , who now returned : adding that I only wished I had money enough , to lend them the amount they needed .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 11]: Mr. Micawber 's answer expressed the disturbance of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 40]: He said , shaking hands with me , ` Copperfield , you are a true friend ; but when the worst comes to the worst , no man is without a friend who is possessed of shaving materials . '
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 21]: At this dreadful hint Mrs. Micawber threw her arms round Mr. Micawber 's neck and entreated him to be calm .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 37]: He wept ; but so far recovered , almost immediately , as to ring the bell for the waiter , and bespeak a hot kidney pudding and a plate of shrimps for breakfast in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 29]: When I took my leave of them , they both pressed me so much to come and dine before they went away , that I could not refuse .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 69]: But , as I knew I could not come next day , when I should have a good deal to prepare in the evening , Mr. Micawber arranged that he would call at Doctor Strong 's in the course of the morning -LRB- having a presentiment that the remittance would arrive by that post -RRB- , and propose the day after , if it would suit me better .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 32]: Accordingly I was called out of school next forenoon , and found Mr. Micawber in the parlour ; who had called to say that the dinner would take place as proposed .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 17]: When I asked him if the remittance had come , he pressed my hand and departed .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 60]: As I was looking out of window that same evening , it surprised me , and made me rather uneasy , to see Mr. Micawber and Uriah Heep walk past , arm in arm : Uriah humbly sensible of the honour that was done him , and Mr. Micawber taking a bland delight in extending his patronage to Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 52]: But I was still more surprised , when I went to the little hotel next day at the appointed dinner-hour , which was four o'clock , to find , from what Mr. Micawber said , that he had gone home with Uriah , and had drunk brandy-and-water at Mrs. Heep 's .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 30]: ` And I 'll tell you what , my dear Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` your friend Heep is a young fellow who might be attorney-general .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 43]: If I had known that young man , at the period when my difficulties came to a crisis , all I can say is , that I believe my creditors would have been a great deal better managed than they were . '
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 31]: I hardly understood how this could have been , seeing that Mr. Micawber had paid them nothing at all as it was ; but I did not like to ask .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 30]: Neither did I like to say , that I hoped he had not been too communicative to Uriah ; or to inquire if they had talked much about me .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 41]: I was afraid of hurting Mr. Micawber 's feelings , or , at all events , Mrs. Micawber 's , she being very sensitive ; but I was uncomfortable about it , too , and often thought about it afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 7]: We had a beautiful little dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 27]: Quite an elegant dish of fish ; the kidney-end of a loin of veal , roasted ; fried sausage-meat ; a partridge , and a pudding .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 27]: There was wine , and there was strong ale ; and after dinner Mrs. Micawber made us a bowl of hot punch with her own hands .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 6]: Mr. Micawber was uncommonly convivial .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 8]: I never saw him such good company .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 22]: He made his face shine with the punch , so that it looked as if it had been varnished all over .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 43]: He got cheerfully sentimental about the town , and proposed success to it ; observing that Mrs. Micawber and himself had been made extremely snug and comfortable there and that he never should forget the agreeable hours they had passed in Canterbury .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 36]: He proposed me afterwards ; and he , and Mrs. Micawber , and I , took a review of our past acquaintance , in the course of which we sold the property all over again .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 39]: Then I proposed Mrs. Micawber : or , at least , said , modestly , ` If you 'll allow me , Mrs. Micawber , I shall now have the pleasure of drinking your health , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 58]: On which Mr. Micawber delivered an eulogium on Mrs. Micawber 's character , and said she had ever been his guide , philosopher , and friend , and that he would recommend me , when I came to a marrying time of life , to marry such another woman , if such another woman could be found .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 14]: As the punch disappeared , Mr. Micawber became still more friendly and convivial .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 17]: Mrs. Micawber 's spirits becoming elevated , too , we sang ` Auld Lang Syne ' .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 53]: When we came to ` Here 's a hand , my trusty frere ' , we all joined hands round the table ; and when we declared we would ` take a right gude Willie Waught ' , and had n't the least idea what it meant , we were really affected .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 39]: In a word , I never saw anybody so thoroughly jovial as Mr. Micawber was , down to the very last moment of the evening , when I took a hearty farewell of himself and his amiable wife .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 55]: Consequently , I was not prepared , at seven o'clock next morning , to receive the following communication , dated half past nine in the evening ; a quarter of an hour after I had left him : -- ` My DEAR YOUNG FRIEND , ` The die is cast -- all is over .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 30]: Hiding the ravages of care with a sickly mask of mirth , I have not informed you , this evening , that there is no hope of the remittance !
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 51]: Under these circumstances , alike humiliating to endure , humiliating to contemplate , and humiliating to relate , I have discharged the pecuniary liability contracted at this establishment , by giving a note of hand , made payable fourteen days after date , at my residence , Pentonville , London .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 12]: When it becomes due , it will not be taken up .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 5]: The result is destruction .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 11]: The bolt is impending , and the tree must fall .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 22]: ` Let the wretched man who now addresses you , my dear Copperfield , be a beacon to you through life .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 11]: He writes with that intention , and in that hope .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 48]: If he could think himself of so much use , one gleam of day might , by possibility , penetrate into the cheerless dungeon of his remaining existence -- though his longevity is , at present -LRB- to say the least of it -RRB- , extremely problematical .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 27]: ` This is the last communication , my dear Copperfield , you will ever receive ` From ` The Beggared Outcast , ` WILKINS MICAWBER . '
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 47]: I was so shocked by the contents of this heart-rending letter , that I ran off directly towards the little hotel with the intention of taking it on my way to Doctor Strong 's , and trying to soothe Mr. Micawber with a word of comfort .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 53]: But , half-way there , I met the London coach with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber up behind ; Mr. Micawber , the very picture of tranquil enjoyment , smiling at Mrs. Micawber 's conversation , eating walnuts out of a paper bag , with a bottle sticking out of his breast pocket .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 21]: As they did not see me , I thought it best , all things considered , not to see them .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 47]: So , with a great weight taken off my mind , I turned into a by-street that was the nearest way to school , and felt , upon the whole , relieved that they were gone ; though I still liked them very much , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 7]: Chapter 18 A Retrospect My school-days !
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 23]: The silent gliding on of my existence -- the unseen , unfelt progress of my life -- from childhood up to youth !
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 39]: Let me think , as I look back upon that flowing water , now a dry channel overgrown with leaves , whether there are any marks along its course , by which I can remember how it ran .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 30]: A moment , and I occupy my place in the Cathedral , where we all went together , every Sunday morning , assembling first at school for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 54]: The earthy smell , the sunless air , the sensation of the world being shut out , the resounding of the organ through the black and white arched galleries and aisles , are wings that take me back , and hold me hovering above those days , in a half-sleeping and half-waking dream .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 10]: I am not the last boy in the school .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 12]: I have risen in a few months , over several heads .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 21]: But the first boy seems to me a mighty creature , dwelling afar off , whose giddy height is unattainable .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 50]: Agnes says ` No , ' but I say ` Yes , ' and tell her that she little thinks what stores of knowledge have been mastered by the wonderful Being , at whose place she thinks I , even I , weak aspirant , may arrive in time .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 23]: He is not my private friend and public patron , as Steerforth was , but I hold him in a reverential respect .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 27]: I chiefly wonder what he 'll be , when he leaves Doctor Strong 's , and what mankind will do to maintain any place against him .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 9]: But who is this that breaks upon me ?
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 9]: This is Miss Shepherd , whom I love .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 12]: Miss Shepherd is a boarder at the Misses Nettingalls ' establishment .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 5]: I adore Miss Shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 19]: She is a little girl , in a spencer , with a round face and curly flaxen hair .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 12]: The Misses Nettingalls ' young ladies come to the Cathedral too .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 16]: I can not look upon my book , for I must look upon Miss Shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 10]: When the choristers chaunt , I hear Miss Shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 20]: In the service I mentally insert Miss Shepherd 's name -- I put her in among the Royal Family .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 23]: At home , in my own room , I am sometimes moved to cry out , ` Oh , Miss Shepherd ! '
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 6]: in a transport of love .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 28]: For some time , I am doubtful of Miss Shepherd 's feelings , but , at length , Fate being propitious , we meet at the dancing-school .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 8]: I have Miss Shepherd for my partner .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 27]: I touch Miss Shepherd 's glove , and feel a thrill go up the right arm of my jacket , and come out at my hair .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 13]: I say nothing to Miss Shepherd , but we understand each other .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 10]: Miss Shepherd and myself live but to be united .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 17]: Why do I secretly give Miss Shepherd twelve Brazil nuts for a present , I wonder ?
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 49]: They are not expressive of affection , they are difficult to pack into a parcel of any regular shape , they are hard to crack , even in room doors , and they are oily when cracked ; yet I feel that they are appropriate to Miss Shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 17]: Soft , seedy biscuits , also , I bestow upon Miss Shepherd ; and oranges innumerable .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 10]: Once , I kiss Miss Shepherd in the cloak-room .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 2]: Ecstasy !
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 32]: What are my agony and indignation next day , when I hear a flying rumour that the Misses Nettingall have stood Miss Shepherd in the stocks for turning in her toes !
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 23]: Miss Shepherd being the one pervading theme and vision of my life , how do I ever come to break with her ?
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 5]: I ca n't conceive .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 11]: And yet a coolness grows between Miss Shepherd and myself .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 28]: Whispers reach me of Miss Shepherd having said she wished I would n't stare so , and having avowed a preference for Master Jones -- for Jones !
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 7]: a boy of no merit whatever !
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 9]: The gulf between me and Miss Shepherd widens .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 16]: At last , one day , I meet the Misses Nettingalls ' establishment out walking .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 16]: Miss Shepherd makes a face as she goes by , and laughs to her companion .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 4]: All is over .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 40]: The devotion of a life -- it seems a life , it is all the same -- is at an end ; Miss Shepherd comes out of the morning service , and the Royal Family know her no more .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 14]: I am higher in the school , and no one breaks my peace .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 38]: I am not at all polite , now , to the Misses Nettingalls ' young ladies , and should n't dote on any of them , if they were twice as many and twenty times as beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 23]: I think the dancing-school a tiresome affair , and wonder why the girls ca n't dance by themselves and leave us alone .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 16]: I am growing great in Latin verses , and neglect the laces of my boots .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 13]: Doctor Strong refers to me in public as a promising young scholar .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 19]: Mr. Dick is wild with joy , and my aunt remits me a guinea by the next post .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 18]: The shade of a young butcher rises , like the apparition of an armed head in Macbeth .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 6]: Who is this young butcher ?
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 10]: He is the terror of the youth of Canterbury .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 32]: There is a vague belief abroad , that the beef suet with which he anoints his hair gives him unnatural strength , and that he is a match for a man .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 24]: He is a broad-faced , bull-necked , young butcher , with rough red cheeks , an ill-conditioned mind , and an injurious tongue .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 17]: His main use of this tongue , is , to disparage Doctor Strong 's young gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 16]: He says , publicly , that if they want anything he 'll give it 'em .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 27]: He names individuals among them -LRB- myself included -RRB- , whom he could undertake to settle with one hand , and the other tied behind him .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 21]: He waylays the smaller boys to punch their unprotected heads , and calls challenges after me in the open streets .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 11]: For these sufficient reasons I resolve to fight the butcher .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 19]: It is a summer evening , down in a green hollow , at the corner of a wall .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 7]: I meet the butcher by appointment .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 27]: I am attended by a select body of our boys ; the butcher , by two other butchers , a young publican , and a sweep .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 15]: The preliminaries are adjusted , and the butcher and myself stand face to face .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 15]: In a moment the butcher lights ten thousand candles out of my left eyebrow .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 23]: In another moment , I do n't know where the wall is , or where I am , or where anybody is .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 28]: I hardly know which is myself and which the butcher , we are always in such a tangle and tussle , knocking about upon the trodden grass .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 50]: Sometimes I see the butcher , bloody but confident ; sometimes I see nothing , and sit gasping on my second 's knee ; sometimes I go in at the butcher madly , and cut my knuckles open against his face , without appearing to discompose him at all .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 58]: At last I awake , very queer about the head , as from a giddy sleep , and see the butcher walking off , congratulated by the two other butchers and the sweep and publican , and putting on his coat as he goes ; from which I augur , justly , that the victory is his .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 43]: I am taken home in a sad plight , and I have beef-steaks put to my eyes , and am rubbed with vinegar and brandy , and find a great puffy place bursting out on my upper lip , which swells immoderately .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 57]: For three or four days I remain at home , a very ill-looking subject , with a green shade over my eyes ; and I should be very dull , but that Agnes is a sister to me , and condoles with me , and reads to me , and makes the time light and happy .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 49]: Agnes has my confidence completely , always ; I tell her all about the butcher , and the wrongs he has heaped upon me ; she thinks I could n't have done otherwise than fight the butcher , while she shrinks and trembles at my having fought him .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 31]: Time has stolen on unobserved , for Adams is not the head-boy in the days that are come now , nor has he been this many and many a day .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 34]: Adams has left the school so long , that when he comes back , on a visit to Doctor Strong , there are not many there , besides myself , who know him .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 25]: Adams is going to be called to the bar almost directly , and is to be an advocate , and to wear a wig .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 20]: I am surprised to find him a meeker man than I had thought , and less imposing in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 35]: He has not staggered the world yet , either ; for it goes on -LRB- as well as I can make out -RRB- pretty much the same as if he had never joined it .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 28]: A blank , through which the warriors of poetry and history march on in stately hosts that seem to have no end -- and what comes next !
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 7]: I am the head-boy , now !
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 36]: I look down on the line of boys below me , with a condescending interest in such of them as bring to my mind the boy I was myself , when I first came there .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 46]: That little fellow seems to be no part of me ; I remember him as something left behind upon the road of life -- as something I have passed , rather than have actually been -- and almost think of him as of someone else .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 19]: And the little girl I saw on that first day at Mr. Wickfield 's , where is she ?
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 3]: Gone also .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 66]: In her stead , the perfect likeness of the picture , a child likeness no more , moves about the house ; and Agnes -- my sweet sister , as I call her in my thoughts , my counsellor and friend , the better angel of the lives of all who come within her calm , good , self-denying influence -- is quite a woman .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 28]: What other changes have come upon me , besides the changes in my growth and looks , and in the knowledge I have garnered all this while ?
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 43]: I wear a gold watch and chain , a ring upon my little finger , and a long-tailed coat ; and I use a great deal of bear 's grease -- which , taken in conjunction with the ring , looks bad .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 6]: Am I in love again ?
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 3]: I am .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 7]: I worship the eldest Miss Larkins .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 10]: The eldest Miss Larkins is not a little girl .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 15]: She is a tall , dark , black-eyed , fine figure of a woman .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 29]: The eldest Miss Larkins is not a chicken ; for the youngest Miss Larkins is not that , and the eldest must be three or four years older .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 10]: Perhaps the eldest Miss Larkins may be about thirty .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 9]: My passion for her is beyond all bounds .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 7]: The eldest Miss Larkins knows officers .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 8]: It is an awful thing to bear .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 10]: I see them speaking to her in the street .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 36]: I see them cross the way to meet her , when her bonnet -LRB- she has a bright taste in bonnets -RRB- is seen coming down the pavement , accompanied by her sister 's bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 11]: She laughs and talks , and seems to like it .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 19]: I spend a good deal of my own spare time in walking up and down to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 27]: If I can bow to her once in the day -LRB- I know her to bow to , knowing Mr. Larkins -RRB- , I am happier .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 8]: I deserve a bow now and then .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 42]: The raging agonies I suffer on the night of the Race Ball , where I know the eldest Miss Larkins will be dancing with the military , ought to have some compensation , if there be even-handed justice in the world .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 17]: My passion takes away my appetite , and makes me wear my newest silk neckerchief continually .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 22]: I have no relief but in putting on my best clothes , and having my boots cleaned over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 14]: I seem , then , to be worthier of the eldest Miss Larkins .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 17]: Everything that belongs to her , or is connected with her , is precious to me .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 29]: Mr. Larkins -LRB- a gruff old gentleman with a double chin , and one of his eyes immovable in his head -RRB- is fraught with interest to me .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 18]: When I ca n't meet his daughter , I go where I am likely to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 11]: To say ` How do you do , Mr. Larkins ?
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 12]: Are the young ladies and all the family quite well ? '
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 8]: seems so pointed , that I blush .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 7]: I think continually about my age .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 21]: Say I am seventeen , and say that seventeen is young for the eldest Miss Larkins , what of that ?
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 11]: Besides , I shall be one-and-twenty in no time almost .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 45]: I regularly take walks outside Mr. Larkins 's house in the evening , though it cuts me to the heart to see the officers go in , or to hear them up in the drawing-room , where the eldest Miss Larkins plays the harp .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 109]: I even walk , on two or three occasions , in a sickly , spoony manner , round and round the house after the family are gone to bed , wondering which is the eldest Miss Larkins 's chamber -LRB- and pitching , I dare say now , on Mr. Larkins 's instead -RRB- ; wishing that a fire would burst out ; that the assembled crowd would stand appalled ; that I , dashing through them with a ladder , might rear it against her window , save her in my arms , go back for something she had left behind , and perish in the flames .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 26]: For I am generally disinterested in my love , and think I could be content to make a figure before Miss Larkins , and expire .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 6]: Generally , but not always .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 7]: Sometimes brighter visions rise before me .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 36]: When I dress -LRB- the occupation of two hours -RRB- , for a great ball given at the Larkins 's -LRB- the anticipation of three weeks -RRB- , I indulge my fancy with pleasing images .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 13]: I picture myself taking courage to make a declaration to Miss Larkins .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 27]: I picture Miss Larkins sinking her head upon my shoulder , and saying , ` Oh , Mr. Copperfield , can I believe my ears ! '
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 25]: I picture Mr. Larkins waiting on me next morning , and saying , ` My dear Copperfield , my daughter has told me all .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 5]: Youth is no objection .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 6]: Here are twenty thousand pounds .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 4]: Be happy ! '
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 23]: I picture my aunt relenting , and blessing us ; and Mr. Dick and Doctor Strong being present at the marriage ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 32]: I am a sensible fellow , I believe -- I believe , on looking back , I mean -- and modest I am sure ; but all this goes on notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 38]: I repair to the enchanted house , where there are lights , chattering , music , flowers , officers -LRB- I am sorry to see -RRB- , and the eldest Miss Larkins , a blaze of beauty .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 25]: She is dressed in blue , with blue flowers in her hair -- forget-me-nots -- as if SHE had any need to wear forget-me-nots .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 70]: It is the first really grown-up party that I have ever been invited to , and I am a little uncomfortable ; for I appear not to belong to anybody , and nobody appears to have anything to say to me , except Mr. Larkins , who asks me how my schoolfellows are , which he need n't do , as I have not come there to be insulted .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 34]: But after I have stood in the doorway for some time , and feasted my eyes upon the goddess of my heart , she approaches me -- she , the eldest Miss Larkins !
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 10]: -- and asks me pleasantly , if I dance ?
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 15]: I stammer , with a bow , ` With you , Miss Larkins . '
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 7]: ` With no one else ? '
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 5]: inquires Miss Larkins . '
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 12]: I should have no pleasure in dancing with anyone else . '
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 29]: Miss Larkins laughs and blushes -LRB- or I think she blushes -RRB- , and says , ` Next time but one , I shall be very glad . '
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 4]: The time arrives .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 20]: ` It is a waltz , I think , ' Miss Larkins doubtfully observes , when I present myself .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 5]: ` Do you waltz ?
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 29]: If not , Captain Bailey -- ' But I do waltz -LRB- pretty well , too , as it happens -RRB- , and I take Miss Larkins out .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 11]: I take her sternly from the side of Captain Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 16]: He is wretched , I have no doubt ; but he is nothing to me .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 7]: I have been wretched , too .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 8]: I waltz with the eldest Miss Larkins !
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 13]: I do n't know where , among whom , or how long .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 39]: I only know that I swim about in space , with a blue angel , in a state of blissful delirium , until I find myself alone with her in a little room , resting on a sofa .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 17]: She admires a flower -LRB- pink camellia japonica , price half-a-crown -RRB- , in my button-hole .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 21]: I give it her , and say : ' I ask an inestimable price for it , Miss Larkins . '
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 3]: ` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 5]: What is that ? '
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 5]: returns Miss Larkins . '
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 17]: A flower of yours , that I may treasure it as a miser does gold . '
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 12]: ` You 're a bold boy , ' says Miss Larkins .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 4]: ` There . '
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 22]: She gives it me , not displeased ; and I put it to my lips , and then into my breast .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 25]: Miss Larkins , laughing , draws her hand through my arm , and says , ` Now take me back to Captain Bailey . '
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 45]: I am lost in the recollection of this delicious interview , and the waltz , when she comes to me again , with a plain elderly gentleman who has been playing whist all night , upon her arm , and says : ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 6]: here is my bold friend !
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 11]: Mr. Chestle wants to know you , Mr. Copperfield . '
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 19]: I feel at once that he is a friend of the family , and am much gratified . '
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 12]: I admire your taste , sir , ' says Mr. Chestle .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 6]: ` It does you credit .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 60]: I suppose you do n't take much interest in hops ; but I am a pretty large grower myself ; and if you ever like to come over to our neighbourhood -- neighbourhood of Ashford -- and take a run about our place , -- we shall be glad for you to stop as long as you like . '
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 10]: I thank Mr. Chestle warmly , and shake hands .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 9]: I think I am in a happy dream .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 10]: I waltz with the eldest Miss Larkins once again .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 7]: She says I waltz so well !
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 31]: I go home in a state of unspeakable bliss , and waltz in imagination , all night long , with my arm round the blue waist of my dear divinity .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 26]: For some days afterwards , I am lost in rapturous reflections ; but I neither see her in the street , nor when I call .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 16]: I am imperfectly consoled for this disappointment by the sacred pledge , the perished flower .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 12]: ` Trotwood , ' says Agnes , one day after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 12]: ` Who do you think is going to be married tomorrow ?
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 5]: Someone you admire . '
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 10]: ` Not you , I suppose , Agnes ? '
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 5]: ` Not me ! '
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 11]: raising her cheerful face from the music she is copying .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 8]: ` Do you hear him , Papa ?
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 7]: -- The eldest Miss Larkins . '
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 8]: ` To -- to Captain Bailey ? '
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 8]: I have just enough power to ask .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 7]: ` No ; to no Captain .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 8]: To Mr. Chestle , a hop-grower . '
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 11]: I am terribly dejected for about a week or two .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 32]: I take off my ring , I wear my worst clothes , I use no bear 's grease , and I frequently lament over the late Miss Larkins 's faded flower .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 40]: Being , by that time , rather tired of this kind of life , and having received new provocation from the butcher , I throw the flower away , go out with the butcher , and gloriously defeat him .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 36]: This , and the resumption of my ring , as well as of the bear 's grease in moderation , are the last marks I can discern , now , in my progress to seventeen .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 42]: Chapter 19 I Look About Me , and Make a Discovery I am doubtful whether I was at heart glad or sorry , when my school-days drew to an end , and the time came for my leaving Doctor Strong 's .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 27]: I had been very happy there , I had a great attachment for the Doctor , and I was eminent and distinguished in that little world .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 21]: For these reasons I was sorry to go ; but for other reasons , unsubstantial enough , I was glad .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 56]: Misty ideas of being a young man at my own disposal , of the importance attaching to a young man at his own disposal , of the wonderful things to be seen and done by that magnificent animal , and the wonderful effects he could not fail to make upon society , lured me away .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 31]: So powerful were these visionary considerations in my boyish mind , that I seem , according to my present way of thinking , to have left school without natural regret .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 15]: The separation has not made the impression on me , that other separations have .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 27]: I try in vain to recall how I felt about it , and what its circumstances were ; but it is not momentous in my recollection .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 8]: I suppose the opening prospect confused me .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 38]: I know that my juvenile experiences went for little or nothing then ; and that life was more like a great fairy story , which I was just about to begin to read , than anything else .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 19]: My aunt and I had held many grave deliberations on the calling to which I should be devoted .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 27]: For a year or more I had endeavoured to find a satisfactory answer to her often-repeated question , ` What I would like to be ? '
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 15]: But I had no particular liking , that I could discover , for anything .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 45]: If I could have been inspired with a knowledge of the science of navigation , taken the command of a fast-sailing expedition , and gone round the world on a triumphant voyage of discovery , I think I might have considered myself completely suited .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 43]: But , in the absence of any such miraculous provision , my desire was to apply myself to some pursuit that would not lie too heavily upon her purse ; and to do my duty in it , whatever it might be .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 16]: Mr. Dick had regularly assisted at our councils , with a meditative and sage demeanour .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 37]: He never made a suggestion but once ; and on that occasion -LRB- I do n't know what put it in his head -RRB- , he suddenly proposed that I should be ' a Brazier ' .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 36]: My aunt received this proposal so very ungraciously , that he never ventured on a second ; but ever afterwards confined himself to looking watchfully at her for her suggestions , and rattling his money .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 63]: ` Trot , I tell you what , my dear , ' said my aunt , one morning in the Christmas season when I left school : ` as this knotty point is still unsettled , and as we must not make a mistake in our decision if we can help it , I think we had better take a little breathing-time .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 26]: In the meanwhile , you must try to look at it from a new point of view , and not as a schoolboy . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 6]: I will , aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 45]: ` It has occurred to me , ' pursued my aunt , ` that a little change , and a glimpse of life out of doors , may be useful in helping you to know your own mind , and form a cooler judgement .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 52]: Suppose you were to go down into the old part of the country again , for instance , and see that -- that out-of-the-way woman with the savagest of names , ' said my aunt , rubbing her nose , for she could never thoroughly forgive Peggotty for being so called .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 17]: ` Of all things in the world , aunt , I should like it best ! '
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 20]: ` Well , ' said my aunt , ` that 's lucky , for I should like it too .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 12]: But it 's natural and rational that you should like it .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 22]: And I am very well persuaded that whatever you do , Trot , will always be natural and rational . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 7]: I hope so , aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 26]: ` Your sister , Betsey Trotwood , ' said my aunt , ` would have been as natural and rational a girl as ever breathed .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 13]: You 'll be worthy of her , wo n't you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 11]: I hope I shall be worthy of YOU , aunt .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 8]: That will be enough for me . '
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 65]: ` It 's a mercy that poor dear baby of a mother of yours did n't live , ' said my aunt , looking at me approvingly , ` or she 'd have been so vain of her boy by this time , that her soft little head would have been completely turned , if there was anything of it left to turn . '
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 26]: -LRB- My aunt always excused any weakness of her own in my behalf , by transferring it in this way to my poor mother . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 15]: ` Bless me , Trotwood , how you do remind me of her ! '
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 9]: ` Pleasantly , I hope , aunt ? '
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 59]: said I. ` He 's as like her , Dick , ' said my aunt , emphatically , ` he 's as like her , as she was that afternoon before she began to fret -- bless my heart , he 's as like her , as he can look at me out of his two eyes ! '
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 6]: ` Is he indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 4]: said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 16]: ` And he 's like David , too , ' said my aunt , decisively .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 8]: ` He is very like David ! '
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 4]: said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 39]: ` But what I want you to be , Trot , ' resumed my aunt , ' - I do n't mean physically , but morally ; you are very well physically -- is , a firm fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 12]: A fine firm fellow , with a will of your own .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 19]: With resolution , ' said my aunt , shaking her cap at me , and clenching her hand .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 4]: ` With determination .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 28]: With character , Trot -- with strength of character that is not to be influenced , except on good reason , by anybody , or by anything .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 9]: That 's what I want you to be .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 23]: That 's what your father and mother might both have been , Heaven knows , and been the better for it . '
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 12]: I intimated that I hoped I should be what she described .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 40]: ` That you may begin , in a small way , to have a reliance upon yourself , and to act for yourself , ' said my aunt , ' I shall send you upon your trip , alone .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 31]: I did think , once , of Mr. Dick 's going with you ; but , on second thoughts , I shall keep him to take care of me . '
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 38]: Mr. Dick , for a moment , looked a little disappointed ; until the honour and dignity of having to take care of the most wonderful woman in the world , restored the sunshine to his face .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 48]: ` Besides , ' said my aunt , ` there 's the Memorial -- ' ` Oh , certainly , ' said Mr. Dick , in a hurry , ' I intend , Trotwood , to get that done immediately -- it really must be done immediately !
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 39]: And then it will go in , you know -- and then -- ' said Mr. Dick , after checking himself , and pausing a long time , ` there 'll be a pretty kettle of fish ! '
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 33]: In pursuance of my aunt 's kind scheme , I was shortly afterwards fitted out with a handsome purse of money , and a portmanteau , and tenderly dismissed upon my expedition .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 67]: At parting , my aunt gave me some good advice , and a good many kisses ; and said that as her object was that I should look about me , and should think a little , she would recommend me to stay a few days in London , if I liked it , either on my way down into Suffolk , or in coming back .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 53]: In a word , I was at liberty to do what I would , for three weeks or a month ; and no other conditions were imposed upon my freedom than the before-mentioned thinking and looking about me , and a pledge to write three times a week and faithfully report myself .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 37]: I went to Canterbury first , that I might take leave of Agnes and Mr. Wickfield -LRB- my old room in whose house I had not yet relinquished -RRB- , and also of the good Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 26]: Agnes was very glad to see me , and told me that the house had not been like itself since I had left it . '
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 30]: I am sure I am not like myself when I am away , ' said I. ' I seem to want my right hand , when I miss you .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 21]: Though that 's not saying much ; for there 's no head in my right hand , and no heart .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 18]: Everyone who knows you , consults with you , and is guided by you , Agnes . '
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 18]: ` Everyone who knows me , spoils me , I believe , ' she answered , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 10]: it 's because you are like no one else .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 9]: You are so good , and so sweet-tempered .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 14]: You have such a gentle nature , and you are always right . '
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 31]: ` You talk , ' said Agnes , breaking into a pleasant laugh , as she sat at work , ` as if I were the late Miss Larkins . '
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 22]: It 's not fair to abuse my confidence , ' I answered , reddening at the recollection of my blue enslaver .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 14]: ` But I shall confide in you , just the same , Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 8]: I can never grow out of that .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 35]: Whenever I fall into trouble , or fall in love , I shall always tell you , if you 'll let me -- even when I come to fall in love in earnest . '
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 11]: ` Why , you have always been in earnest ! '
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 6]: said Agnes , laughing again .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 26]: that was as a child , or a schoolboy , ' said I , laughing in my turn , not without being a little shame-faced .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 23]: ` Times are altering now , and I suppose I shall be in a terrible state of earnestness one day or other .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 19]: My wonder is , that you are not in earnest yourself , by this time , Agnes . '
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 9]: Agnes laughed again , and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 10]: ` Oh , I know you are not ! '
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 15]: said I , ` because if you had been you would have told me .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 27]: Or at least ' -- for I saw a faint blush in her face , ` you would have let me find it out for myself .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 18]: But there is no one that I know of , who deserves to love you , Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 28]: Someone of a nobler character , and more worthy altogether than anyone I have ever seen here , must rise up , before I give my consent .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 32]: In the time to come , I shall have a wary eye on all admirers ; and shall exact a great deal from the successful one , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 33]: We had gone on , so far , in a mixture of confidential jest and earnest , that had long grown naturally out of our familiar relations , begun as mere children .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 64]: But Agnes , now suddenly lifting up her eyes to mine , and speaking in a different manner , said : ` Trotwood , there is something that I want to ask you , and that I may not have another opportunity of asking for a long time , perhaps - something I would ask , I think , of no one else .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 10]: Have you observed any gradual alteration in Papa ? '
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 14]: I had observed it , and had often wondered whether she had too .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 30]: I must have shown as much , now , in my face ; for her eyes were in a moment cast down , and I saw tears in them .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 17]: ` Tell me what it is , ' she said , in a low voice . '
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 17]: I think -- shall I be quite plain , Agnes , liking him so much ? '
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' she said . '
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 21]: I think he does himself no good by the habit that has increased upon him since I first came here .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 12]: He is often very nervous -- or I fancy so . '
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 14]: ` It is not fancy , ' said Agnes , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 17]: ` His hand trembles , his speech is not plain , and his eyes look wild .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 28]: I have remarked that at those times , and when he is least like himself , he is most certain to be wanted on some business . '
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 8]: ` By Uriah , ' said Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 57]: ` Yes ; and the sense of being unfit for it , or of not having understood it , or of having shown his condition in spite of himself , seems to make him so uneasy , that next day he is worse , and next day worse , and so he becomes jaded and haggard .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 40]: Do not be alarmed by what I say , Agnes , but in this state I saw him , only the other evening , lay down his head upon his desk , and shed tears like a child . '
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 36]: Her hand passed softly before my lips while I was yet speaking , and in a moment she had met her father at the door of the room , and was hanging on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 20]: The expression of her face , as they both looked towards me , I felt to be very touching .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 107]: There was such deep fondness for him , and gratitude to him for all his love and care , in her beautiful look ; and there was such a fervent appeal to me to deal tenderly by him , even in my inmost thoughts , and to let no harsh construction find any place against him ; she was , at once , so proud of him and devoted to him , yet so compassionate and sorry , and so reliant upon me to be so , too ; that nothing she could have said would have expressed more to me , or moved me more .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 10]: We were to drink tea at the Doctor 's .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 26]: We went there at the usual hour ; and round the study fireside found the Doctor , and his young wife , and her mother .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 56]: The Doctor , who made as much of my going away as if I were going to China , received me as an honoured guest ; and called for a log of wood to be thrown on the fire , that he might see the face of his old pupil reddening in the blaze . '
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 34]: I shall not see many more new faces in Trotwood 's stead , Wickfield , ' said the Doctor , warming his hands ; ' I am getting lazy , and want ease .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 19]: I shall relinquish all my young people in another six months , and lead a quieter life . '
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 19]: ` You have said so , any time these ten years , Doctor , ' Mr. Wickfield answered .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 14]: ` But now I mean to do it , ' returned the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 40]: ` My first master will succeed me -- I am in earnest at last -- so you 'll soon have to arrange our contracts , and to bind us firmly to them , like a couple of knaves . '
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 21]: ` And to take care , ' said Mr. Wickfield , ` that you 're not imposed on , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 15]: As you certainly would be , in any contract you should make for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 4]: I am ready .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 13]: There are worse tasks than that , in my calling . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 31]: I shall have nothing to think of then , ' said the Doctor , with a smile , ` but my Dictionary ; and this other contract-bargain -- Annie . '
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 47]: As Mr. Wickfield glanced towards her , sitting at the tea table by Agnes , she seemed to me to avoid his look with such unwonted hesitation and timidity , that his attention became fixed upon her , as if something were suggested to his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 22]: ` There is a post come in from India , I observe , ' he said , after a short silence .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 5]: ` By the by !
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 8]: and letters from Mr. Jack Maldon ! '
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 4]: said the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 6]: ` Poor dear Jack ! '
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 8]: said Mrs. Markleham , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 5]: ` That trying climate !
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 16]: -- like living , they tell me , on a sand-heap , underneath a burning-glass !
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 9]: He looked strong , but he was n't .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 20]: My dear Doctor , it was his spirit , not his constitution , that he ventured on so boldly .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 69]: Annie , my dear , I am sure you must perfectly recollect that your cousin never was strong -- not what can be called ROBUST , you know , ' said Mrs. Markleham , with emphasis , and looking round upon us generally , ' - from the time when my daughter and himself were children together , and walking about , arm-in-arm , the livelong day . '
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 9]: Annie , thus addressed , made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 18]: ` Do I gather from what you say , ma'am , that Mr. Maldon is ill ? '
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 4]: asked Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 4]: ` Ill ! '
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 5]: replied the Old Soldier .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 13]: ` My dear sir , he 's all sorts of things . '
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 5]: ` Except well ? '
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 4]: said Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 7]: ` Except well , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 5]: said the Old Soldier .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 28]: ` He has had dreadful strokes of the sun , no doubt , and jungle fevers and agues , and every kind of thing you can mention .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 30]: As to his liver , ' said the Old Soldier resignedly , ` that , of course , he gave up altogether , when he first went out ! '
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 8]: ` Does he say all this ? '
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 4]: asked Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 3]: ` Say ?
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 30]: My dear sir , ' returned Mrs. Markleham , shaking her head and her fan , ` you little know my poor Jack Maldon when you ask that question .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 2]: Say ?
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 3]: Not he .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 14]: You might drag him at the heels of four wild horses first . '
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 4]: ` Mama ! '
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 4]: said Mrs. Strong .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 37]: ` Annie , my dear , ' returned her mother , ` once for all , I must really beg that you will not interfere with me , unless it is to confirm what I say .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 32]: You know as well as I do that your cousin Maldon would be dragged at the heels of any number of wild horses -- why should I confine myself to four !
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 27]: I WO N'T confine myself to four -- eight , sixteen , two-and-thirty , rather than say anything calculated to overturn the Doctor 's plans . '
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 21]: ` Wickfield 's plans , ' said the Doctor , stroking his face , and looking penitently at his adviser .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 12]: ` That is to say , our joint plans for him .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 10]: I said myself , abroad or at home . '
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 13]: ` And I said ' added Mr. Wickfield gravely , ` abroad .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 9]: I was the means of sending him abroad .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 6]: It 's my responsibility . '
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 3]: Responsibility ! '
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 5]: said the Old Soldier .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 25]: ` Everything was done for the best , my dear Mr. Wickfield ; everything was done for the kindest and best , we know .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 16]: But if the dear fellow ca n't live there , he ca n't live there .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 23]: And if he ca n't live there , he 'll die there , sooner than he 'll overturn the Doctor 's plans .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 41]: I know him , ' said the Old Soldier , fanning herself , in a sort of calm prophetic agony , ` and I know he 'll die there , sooner than he 'll overturn the Doctor 's plans . '
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 29]: ` Well , well , ma'am , ' said the Doctor cheerfully , ' I am not bigoted to my plans , and I can overturn them myself .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 7]: I can substitute some other plans .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 40]: If Mr. Jack Maldon comes home on account of ill health , he must not be allowed to go back , and we must endeavour to make some more suitable and fortunate provision for him in this country . '
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 63]: Mrs. Markleham was so overcome by this generous speech -- which , I need not say , she had not at all expected or led up to -- that she could only tell the Doctor it was like himself , and go several times through that operation of kissing the sticks of her fan , and then tapping his hand with it .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 54]: After which she gently chid her daughter Annie , for not being more demonstrative when such kindnesses were showered , for her sake , on her old playfellow ; and entertained us with some particulars concerning other deserving members of her family , whom it was desirable to set on their deserving legs .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 17]: All this time , her daughter Annie never once spoke , or lifted up her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 21]: All this time , Mr. Wickfield had his glance upon her as she sat by his own daughter 's side .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 37]: It appeared to me that he never thought of being observed by anyone ; but was so intent upon her , and upon his own thoughts in connexion with her , as to be quite absorbed .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 22]: He now asked what Mr. Jack Maldon had actually written in reference to himself , and to whom he had written ?
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 36]: ` Why , here , ' said Mrs. Markleham , taking a letter from the chimney-piece above the Doctor 's head , ` the dear fellow says to the Doctor himself -- where is it ?
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 41]: -- `` I am sorry to inform you that my health is suffering severely , and that I fear I may be reduced to the necessity of returning home for a time , as the only hope of restoration . ''
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 8]: That 's pretty plain , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 6]: His only hope of restoration !
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 8]: But Annie 's letter is plainer still .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 9]: Annie , show me that letter again . '
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 14]: ` Not now , mama , ' she pleaded in a low tone .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 41]: ` My dear , you absolutely are , on some subjects , one of the most ridiculous persons in the world , ' returned her mother , ` and perhaps the most unnatural to the claims of your own family .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 22]: We never should have heard of the letter at all , I believe , unless I had asked for it myself .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 13]: Do you call that confidence , my love , towards Doctor Strong ?
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 4]: I am surprised .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 7]: You ought to know better . '
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 30]: The letter was reluctantly produced ; and as I handed it to the old lady , I saw how the unwilling hand from which I took it , trembled .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 24]: ` Now let us see , ' said Mrs. Markleham , putting her glass to her eye , ` where the passage is .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 21]: `` The remembrance of old times , my dearest Annie '' -- and so forth -- it 's not there .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 11]: `` The amiable old Proctor '' -- who 's he ?
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 18]: Dear me , Annie , how illegibly your cousin Maldon writes , and how stupid I am !
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 7]: `` Doctor , '' of course .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 4]: amiable indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 30]: Here she left off , to kiss her fan again , and shake it at the Doctor , who was looking at us in a state of placid satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 7]: ` Now I have found it .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 34]: `` You may not be surprised to hear , Annie , '' -- no , to be sure , knowing that he never was really strong ; what did I say just now ?
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 44]: -- `` that I have undergone so much in this distant place , as to have decided to leave it at all hazards ; on sick leave , if I can ; on total resignation , if that is not to be obtained .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 14]: What I have endured , and do endure here , is insupportable . ''
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 39]: And but for the promptitude of that best of creatures , ' said Mrs. Markleham , telegraphing the Doctor as before , and refolding the letter , ` it would be insupportable to me to think of . '
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 36]: Mr. Wickfield said not one word , though the old lady looked to him as if for his commentary on this intelligence ; but sat severely silent , with his eyes fixed on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 46]: Long after the subject was dismissed , and other topics occupied us , he remained so ; seldom raising his eyes , unless to rest them for a moment , with a thoughtful frown , upon the Doctor , or his wife , or both .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 8]: The Doctor was very fond of music .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 14]: Agnes sang with great sweetness and expression , and so did Mrs. Strong .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 17]: They sang together , and played duets together , and we had quite a little concert .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 60]: But I remarked two things : first , that though Annie soon recovered her composure , and was quite herself , there was a blank between her and Mr. Wickfield which separated them wholly from each other ; secondly , that Mr. Wickfield seemed to dislike the intimacy between her and Agnes , and to watch it with uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 42]: And now , I must confess , the recollection of what I had seen on that night when Mr. Maldon went away , first began to return upon me with a meaning it had never had , and to trouble me .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 58]: The innocent beauty of her face was not as innocent to me as it had been ; I mistrusted the natural grace and charm of her manner ; and when I looked at Agnes by her side , and thought how good and true Agnes was , suspicions arose within me that it was an ill-assorted friendship .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 33]: She was so happy in it herself , however , and the other was so happy too , that they made the evening fly away as if it were but an hour .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 10]: It closed in an incident which I well remember .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 37]: They were taking leave of each other , and Agnes was going to embrace her and kiss her , when Mr. Wickfield stepped between them , as if by accident , and drew Agnes quickly away .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 46]: Then I saw , as though all the intervening time had been cancelled , and I were still standing in the doorway on the night of the departure , the expression of that night in the face of Mrs. Strong , as it confronted his .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 43]: I can not say what an impression this made upon me , or how impossible I found it , when I thought of her afterwards , to separate her from this look , and remember her face in its innocent loveliness again .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 8]: It haunted me when I got home .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 17]: I seemed to have left the Doctor 's roof with a dark cloud lowering on it .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 34]: The reverence that I had for his grey head , was mingled with commiseration for his faith in those who were treacherous to him , and with resentment against those who injured him .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 46]: The impending shadow of a great affliction , and a great disgrace that had no distinct form in it yet , fell like a stain upon the quiet place where I had worked and played as a boy , and did it a cruel wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 59]: I had no pleasure in thinking , any more , of the grave old broad-leaved aloe-trees , which remained shut up in themselves a hundred years together , and of the trim smooth grass-plot , and the stone urns , and the Doctor 's walk , and the congenial sound of the Cathedral bell hovering above them all .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 27]: It was as if the tranquil sanctuary of my boyhood had been sacked before my face , and its peace and honour given to the winds .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 27]: But morning brought with it my parting from the old house , which Agnes had filled with her influence ; and that occupied my mind sufficiently .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 40]: I should be there again soon , no doubt ; I might sleep again -- perhaps often -- in my old room ; but the days of my inhabiting there were gone , and the old time was past .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 54]: I was heavier at heart when I packed up such of my books and clothes as still remained there to be sent to Dover , than I cared to show to Uriah Heep ; who was so officious to help me , that I uncharitably thought him mighty glad that I was going .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 32]: I got away from Agnes and her father , somehow , with an indifferent show of being very manly , and took my seat upon the box of the London coach .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 35]: I was so softened and forgiving , going through the town , that I had half a mind to nod to my old enemy the butcher , and throw him five shillings to drink .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 51]: But he looked such a very obdurate butcher as he stood scraping the great block in the shop , and moreover , his appearance was so little improved by the loss of a front tooth which I had knocked out , that I thought it best to make no advances .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 35]: The main object on my mind , I remember , when we got fairly on the road , was to appear as old as possible to the coachman , and to speak extremely gruff .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 27]: The latter point I achieved at great personal inconvenience ; but I stuck to it , because I felt it was a grown-up sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 9]: ` You are going through , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 4]: said the coachman .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 23]: ` Yes , William , ' I said , condescendingly -LRB- I knew him -RRB- ; ' I am going to London .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 9]: I shall go down into Suffolk afterwards . '
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 6]: ` Shooting , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 4]: said the coachman .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 35]: He knew as well as I did that it was just as likely , at that time of year , I was going down there whaling ; but I felt complimented , too . '
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 25]: I do n't know , ' I said , pretending to be undecided , ` whether I shall take a shot or not . '
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 15]: ` Birds is got wery shy , I 'm told , ' said William .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 17]: ` So I understand , ' said I. ` Is Suffolk your county , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 3]: asked William .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 11]: ` Yes , ' I said , with some importance .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 7]: ` Suffolk 's my county . '
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 16]: ` I 'm told the dumplings is uncommon fine down there , ' said William .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 47]: I was not aware of it myself , but I felt it necessary to uphold the institutions of my county , and to evince a familiarity with them ; so I shook my head , as much as to say , ' I believe you ! '
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 9]: ` And the Punches , ' said William .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 5]: ` There 's cattle !
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 18]: A Suffolk Punch , when he 's a good un , is worth his weight in gold .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 12]: Did you ever breed any Suffolk Punches yourself , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 12]: ` N-no , ' I said , ` not exactly . '
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 29]: ` Here 's a gen ` lm 'n behind me , I 'll pound it , ' said William , ` as has bred 'em by wholesale . '
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 53]: The gentleman spoken of was a gentleman with a very unpromising squint , and a prominent chin , who had a tall white hat on with a narrow flat brim , and whose close-fitting drab trousers seemed to button all the way up outside his legs from his boots to his hips .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 54]: His chin was cocked over the coachman 's shoulder , so near to me , that his breath quite tickled the back of my head ; and as I looked at him , he leered at the leaders with the eye with which he did n't squint , in a very knowing manner .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 6]: ` Ai n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 3]: asked William .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 7]: ` Ai n't I what ? '
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 5]: said the gentleman behind .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 10]: ` Bred them Suffolk Punches by wholesale ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 10]: I should think so , ' said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 20]: ` There ai n't no sort of orse that I ai n't bred , and no sort of dorg .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 9]: Orses and dorgs is some men 's fancy .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 30]: They 're wittles and drink to me -- lodging , wife , and children -- reading , writing , and Arithmetic -- snuff , tobacker , and sleep . '
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 20]: ` That ai n't a sort of man to see sitting behind a coach-box , is it though ? '
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 12]: said William in my ear , as he handled the reins .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 25]: I construed this remark into an indication of a wish that he should have my place , so I blushingly offered to resign it .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 25]: ` Well , if you do n't mind , sir , ' said William , ' I think it would be more correct . '
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 14]: I have always considered this as the first fall I had in life .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 28]: When I booked my place at the coach office I had had ` Box Seat ' written against the entry , and had given the book-keeper half-a-crown .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 41]: I was got up in a special great-coat and shawl , expressly to do honour to that distinguished eminence ; had glorified myself upon it a good deal ; and had felt that I was a credit to the coach .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 56]: And here , in the very first stage , I was supplanted by a shabby man with a squint , who had no other merit than smelling like a livery-stables , and being able to walk across me , more like a fly than a human being , while the horses were at a canter !
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 40]: A distrust of myself , which has often beset me in life on small occasions , when it would have been better away , was assuredly not stopped in its growth by this little incident outside the Canterbury coach .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 12]: It was in vain to take refuge in gruffness of speech .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 25]: I spoke from the pit of my stomach for the rest of the journey , but I felt completely extinguished , and dreadfully young .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 48]: It was curious and interesting , nevertheless , to be sitting up there behind four horses : well educated , well dressed , and with plenty of money in my pocket ; and to look out for the places where I had slept on my weary journey .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 16]: I had abundant occupation for my thoughts , in every conspicuous landmark on the road .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 39]: When I looked down at the trampers whom we passed , and saw that well-remembered style of face turned up , I felt as if the tinker 's blackened hand were in the bosom of my shirt again .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 61]: When we clattered through the narrow street of Chatham , and I caught a glimpse , in passing , of the lane where the old monster lived who had bought my jacket , I stretched my neck eagerly to look for the place where I had sat , in the sun and in the shade , waiting for my money .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 61]: When we came , at last , within a stage of London , and passed the veritable Salem House where Mr. Creakle had laid about him with a heavy hand , I would have given all I had , for lawful permission to get down and thrash him , and let all the boys out like so many caged sparrows .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 21]: We went to the Golden Cross at Charing Cross , then a mouldy sort of establishment in a close neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 33]: A waiter showed me into the coffee-room ; and a chambermaid introduced me to my small bedchamber , which smelt like a hackney-coach , and was shut up like a family vault .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 47]: I was still painfully conscious of my youth , for nobody stood in any awe of me at all : the chambermaid being utterly indifferent to my opinions on any subject , and the waiter being familiar with me , and offering advice to my inexperience .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 23]: ` Well now , ' said the waiter , in a tone of confidence , ` what would you like for dinner ?
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 12]: Young gentlemen likes poultry in general : have a fowl ! '
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 21]: I told him , as majestically as I could , that I was n't in the humour for a fowl .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 6]: ` Ai n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 4]: said the waiter .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 17]: ` Young gentlemen is generally tired of beef and mutton : have a weal cutlet ! '
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 16]: I assented to this proposal , in default of being able to suggest anything else .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 8]: ` Do you care for taters ? '
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 16]: said the waiter , with an insinuating smile , and his head on one side .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 11]: ` Young gentlemen generally has been overdosed with taters . '
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 60]: I commanded him , in my deepest voice , to order a veal cutlet and potatoes , and all things fitting ; and to inquire at the bar if there were any letters for Trotwood Copperfield , Esquire -- which I knew there were not , and could n't be , but thought it manly to appear to expect .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 34]: He soon came back to say that there were none -LRB- at which I was much surprised -RRB- and began to lay the cloth for my dinner in a box by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 56]: While he was so engaged , he asked me what I would take with it ; and on my replying ` Half a pint of sherry , ` thought it a favourable opportunity , I am afraid , to extract that measure of wine from the stale leavings at the bottoms of several small decanters .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 53]: I am of this opinion , because , while I was reading the newspaper , I observed him behind a low wooden partition , which was his private apartment , very busy pouring out of a number of those vessels into one , like a chemist and druggist making up a prescription .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 51]: When the wine came , too , I thought it flat ; and it certainly had more English crumbs in it , than were to be expected in a foreign wine in anything like a pure state , but I was bashful enough to drink it , and say nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 35]: Being then in a pleasant frame of mind -LRB- from which I infer that poisoning is not always disagreeable in some stages of the process -RRB- , I resolved to go to the play .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 29]: It was Covent Garden Theatre that I chose ; and there , from the back of a centre box , I saw Julius Caesar and the new Pantomime .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 39]: To have all those noble Romans alive before me , and walking in and out for my entertainment , instead of being the stern taskmasters they had been at school , was a most novel and delightful effect .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 108]: But the mingled reality and mystery of the whole show , the influence upon me of the poetry , the lights , the music , the company , the smooth stupendous changes of glittering and brilliant scenery , were so dazzling , and opened up such illimitable regions of delight , that when I came out into the rainy street , at twelve o'clock at night , I felt as if I had come from the clouds , where I had been leading a romantic life for ages , to a bawling , splashing , link-lighted , umbrella-struggling , hackney-coach-jostling , patten-clinking , muddy , miserable world .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 94]: I had emerged by another door , and stood in the street for a little while , as if I really were a stranger upon earth : but the unceremonious pushing and hustling that I received , soon recalled me to myself , and put me in the road back to the hotel ; whither I went , revolving the glorious vision all the way ; and where , after some porter and oysters , I sat revolving it still , at past one o'clock , with my eyes on the coffee-room fire .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 72]: I was so filled with the play , and with the past -- for it was , in a manner , like a shining transparency , through which I saw my earlier life moving along -- that I do n't know when the figure of a handsome well-formed young man dressed with a tasteful easy negligence which I have reason to remember very well , became a real presence to me .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 27]: But I recollect being conscious of his company without having noticed his coming in -- and my still sitting , musing , over the coffee-room fire .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 49]: At last I rose to go to bed , much to the relief of the sleepy waiter , who had got the fidgets in his legs , and was twisting them , and hitting them , and putting them through all kinds of contortions in his small pantry .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 20]: In going towards the door , I passed the person who had come in , and saw him plainly .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 11]: I turned directly , came back , and looked again .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 14]: He did not know me , but I knew him in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 33]: At another time I might have wanted the confidence or the decision to speak to him , and might have put it off until next day , and might have lost him .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 64]: But , in the then condition of my mind , where the play was still running high , his former protection of me appeared so deserving of my gratitude , and my old love for him overflowed my breast so freshly and spontaneously , that I went up to him at once , with a fast-beating heart , and said : ` Steerforth !
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 8]: wo n't you speak to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 23]: He looked at me -- just as he used to look , sometimes -- but I saw no recognition in his face .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 19]: ` You do n't remember me , I am afraid , ' said I. ` My God ! '
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 4]: he suddenly exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 7]: ` It 's little Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 14]: I grasped him by both hands , and could not let them go .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 26]: But for very shame , and the fear that it might displease him , I could have held him round the neck and cried . '
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 10]: I never , never , never was so glad !
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 13]: My dear Steerforth , I am so overjoyed to see you ! '
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 12]: ` And I am rejoiced to see you , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 8]: he said , shaking my hands heartily .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 14]: ` Why , Copperfield , old boy , do n't be overpowered ! '
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 24]: And yet he was glad , too , I thought , to see how the delight I had in meeting him affected me .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 36]: I brushed away the tears that my utmost resolution had not been able to keep back , and I made a clumsy laugh of it , and we sat down together , side by side .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 12]: ` Why , how do you come to be here ? '
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 10]: said Steerforth , clapping me on the shoulder . '
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 10]: I came here by the Canterbury coach , today .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 23]: I have been adopted by an aunt down in that part of the country , and have just finished my education there .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 11]: How do YOU come to be here , Steerforth ? '
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 44]: ` Well , I am what they call an Oxford man , ' he returned ; ` that is to say , I get bored to death down there , periodically -- and I am on my way now to my mother 's .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 9]: You 're a devilish amiable-looking fellow , Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 13]: just what you used to be , now I look at you !
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 8]: Not altered in the least ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 18]: I knew you immediately , ' I said ; ` but you are more easily remembered . '
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 30]: He laughed as he ran his hand through the clustering curls of his hair , and said gaily : ` Yes , I am on an expedition of duty .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 34]: My mother lives a little way out of town ; and the roads being in a beastly condition , and our house tedious enough , I remained here tonight instead of going on .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 24]: I have not been in town half-a-dozen hours , and those I have been dozing and grumbling away at the play . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 17]: I have been at the play , too , ' said I. ` At Covent Garden .
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 10]: What a delightful and magnificent entertainment , Steerforth ! '
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 4]: Steerforth laughed heartily .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 24]: ` My dear young Davy , ' he said , clapping me on the shoulder again , ` you are a very Daisy .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 16]: The daisy of the field , at sunrise , is not fresher than you are .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 18]: I have been at Covent Garden , too , and there never was a more miserable business .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 6]: Holloa , you sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 26]: This was addressed to the waiter , who had been very attentive to our recognition , at a distance , and now came forward deferentially .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 12]: ` Where have you put my friend , Mr. Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 8]: ` Beg your pardon , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 6]: ` Where does he sleep ?
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 5]: What 's his number ?
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 10]: You know what I mean , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 15]: ` Well , sir , ' said the waiter , with an apologetic air .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 12]: ` Mr. Copperfield is at present in forty-four , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 27]: ` And what the devil do you mean , ' retorted Steerforth , ` by putting Mr. Copperfield into a little loft over a stable ? '
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 28]: ` Why , you see we was n't aware , sir , ' returned the waiter , still apologetically , ` as Mr. Copperfield was anyways particular .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 15]: We can give Mr. Copperfield seventy-two , sir , if it would be preferred .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 6]: Next you , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 12]: ` Of course it would be preferred , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 8]: ` And do it at once . '
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 9]: The waiter immediately withdrew to make the exchange .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 49]: Steerforth , very much amused at my having been put into forty-four , laughed again , and clapped me on the shoulder again , and invited me to breakfast with him next morning at ten o'clock -- an invitation I was only too proud and happy to accept .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 63]: It being now pretty late , we took our candles and went upstairs , where we parted with friendly heartiness at his door , and where I found my new room a great improvement on my old one , it not being at all musty , and having an immense four-post bedstead in it , which was quite a little landed estate .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 50]: Here , among pillows enough for six , I soon fell asleep in a blissful condition , and dreamed of ancient Rome , Steerforth , and friendship , until the early morning coaches , rumbling out of the archway underneath , made me dream of thunder and the gods .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 41]: Chapter 20 Steerforth 's Home When the chambermaid tapped at my door at eight o'clock , and informed me that my shaving-water was outside , I felt severely the having no occasion for it , and blushed in my bed .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 52]: The suspicion that she laughed too , when she said it , preyed upon my mind all the time I was dressing ; and gave me , I was conscious , a sneaking and guilty air when I passed her on the staircase , as I was going down to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 98]: I was so sensitively aware , indeed , of being younger than I could have wished , that for some time I could not make up my mind to pass her at all , under the ignoble circumstances of the case ; but , hearing her there with a broom , stood peeping out of window at King Charles on horseback , surrounded by a maze of hackney-coaches , and looking anything but regal in a drizzling rain and a dark-brown fog , until I was admonished by the waiter that the gentleman was waiting for me .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 77]: It was not in the coffee-room that I found Steerforth expecting me , but in a snug private apartment , red-curtained and Turkey-carpeted , where the fire burnt bright , and a fine hot breakfast was set forth on a table covered with a clean cloth ; and a cheerful miniature of the room , the fire , the breakfast , Steerforth , and all , was shining in the little round mirror over the sideboard .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 44]: I was rather bashful at first , Steerforth being so self-possessed , and elegant , and superior to me in all respects -LRB- age included -RRB- ; but his easy patronage soon put that to rights , and made me quite at home .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 37]: I could not enough admire the change he had wrought in the Golden Cross ; or compare the dull forlorn state I had held yesterday , with this morning 's comfort and this morning 's entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 17]: As to the waiter 's familiarity , it was quenched as if it had never been .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 15]: He attended on us , as I may say , in sackcloth and ashes .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 36]: ` Now , Copperfield , ' said Steerforth , when we were alone , ' I should like to hear what you are doing , and where you are going , and all about you .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 10]: I feel as if you were my property . '
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 36]: Glowing with pleasure to find that he had still this interest in me , I told him how my aunt had proposed the little expedition that I had before me , and whither it tended .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 29]: ` As you are in no hurry , then , ' said Steerforth , ` come home with me to Highgate , and stay a day or two .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 35]: You will be pleased with my mother -- she is a little vain and prosy about me , but that you can forgive her -- and she will be pleased with you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 26]: I should like to be as sure of that , as you are kind enough to say you are , ' I answered , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 22]: said Steerforth , ` everyone who likes me , has a claim on her that is sure to be acknowledged . '
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 17]: ` Then I think I shall be a favourite , ' said I. ` Good ! '
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 6]: ` Come and prove it .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 43]: We will go and see the lions for an hour or two -- it 's something to have a fresh fellow like you to show them to , Copperfield -- and then we 'll journey out to Highgate by the coach . '
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 35]: I could hardly believe but that I was in a dream , and that I should wake presently in number forty-four , to the solitary box in the coffee-room and the familiar waiter again .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 81]: After I had written to my aunt and told her of my fortunate meeting with my admired old schoolfellow , and my acceptance of his invitation , we went out in a hackney-chariot , and saw a Panorama and some other sights , and took a walk through the Museum , where I could not help observing how much Steerforth knew , on an infinite variety of subjects , and of how little account he seemed to make his knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 39]: ` You 'll take a high degree at college , Steerforth , ' said I , ` if you have not done so already ; and they will have good reason to be proud of you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 6]: I take a degree ! '
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 3]: cried Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 4]: ` Not I !
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 13]: my dear Daisy -- will you mind my calling you Daisy ? '
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 6]: ` Not at all ! '
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 9]: said I. ` That 's a good fellow !
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 11]: My dear Daisy , ' said Steerforth , laughing . '
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 15]: I have not the least desire or intention to distinguish myself in that way .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 9]: I have done quite sufficient for my purpose .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 15]: I find that I am heavy company enough for myself as I am . '
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 10]: ` But the fame -- ' I was beginning .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 6]: ` You romantic Daisy ! '
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 29]: said Steerforth , laughing still more heartily : ` why should I trouble myself , that a parcel of heavy-headed fellows may gape and hold up their hands ?
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 9]: Let them do it at some other man .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 14]: There 's fame for him , and he 's welcome to it . '
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 19]: I was abashed at having made so great a mistake , and was glad to change the subject .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 28]: Fortunately it was not difficult to do , for Steerforth could always pass from one subject to another with a carelessness and lightness that were his own .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 40]: Lunch succeeded to our sight-seeing , and the short winter day wore away so fast , that it was dusk when the stage-coach stopped with us at an old brick house at Highgate on the summit of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 45]: An elderly lady , though not very far advanced in years , with a proud carriage and a handsome face , was in the doorway as we alighted ; and greeting Steerforth as ` My dearest James , ' folded him in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 18]: To this lady he presented me as his mother , and she gave me a stately welcome .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 12]: It was a genteel old-fashioned house , very quiet and orderly .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 29]: From the windows of my room I saw all London lying in the distance like a great vapour , with here and there some lights twinkling through it .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 72]: I had only time , in dressing , to glance at the solid furniture , the framed pieces of work -LRB- done , I supposed , by Steerforth 's mother when she was a girl -RRB- , and some pictures in crayons of ladies with powdered hair and bodices , coming and going on the walls , as the newly-kindled fire crackled and sputtered , when I was called to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 67]: There was a second lady in the dining-room , of a slight short figure , dark , and not agreeable to look at , but with some appearance of good looks too , who attracted my attention : perhaps because I had not expected to see her ; perhaps because I found myself sitting opposite to her ; perhaps because of something really remarkable in her .
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 21]: She had black hair and eager black eyes , and was thin , and had a scar upon her lip .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 63]: It was an old scar -- I should rather call it seam , for it was not discoloured , and had healed years ago -- which had once cut through her mouth , downward towards the chin , but was now barely visible across the table , except above and on her upper lip , the shape of which it had altered .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 23]: I concluded in my own mind that she was about thirty years of age , and that she wished to be married .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 32]: She was a little dilapidated -- like a house -- with having been so long to let ; yet had , as I have said , an appearance of good looks .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 23]: Her thinness seemed to be the effect of some wasting fire within her , which found a vent in her gaunt eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 17]: She was introduced as Miss Dartle , and both Steerforth and his mother called her Rosa .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 19]: I found that she lived there , and had been for a long time Mrs. Steerforth 's companion .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 32]: It appeared to me that she never said anything she wanted to say , outright ; but hinted it , and made a great deal more of it by this practice .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 38]: For example , when Mrs. Steerforth observed , more in jest than earnest , that she feared her son led but a wild life at college , Miss Dartle put in thus : ` Oh , really ?
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 22]: You know how ignorant I am , and that I only ask for information , but is n't it always so ?
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 17]: I thought that kind of life was on all hands understood to be -- eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 25]: ` It is education for a very grave profession , if you mean that , Rosa , ' Mrs. Steerforth answered with some coldness .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 10]: That 's very true , ' returned Miss Dartle .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 8]: ` But is n't it , though ?
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 20]: -- I want to be put right , if I am wrong -- is n't it , really ? '
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 5]: ` Really what ? '
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 4]: said Mrs. Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 7]: You mean it 's not ! '
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 4]: returned Miss Dartle .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 11]: ` Well , I 'm very glad to hear it !
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 8]: Now , I know what to do !
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 7]: That 's the advantage of asking .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 28]: I shall never allow people to talk before me about wastefulness and profligacy , and so forth , in connexion with that life , any more . '
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 12]: ` And you will be right , ' said Mrs. Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 29]: ` My son 's tutor is a conscientious gentleman ; and if I had not implicit reliance on my son , I should have reliance on him . '
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 5]: ` Should you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 4]: said Miss Dartle .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 4]: ` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 5]: Conscientious , is he ?
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 6]: Really conscientious , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 14]: ` Yes , I am convinced of it , ' said Mrs. Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 6]: ` How very nice ! '
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 4]: exclaimed Miss Dartle .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 5]: ` What a comfort !
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 3]: Really conscientious ?
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 19]: Then he 's not -- but of course he ca n't be , if he 's really conscientious .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 17]: Well , I shall be quite happy in my opinion of him , from this time .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 23]: You ca n't think how it elevates him in my opinion , to know for certain that he 's really conscientious ! '
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 49]: Her own views of every question , and her correction of everything that was said to which she was opposed , Miss Dartle insinuated in the same way : sometimes , I could not conceal from myself , with great power , though in contradiction even of Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 8]: An instance happened before dinner was done .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 66]: Mrs. Steerforth speaking to me about my intention of going down into Suffolk , I said at hazard how glad I should be , if Steerforth would only go there with me ; and explaining to him that I was going to see my old nurse , and Mr. Peggotty 's family , I reminded him of the boatman whom he had seen at school .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 5]: That bluff fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 13]: ` He had a son with him , had n't he ? '
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 20]: That was his nephew , ' I replied ; ` whom he adopted , though , as a son .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 16]: He has a very pretty little niece too , whom he adopted as a daughter .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 34]: In short , his house -- or rather his boat , for he lives in one , on dry land -- is full of people who are objects of his generosity and kindness .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 10]: You would be delighted to see that household . '
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 5]: ` Should I ? '
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 8]: ` Well , I think I should .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 8]: I must see what can be done .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 37]: It would be worth a journey -LRB- not to mention the pleasure of a journey with you , Daisy -RRB- , to see that sort of people together , and to make one of 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 10]: My heart leaped with a new hope of pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 39]: But it was in reference to the tone in which he had spoken of ` that sort of people ' , that Miss Dartle , whose sparkling eyes had been watchful of us , now broke in again .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 7]: ` Oh , but , really ?
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 4]: Do tell me .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 6]: Are they , though ? '
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 5]: ` Are they what ?
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 6]: And are who what ? '
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 6]: ` That sort of people .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 14]: -- Are they really animals and clods , and beings of another order ?
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 8]: I want to know SO much . '
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 21]: ` Why , there 's a pretty wide separation between them and us , ' said Steerforth , with indifference .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 15]: ` They are not to be expected to be as sensitive as we are .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 12]: Their delicacy is not to be shocked , or hurt easily .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 58]: They are wonderfully virtuous , I dare say -- some people contend for that , at least ; and I am sure I do n't want to contradict them -- but they have not very fine natures , and they may be thankful that , like their coarse rough skins , they are not easily wounded . '
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 4]: ` Really ! '
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 4]: said Miss Dartle .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 21]: ` Well , I do n't know , now , when I have been better pleased than to hear that .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 5]: It 's so consoling !
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 18]: It 's such a delight to know that , when they suffer , they do n't feel !
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 25]: Sometimes I have been quite uneasy for that sort of people ; but now I shall just dismiss the idea of them , altogether .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 4]: Live and learn .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 15]: I had my doubts , I confess , but now they 're cleared up .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 24]: I did n't know , and now I do know , and that shows the advantage of asking -- do n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 42]: I believed that Steerforth had said what he had , in jest , or to draw Miss Dartle out ; and I expected him to say as much when she was gone , and we two were sitting before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 11]: But he merely asked me what I thought of her .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 11]: ` She is very clever , is she not ? '
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 3]: ` Clever !
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 28]: She brings everything to a grindstone , ' said Steerforth , and sharpens it , as she has sharpened her own face and figure these years past .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 9]: She has worn herself away by constant sharpening .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 6]: She is all edge . '
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 12]: ` What a remarkable scar that is upon her lip ! '
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 11]: Steerforth 's face fell , and he paused a moment .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 17]: ` Why , the fact is , ' he returned , ' I did that . '
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 7]: ` By an unfortunate accident ! '
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 19]: I was a young boy , and she exasperated me , and I threw a hammer at her .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 10]: A promising young angel I must have been ! '
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 19]: I was deeply sorry to have touched on such a painful theme , but that was useless now .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 45]: ` She has borne the mark ever since , as you see , ' said Steerforth ; ` and she 'll bear it to her grave , if she ever rests in one -- though I can hardly believe she will ever rest anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 15]: She was the motherless child of a sort of cousin of my father 's .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 5]: He died one day .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 18]: My mother , who was then a widow , brought her here to be company to her .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 26]: She has a couple of thousand pounds of her own , and saves the interest of it every year , to add to the principal .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 12]: There 's the history of Miss Rosa Dartle for you . '
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 14]: ` And I have no doubt she loves you like a brother ? '
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 6]: said I. ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 8]: retorted Steerforth , looking at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 19]: ` Some brothers are not loved over much ; and some love -- but help yourself , Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 41]: We 'll drink the daisies of the field , in compliment to you ; and the lilies of the valley that toil not , neither do they spin , in compliment to me -- the more shame for me ! '
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 27]: A moody smile that had overspread his features cleared off as he said this merrily , and he was his own frank , winning self again .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 19]: I could not help glancing at the scar with a painful interest when we went in to tea .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 57]: It was not long before I observed that it was the most susceptible part of her face , and that , when she turned pale , that mark altered first , and became a dull , lead-coloured streak , lengthening out to its full extent , like a mark in invisible ink brought to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 49]: There was a little altercation between her and Steerforth about a cast of the dice at back gammon - when I thought her , for one moment , in a storm of rage ; and then I saw it start forth like the old writing on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 17]: It was no matter of wonder to me to find Mrs. Steerforth devoted to her son .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 13]: She seemed to be able to speak or think about nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 49]: She showed me his picture as an infant , in a locket , with some of his baby-hair in it ; she showed me his picture as he had been when I first knew him ; and she wore at her breast his picture as he was now .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 59]: All the letters he had ever written to her , she kept in a cabinet near her own chair by the fire ; and she would have read me some of them , and I should have been very glad to hear them too , if he had not interposed , and coaxed her out of the design .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 41]: ` It was at Mr. Creakle 's , my son tells me , that you first became acquainted , ' said Mrs. Steerforth , as she and I were talking at one table , while they played backgammon at another .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 42]: ` Indeed , I recollect his speaking , at that time , of a pupil younger than himself who had taken his fancy there ; but your name , as you may suppose , has not lived in my memory . '
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 34]: ` He was very generous and noble to me in those days , I assure you , ma'am , ' said I , ` and I stood in need of such a friend .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 10]: I should have been quite crushed without him . '
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 15]: ` He is always generous and noble , ' said Mrs. Steerforth , proudly .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 12]: I subscribed to this with all my heart , God knows .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 33]: She knew I did ; for the stateliness of her manner already abated towards me , except when she spoke in praise of him , and then her air was always lofty .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 41]: ` It was not a fit school generally for my son , ' said she ; ` far from it ; but there were particular circumstances to be considered at the time , of more importance even than that selection .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 40]: My son 's high spirit made it desirable that he should be placed with some man who felt its superiority , and would be content to bow himself before it ; and we found such a man there . '
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 8]: I knew that , knowing the fellow .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 36]: And yet I did not despise him the more for it , but thought it a redeeming quality in him if he could be allowed any grace for not resisting one so irresistible as Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 31]: ` My son 's great capacity was tempted on , there , by a feeling of voluntary emulation and conscious pride , ' the fond lady went on to say .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 30]: ` He would have risen against all constraint ; but he found himself the monarch of the place , and he haughtily determined to be worthy of his station .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 6]: It was like himself . '
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 16]: I echoed , with all my heart and soul , that it was like himself .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 39]: ` So my son took , of his own will , and on no compulsion , to the course in which he can always , when it is his pleasure , outstrip every competitor , ' she pursued .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 34]: ` My son informs me , Mr. Copperfield , that you were quite devoted to him , and that when you met yesterday you made yourself known to him with tears of joy .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 71]: I should be an affected woman if I made any pretence of being surprised by my son 's inspiring such emotions ; but I can not be indifferent to anyone who is so sensible of his merit , and I am very glad to see you here , and can assure you that he feels an unusual friendship for you , and that you may rely on his protection . '
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 12]: Miss Dartle played backgammon as eagerly as she did everything else .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 41]: If I had seen her , first , at the board , I should have fancied that her figure had got thin , and her eyes had got large , over that pursuit , and no other in the world .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 48]: But I am very much mistaken if she missed a word of this , or lost a look of mine as I received it with the utmost pleasure , and honoured by Mrs. Steerforth 's confidence , felt older than I had done since I left Canterbury .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 39]: When the evening was pretty far spent , and a tray of glasses and decanters came in , Steerforth promised , over the fire , that he would seriously think of going down into the country with me .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 22]: There was no hurry , he said ; a week hence would do ; and his mother hospitably said the same .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 20]: While we were talking , he more than once called me Daisy ; which brought Miss Dartle out again .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 17]: ` But really , Mr. Copperfield , ' she asked , ` is it a nickname ?
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 8]: And why does he give it you ?
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 5]: Is it -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 9]: -- because he thinks you young and innocent ?
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 9]: I am so stupid in these things . '
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 10]: I coloured in replying that I believed it was .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 4]: said Miss Dartle .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 9]: ` Now I am glad to know that !
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 13]: I ask for information , and I am glad to know it .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 14]: He thinks you young and innocent ; and so you are his friend .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 8]: Well , that 's quite delightful ! '
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 14]: She went to bed soon after this , and Mrs. Steerforth retired too .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 30]: Steerforth and I , after lingering for half-an-hour over the fire , talking about Traddles and all the rest of them at old Salem House , went upstairs together .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 17]: Steerforth 's room was next to mine , and I went in to look at it .
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 37]: It was a picture of comfort , full of easy-chairs , cushions and footstools , worked by his mother 's hand , and with no sort of thing omitted that could help to render it complete .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 35]: Finally , her handsome features looked down on her darling from a portrait on the wall , as if it were even something to her that her likeness should watch him while he slept .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 33]: I found the fire burning clear enough in my room by this time , and the curtains drawn before the windows and round the bed , giving it a very snug appearance .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 44]: I sat down in a great chair upon the hearth to meditate on my happiness ; and had enjoyed the contemplation of it for some time , when I found a likeness of Miss Dartle looking eagerly at me from above the chimney-piece .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 13]: It was a startling likeness , and necessarily had a startling look .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 60]: The painter had n't made the scar , but I made it ; and there it was , coming and going ; now confined to the upper lip as I had seen it at dinner , and now showing the whole extent of the wound inflicted by the hammer , as I had seen it when she was passionate .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 18]: I wondered peevishly why they could n't put her anywhere else instead of quartering her on me .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 19]: To get rid of her , I undressed quickly , extinguished my light , and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 25]: But , as I fell asleep , I could not forget that she was still there looking , ` Is it really , though ?
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 41]: I want to know ' ; and when I awoke in the night , I found that I was uneasily asking all sorts of people in my dreams whether it really was or not -- without knowing what I meant .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 45]: Chapter 21 Little Em ` ly There was a servant in that house , a man who , I understood , was usually with Steerforth , and had come into his service at the University , who was in appearance a pattern of respectability .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 13]: I believe there never existed in his station a more respectable-looking man .
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 39]: He was taciturn , soft-footed , very quiet in his manner , deferential , observant , always at hand when wanted , and never near when not wanted ; but his great claim to consideration was his respectability .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 69]: He had not a pliant face , he had rather a stiff neck , rather a tight smooth head with short hair clinging to it at the sides , a soft way of speaking , with a peculiar habit of whispering the letter S so distinctly , that he seemed to use it oftener than any other man ; but every peculiarity that he had he made respectable .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 14]: If his nose had been upside-down , he would have made that respectable .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 15]: He surrounded himself with an atmosphere of respectability , and walked secure in it .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 20]: It would have been next to impossible to suspect him of anything wrong , he was so thoroughly respectable .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 17]: Nobody could have thought of putting him in a livery , he was so highly respectable .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 26]: To have imposed any derogatory work upon him , would have been to inflict a wanton insult on the feelings of a most respectable man .
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 37]: And of this , I noticed - the women-servants in the household were so intuitively conscious , that they always did such work themselves , and generally while he read the paper by the pantry fire .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 8]: Such a self-contained man I never saw .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 21]: But in that quality , as in every other he possessed , he only seemed to be the more respectable .
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 20]: Even the fact that no one knew his Christian name , seemed to form a part of his respectability .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 16]: Nothing could be objected against his surname , Littimer , by which he was known .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 16]: Peter might have been hanged , or Tom transported ; but Littimer was perfectly respectable .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 28]: It was occasioned , I suppose , by the reverend nature of respectability in the abstract , but I felt particularly young in this man 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 40]: How old he was himself , I could not guess -- and that again went to his credit on the same score ; for in the calmness of respectability he might have numbered fifty years as well as thirty .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 27]: Littimer was in my room in the morning before I was up , to bring me that reproachful shaving-water , and to put out my clothes .
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 65]: When I undrew the curtains and looked out of bed , I saw him , in an equable temperature of respectability , unaffected by the east wind of January , and not even breathing frostily , standing my boots right and left in the first dancing position , and blowing specks of dust off my coat as he laid it down like a baby .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 14]: I gave him good morning , and asked him what o'clock it was .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 57]: He took out of his pocket the most respectable hunting-watch I ever saw , and preventing the spring with his thumb from opening far , looked in at the face as if he were consulting an oracular oyster , shut it up again , and said , if I pleased , it was half past eight .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 16]: ` Mr. Steerforth will be glad to hear how you have rested , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 13]: ` Thank you , ' said I , ` very well indeed .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 7]: Is Mr. Steerforth quite well ? '
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 13]: ` Thank you , sir , Mr. Steerforth is tolerably well . '
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 10]: Another of his characteristics -- no use of superlatives .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 6]: A cool calm medium always .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 17]: ` Is there anything more I can have the honour of doing for you , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 17]: The warning-bell will ring at nine ; the family take breakfast at half past nine . '
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 9]: ` Nothing , I thank you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 61]: I thank YOU , sir , if you please ' ; and with that , and with a little inclination of his head when he passed the bed-side , as an apology for correcting me , he went out , shutting the door as delicately as if I had just fallen into a sweet sleep on which my life depended .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 80]: Every morning we held exactly this conversation : never any more , and never any less : and yet , invariably , however far I might have been lifted out of myself over-night , and advanced towards maturer years , by Steerforth 's companionship , or Mrs. Steerforth 's confidence , or Miss Dartle 's conversation , in the presence of this most respectable man I became , as our smaller poets sing , ' a boy again ' .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 19]: He got horses for us ; and Steerforth , who knew everything , gave me lessons in riding .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 30]: He provided foils for us , and Steerforth gave me lessons in fencing -- gloves , and I began , of the same master , to improve in boxing .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 34]: It gave me no manner of concern that Steerforth should find me a novice in these sciences , but I never could bear to show my want of skill before the respectable Littimer .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 59]: I had no reason to believe that Littimer understood such arts himself ; he never led me to suppose anything of the kind , by so much as the vibration of one of his respectable eyelashes ; yet whenever he was by , while we were practising , I felt myself the greenest and most inexperienced of mortals .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 27]: I am particular about this man , because he made a particular effect on me at that time , and because of what took place thereafter .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 10]: The week passed away in a most delightful manner .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 55]: It passed rapidly , as may be supposed , to one entranced as I was ; and yet it gave me so many occasions for knowing Steerforth better , and admiring him more in a thousand respects , that at its close I seemed to have been with him for a much longer time .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 25]: A dashing way he had of treating me like a plaything , was more agreeable to me than any behaviour he could have adopted .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 74]: It reminded me of our old acquaintance ; it seemed the natural sequel of it ; it showed me that he was unchanged ; it relieved me of any uneasiness I might have felt , in comparing my merits with his , and measuring my claims upon his friendship by any equal standard ; above all , it was a familiar , unrestrained , affectionate demeanour that he used towards no one else .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 29]: As he had treated me at school differently from all the rest , I joyfully believed that he treated me in life unlike any other friend he had .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 24]: I believed that I was nearer to his heart than any other friend , and my own heart warmed with attachment to him .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 21]: He made up his mind to go with me into the country , and the day arrived for our departure .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 21]: He had been doubtful at first whether to take Littimer or not , but decided to leave him at home .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 49]: The respectable creature , satisfied with his lot whatever it was , arranged our portmanteaux on the little carriage that was to take us into London , as if they were intended to defy the shocks of ages , and received my modestly proffered donation with perfect tranquillity .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 26]: We bade adieu to Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle , with many thanks on my part , and much kindness on the devoted mother 's .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 28]: The last thing I saw was Littimer 's unruffled eye ; fraught , as I fancied , with the silent conviction that I was very young indeed .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 21]: What I felt , in returning so auspiciously to the old familiar places , I shall not endeavour to describe .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 7]: We went down by the Mail .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 58]: I was so concerned , I recollect , even for the honour of Yarmouth , that when Steerforth said , as we drove through its dark streets to the inn , that , as well as he could make out , it was a good , queer , out-of-the-way kind of hole , I was highly pleased .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 39]: We went to bed on our arrival -LRB- I observed a pair of dirty shoes and gaiters in connexion with my old friend the Dolphin as we passed that door -RRB- , and breakfasted late in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 35]: Steerforth , who was in great spirits , had been strolling about the beach before I was up , and had made acquaintance , he said , with half the boatmen in the place .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 55]: Moreover , he had seen , in the distance , what he was sure must be the identical house of Mr. Peggotty , with smoke coming out of the chimney ; and had had a great mind , he told me , to walk in and swear he was myself grown out of knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 13]: ` When do you propose to introduce me there , Daisy ? '
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 4]: he said . '
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 6]: I am at your disposal .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 6]: Make your own arrangements . '
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 26]: ` Why , I was thinking that this evening would be a good time , Steerforth , when they are all sitting round the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 20]: I should like you to see it when it 's snug , it 's such a curious place . '
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 6]: ` So be it ! '
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 3]: returned Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 6]: ` This evening . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 21]: I shall not give them any notice that we are here , you know , ' said I , delighted .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 9]: ` We must take them by surprise . '
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 6]: ` Oh , of course !
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 17]: It 's no fun , ' said Steerforth , ` unless we take them by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 11]: Let us see the natives in their aboriginal condition . '
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 16]: ` Though they ARE that sort of people that you mentioned , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 3]: ` Aha !
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 11]: you recollect my skirmishes with Rosa , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 7]: he exclaimed with a quick look .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 12]: ` Confound the girl , I am half afraid of her .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 8]: She 's like a goblin to me .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 5]: But never mind her .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 8]: Now what are you going to do ?
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 12]: You are going to see your nurse , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 19]: ` Why , yes , ' I said , ' I must see Peggotty first of all . '
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 12]: ` Well , ' replied Steerforth , looking at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 16]: ` Suppose I deliver you up to be cried over for a couple of hours .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 6]: Is that long enough ? '
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 48]: I answered , laughing , that I thought we might get through it in that time , but that he must come also ; for he would find that his renown had preceded him , and that he was almost as great a personage as I was .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 19]: ` I 'll come anywhere you like , ' said Steerforth , ` or do anything you like .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 26]: Tell me where to come to ; and in two hours I 'll produce myself in any state you please , sentimental or comical . '
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 29]: I gave him minute directions for finding the residence of Mr. Barkis , carrier to Blunderstone and elsewhere ; and , on this understanding , went out alone .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 39]: There was a sharp bracing air ; the ground was dry ; the sea was crisp and clear ; the sun was diffusing abundance of light , if not much warmth ; and everything was fresh and lively .
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 31]: I was so fresh and lively myself , in the pleasure of being there , that I could have stopped the people in the streets and shaken hands with them .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 8]: The streets looked small , of course .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 22]: The streets that we have only seen as children always do , I believe , when we go back to them .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 22]: But I had forgotten nothing in them , and found nothing changed , until I came to Mr. Omer 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 35]: OMER And Joram was now written up , where OMER used to be ; but the inscription , DRAPER , TAILOR , HABERDASHER , FUNERAL FURNISHER , & c. , remained as it was .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 33]: My footsteps seemed to tend so naturally to the shop door , after I had read these words from over the way , that I went across the road and looked in .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 29]: There was a pretty woman at the back of the shop , dancing a little child in her arms , while another little fellow clung to her apron .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 13]: I had no difficulty in recognizing either Minnie or Minnie 's children .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 34]: The glass door of the parlour was not open ; but in the workshop across the yard I could faintly hear the old tune playing , as if it had never left off .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 8]: ` Is Mr. Omer at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 6]: said I , entering . '
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 16]: I should like to see him , for a moment , if he is . '
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 27]: ` Oh yes , sir , he is at home , ' said Minnie ; ` the weather do n't suit his asthma out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 7]: Joe , call your grandfather ! '
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 39]: The little fellow , who was holding her apron , gave such a lusty shout , that the sound of it made him bashful , and he buried his face in her skirts , to her great admiration .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 30]: I heard a heavy puffing and blowing coming towards us , and soon Mr. Omer , shorter-winded than of yore , but not much older-looking , stood before me .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 10]: ` Servant , sir , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 11]: ` What can I do for you , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 24]: ` You can shake hands with me , Mr. Omer , if you please , ' said I , putting out my own .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 23]: ` You were very good-natured to me once , when I am afraid I did n't show that I thought so . '
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 6]: ` Was I though ? '
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 5]: returned the old man .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 15]: ` I 'm glad to hear it , but I do n't remember when .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 8]: Are you sure it was me ? '
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 5]: ` Quite . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 34]: I think my memory has got as short as my breath , ' said Mr. Omer , looking at me and shaking his head ; ` for I do n't remember you . '
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 50]: ` Do n't you remember your coming to the coach to meet me , and my having breakfast here , and our riding out to Blunderstone together : you , and I , and Mrs. Joram , and Mr. Joram too -- who was n't her husband then ? '
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 9]: ` Why , Lord bless my soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 23]: exclaimed Mr. Omer , after being thrown by his surprise into a fit of coughing , ` you do n't say so !
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 8]: Minnie , my dear , you recollect ?
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 15]: Dear me , yes ; the party was a lady , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 8]: ` My mother , ' I rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 28]: ` To -- be -- sure , ' said Mr. Omer , touching my waistcoat with his forefinger , ` and there was a little child too !
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 5]: There was two parties .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 11]: The little party was laid along with the other party .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 9]: Over at Blunderstone it was , of course .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 8]: And how have you been since ? '
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 15]: Very well , I thanked him , as I hoped he had been too .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 14]: nothing to grumble at , you know , ' said Mr. Omer . '
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 18]: I find my breath gets short , but it seldom gets longer as a man gets older .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 14]: I take it as it comes , and make the most of it .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 11]: That 's the best way , ai n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 36]: Mr. Omer coughed again , in consequence of laughing , and was assisted out of his fit by his daughter , who now stood close beside us , dancing her smallest child on the counter .
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 4]: said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 7]: ` Yes , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 3]: Two parties !
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 24]: Why , in that very ride , if you 'll believe me , the day was named for my Minnie to marry Joram .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 11]: `` Do name it , sir , '' says Joram .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 11]: `` Yes , do , father , '' says Minnie .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 9]: And now he 's come into the business .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 4]: And look here !
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 4]: The youngest ! '
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 34]: Minnie laughed , and stroked her banded hair upon her temples , as her father put one of his fat fingers into the hand of the child she was dancing on the counter .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 8]: ` Two parties , of course ! '
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 9]: said Mr. Omer , nodding his head retrospectively .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 4]: ` Ex-actly so !
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 40]: And Joram 's at work , at this minute , on a grey one with silver nails , not this measurement ' -- the measurement of the dancing child upon the counter -- ` by a good two inches .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 7]: -- Will you take something ? '
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 7]: I thanked him , but declined .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 10]: ` Let me see , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 24]: ` Barkis 's the carrier 's wife -- Peggotty 's the boatman 's sister -- she had something to do with your family ?
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 9]: She was in service there , sure ? '
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 11]: My answering in the affirmative gave him great satisfaction . '
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 22]: I believe my breath will get long next , my memory 's getting so much so , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 49]: ` Well , sir , we 've got a young relation of hers here , under articles to us , that has as elegant a taste in the dress-making business -- I assure you I do n't believe there 's a Duchess in England can touch her . '
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 8]: ` Not little Em ` ly ? '
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 5]: said I , involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 19]: 'Em ` ly 's her name , ' said Mr. Omer , ` and she 's little too .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 28]: But if you 'll believe me , she has such a face of her own that half the women in this town are mad against her . '
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 6]: ` Nonsense , father ! '
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 3]: cried Minnie .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 39]: ` My dear , ' said Mr. Omer , ' I do n't say it 's the case with you , ' winking at me , ` but I say that half the women in Yarmouth -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 13]: and in five mile round -- are mad against that girl . '
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 42]: ` Then she should have kept to her own station in life , father , ' said Minnie , ` and not have given them any hold to talk about her , and then they could n't have done it . '
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 11]: ` Could n't have done it , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 4]: retorted Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 7]: ` Could n't have done it !
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 7]: Is that YOUR knowledge of life ?
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 28]: What is there that any woman could n't do , that she should n't do -- especially on the subject of another woman 's good looks ? '
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 19]: I really thought it was all over with Mr. Omer , after he had uttered this libellous pleasantry .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 60]: He coughed to that extent , and his breath eluded all his attempts to recover it with that obstinacy , that I fully expected to see his head go down behind the counter , and his little black breeches , with the rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees , come quivering up in a last ineffectual struggle .
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 32]: At length , however , he got better , though he still panted hard , and was so exhausted that he was obliged to sit on the stool of the shop-desk .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 45]: ` You see , ' he said , wiping his head , and breathing with difficulty , ` she has n't taken much to any companions here ; she has n't taken kindly to any particular acquaintances and friends , not to mention sweethearts .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 19]: In consequence , an ill-natured story got about , that Em ` ly wanted to be a lady .
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 43]: Now my opinion is , that it came into circulation principally on account of her sometimes saying , at the school , that if she was a lady she would like to do so-and-so for her uncle -- do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 10]: -- and buy him such-and-such fine things . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 27]: I assure you , Mr. Omer , she has said so to me , ' I returned eagerly , ` when we were both children . '
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 10]: Mr. Omer nodded his head and rubbed his chin .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 4]: ` Just so .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 31]: Then out of a very little , she could dress herself , you see , better than most others could out of a deal , and that made things unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 57]: Moreover , she was rather what might be called wayward -- I 'll go so far as to say what I should call wayward myself , ' said Mr. Omer ; ' - did n't know her own mind quite -- a little spoiled -- and could n't , at first , exactly bind herself down .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 13]: No more than that was ever said against her , Minnie ? '
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 10]: ` No , father , ' said Mrs. Joram .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 10]: ` That 's the worst , I believe . '
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 35]: ` So when she got a situation , ' said Mr. Omer , ` to keep a fractious old lady company , they did n't very well agree , and she did n't stop .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 11]: At last she came here , apprenticed for three years .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 19]: Nearly two of 'em are over , and she has been as good a girl as ever was .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 4]: Worth any six !
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 11]: Minnie , is she worth any six , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 9]: ` Yes , father , ' replied Minnie .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 9]: ` Never say I detracted from her ! '
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 9]: ` Very good , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 5]: ` That 's right .
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 43]: And so , young gentleman , ' he added , after a few moments ' further rubbing of his chin , ` that you may not consider me long-winded as well as short-breathed , I believe that 's all about it . '
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 25]: As they had spoken in a subdued tone , while speaking of Em ` ly , I had no doubt that she was near .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 25]: On my asking now , if that were not so , Mr. Omer nodded yes , and nodded towards the door of the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 31]: My hurried inquiry if I might peep in , was answered with a free permission ; and , looking through the glass , I saw her sitting at her work .
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 96]: I saw her , a most beautiful little creature , with the cloudless blue eyes , that had looked into my childish heart , turned laughingly upon another child of Minnie 's who was playing near her ; with enough of wilfulness in her bright face to justify what I had heard ; with much of the old capricious coyness lurking in it ; but with nothing in her pretty looks , I am sure , but what was meant for goodness and for happiness , and what was on a good and happy course .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 17]: The tune across the yard that seemed as if it never had left off -- alas !
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 19]: it was the tune that never DOES leave off -- was beating , softly , all the while .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 20]: ` Would n't you like to step in , ' said Mr. Omer , ` and speak to her ?
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 9]: Walk in and speak to her , sir !
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 6]: Make yourself at home ! '
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 26]: I was too bashful to do so then -- I was afraid of confusing her , and I was no less afraid of confusing myself .
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 52]: - but I informed myself of the hour at which she left of an evening , in order that our visit might be timed accordingly ; and taking leave of Mr. Omer , and his pretty daughter , and her little children , went away to my dear old Peggotty 's .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 12]: Here she was , in the tiled kitchen , cooking dinner !
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 20]: The moment I knocked at the door she opened it , and asked me what I pleased to want .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 17]: I looked at her with a smile , but she gave me no smile in return .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 21]: I had never ceased to write to her , but it must have been seven years since we had met .
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 10]: ` Is Mr. Barkis at home , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 10]: I said , feigning to speak roughly to her .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 23]: ` He 's at home , sir , ' returned Peggotty , ` but he 's bad abed with the rheumatics . '
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 11]: ` Do n't he go over to Blunderstone now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 12]: ` When he 's well he do , ' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 11]: ` Do YOU ever go there , Mrs. Barkis ? '
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 20]: She looked at me more attentively , and I noticed a quick movement of her hands towards each other .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 22]: ` Because I want to ask a question about a house there , that they call the -- what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 8]: -- the Rookery , ' said I .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 24]: She took a step backward , and put out her hands in an undecided frightened way , as if to keep me off .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 4]: ` Peggotty ! '
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 5]: I cried to her .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 9]: She cried , ` My darling boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 16]: and we both burst into tears , and were locked in one another 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 50]: What extravagances she committed ; what laughing and crying over me ; what pride she showed , what joy , what sorrow that she whose pride and joy I might have been , could never hold me in a fond embrace ; I have not the heart to tell .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 18]: I was troubled with no misgiving that it was young in me to respond to her emotions .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 28]: I had never laughed and cried in all my life , I dare say -- not even to her -- more freely than I did that morning .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 31]: ` Barkis will be so glad , ' said Peggotty , wiping her eyes with her apron , ` that it 'll do him more good than pints of liniment .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 10]: May I go and tell him you are here ?
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 12]: Will you come up and see him , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 5]: Of course I would .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 46]: But Peggotty could not get out of the room as easily as she meant to , for as often as she got to the door and looked round at me , she came back again to have another laugh and another cry upon my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 40]: At last , to make the matter easier , I went upstairs with her ; and having waited outside for a minute , while she said a word of preparation to Mr. Barkis , presented myself before that invalid .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 7]: He received me with absolute enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 31]: He was too rheumatic to be shaken hands with , but he begged me to shake the tassel on the top of his nightcap , which I did most cordially .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 35]: When I sat down by the side of the bed , he said that it did him a world of good to feel as if he was driving me on the Blunderstone road again .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 41]: As he lay in bed , face upward , and so covered , with that exception , that he seemed to be nothing but a face -- like a conventional cherubim - he looked the queerest object I ever beheld .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 17]: ` What name was it , as I wrote up in the cart , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 10]: said Mr. Barkis , with a slow rheumatic smile .
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 18]: Mr. Barkis , we had some grave talks about that matter , had n't we ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 11]: I was willin ' a long time , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 5]: said Mr. Barkis . '
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 20]: A long time , ' said I. ` And I do n't regret it , ' said Mr. Barkis .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 24]: ` Do you remember what you told me once , about her making all the apple parsties and doing all the cooking ? '
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 10]: ` Yes , very well , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 16]: ` It was as true , ' said Mr. Barkis , ` as turnips is .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 27]: It was as true , ' said Mr. Barkis , nodding his nightcap , which was his only means of emphasis , ` as taxes is .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 8]: And nothing 's truer than them . '
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 27]: Mr. Barkis turned his eyes upon me , as if for my assent to this result of his reflections in bed ; and I gave it .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 33]: ` Nothing 's truer than them , ' repeated Mr. Barkis ; ' a man as poor as I am , finds that out in his mind when he 's laid up .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 11]: I 'm a very poor man , sir ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 12]: I am sorry to hear it , Mr. Barkis . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 14]: A very poor man , indeed I am , ' said Mr. Barkis .
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 35]: Here his right hand came slowly and feebly from under the bedclothes , and with a purposeless uncertain grasp took hold of a stick which was loosely tied to the side of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 43]: After some poking about with this instrument , in the course of which his face assumed a variety of distracted expressions , Mr. Barkis poked it against a box , an end of which had been visible to me all the time .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 6]: Then his face became composed .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 9]: ` Old clothes , ' said Mr. Barkis .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 17]: said I. ' I wish it was Money , sir , ' said Mr. Barkis . '
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 32]: I wish it was , indeed , ' said I. ` But it AI N'T , ' said Mr. Barkis , opening both his eyes as wide as he possibly could .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 37]: I expressed myself quite sure of that , and Mr. Barkis , turning his eyes more gently to his wife , said : ` She 's the usefullest and best of women , C. P. Barkis .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 18]: All the praise that anyone can give to C. P. Barkis , she deserves , and more !
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 24]: My dear , you 'll get a dinner today , for company ; something good to eat and drink , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 32]: I should have protested against this unnecessary demonstration in my honour , but that I saw Peggotty , on the opposite side of the bed , extremely anxious I should not .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 7]: So I held my peace . '
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 27]: I have got a trifle of money somewhere about me , my dear , ' said Mr. Barkis , ` but I 'm a little tired .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 24]: If you and Mr. David will leave me for a short nap , I 'll try and find it when I wake . '
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 11]: We left the room , in compliance with this request .
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 63]: When we got outside the door , Peggotty informed me that Mr. Barkis , being now ' a little nearer ' than he used to be , always resorted to this same device before producing a single coin from his store ; and that he endured unheard-of agonies in crawling out of bed alone , and taking it from that unlucky box .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 57]: In effect , we presently heard him uttering suppressed groans of the most dismal nature , as this magpie proceeding racked him in every joint ; but while Peggotty 's eyes were full of compassion for him , she said his generous impulse would do him good , and it was better not to check it .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 50]: So he groaned on , until he had got into bed again , suffering , I have no doubt , a martyrdom ; and then called us in , pretending to have just woke up from a refreshing sleep , and to produce a guinea from under his pillow .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 33]: His satisfaction in which happy imposition on us , and in having preserved the impenetrable secret of the box , appeared to be a sufficient compensation to him for all his tortures .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 16]: I prepared Peggotty for Steerforth 's arrival and it was not long before he came .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 41]: I am persuaded she knew no difference between his having been a personal benefactor of hers , and a kind friend to me , and that she would have received him with the utmost gratitude and devotion in any case .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 58]: But his easy , spirited good humour ; his genial manner , his handsome looks , his natural gift of adapting himself to whomsoever he pleased , and making direct , when he cared to do it , to the main point of interest in anybody 's heart ; bound her to him wholly in five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 12]: His manner to me , alone , would have won her .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 27]: But , through all these causes combined , I sincerely believe she had a kind of adoration for him before he left the house that night .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 25]: He stayed there with me to dinner -- if I were to say willingly , I should not half express how readily and gaily .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 23]: He went into Mr. Barkis 's room like light and air , brightening and refreshing it as if he were healthy weather .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 59]: There was no noise , no effort , no consciousness , in anything he did ; but in everything an indescribable lightness , a seeming impossibility of doing anything else , or doing anything better , which was so graceful , so natural , and agreeable , that it overcomes me , even now , in the remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 52]: We made merry in the little parlour , where the Book of Martyrs , unthumbed since my time , was laid out upon the desk as of old , and where I now turned over its terrific pictures , remembering the old sensations they had awakened , but not feeling them .
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 49]: When Peggotty spoke of what she called my room , and of its being ready for me at night , and of her hoping I would occupy it , before I could so much as look at Steerforth , hesitating , he was possessed of the whole case .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 8]: ` Of course , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 19]: ` You 'll sleep here , while we stay , and I shall sleep at the hotel . '
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 24]: ` But to bring you so far , ' I returned , ` and to separate , seems bad companionship , Steerforth . '
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 16]: ` Why , in the name of Heaven , where do you naturally belong ? '
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 12]: ` What is `` seems '' , compared to that ? '
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 6]: It was settled at once .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 25]: He maintained all his delightful qualities to the last , until we started forth , at eight o'clock , for Mr. Peggotty 's boat .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 62]: Indeed , they were more and more brightly exhibited as the hours went on ; for I thought even then , and I have no doubt now , that the consciousness of success in his determination to please , inspired him with a new delicacy of perception , and made it , subtle as it was , more easy to him .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 88]: If anyone had told me , then , that all this was a brilliant game , played for the excitement of the moment , for the employment of high spirits , in the thoughtless love of superiority , in a mere wasteful careless course of winning what was worthless to him , and next minute thrown away -- I say , if anyone had told me such a lie that night , I wonder in what manner of receiving it my indignation would have found a vent !
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 63]: Probably only in an increase , had that been possible , of the romantic feelings of fidelity and friendship with which I walked beside him , over the dark wintry sands towards the old boat ; the wind sighing around us even more mournfully , than it had sighed and moaned upon the night when I first darkened Mr. Peggotty 's door .
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 16]: ` This is a wild kind of place , Steerforth , is it not ? '
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 24]: ` Dismal enough in the dark , ' he said : ` and the sea roars as if it were hungry for us .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 13]: Is that the boat , where I see a light yonder ? '
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 25]: ` That 's the boat , ' said I. ` And it 's the same I saw this morning , ' he returned . '
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 13]: I came straight to it , by instinct , I suppose . '
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 17]: We said no more as we approached the light , but made softly for the door .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 20]: I laid my hand upon the latch ; and whispering Steerforth to keep close to me , went in .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 43]: A murmur of voices had been audible on the outside , and , at the moment of our entrance , a clapping of hands : which latter noise , I was surprised to see , proceeded from the generally disconsolate Mrs. Gummidge .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 14]: But Mrs. Gummidge was not the only person there who was unusually excited .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 135]: Mr. Peggotty , his face lighted up with uncommon satisfaction , and laughing with all his might , held his rough arms wide open , as if for little Em ` ly to run into them ; Ham , with a mixed expression in his face of admiration , exultation , and a lumbering sort of bashfulness that sat upon him very well , held little Em ` ly by the hand , as if he were presenting her to Mr. Peggotty ; little Em ` ly herself , blushing and shy , but delighted with Mr. Peggotty 's delight , as her joyous eyes expressed , was stopped by our entrance -LRB- for she saw us first -RRB- in the very act of springing from Ham to nestle in Mr. Peggotty 's embrace .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 52]: In the first glimpse we had of them all , and at the moment of our passing from the dark cold night into the warm light room , this was the way in which they were all employed : Mrs. Gummidge in the background , clapping her hands like a madwoman .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 23]: The little picture was so instantaneously dissolved by our going in , that one might have doubted whether it had ever been .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 35]: I was in the midst of the astonished family , face to face with Mr. Peggotty , and holding out my hand to him , when Ham shouted : ` Mas ' r Davy !
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 8]: It 's Mas ' r Davy ! '
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 37]: In a moment we were all shaking hands with one another , and asking one another how we did , and telling one another how glad we were to meet , and all talking at once .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 71]: Mr. Peggotty was so proud and overjoyed to see us , that he did not know what to say or do , but kept over and over again shaking hands with me , and then with Steerforth , and then with me , and then ruffling his shaggy hair all over his head , and laughing with such glee and triumph , that it was a treat to see him .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 50]: ` Why , that you two gent ` lmen -- gent ` lmen growed -- should come to this here roof tonight , of all nights in my life , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` is such a thing as never happened afore , I do rightly believe !
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 10]: Em ` ly , my darling , come here !
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 7]: Come here , my little witch !
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 12]: There 's Mas ' r Davy 's friend , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 16]: There 's the gent ` lman as you 've heerd on , Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 42]: He comes to see you , along with Mas ' r Davy , on the brightest night of your uncle 's life as ever was or will be , Gorm the t ` other one , and horroar for it ! '
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 67]: After delivering this speech all in a breath , and with extraordinary animation and pleasure , Mr. Peggotty put one of his large hands rapturously on each side of his niece 's face , and kissing it a dozen times , laid it with a gentle pride and love upon his broad chest , and patted it as if his hand had been a lady 's .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 36]: Then he let her go ; and as she ran into the little chamber where I used to sleep , looked round upon us , quite hot and out of breath with his uncommon satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 25]: ` If you two gent ` lmen -- gent ` lmen growed now , and such gent ` lmen -- ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 12]: ` So th ' are , so th ' are ! '
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 3]: cried Ham .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 4]: ` Well said !
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 5]: So th ' are .
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 18]: Mas ' r Davy bor ' -- gent ` lmen growed -- so th ' are ! '
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 42]: ` If you two gent ` lmen , gent ` lmen growed , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` do n't ex-cuse me for being in a state of mind , when you understand matters , I 'll arks your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 7]: Em ` ly , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 24]: -- She knows I 'm a going to tell , ' here his delight broke out again , ` and has made off .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 17]: Would you be so good as look arter her , Mawther , for a minute ? '
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 6]: Mrs. Gummidge nodded and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 43]: ` If this ai n't , ' said Mr. Peggotty , sitting down among us by the fire , ` the brightest night o ' my life , I 'm a shellfish -- biled too - and more I ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 63]: This here little Em ` ly , sir , ' in a low voice to Steerforth , ' - her as you see a blushing here just now -- ' Steerforth only nodded ; but with such a pleased expression of interest , and of participation in Mr. Peggotty 's feelings , that the latter answered him as if he had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 10]: ` To be sure , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 10]: ` That 's her , and so she is .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 5]: Thankee , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 16]: Ham nodded to me several times , as if he would have said so too .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 52]: ` This here little Em ` ly of ours , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` has been , in our house , what I suppose -LRB- I 'm a ignorant man , but that 's my belief -RRB- no one but a little bright-eyed creetur can be in a house .
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 19]: She ai n't my child ; I never had one ; but I could n't love her more .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 3]: You understand !
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 8]: I could n't do it ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 9]: I quite understand , ' said Steerforth . '
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 17]: I know you do , sir , ' returned Mr. Peggotty , ` and thankee again .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 47]: Mas ' r Davy , he can remember what she was ; you may judge for your own self what she is ; but neither of you ca n't fully know what she has been , is , and will be , to my loving art .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 50]: I am rough , sir , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ' I am as rough as a Sea Porkypine ; but no one , unless , mayhap , it is a woman , can know , I think , what our little Em ` ly is to me .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 31]: And betwixt ourselves , ' sinking his voice lower yet , ` that woman 's name ai n't Missis Gummidge neither , though she has a world of merits . '
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 79]: Mr. Peggotty ruffled his hair again , with both hands , as a further preparation for what he was going to say , and went on , with a hand upon each of his knees : ` There was a certain person as had know 'd our Em ` ly , from the time when her father was drownded ; as had seen her constant ; when a babby , when a young gal , when a woman .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 66]: Not much of a person to look at , he war n't , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` something o ' my own build - rough -- a good deal o ' the sou ' - wester in him -- wery salt -- but , on the whole , a honest sort of a chap , with his art in the right place . '
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 22]: I thought I had never seen Ham grin to anything like the extent to which he sat grinning at us now .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 41]: ` What does this here blessed tarpaulin go and do , ' said Mr. Peggotty , with his face one high noon of enjoyment , ` but he loses that there art of his to our little Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 42]: He follers her about , he makes hisself a sort o ' servant to her , he loses in a great measure his relish for his wittles , and in the long-run he makes it clear to me wot 's amiss .
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 24]: Now I could wish myself , you see , that our little Em ` ly was in a fair way of being married .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 25]: I could wish to see her , at all ewents , under articles to a honest man as had a right to defend her .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 108]: I do n't know how long I may live , or how soon I may die ; but I know that if I was capsized , any night , in a gale of wind in Yarmouth Roads here , and was to see the town-lights shining for the last time over the rollers as I could n't make no head against , I could go down quieter for thinking `` There 's a man ashore there , iron-true to my little Em ` ly , God bless her , and no wrong can touch my Em ` ly while so be as that man lives . '' '
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 44]: Mr. Peggotty , in simple earnestness , waved his right arm , as if he were waving it at the town-lights for the last time , and then , exchanging a nod with Ham , whose eye he caught , proceeded as before .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 10]: I counsels him to speak to Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 20]: He 's big enough , but he 's bashfuller than a little un , and he do n't like .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 4]: So I speak .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 3]: Him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 5]: says Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 18]: `` Him that I 've know 'd so intimate so many years , and like so much .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 4]: Oh , Uncle !
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 6]: I never can have him .
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 8]: He 's such a good fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 43]: I gives her a kiss , and I says no more to her than , `` My dear , you 're right to speak out , you 're to choose for yourself , you 're as free as a little bird . ''
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 24]: Then I aways to him , and I says , `` I wish it could have been so , but it ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 29]: But you can both be as you was , and wot I say to you is , Be as you was with her , like a man . ''
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 15]: He says to me , a-shaking of my hand , `` I will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 3]: he says .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 27]: And he was -- honourable and manful -- for two year going on , and we was just the same at home here as afore . '
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 93]: Mr. Peggotty 's face , which had varied in its expression with the various stages of his narrative , now resumed all its former triumphant delight , as he laid a hand upon my knee and a hand upon Steerforth 's -LRB- previously wetting them both , for the greater emphasis of the action -RRB- , and divided the following speech between us : ` All of a sudden , one evening -- as it might be tonight -- comes little Em ` ly from her work , and him with her !
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 12]: There ai n't so much in that , you 'll say .
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 26]: No , because he takes care on her , like a brother , arter dark , and indeed afore dark , and at all times .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 25]: But this tarpaulin chap , he takes hold of her hand , and he cries out to me , joyful , `` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 9]: This is to be my little wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 24]: And she says , half bold and half shy , and half a laughing and half a crying , `` Yes , Uncle !
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 5]: If you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 6]: -- If I please ! '
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 25]: cried Mr. Peggotty , rolling his head in an ecstasy at the idea ; ` Lord , as if I should do anythink else !
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 44]: -- `` If you please , I am steadier now , and I have thought better of it , and I 'll be as good a little wife as I can to him , for he 's a dear , good fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 17]: Then Missis Gummidge , she claps her hands like a play , and you come in .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 2]: Theer !
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 6]: the murder 's out ! '
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 9]: said Mr. Peggotty -- ` You come in !
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 28]: It took place this here present hour ; and here 's the man that 'll marry her , the minute she 's out of her time . '
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 79]: Ham staggered , as well he might , under the blow Mr. Peggotty dealt him in his unbounded joy , as a mark of confidence and friendship ; but feeling called upon to say something to us , he said , with much faltering and great difficulty : ` She war n't no higher than you was , Mas ' r Davy -- when you first come -- when I thought what she 'd grow up to be .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 14]: I see her grown up - gent ` lmen -- like a flower .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 16]: I 'd lay down my life for her -- Mas ' r Davy -- Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 5]: most content and cheerful !
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 35]: She 's more to me -- gent ` lmen - than -- she 's all to me that ever I can want , and more than ever I -- than ever I could say .
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 7]: I -- I love her true .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 48]: There ai n't a gent ` lman in all the land -- nor yet sailing upon all the sea -- that can love his lady more than I love her , though there 's many a common man -- would say better -- what he meant . '
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 34]: I thought it affecting to see such a sturdy fellow as Ham was now , trembling in the strength of what he felt for the pretty little creature who had won his heart .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 22]: I thought the simple confidence reposed in us by Mr. Peggotty and by himself , was , in itself , affecting .
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 8]: I was affected by the story altogether .
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 18]: How far my emotions were influenced by the recollections of my childhood , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 25]: Whether I had come there with any lingering fancy that I was still to love little Em ` ly , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 33]: I know that I was filled with pleasure by all this ; but , at first , with an indescribably sensitive pleasure , that a very little would have changed to pain .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 29]: Therefore , if it had depended upon me to touch the prevailing chord among them with any skill , I should have made a poor hand of it .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 34]: But it depended upon Steerforth ; and he did it with such address , that in a few minutes we were all as easy and as happy as it was possible to be .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 27]: ` Mr. Peggotty , ' he said , ` you are a thoroughly good fellow , and deserve to be as happy as you are tonight .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 5]: My hand upon it !
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 10]: Ham , I give you joy , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 7]: My hand upon that , too !
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 13]: Daisy , stir the fire , and make it a brisk one !
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 30]: and Mr. Peggotty , unless you can induce your gentle niece to come back -LRB- for whom I vacate this seat in the corner -RRB- , I shall go .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 30]: Any gap at your fireside on such a night -- such a gap least of all -- I would n't make , for the wealth of the Indies ! '
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 15]: So Mr. Peggotty went into my old room to fetch little Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 17]: At first little Em ` ly did n't like to come , and then Ham went .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 125]: Presently they brought her to the fireside , very much confused , and very shy , -- but she soon became more assured when she found how gently and respectfully Steerforth spoke to her ; how skilfully he avoided anything that would embarrass her ; how he talked to Mr. Peggotty of boats , and ships , and tides , and fish ; how he referred to me about the time when he had seen Mr. Peggotty at Salem House ; how delighted he was with the boat and all belonging to it ; how lightly and easily he carried on , until he brought us , by degrees , into a charmed circle , and we were all talking away without any reserve .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 30]: Em ` ly , indeed , said little all the evening ; but she looked , and listened , and her face got animated , and she was charming .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 51]: Steerforth told a story of a dismal shipwreck -LRB- which arose out of his talk with Mr. Peggotty -RRB- , as if he saw it all before him -- and little Em ` ly 's eyes were fastened on him all the time , as if she saw it too .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 70]: He told us a merry adventure of his own , as a relief to that , with as much gaiety as if the narrative were as fresh to him as it was to us -- and little Em ` ly laughed until the boat rang with the musical sounds , and we all laughed -LRB- Steerforth too -RRB- , in irresistible sympathy with what was so pleasant and light-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 70]: He got Mr. Peggotty to sing , or rather to roar , ` When the stormy winds do blow , do blow , do blow ' ; and he sang a sailor 's song himself , so pathetically and beautifully , that I could have almost fancied that the real wind creeping sorrowfully round the house , and murmuring low through our unbroken silence , was there to listen .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 35]: As to Mrs. Gummidge , he roused that victim of despondency with a success never attained by anyone else -LRB- so Mr. Peggotty informed me -RRB- , since the decease of the old one .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 23]: He left her so little leisure for being miserable , that she said next day she thought she must have been bewitched .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 15]: But he set up no monopoly of the general attention , or the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 90]: When little Em ` ly grew more courageous , and talked -LRB- but still bashfully -RRB- across the fire to me , of our old wanderings upon the beach , to pick up shells and pebbles ; and when I asked her if she recollected how I used to be devoted to her ; and when we both laughed and reddened , casting these looks back on the pleasant old times , so unreal to look at now ; he was silent and attentive , and observed us thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 35]: She sat , at this time , and all the evening , on the old locker in her old little corner by the fire -- Ham beside her , where I used to sit .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 49]: I could not satisfy myself whether it was in her own little tormenting way , or in a maidenly reserve before us , that she kept quite close to the wall , and away from him ; but I observed that she did so , all the evening .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 14]: As I remember , it was almost midnight when we took our leave .
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 43]: We had had some biscuit and dried fish for supper , and Steerforth had produced from his pocket a full flask of Hollands , which we men -LRB- I may say we men , now , without a blush -RRB- had emptied .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 60]: We parted merrily ; and as they all stood crowded round the door to light us as far as they could upon our road , I saw the sweet blue eyes of little Em ` ly peeping after us , from behind Ham , and heard her soft voice calling to us to be careful how we went . '
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 7]: A most engaging little Beauty ! '
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 7]: said Steerforth , taking my arm .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 25]: It 's a quaint place , and they are quaint company , and it 's quite a new sensation to mix with them . '
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 25]: ` How fortunate we are , too , ' I returned , ` to have arrived to witness their happiness in that intended marriage !
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 7]: I never saw people so happy .
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 23]: How delightful to see it , and to be made the sharers in their honest joy , as we have been ! '
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 16]: ` That 's rather a chuckle-headed fellow for the girl ; is n't he ? '
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 25]: He had been so hearty with him , and with them all , that I felt a shock in this unexpected and cold reply .
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 25]: But turning quickly upon him , and seeing a laugh in his eyes , I answered , much relieved : ` Ah , Steerforth !
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 11]: It 's well for you to joke about the poor !
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 23]: You may skirmish with Miss Dartle , or try to hide your sympathies in jest from me , but I know better .
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 58]: When I see how perfectly you understand them , how exquisitely you can enter into happiness like this plain fisherman 's , or humour a love like my old nurse 's , I know that there is not a joy or sorrow , not an emotion , of such people , that can be indifferent to you .
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 17]: And I admire and love you for it , Steerforth , twenty times the more ! '
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 26]: He stopped , and , looking in my face , said , ` Daisy , I believe you are in earnest , and are good .
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 7]: I wish we all were ! '
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 22]: Next moment he was gaily singing Mr. Peggotty 's song , as we walked at a round pace back to Yarmouth .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 26]: Chapter 22 Some Old Scenes , and Some New People Steerforth and I stayed for more than a fortnight in that part of the country .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 23]: We were very much together , I need not say ; but occasionally we were asunder for some hours at a time .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 37]: He was a good sailor , and I was but an indifferent one ; and when he went out boating with Mr. Peggotty , which was a favourite amusement of his , I generally remained ashore .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 59]: My occupation of Peggotty 's spare-room put a constraint upon me , from which he was free : for , knowing how assiduously she attended on Mr. Barkis all day , I did not like to remain out late at night ; whereas Steerforth , lying at the Inn , had nothing to consult but his own humour .
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 63]: Thus it came about , that I heard of his making little treats for the fishermen at Mr. Peggotty 's house of call , ` The Willing Mind ' , after I was in bed , and of his being afloat , wrapped in fishermen 's clothes , whole moonlight nights , and coming back when the morning tide was at flood .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 49]: By this time , however , I knew that his restless nature and bold spirits delighted to find a vent in rough toil and hard weather , as in any other means of excitement that presented itself freshly to him ; so none of his proceedings surprised me .
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 50]: Another cause of our being sometimes apart , was , that I had naturally an interest in going over to Blunderstone , and revisiting the old familiar scenes of my childhood ; while Steerforth , after being there once , had naturally no great interest in going there again .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 32]: Hence , on three or four days that I can at once recall , we went our several ways after an early breakfast , and met again at a late dinner .
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 43]: I had no idea how he employed his time in the interval , beyond a general knowledge that he was very popular in the place , and had twenty means of actively diverting himself where another man might not have found one .
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 39]: For my own part , my occupation in my solitary pilgrimages was to recall every yard of the old road as I went along it , and to haunt the old spots , of which I never tired .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 27]: I haunted them , as my memory had often done , and lingered among them as my younger thoughts had lingered when I was far away .
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 85]: The grave beneath the tree , where both my parents lay -- on which I had looked out , when it was my father 's only , with such curious feelings of compassion , and by which I had stood , so desolate , when it was opened to receive my pretty mother and her baby -- the grave which Peggotty 's own faithful care had ever since kept neat , and made a garden of , I walked near , by the hour .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 57]: It lay a little off the churchyard path , in a quiet corner , not so far removed but I could read the names upon the stone as I walked to and fro , startled by the sound of the church-bell when it struck the hour , for it was like a departed voice to me .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 27]: My reflections at these times were always associated with the figure I was to make in life , and the distinguished things I was to do .
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 35]: My echoing footsteps went to no other tune , but were as constant to that as if I had come home to build my castles in the air at a living mother 's side .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 9]: There were great changes in my old home .
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 27]: The ragged nests , so long deserted by the rooks , were gone ; and the trees were lopped and topped out of their remembered shapes .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 17]: The garden had run wild , and half the windows of the house were shut up .
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 21]: It was occupied , but only by a poor lunatic gentleman , and the people who took care of him .
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 66]: He was always sitting at my little window , looking out into the churchyard ; and I wondered whether his rambling thoughts ever went upon any of the fancies that used to occupy mine , on the rosy mornings when I peeped out of that same little window in my night-clothes , and saw the sheep quietly feeding in the light of the rising sun .
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 36]: Our old neighbours , Mr. and Mrs. Grayper , were gone to South America , and the rain had made its way through the roof of their empty house , and stained the outer walls .
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 54]: Mr. Chillip was married again to a tall , raw-boned , high-nosed wife ; and they had a weazen little baby , with a heavy head that it could n't hold up , and two weak staring eyes , with which it seemed to be always wondering why it had ever been born .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 38]: It was with a singular jumble of sadness and pleasure that I used to linger about my native place , until the reddening winter sun admonished me that it was time to start on my returning walk .
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 36]: But , when the place was left behind , and especially when Steerforth and I were happily seated over our dinner by a blazing fire , it was delicious to think of having been there .
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 80]: So it was , though in a softened degree , when I went to my neat room at night ; and , turning over the leaves of the crocodile-book -LRB- which was always there , upon a little table -RRB- , remembered with a grateful heart how blest I was in having such a friend as Steerforth , such a friend as Peggotty , and such a substitute for what I had lost as my excellent and generous aunt .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 19]: My nearest way to Yarmouth , in coming back from these long walks , was by a ferry .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 32]: It landed me on the flat between the town and the sea , which I could make straight across , and so save myself a considerable circuit by the high road .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 28]: Mr. Peggotty 's house being on that waste-place , and not a hundred yards out of my track , I always looked in as I went by .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 30]: Steerforth was pretty sure to be there expecting me , and we went on together through the frosty air and gathering fog towards the twinkling lights of the town .
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 51]: One dark evening , when I was later than usual -- for I had , that day , been making my parting visit to Blunderstone , as we were now about to return home -- I found him alone in Mr. Peggotty 's house , sitting thoughtfully before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 17]: He was so intent upon his own reflections that he was quite unconscious of my approach .
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 35]: This , indeed , he might easily have been if he had been less absorbed , for footsteps fell noiselessly on the sandy ground outside ; but even my entrance failed to rouse him .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 26]: I was standing close to him , looking at him ; and still , with a heavy brow , he was lost in his meditations .
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 21]: He gave such a start when I put my hand upon his shoulder , that he made me start too .
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 21]: ` You come upon me , ' he said , almost angrily , ` like a reproachful ghost ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 13]: I was obliged to announce myself , somehow , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 11]: ` Have I called you down from the stars ? '
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 7]: ` No , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 8]: ` Up from anywhere , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 10]: said I , taking my seat near him . '
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 14]: I was looking at the pictures in the fire , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 49]: ` But you are spoiling them for me , ' said I , as he stirred it quickly with a piece of burning wood , striking out of it a train of red-hot sparks that went careering up the little chimney , and roaring out into the air .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 13]: ` You would not have seen them , ' he returned . '
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 11]: I detest this mongrel time , neither day nor night .
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 5]: How late you are !
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 7]: Where have you been ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 77]: I have been taking leave of my usual walk , ' said I. ` And I have been sitting here , ' said Steerforth , glancing round the room , ` thinking that all the people we found so glad on the night of our coming down , might -- to judge from the present wasted air of the place -- be dispersed , or dead , or come to I do n't know what harm .
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 18]: David , I wish to God I had had a judicious father these last twenty years ! '
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 12]: ` My dear Steerforth , what is the matter ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 13]: I wish with all my soul I had been better guided ! '
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 4]: he exclaimed . '
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 13]: I wish with all my soul I could guide myself better ! '
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 13]: There was a passionate dejection in his manner that quite amazed me .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 12]: He was more unlike himself than I could have supposed possible .
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 78]: ` It would be better to be this poor Peggotty , or his lout of a nephew , ' he said , getting up and leaning moodily against the chimney-piece , with his face towards the fire , ` than to be myself , twenty times richer and twenty times wiser , and be the torment to myself that I have been , in this Devil 's bark of a boat , within the last half-hour ! '
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 39]: I was so confounded by the alteration in him , that at first I could only observe him in silence , as he stood leaning his head upon his hand , and looking gloomily down at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 42]: At length I begged him , with all the earnestness I felt , to tell me what had occurred to cross him so unusually , and to let me sympathize with him , if I could not hope to advise him .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 21]: Before I had well concluded , he began to laugh -- fretfully at first , but soon with returning gaiety .
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 9]: ` Tut , it 's nothing , Daisy !
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 3]: nothing ! '
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 4]: he replied . '
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 18]: I told you at the inn in London , I am heavy company for myself , sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 19]: I have been a nightmare to myself , just now -- must have had one , I think .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 19]: At odd dull times , nursery tales come up into the memory , unrecognized for what they are .
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 36]: I believe I have been confounding myself with the bad boy who `` did n't care '' , and became food for lions -- a grander kind of going to the dogs , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 17]: What old women call the horrors , have been creeping over me from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 8]: I have been afraid of myself . '
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 33]: ` You are afraid of nothing else , I think , ' said I. ` Perhaps not , and yet may have enough to be afraid of too , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 5]: So it goes by !
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 49]: I am not about to be hipped again , David ; but I tell you , my good fellow , once more , that it would have been well for me -LRB- and for more than me -RRB- if I had had a steadfast and judicious father ! '
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 35]: His face was always full of expression , but I never saw it express such a dark kind of earnestness as when he said these words , with his glance bent on the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 7]: ` So much for that ! '
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 19]: he said , making as if he tossed something light into the air , with his hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 16]: ` Why , being gone , I am a man again , '' like Macbeth .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 5]: And now for dinner !
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 19]: If I have not -LRB- Macbeth-like -RRB- broken up the feast with most admired disorder , Daisy . '
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 11]: ` But where are they all , I wonder ! '
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 10]: said I. ` God knows , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 20]: ` After strolling to the ferry looking for you , I strolled in here and found the place deserted .
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 12]: That set me thinking , and you found me thinking . '
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 19]: The advent of Mrs. Gummidge with a basket , explained how the house had happened to be empty .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 54]: She had hurried out to buy something that was needed , against Mr. Peggotty 's return with the tide ; and had left the door open in the meanwhile , lest Ham and little Em ` ly , with whom it was an early night , should come home while she was gone .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 28]: Steerforth , after very much improving Mrs. Gummidge 's spirits by a cheerful salutation and a jocose embrace , took my arm , and hurried me away .
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 35]: He had improved his own spirits , no less than Mrs. Gummidge 's , for they were again at their usual flow , and he was full of vivacious conversation as we went along .
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 22]: ` And so , ' he said , gaily , ` we abandon this buccaneer life tomorrow , do we ? '
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 9]: ` So we agreed , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 14]: ` And our places by the coach are taken , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 3]: ` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 15]: there 's no help for it , I suppose , ' said Steerforth . '
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 23]: I have almost forgotten that there is anything to do in the world but to go out tossing on the sea here .
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 7]: I wish there was not . '
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 15]: ` As long as the novelty should last , ' said I , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 29]: ` Like enough , ' he returned ; ` though there 's a sarcastic meaning in that observation for an amiable piece of innocence like my young friend .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 11]: I dare say I am a capricious fellow , David .
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 19]: I know I am ; but while the iron is hot , I can strike it vigorously too .
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 20]: I could pass a reasonably good examination already , as a pilot in these waters , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 14]: ` Mr. Peggotty says you are a wonder , ' I returned . '
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 7]: A nautical phenomenon , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 3]: laughed Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 31]: ` Indeed he does , and you know how truly ; I know how ardent you are in any pursuit you follow , and how easily you can master it .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 24]: And that amazes me most in you , Steerforth - that you should be contented with such fitful uses of your powers . '
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 4]: ` Contented ? '
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 6]: he answered , merrily . '
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 14]: I am never contented , except with your freshness , my gentle Daisy .
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 31]: As to fitfulness , I have never learnt the art of binding myself to any of the wheels on which the Ixions of these days are turning round and round .
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 17]: I missed it somehow in a bad apprenticeship , and now do n't care about it .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 12]: -- You know I have bought a boat down here ? '
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 11]: ` What an extraordinary fellow you are , Steerforth ! '
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 16]: I exclaimed , stopping -- for this was the first I had heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 15]: ` When you may never care to come near the place again ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 11]: I do n't know that , ' he returned . '
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 9]: I have taken a fancy to the place .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 46]: At all events , ' walking me briskly on , ' I have bought a boat that was for sale -- a clipper , Mr. Peggotty says ; and so she is -- and Mr. Peggotty will be master of her in my absence . '
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 9]: ` Now I understand you , Steerforth ! '
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 5]: said I , exultingly .
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 23]: ` You pretend to have bought it for yourself , but you have really done so to confer a benefit on him .
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 12]: I might have known as much at first , knowing you .
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 18]: My dear kind Steerforth , how can I tell you what I think of your generosity ? '
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 4]: ` Tush ! '
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 6]: he answered , turning red .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 9]: ` The less said , the better . '
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 7]: ` Did n't I know ? '
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 32]: cried I , ` did n't I say that there was not a joy , or sorrow , or any emotion of such honest hearts that was indifferent to you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 16]: ` Aye , aye , ' he answered , ` you told me all that .
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 5]: There let it rest .
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 6]: We have said enough ! '
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 35]: Afraid of offending him by pursuing the subject when he made so light of it , I only pursued it in my thoughts as we went on at even a quicker pace than before .
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 32]: ` She must be newly rigged , ' said Steerforth , ` and I shall leave Littimer behind to see it done , that I may know she is quite complete .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 11]: Did I tell you Littimer had come down ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 3]: No . '
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 4]: ` Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 13]: came down this morning , with a letter from my mother . '
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 24]: As our looks met , I observed that he was pale even to his lips , though he looked very steadily at me .
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 32]: I feared that some difference between him and his mother might have led to his being in the frame of mind in which I had found him at the solitary fireside .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 4]: I hinted so .
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 5]: ` Oh no ! '
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 13]: he said , shaking his head , and giving a slight laugh .
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 6]: ` Nothing of the sort !
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 11]: He is come down , that man of mine . '
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 7]: ` The same as ever ? '
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 12]: said I. ` The same as ever , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 9]: ` Distant and quiet as the North Pole .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 10]: He shall see to the boat being fresh named .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 9]: She 's the `` Stormy Petrel '' now .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 9]: What does Mr. Peggotty care for Stormy Petrels !
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 8]: I 'll have her christened again . '
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 6]: ` By what name ? '
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 10]: ` The `` Little Em ` ly '' . '
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 26]: As he had continued to look steadily at me , I took it as a reminder that he objected to being extolled for his consideration .
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 30]: I could not help showing in my face how much it pleased me , but I said little , and he resumed his usual smile , and seemed relieved .
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 23]: ` But see here , ' he said , looking before us , ` where the original little Em ` ly comes !
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 8]: And that fellow with her , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 10]: Upon my soul , he 's a true knight .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 6]: He never leaves her ! '
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 25]: Ham was a boat-builder in these days , having improved a natural ingenuity in that handicraft , until he had become a skilled workman .
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 29]: He was in his working-dress , and looked rugged enough , but manly withal , and a very fit protector for the blooming little creature at his side .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 41]: Indeed , there was a frankness in his face , an honesty , and an undisguised show of his pride in her , and his love for her , which were , to me , the best of good looks .
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 19]: I thought , as they came towards us , that they were well matched even in that particular .
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 28]: She withdrew her hand timidly from his arm as we stopped to speak to them , and blushed as she gave it to Steerforth and to me .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 34]: When they passed on , after we had exchanged a few words , she did not like to replace that hand , but , still appearing timid and constrained , walked by herself .
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 32]: I thought all this very pretty and engaging , and Steerforth seemed to think so too , as we looked after them fading away in the light of a young moon .
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 38]: Suddenly there passed us -- evidently following them -- a young woman whose approach we had not observed , but whose face I saw as she went by , and thought I had a faint remembrance of .
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 48]: She was lightly dressed ; looked bold , and haggard , and flaunting , and poor ; but seemed , for the time , to have given all that to the wind which was blowing , and to have nothing in her mind but going after them .
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 39]: As the dark distant level , absorbing their figures into itself , left but itself visible between us and the sea and clouds , her figure disappeared in like manner , still no nearer to them than before .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 26]: ` That is a black shadow to be following the girl , ' said Steerforth , standing still ; ` what does it mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 13]: He spoke in a low voice that sounded almost strange to Me .
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 48]: ` She must have it in her mind to beg of them , I think , ' said I. ' A beggar would be no novelty , ' said Steerforth ; ` but it is a strange thing that the beggar should take that shape tonight . '
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 4]: ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 33]: ` For no better reason , truly , than because I was thinking , ' he said , after a pause , ` of something like it , when it came by .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 12]: Where the Devil did it come from , I wonder ! '
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 27]: ` From the shadow of this wall , I think , ' said I , as we emerged upon a road on which a wall abutted .
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 6]: ` It 's gone ! '
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 8]: he returned , looking over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 8]: ` And all ill go with it .
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 6]: Now for our dinner ! '
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 18]: But he looked again over his shoulder towards the sea-line glimmering afar off , and yet again .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 47]: And he wondered about it , in some broken expressions , several times , in the short remainder of our walk ; and only seemed to forget it when the light of fire and candle shone upon us , seated warm and merry , at table .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 12]: Littimer was there , and had his usual effect upon me .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 42]: When I said to him that I hoped Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle were well , he answered respectfully -LRB- and of course respectably -RRB- , that they were tolerably well , he thanked me , and had sent their compliments .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 34]: This was all , and yet he seemed to me to say as plainly as a man could say : ` You are very young , sir ; you are exceedingly young . '
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 49]: We had almost finished dinner , when taking a step or two towards the table , from the corner where he kept watch upon us , or rather upon me , as I felt , he said to his master : ' I beg your pardon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 7]: Miss Mowcher is down here . '
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 4]: ` Who ? '
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 6]: cried Steerforth , much astonished .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 7]: ` Miss Mowcher , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 12]: ` Why , what on earth does she do here ? '
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 14]: ` It appears to be her native part of the country , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 18]: She informs me that she makes one of her professional visits here , every year , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 30]: I met her in the street this afternoon , and she wished to know if she might have the honour of waiting on you after dinner , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 12]: ` Do you know the Giantess in question , Daisy ? '
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 3]: inquired Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 28]: I was obliged to confess -- I felt ashamed , even of being at this disadvantage before Littimer -- that Miss Mowcher and I were wholly unacquainted .
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 24]: ` Then you shall know her , ' said Steerforth , ` for she is one of the seven wonders of the world .
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 10]: When Miss Mowcher comes , show her in . '
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 40]: I felt some curiosity and excitement about this lady , especially as Steerforth burst into a fit of laughing when I referred to her , and positively refused to answer any question of which I made her the subject .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 57]: I remained , therefore , in a state of considerable expectation until the cloth had been removed some half an hour , and we were sitting over our decanter of wine before the fire , when the door opened , and Littimer , with his habitual serenity quite undisturbed , announced : ` Miss Mowcher ! '
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 9]: I looked at the doorway and saw nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 107]: I was still looking at the doorway , thinking that Miss Mowcher was a long while making her appearance , when , to my infinite astonishment , there came waddling round a sofa which stood between me and it , a pursy dwarf , of about forty or forty-five , with a very large head and face , a pair of roguish grey eyes , and such extremely little arms , that , to enable herself to lay a finger archly against her snub nose , as she ogled Steerforth , she was obliged to meet the finger half-way , and lay her nose against it .
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 30]: Her chin , which was what is called a double chin , was so fat that it entirely swallowed up the strings of her bonnet , bow and all .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 82]: Throat she had none ; waist she had none ; legs she had none , worth mentioning ; for though she was more than full-sized down to where her waist would have been , if she had had any , and though she terminated , as human beings generally do , in a pair of feet , she was so short that she stood at a common-sized chair as at a table , resting a bag she carried on the seat .
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 67]: This lady -- dressed in an off-hand , easy style ; bringing her nose and her forefinger together , with the difficulty I have described ; standing with her head necessarily on one side , and , with one of her sharp eyes shut up , making an uncommonly knowing face -- after ogling Steerforth for a few moments , broke into a torrent of words .
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 4]: My flower ! '
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 11]: she pleasantly began , shaking her large head at him .
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 8]: ` You 're there , are you !
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 20]: Oh , you naughty boy , fie for shame , what do you do so far away from home ?
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 9]: Up to mischief , I 'll be bound .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 23]: Oh , you 're a downy fellow , Steerforth , so you are , and I 'm another , ai n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 25]: You 'd have betted a hundred pound to five , now , that you would n't have seen me here , would n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 10]: Bless you , man alive , I 'm everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 21]: I 'm here and there , and where not , like the conjurer 's half-crown in the lady 's handkercher .
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 41]: Talking of handkerchers -- and talking of ladies -- what a comfort you are to your blessed mother , ai n't you , my dear boy , over one of my shoulders , and I do n't say which ! '
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 52]: Miss Mowcher untied her bonnet , at this passage of her discourse , threw back the strings , and sat down , panting , on a footstool in front of the fire -- making a kind of arbour of the dining table , which spread its mahogany shelter above her head .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 11]: ` Oh my stars and what 's - their-names ! '
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 36]: she went on , clapping a hand on each of her little knees , and glancing shrewdly at me , ` I 'm of too full a habit , that 's the fact , Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 28]: After a flight of stairs , it gives me as much trouble to draw every breath I want , as if it was a bucket of water .
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 26]: If you saw me looking out of an upper window , you 'd think I was a fine woman , would n't you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 14]: I should think that , wherever I saw you , ' replied Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 10]: ` Go along , you dog , do ! '
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 28]: cried the little creature , making a whisk at him with the handkerchief with which she was wiping her face , ` and do n't be impudent !
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 22]: But I give you my word and honour I was at Lady Mithers 's last week -- THERE 'S a woman !
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 4]: How SHE wears !
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 20]: -- and Mithers himself came into the room where I was waiting for her -- THERE 'S a man !
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 4]: How HE wears !
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 40]: and his wig too , for he 's had it these ten years -- and he went on at that rate in the complimentary line , that I began to think I should be obliged to ring the bell .
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 12]: He 's a pleasant wretch , but he wants principle . '
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 10]: ` What were you doing for Lady Mithers ? '
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 3]: asked Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 34]: ` That 's tellings , my blessed infant , ' she retorted , tapping her nose again , screwing up her face , and twinkling her eyes like an imp of supernatural intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 5]: ` Never YOU mind !
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 33]: You 'd like to know whether I stop her hair from falling off , or dye it , or touch up her complexion , or improve her eyebrows , would n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 13]: And so you shall , my darling -- when I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 12]: Do you know what my great grandfather 's name was ? '
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 7]: ` No , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 35]: ` It was Walker , my sweet pet , ' replied Miss Mowcher , ` and he came of a long line of Walkers , that I inherit all the Hookey estates from . '
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 16]: I never beheld anything approaching to Miss Mowcher 's wink except Miss Mowcher 's self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 49]: She had a wonderful way too , when listening to what was said to her , or when waiting for an answer to what she had said herself , of pausing with her head cunningly on one side , and one eye turned up like a magpie 's .
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 26]: Altogether I was lost in amazement , and sat staring at her , quite oblivious , I am afraid , of the laws of politeness .
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 70]: She had by this time drawn the chair to her side , and was busily engaged in producing from the bag -LRB- plunging in her short arm to the shoulder , at every dive -RRB- a number of small bottles , sponges , combs , brushes , bits of flannel , little pairs of curling-irons , and other instruments , which she tumbled in a heap upon the chair .
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 24]: From this employment she suddenly desisted , and said to Steerforth , much to my confusion : ` Who 's your friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 16]: ` Mr. Copperfield , ' said Steerforth ; ` he wants to know you . '
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 8]: ` Well , then , he shall !
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 10]: I thought he looked as if he did ! '
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 21]: returned Miss Mowcher , waddling up to me , bag in hand , and laughing on me as she came .
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 7]: ` Face like a peach ! '
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 11]: standing on tiptoe to pinch my cheek as I sat .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 4]: ` Quite tempting !
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 7]: I 'm very fond of peaches .
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 14]: Happy to make your acquaintance , Mr. Copperfield , I 'm sure . '
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 21]: I said that I congratulated myself on having the honour to make hers , and that the happiness was mutual .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 12]: ` Oh , my goodness , how polite we are ! '
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 20]: exclaimed Miss Mowcher , making a preposterous attempt to cover her large face with her morsel of a hand .
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 18]: ` What a world of gammon and spinnage it is , though , ai n't it ! '
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 34]: This was addressed confidentially to both of us , as the morsel of a hand came away from the face , and buried itself , arm and all , in the bag again .
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 10]: ` What do you mean , Miss Mowcher ? '
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 22]: What a refreshing set of humbugs we are , to be sure , ai n't we , my sweet child ? '
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 24]: replied that morsel of a woman , feeling in the bag with her head on one side and her eye in the air .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 5]: ` Look here ! '
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 4]: taking something out .
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 9]: ` Scraps of the Russian Prince 's nails .
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 23]: Prince Alphabet turned topsy-turvy , I call him , for his name 's got all the letters in it , higgledy-piggledy . '
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 14]: ` The Russian Prince is a client of yours , is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 4]: said Steerforth . '
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 13]: I believe you , my pet , ' replied Miss Mowcher . '
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 9]: I keep his nails in order for him .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 4]: Twice a week !
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 5]: Fingers and toes . '
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 9]: ` He pays well , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 20]: ` Pays , as he speaks , my dear child -- through the nose , ' replied Miss Mowcher .
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 11]: ` None of your close shavers the Prince ai n't .
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 11]: You 'd say so , if you saw his moustachios .
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 9]: Red by nature , black by art . '
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 12]: ` By your art , of course , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 5]: Miss Mowcher winked assent .
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 7]: ` Forced to send for me .
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 5]: Could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 20]: The climate affected his dye ; it did very well in Russia , but it was no go here .
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 16]: You never saw such a rusty Prince in all your born days as he was .
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 5]: Like old iron ! '
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 14]: ` Is that why you called him a humbug , just now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 3]: inquired Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 16]: ` Oh , you 're a broth of a boy , ai n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 10]: returned Miss Mowcher , shaking her head violently . '
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 28]: I said , what a set of humbugs we were in general , and I showed you the scraps of the Prince 's nails to prove it .
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 23]: The Prince 's nails do more for me in private families of the genteel sort , than all my talents put together .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 6]: I always carry 'em about .
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 6]: They 're the best introduction .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 15]: If Miss Mowcher cuts the Prince 's nails , she must be all right .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 9]: I give 'em away to the young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 9]: They put 'em in albums , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 32]: Upon my life , `` the whole social system '' -LRB- as the men call it when they make speeches in Parliament -RRB- is a system of Prince 's nails ! '
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 19]: said this least of women , trying to fold her short arms , and nodding her large head .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 9]: Steerforth laughed heartily , and I laughed too .
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 37]: Miss Mowcher continuing all the time to shake her head -LRB- which was very much on one side -RRB- , and to look into the air with one eye , and to wink with the other .
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 6]: ` Well , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 17]: she said , smiting her small knees , and rising , ` this is not business .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 17]: Come , Steerforth , let 's explore the polar regions , and have it over . '
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 29]: She then selected two or three of the little instruments , and a little bottle , and asked -LRB- to my surprise -RRB- if the table would bear .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 40]: On Steerforth 's replying in the affirmative , she pushed a chair against it , and begging the assistance of my hand , mounted up , pretty nimbly , to the top , as if it were a stage .
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 34]: ` If either of you saw my ankles , ' she said , when she was safely elevated , ` say so , and I 'll go home and destroy myself ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 9]: I did not , ' said Steerforth . '
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 23]: I did not , ' said I. ` Well then , ' cried Miss Mowcher , ' I 'll consent to live .
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 17]: Now , ducky , ducky , ducky , come to Mrs. Bond and be killed . '
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 52]: This was an invocation to Steerforth to place himself under her hands ; who , accordingly , sat himself down , with his back to the table , and his laughing face towards me , and submitted his head to her inspection , evidently for no other purpose than our entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 37]: To see Miss Mowcher standing over him , looking at his rich profusion of brown hair through a large round magnifying glass , which she took out of her pocket , was a most amazing spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 8]: ` You 're a pretty fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 9]: said Miss Mowcher , after a brief inspection .
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 23]: ` You 'd be as bald as a friar on the top of your head in twelve months , but for me .
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 29]: just half a minute , my young friend , and we 'll give you a polishing that shall keep your curls on for the next ten years ! '
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 68]: With this , she tilted some of the contents of the little bottle on to one of the little bits of flannel , and , again imparting some of the virtues of that preparation to one of the little brushes , began rubbing and scraping away with both on the crown of Steerforth 's head in the busiest manner I ever witnessed , talking all the time .
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 15]: ` There 's Charley Pyegrave , the duke 's son , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 6]: ` You know Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 7]: peeping round into his face . '
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 7]: A little , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 7]: ` What a man HE is !
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 5]: THERE 'S a whisker !
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 24]: As to Charley 's legs , if they were only a pair -LRB- which they ai n't -RRB- , they 'd defy competition .
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 17]: Would you believe he tried to do without me -- in the Life-Guards , too ? '
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 4]: ` Mad ! '
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 6]: ` It looks like it .
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 14]: However , mad or sane , he tried , ' returned Miss Mowcher .
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 33]: ` What does he do , but , lo and behold you , he goes into a perfumer 's shop , and wants to buy a bottle of the Madagascar Liquid . '
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 5]: ` Charley does ? '
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 4]: ` Charley does .
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 12]: But they have n't got any of the Madagascar Liquid . '
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 5]: ` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 5]: Something to drink ? '
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 3]: asked Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 5]: ` To drink ? '
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 10]: returned Miss Mowcher , stopping to slap his cheek .
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 11]: ` To doctor his own moustachios with , you know .
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 25]: There was a woman in the shop -- elderly female -- quite a Griffin -- who had never even heard of it by name .
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 27]: `` Begging pardon , sir , '' said the Griffin to Charley , `` it 's not -- not -- not ROUGE , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 10]: `` Rouge , '' said Charley to the Griffin .
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 17]: `` What the unmentionable to ears polite , do you think I want with rouge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 29]: `` No offence , sir , '' said the Griffin ; `` we have it asked for by so many names , I thought it might be . ''
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 33]: Now that , my child , ' continued Miss Mowcher , rubbing all the time as busily as ever , ` is another instance of the refreshing humbug I was speaking of .
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 30]: I do something in that way myself -- perhaps a good deal -- perhaps a little -- sharp 's the word , my dear boy -- never mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 8]: ` In what way do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 6]: In the rouge way ? '
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 43]: ` Put this and that together , my tender pupil , ' returned the wary Mowcher , touching her nose , ` work it by the rule of Secrets in all trades , and the product will give you the desired result .
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 11]: I say I do a little in that way myself .
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 8]: One Dowager , SHE calls it lip-salve .
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 7]: Another , SHE calls it gloves .
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 7]: Another , SHE calls it tucker-edging .
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 8]: Another , SHE calls it a fan .
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 8]: I call it whatever THEY call it .
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 46]: I supply it for 'em , but we keep up the trick so , to one another , and make believe with such a face , that they 'd as soon think of laying it on , before a whole drawing-room , as before me .
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 32]: And when I wait upon 'em , they 'll say to me sometimes -- WITH IT ON - thick , and no mistake -- `` How am I looking , Mowcher ?
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 5]: Am I pale ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 10]: Is n't THAT refreshing , my young friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 37]: I never did in my days behold anything like Mowcher as she stood upon the dining table , intensely enjoying this refreshment , rubbing busily at Steerforth 's head , and winking at me over it .
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 10]: ` Such things are not much in demand hereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 6]: That sets me off again !
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 16]: I have n't seen a pretty woman since I 've been here , jemmy . '
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 4]: ` No ? '
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 12]: ` Not the ghost of one , ' replied Miss Mowcher .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 14]: ` We could show her the substance of one , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 9]: said Steerforth , addressing his eyes to mine .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 6]: ` Eh , Daisy ? '
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 12]: ` Yes , indeed , ' said I. ` Aha ? '
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 19]: cried the little creature , glancing sharply at my face , and then peeping round at Steerforth 's .
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 4]: ` Umph ? '
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 24]: The first exclamation sounded like a question put to both of us , and the second like a question put to Steerforth only .
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 47]: She seemed to have found no answer to either , but continued to rub , with her head on one side and her eye turned up , as if she were looking for an answer in the air and were confident of its appearing presently . '
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 9]: A sister of yours , Mr. Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 14]: she cried , after a pause , and still keeping the same look-out .
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 6]: ` Aye , aye ? '
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 12]: ` No , ' said Steerforth , before I could reply .
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 6]: ` Nothing of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 23]: On the contrary , Mr. Copperfield used -- or I am much mistaken -- to have a great admiration for her . '
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 9]: ` Why , has n't he now ? '
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 4]: returned Miss Mowcher .
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 5]: ` Is he fickle ?
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 5]: Oh , for shame !
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 17]: Did he sip every flower , and change every hour , until Polly his passion requited ?
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 7]: -- Is her name Polly ? '
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 25]: The Elfin suddenness with which she pounced upon me with this question , and a searching look , quite disconcerted me for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 10]: ` No , Miss Mowcher , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 7]: ` Her name is Emily . '
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 4]: ` Aha ? '
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 6]: she cried exactly as before .
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 3]: ` Umph ?
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 6]: What a rattle I am !
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 9]: Mr. Copperfield , ai n't I volatile ? '
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 18]: Her tone and look implied something that was not agreeable to me in connexion with the subject .
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 26]: So I said , in a graver manner than any of us had yet assumed : ` She is as virtuous as she is pretty .
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 20]: She is engaged to be married to a most worthy and deserving man in her own station of life .
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 20]: I esteem her for her good sense , as much as I admire her for her good looks . '
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 5]: ` Well said ! '
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 3]: cried Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 7]: ` Hear , hear , hear !
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 23]: Now I 'll quench the curiosity of this little Fatima , my dear Daisy , by leaving her nothing to guess at .
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 35]: She is at present apprenticed , Miss Mowcher , or articled , or whatever it may be , to Omer and Joram , Haberdashers , Milliners , and so forth , in this town .
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 4]: Do you observe ?
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 4]: Omer and Joram .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 36]: The promise of which my friend has spoken , is made and entered into with her cousin ; Christian name , Ham ; surname , Peggotty ; occupation , boat-builder ; also of this town .
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 24]: She lives with a relative ; Christian name , unknown ; surname , Peggotty ; occupation , seafaring ; also of this town .
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 13]: She is the prettiest and most engaging little fairy in the world .
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 11]: I admire her -- as my friend does -- exceedingly .
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 59]: If it were not that I might appear to disparage her Intended , which I know my friend would not like , I would add , that to me she seems to be throwing herself away ; that I am sure she might do better ; and that I swear she was born to be a lady . '
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 38]: Miss Mowcher listened to these words , which were very slowly and distinctly spoken , with her head on one side , and her eye in the air as if she were still looking for that answer .
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 18]: When he ceased she became brisk again in an instant , and rattled away with surprising volubility .
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 11]: And that 's all about it , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 24]: she exclaimed , trimming his whiskers with a little restless pair of scissors , that went glancing round his head in all directions .
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 7]: ` Very well : very well !
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 5]: Quite a long story .
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 16]: Ought to end `` and they lived happy ever afterwards '' ; ought n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 7]: What 's that game at forfeits ?
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 25]: I love my love with an E , because she 's enticing ; I hate her with an E , because she 's engaged .
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 29]: I took her to the sign of the exquisite , and treated her with an elopement , her name 's Emily , and she lives in the east ?
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 9]: Mr. Copperfield , ai n't I volatile ? '
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 25]: Merely looking at me with extravagant slyness , and not waiting for any reply , she continued , without drawing breath : ` There !
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 17]: If ever any scapegrace was trimmed and touched up to perfection , you are , Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 13]: If I understand any noddle in the world , I understand yours .
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 13]: Do you hear me when I tell you that , my darling ?
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 11]: I understand yours , ' peeping down into his face .
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 30]: ` Now you may mizzle , jemmy -LRB- as we say at Court -RRB- , and if Mr. Copperfield will take the chair I 'll operate on him . '
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 9]: ` What do you say , Daisy ? '
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 10]: inquired Steerforth , laughing , and resigning his seat .
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 7]: ` Will you be improved ? '
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 12]: ` Thank you , Miss Mowcher , not this evening . '
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 30]: ` Do n't say no , ' returned the little woman , looking at me with the aspect of a connoisseur ; ' a little bit more eyebrow ? '
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 14]: ` Thank you , ' I returned , ` some other time . '
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 19]: ` Have it carried half a quarter of an inch towards the temple , ' said Miss Mowcher .
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 10]: ` We can do it in a fortnight . '
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 7]: ` No , I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 5]: Not at present . '
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 11]: ` Go in for a tip , ' she urged .
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 3]: ` No ?
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 15]: Let 's get the scaffolding up , then , for a pair of whiskers .
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 21]: I could not help blushing as I declined , for I felt we were on my weak point , now .
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 77]: But Miss Mowcher , finding that I was not at present disposed for any decoration within the range of her art , and that I was , for the time being , proof against the blandishments of the small bottle which she held up before one eye to enforce her persuasions , said we would make a beginning on an early day , and requested the aid of my hand to descend from her elevated station .
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 21]: Thus assisted , she skipped down with much agility , and began to tie her double chin into her bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 29]: ` The fee , ' said Steerforth , ` is -- ' ` Five bob , ' replied Miss Mowcher , ` and dirt cheap , my chicken .
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 9]: Ai n't I volatile , Mr. Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 10]: I replied politely : ` Not at all . '
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 36]: But I thought she was rather so , when she tossed up his two half-crowns like a goblin pieman , caught them , dropped them in her pocket , and gave it a loud slap .
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 7]: ` That 's the Till ! '
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 28]: observed Miss Mowcher , standing at the chair again , and replacing in the bag a miscellaneous collection of little objects she had emptied out of it .
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 8]: ` Have I got all my traps ?
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 4]: It seems so .
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 35]: It wo n't do to be like long Ned Beadwood , when they took him to church `` to marry him to somebody '' , as he says , and left the bride behind .
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 9]: A wicked rascal , Ned , but droll !
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 20]: Now , I know I 'm going to break your hearts , but I am forced to leave you .
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 14]: You must call up all your fortitude , and try to bear it .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 5]: Good-bye , Mr. Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 9]: Take care of yourself , jockey of Norfolk !
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 7]: How I have been rattling on !
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 10]: It 's all the fault of you two wretches .
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 4]: I forgive you !
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 5]: `` Bob swore ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 24]: -- as the Englishman said for `` Good night '' , when he first learnt French , and thought it so like English .
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 9]: `` Bob swore , '' my ducks ! '
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 37]: With the bag slung over her arm , and rattling as she waddled away , she waddled to the door , where she stopped to inquire if she should leave us a lock of her hair .
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 7]: ` Ai n't I volatile ? '
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 21]: she added , as a commentary on this offer , and , with her finger on her nose , departed .
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 33]: Steerforth laughed to that degree , that it was impossible for me to help laughing too ; though I am not sure I should have done so , but for this inducement .
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 42]: When we had had our laugh quite out , which was after some time , he told me that Miss Mowcher had quite an extensive connexion , and made herself useful to a variety of people in a variety of ways .
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 34]: Some people trifled with her as a mere oddity , he said ; but she was as shrewdly and sharply observant as anyone he knew , and as long-headed as she was short-armed .
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 44]: He told me that what she had said of being here , and there , and everywhere , was true enough ; for she made little darts into the provinces , and seemed to pick up customers everywhere , and to know everybody .
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 53]: I asked him what her disposition was : whether it was at all mischievous , and if her sympathies were generally on the right side of things : but , not succeeding in attracting his attention to these questions after two or three attempts , I forbore or forgot to repeat them .
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 41]: He told me instead , with much rapidity , a good deal about her skill , and her profits ; and about her being a scientific cupper , if I should ever have occasion for her service in that capacity .
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 32]: She was the principal theme of our conversation during the evening : and when we parted for the night Steerforth called after me over the banisters , ` Bob swore ! '
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 5]: as I went downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 41]: I was surprised , when I came to Mr. Barkis 's house , to find Ham walking up and down in front of it , and still more surprised to learn from him that little Em ` ly was inside .
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 18]: I naturally inquired why he was not there too , instead of pacing the streets by himself ?
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 36]: ` Why , you see , Mas ' r Davy , ' he rejoined , in a hesitating manner , 'Em ` ly , she 's talking to some ` un in here . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 27]: I should have thought , ' said I , smiling , ` that that was a reason for your being in here too , Ham . '
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 45]: ` Well , Mas ' r Davy , in a general way , so ' t would be , ' he returned ; ` but look ` ee here , Mas ' r Davy , ' lowering his voice , and speaking very gravely .
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 30]: ` It 's a young woman , sir -- a young woman , that Em ` ly knowed once , and doe n't ought to know no more . '
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 24]: When I heard these words , a light began to fall upon the figure I had seen following them , some hours ago .
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 27]: ` It 's a poor wurem , Mas ' r Davy , ' said Ham , ` as is trod under foot by all the town .
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 6]: Up street and down street .
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 20]: The mowld o ' the churchyard do n't hold any that the folk shrink away from , more . '
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 19]: ` Did I see her tonight , Ham , on the sand , after we met you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 7]: ` Keeping us in sight ? '
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 3]: said Ham .
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 12]: ` It 's like you did , Mas ' r Davy .
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 59]: Not that I know 'd then , she was theer , sir , but along of her creeping soon arterwards under Em ` ly 's little winder , when she see the light come , and whispering `` Em ` ly , Em ` ly , for Christ 's sake , have a woman 's heart towards me .
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 7]: I was once like you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 15]: Those was solemn words , Mas ' r Davy , fur to hear ! '
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 7]: ` They were indeed , Ham .
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 8]: What did Em ` ly do ? '
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 13]: ` Says Em ` ly , `` Martha , is it you ?
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 10]: Oh , Martha , can it be you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 20]: -- for they had sat at work together , many a day , at Mr. Omer 's . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 6]: I recollect her now ! '
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 19]: cried I , recalling one of the two girls I had seen when I first went there . '
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 7]: I recollect her quite well ! '
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 8]: ` Martha Endell , ' said Ham .
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 21]: ` Two or three year older than Em ` ly , but was at the school with her . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 19]: I never heard her name , ' said I. ' I did n't mean to interrupt you . '
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 50]: ` For the matter o ' that , Mas ' r Davy , ' replied Ham , ` all 's told a ` most in them words , `` Em ` ly , Em ` ly , for Christ 's sake , have a woman 's heart towards me .
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 7]: I was once like you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 9]: She wanted to speak to Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 72]: Em ` ly could n't speak to her theer , for her loving uncle was come home , and he would n't -- no , Mas ' r Davy , ' said Ham , with great earnestness , ` he could n't , kind-natur 'd , tender-hearted as he is , see them two together , side by side , for all the treasures that 's wrecked in the sea . '
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 7]: I felt how true this was .
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 14]: I knew it , on the instant , quite as well as Ham .
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 32]: ` So Em ` ly writes in pencil on a bit of paper , ' he pursued , ` and gives it to her out o ' winder to bring here .
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 44]: `` Show that , '' she says , `` to my aunt , Mrs. Barkis , and she 'll set you down by her fire , for the love of me , till uncle is gone out , and I can come . ''
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 23]: By and by she tells me what I tell you , Mas ' r Davy , and asks me to bring her .
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 5]: What can I do ?
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 25]: She doe n't ought to know any such , but I ca n't deny her , when the tears is on her face . '
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 23]: He put his hand into the breast of his shaggy jacket , and took out with great care a pretty little purse .
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 58]: ` And if I could deny her when the tears was on her face , Mas ' r Davy , ' said Ham , tenderly adjusting it on the rough palm of his hand , ` how could I deny her when she give me this to carry for her - knowing what she brought it for ?
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 8]: Such a toy as it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 8]: said Ham , thoughtfully looking on it .
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 16]: ` With such a little money in it , Em ` ly my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 42]: I shook him warmly by the hand when he had put it away again -- for that was more satisfactory to me than saying anything -- and we walked up and down , for a minute or two , in silence .
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 16]: The door opened then , and Peggotty appeared , beckoning to Ham to come in .
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 19]: I would have kept away , but she came after me , entreating me to come in too .
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 28]: Even then , I would have avoided the room where they all were , but for its being the neat-tiled kitchen I have mentioned more than once .
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 20]: The door opening immediately into it , I found myself among them before I considered whither I was going .
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 17]: The girl -- the same I had seen upon the sands -- was near the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 18]: She was sitting on the ground , with her head and one arm lying on a chair .
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 36]: I fancied , from the disposition of her figure , that Em ` ly had but newly risen from the chair , and that the forlorn head might perhaps have been lying on her lap .
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 45]: I saw but little of the girl 's face , over which her hair fell loose and scattered , as if she had been disordering it with her own hands ; but I saw that she was young , and of a fair complexion .
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 5]: Peggotty had been crying .
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 7]: So had little Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 32]: Not a word was spoken when we first went in ; and the Dutch clock by the dresser seemed , in the silence , to tick twice as loud as usual .
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 6]: Em ` ly spoke first .
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 17]: ` Martha wants , ' she said to Ham , ` to go to London . '
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 6]: ` Why to London ? '
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 3]: returned Ham .
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 41]: He stood between them , looking on the prostrate girl with a mixture of compassion for her , and of jealousy of her holding any companionship with her whom he loved so well , which I have always remembered distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 28]: They both spoke as if she were ill ; in a soft , suppressed tone that was plainly heard , although it hardly rose above a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 22]: ` Better there than here , ' said a third voice aloud -- Martha 's , though she did not move .
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 7]: ` No one knows me there .
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 6]: Everybody knows me here . '
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 8]: ` What will she do there ? '
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 3]: inquired Ham .
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 52]: She lifted up her head , and looked darkly round at him for a moment ; then laid it down again , and curved her right arm about her neck , as a woman in a fever , or in an agony of pain from a shot , might twist herself .
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 15]: ` She will try to do well , ' said little Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 12]: ` You do n't know what she has said to us .
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 9]: Does he -- do they -- aunt ? '
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 6]: Peggotty shook her head compassionately .
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 17]: ` I 'll try , ' said Martha , ` if you 'll help me away .
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 11]: I never can do worse than I have done here .
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 5]: I may do better .
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 3]: Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 24]: with a dreadful shiver , ` take me out of these streets , where the whole town knows me from a child ! '
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 22]: As Em ` ly held out her hand to Ham , I saw him put in it a little canvas bag .
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 42]: She took it , as if she thought it were her purse , and made a step or two forward ; but finding her mistake , came back to where he had retired near me , and showed it to him .
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 18]: ` It 's all yourn , Em ` ly , ' I could hear him say . '
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 16]: I have n't nowt in all the wureld that ai n't yourn , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 14]: It ai n't of no delight to me , except for you ! '
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 17]: The tears rose freshly in her eyes , but she turned away and went to Martha .
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 10]: What she gave her , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 14]: I saw her stooping over her , and putting money in her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 11]: She whispered something , as she asked was that enough ?
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 18]: ` More than enough , ' the other said , and took her hand and kissed it .
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 27]: Then Martha arose , and gathering her shawl about her , covering her face with it , and weeping aloud , went slowly to the door .
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 26]: She stopped a moment before going out , as if she would have uttered something or turned back ; but no word passed her lips .
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 17]: Making the same low , dreary , wretched moaning in her shawl , she went away .
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 31]: As the door closed , little Em ` ly looked at us three in a hurried manner and then hid her face in her hands , and fell to sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 9]: ` Doe n't , Em ` ly ! '
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 10]: said Ham , tapping her gently on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 7]: ` Doe n't , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 11]: You doe n't ought to cry so , pretty ! '
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 6]: ` Oh , Ham ! '
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 21]: she exclaimed , still weeping pitifully , ' I am not so good a girl as I ought to be !
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 17]: I know I have not the thankful heart , sometimes , I ought to have ! '
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 16]: ` Yes , yes , you have , I 'm sure , ' said Ham .
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 2]: no !
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 3]: no ! '
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 14]: cried little Em ` ly , sobbing , and shaking her head . '
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 13]: I am not as good a girl as I ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 3]: Not near !
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 4]: not near ! '
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 13]: And still she cried , as if her heart would break . '
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 7]: I try your love too much .
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 6]: I know I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 21]: ` I 'm often cross to you , and changeable with you , when I ought to be far different .
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 7]: You are never so to me .
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 27]: Why am I ever so to you , when I should think of nothing but how to be grateful , and to make you happy ! '
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 15]: ` You always make me so , ' said Ham , ` my dear !
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 9]: I am happy in the sight of you .
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 15]: I am happy , all day long , in the thoughts of you . '
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 6]: that 's not enough ! '
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 13]: ` That is because you are good ; not because I am !
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 50]: Oh , my dear , it might have been a better fortune for you , if you had been fond of someone else -- of someone steadier and much worthier than me , who was all bound up in you , and never vain and changeable like me ! '
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 14]: ` Poor little tender-heart , ' said Ham , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 9]: ` Martha has overset her , altogether . '
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 24]: ` Please , aunt , ' sobbed Em ` ly , ` come here , and let me lay my head upon you .
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 10]: Oh , I am very miserable tonight , aunt !
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 15]: Oh , I am not as good a girl as I ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 8]: I am not , I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 10]: Peggotty had hastened to the chair before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 23]: Em ` ly , with her arms around her neck , kneeled by her , looking up most earnestly into her face .
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 12]: ` Oh , pray , aunt , try to help me !
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 9]: Ham , dear , try to help me !
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 19]: Mr. David , for the sake of old times , do , please , try to help me !
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 11]: I want to be a better girl than I am .
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 13]: I want to feel a hundred times more thankful than I do .
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 28]: I want to feel more , what a blessed thing it is to be the wife of a good man , and to lead a peaceful life .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 6]: Oh me , oh me !
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 8]: Oh my heart , my heart ! '
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 81]: She dropped her face on my old nurse 's breast , and , ceasing this supplication , which in its agony and grief was half a woman 's , half a child 's , as all her manner was -LRB- being , in that , more natural , and better suited to her beauty , as I thought , than any other manner could have been -RRB- , wept silently , while my old nurse hushed her like an infant .
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 36]: She got calmer by degrees , and then we soothed her ; now talking encouragingly , and now jesting a little with her , until she began to raise her head and speak to us .
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 61]: So we got on , until she was able to smile , and then to laugh , and then to sit up , half ashamed ; while Peggotty recalled her stray ringlets , dried her eyes , and made her neat again , lest her uncle should wonder , when she got home , why his darling had been crying .
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 17]: I saw her do , that night , what I had never seen her do before .
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 27]: I saw her innocently kiss her chosen husband on the cheek , and creep close to his bluff form as if it were her best support .
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 46]: When they went away together , in the waning moonlight , and I looked after them , comparing their departure in my mind with Martha 's , I saw that she held his arm with both her hands , and still kept close to him .
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 38]: Chapter 23 I Corroborate Mr. Dick , and Choose a Profession When I awoke in the morning I thought very much of little Em ` ly , and her emotion last night , after Martha had left .
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 35]: I felt as if I had come into the knowledge of those domestic weaknesses and tendernesses in a sacred confidence , and that to disclose them , even to Steerforth , would be wrong .
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 42]: I had no gentler feeling towards anyone than towards the pretty creature who had been my playmate , and whom I have always been persuaded , and shall always be persuaded , to my dying day , I then devotedly loved .
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 59]: The repetition to any ears -- even to Steerforth 's -- of what she had been unable to repress when her heart lay open to me by an accident , I felt would be a rough deed , unworthy of myself , unworthy of the light of our pure childhood , which I always saw encircling her head .
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 25]: I made a resolution , therefore , to keep it in my own breast ; and there it gave her image a new grace .
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 16]: While we were at breakfast , a letter was delivered to me from my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 44]: As it contained matter on which I thought Steerforth could advise me as well as anyone , and on which I knew I should be delighted to consult him , I resolved to make it a subject of discussion on our journey home .
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 17]: For the present we had enough to do , in taking leave of all our friends .
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 45]: Mr. Barkis was far from being the last among them , in his regret at our departure ; and I believe would even have opened the box again , and sacrificed another guinea , if it would have kept us eight-and-forty hours in Yarmouth .
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 13]: Peggotty and all her family were full of grief at our going .
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 57]: The whole house of Omer and Joram turned out to bid us good-bye ; and there were so many seafaring volunteers in attendance on Steerforth , when our portmanteaux went to the coach , that if we had had the baggage of a regiment with us , we should hardly have wanted porters to carry it .
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 26]: In a word , we departed to the regret and admiration of all concerned , and left a great many people very sorry behind US .
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 9]: Do you stay long here , Littimer ? '
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 13]: said I , as he stood waiting to see the coach start .
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 18]: ` No , sir , ' he replied ; ` probably not very long , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 15]: ` He can hardly say , just now , ' observed Steerforth , carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 16]: ` He knows what he has to do , and he 'll do it . '
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 30]: ` That I am sure he will , ' said I. Littimer touched his hat in acknowledgement of my good opinion , and I felt about eight years old .
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 31]: He touched it once more , wishing us a good journey ; and we left him standing on the pavement , as respectable a mystery as any pyramid in Egypt .
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 48]: For some little time we held no conversation , Steerforth being unusually silent , and I being sufficiently engaged in wondering , within myself , when I should see the old places again , and what new changes might happen to me or them in the meanwhile .
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 36]: At length Steerforth , becoming gay and talkative in a moment , as he could become anything he liked at any moment , pulled me by the arm : ` Find a voice , David .
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 12]: What about that letter you were speaking of at breakfast ? '
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 10]: said I , taking it out of my pocket .
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 8]: ` It 's from my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 11]: ` And what does she say , requiring consideration ? '
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 33]: ` Why , she reminds me , Steerforth , ' said I , ` that I came out on this expedition to look about me , and to think a little . '
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 11]: ` Which , of course , you have done ? '
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 11]: ` Indeed I ca n't say I have , particularly .
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 15]: To tell you the truth , I am afraid I have forgotten it . '
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 16]: look about you now , and make up for your negligence , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 35]: ` Look to the right , and you 'll see a flat country , with a good deal of marsh in it ; look to the left , and you 'll see the same .
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 24]: Look to the front , and you 'll find no difference ; look to the rear , and there it is still . '
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 26]: I laughed , and replied that I saw no suitable profession in the whole prospect ; which was perhaps to be attributed to its flatness .
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 10]: ` What says our aunt on the subject ? '
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 11]: inquired Steerforth , glancing at the letter in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 7]: ` Does she suggest anything ? '
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 26]: ` Why , yes , ' said I. ` She asks me , here , if I think I should like to be a proctor ?
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 8]: What do you think of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 14]: ` Well , I do n't know , ' replied Steerforth , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 15]: ` You may as well do that as anything else , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 23]: I could not help laughing again , at his balancing all callings and professions so equally ; and I told him so .
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 9]: ` What is a proctor , Steerforth ? '
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 17]: said I. ` Why , he is a sort of monkish attorney , ' replied Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 36]: ` He is , to some faded courts held in Doctors ' Commons , -- a lazy old nook near St. Paul 's Churchyard -- what solicitors are to the courts of law and equity .
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 23]: He is a functionary whose existence , in the natural course of things , would have terminated about two hundred years ago .
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 18]: I can tell you best what he is , by telling you what Doctors ' Commons is .
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 63]: It 's a little out-of-the-way place , where they administer what is called ecclesiastical law , and play all kinds of tricks with obsolete old monsters of acts of Parliament , which three-fourths of the world know nothing about , and the other fourth supposes to have been dug up , in a fossil state , in the days of the Edwards .
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 28]: It 's a place that has an ancient monopoly in suits about people 's wills and people 's marriages , and disputes among ships and boats . '
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 6]: ` Nonsense , Steerforth ! '
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 3]: I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 21]: ` You do n't mean to say that there is any affinity between nautical matters and ecclesiastical matters ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 41]: I do n't , indeed , my dear boy , ' he returned ; ` but I mean to say that they are managed and decided by the same set of people , down in that same Doctors ' Commons .
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 115]: You shall go there one day , and find them blundering through half the nautical terms in Young 's Dictionary , apropos of the `` Nancy '' having run down the `` Sarah Jane '' , or Mr. Peggotty and the Yarmouth boatmen having put off in a gale of wind with an anchor and cable to the `` Nelson '' Indiaman in distress ; and you shall go there another day , and find them deep in the evidence , pro and con , respecting a clergyman who has misbehaved himself ; and you shall find the judge in the nautical case , the advocate in the clergyman 's case , or contrariwise .
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 65]: They are like actors : now a man 's a judge , and now he is not a judge ; now he 's one thing , now he 's another ; now he 's something else , change and change about ; but it 's always a very pleasant , profitable little affair of private theatricals , presented to an uncommonly select audience . '
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 13]: ` But advocates and proctors are not one and the same ? '
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 7]: said I , a little puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 5]: ` Are they ? '
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 36]: ` No , ' returned Steerforth , ` the advocates are civilians -- men who have taken a doctor 's degree at college -- which is the first reason of my knowing anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 6]: The proctors employ the advocates .
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 16]: Both get very comfortable fees , and altogether they make a mighty snug little party .
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 18]: On the whole , I would recommend you to take to Doctors ' Commons kindly , David .
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 22]: They plume them - selves on their gentility there , I can tell you , if that 's any satisfaction . '
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 96]: I made allowance for Steerforth 's light way of treating the subject , and , considering it with reference to the staid air of gravity and antiquity which I associated with that ` lazy old nook near St. Paul 's Churchyard ' , did not feel indisposed towards my aunt 's suggestion ; which she left to my free decision , making no scruple of telling me that it had occurred to her , on her lately visiting her own proctor in Doctors ' Commons for the purpose of settling her will in my favour .
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 34]: ` That 's a laudable proceeding on the part of our aunt , at all events , ' said Steerforth , when I mentioned it ; ` and one deserving of all encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 15]: Daisy , my advice is that you take kindly to Doctors ' Commons . '
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 10]: I quite made up my mind to do so .
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 76]: I then told Steerforth that my aunt was in town awaiting me -LRB- as I found from her letter -RRB- , and that she had taken lodgings for a week at a kind of private hotel at Lincoln 's Inn Fields , where there was a stone staircase , and a convenient door in the roof ; my aunt being firmly persuaded that every house in London was going to be burnt down every night .
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 47]: We achieved the rest of our journey pleasantly , sometimes recurring to Doctors ' Commons , and anticipating the distant days when I should be a proctor there , which Steerforth pictured in a variety of humorous and whimsical lights , that made us both merry .
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 43]: When we came to our journey 's end , he went home , engaging to call upon me next day but one ; and I drove to Lincoln 's Inn Fields , where I found my aunt up , and waiting supper .
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 22]: If I had been round the world since we parted , we could hardly have been better pleased to meet again .
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 39]: My aunt cried outright as she embraced me ; and said , pretending to laugh , that if my poor mother had been alive , that silly little creature would have shed tears , she had no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 12]: ` So you have left Mr. Dick behind , aunt ? '
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 9]: said I. ' I am sorry for that .
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 10]: Ah , Janet , how do you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 20]: As Janet curtsied , hoping I was well , I observed my aunt 's visage lengthen very much . '
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 18]: I am sorry for it , too , ' said my aunt , rubbing her nose . '
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 17]: I have had no peace of mind , Trot , since I have been here . '
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 11]: Before I could ask why , she told me . '
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 34]: I am convinced , ' said my aunt , laying her hand with melancholy firmness on the table , ` that Dick 's character is not a character to keep the donkeys off .
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 9]: I am confident he wants strength of purpose .
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 22]: I ought to have left Janet at home , instead , and then my mind might perhaps have been at ease .
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 29]: If ever there was a donkey trespassing on my green , ' said my aunt , with emphasis , ` there was one this afternoon at four o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 20]: A cold feeling came over me from head to foot , and I know it was a donkey ! '
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 14]: I tried to comfort her on this point , but she rejected consolation .
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 38]: ` It was a donkey , ' said my aunt ; ` and it was the one with the stumpy tail which that Murdering sister of a woman rode , when she came to my house . '
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 17]: This had been , ever since , the only name my aunt knew for Miss Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 39]: ` If there is any Donkey in Dover , whose audacity it is harder to me to bear than another 's , that , ' said my aunt , striking the table , ` is the animal ! '
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 40]: Janet ventured to suggest that my aunt might be disturbing herself unnecessarily , and that she believed the donkey in question was then engaged in the sand-and-gravel line of business , and was not available for purposes of trespass .
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 9]: But my aunt would n't hear of it .
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 74]: Supper was comfortably served and hot , though my aunt 's rooms were very high up -- whether that she might have more stone stairs for her money , or might be nearer to the door in the roof , I do n't know - and consisted of a roast fowl , a steak , and some vegetables , to all of which I did ample justice , and which were all excellent .
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 17]: But my aunt had her own ideas concerning London provision , and ate but little . '
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 31]: I suppose this unfortunate fowl was born and brought up in a cellar , ' said my aunt , ` and never took the air except on a hackney coach-stand .
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 15]: I hope the steak may be beef , but I do n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 16]: Nothing 's genuine in the place , in my opinion , but the dirt . '
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 18]: ` Do n't you think the fowl may have come out of the country , aunt ? '
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 3]: I hinted .
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 9]: ` Certainly not , ' returned my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 22]: ` It would be no pleasure to a London tradesman to sell anything which was what he pretended it was . '
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 26]: I did not venture to controvert this opinion , but I made a good supper , which it greatly satisfied her to see me do .
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 64]: When the table was cleared , Janet assisted her to arrange her hair , to put on her nightcap , which was of a smarter construction than usual -LRB- ` in case of fire ' , my aunt said -RRB- , and to fold her gown back over her knees , these being her usual preparations for warming herself before going to bed .
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 42]: I then made her , according to certain established regulations from which no deviation , however slight , could ever be permitted , a glass of hot wine and water , and a slice of toast cut into long thin strips .
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 54]: With these accompaniments we were left alone to finish the evening , my aunt sitting opposite to me drinking her wine and water ; soaking her strips of toast in it , one by one , before eating them ; and looking benignantly on me , from among the borders of her nightcap .
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 19]: ` Well , Trot , ' she began , ` what do you think of the proctor plan ?
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 13]: Or have you not begun to think about it yet ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 25]: I have thought a good deal about it , my dear aunt , and I have talked a good deal about it with Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 7]: I like it very much indeed .
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 6]: I like it exceedingly . '
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 7]: ` That 's cheering ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 9]: I have only one difficulty , aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 12]: ` Say what it is , Trot , ' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 37]: ` Why , I want to ask , aunt , as this seems , from what I understand , to be a limited profession , whether my entrance into it would not be very expensive ? '
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 21]: ` It will cost , ' returned my aunt , ` to article you , just a thousand pounds . '
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 26]: ` Now , my dear aunt , ' said I , drawing my chair nearer , ' I am uneasy in my mind about that .
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 8]: It 's a large sum of money .
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 28]: You have expended a great deal on my education , and have always been as liberal to me in all things as it was possible to be .
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 8]: You have been the soul of generosity .
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 31]: Surely there are some ways in which I might begin life with hardly any outlay , and yet begin with a good hope of getting on by resolution and exertion .
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 14]: Are you sure that it would not be better to try that course ?
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 26]: Are you certain that you can afford to part with so much money , and that it is right that it should be so expended ?
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 12]: I only ask you , my second mother , to consider .
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 5]: Are you certain ? '
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 79]: My aunt finished eating the piece of toast on which she was then engaged , looking me full in the face all the while ; and then setting her glass on the chimney-piece , and folding her hands upon her folded skirts , replied as follows : ` Trot , my child , if I have any object in life , it is to provide for your being a good , a sensible , and a happy man .
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 10]: I am bent upon it - so is Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 17]: I should like some people that I know to hear Dick 's conversation on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 5]: Its sagacity is wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 16]: But no one knows the resources of that man 's intellect , except myself ! '
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 38]: She stopped for a moment to take my hand between hers , and went on : ` It 's in vain , Trot , to recall the past , unless it works some influence upon the present .
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 12]: Perhaps I might have been better friends with your poor father .
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 23]: Perhaps I might have been better friends with that poor child your mother , even after your sister Betsey Trotwood disappointed me .
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 21]: When you came to me , a little runaway boy , all dusty and way-worn , perhaps I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 23]: From that time until now , Trot , you have ever been a credit to me and a pride and a pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 43]: I have no other claim upon my means ; at least ' -- here to my surprise she hesitated , and was confused -- ` no , I have no other claim upon my means -- and you are my adopted child .
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 54]: Only be a loving child to me in my age , and bear with my whims and fancies ; and you will do more for an old woman whose prime of life was not so happy or conciliating as it might have been , than ever that old woman did for you . '
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 16]: It was the first time I had heard my aunt refer to her past history .
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 32]: There was a magnanimity in her quiet way of doing so , and of dismissing it , which would have exalted her in my respect and affection , if anything could .
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 28]: ` All is agreed and understood between us , now , Trot , ' said my aunt , ` and we need talk of this no more .
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 17]: Give me a kiss , and we 'll go to the Commons after breakfast tomorrow . '
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 14]: We had a long chat by the fire before we went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 57]: I slept in a room on the same floor with my aunt 's , and was a little disturbed in the course of the night by her knocking at my door as often as she was agitated by a distant sound of hackney-coaches or market-carts , and inquiring , ` if I heard the engines ? '
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 15]: But towards morning she slept better , and suffered me to do so too .
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 21]: At about mid-day , we set out for the office of Messrs Spenlow and Jorkins , in Doctors ' Commons .
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 42]: My aunt , who had this other general opinion in reference to London , that every man she saw was a pickpocket , gave me her purse to carry for her , which had ten guineas in it and some silver .
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 57]: We made a pause at the toy shop in Fleet Street , to see the giants of Saint Dunstan 's strike upon the bells -- we had timed our going , so as to catch them at it , at twelve o'clock -- and then went on towards Ludgate Hill , and St. Paul 's Churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 23]: We were crossing to the former place , when I found that my aunt greatly accelerated her speed , and looked frightened .
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 39]: I observed , at the same time , that a lowering ill-dressed man who had stopped and stared at us in passing , a little before , was coming so close after us as to brush against her .
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 3]: ` Trot !
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 5]: My dear Trot ! '
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 15]: cried my aunt , in a terrified whisper , and pressing my arm . '
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 11]: I do n't know what I am to do . '
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 18]: ` Do n't be alarmed , ' said I. ` There 's nothing to be afraid of .
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 16]: Step into a shop , and I 'll soon get rid of this fellow . '
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 8]: ` No , no , child ! '
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 10]: ` Do n't speak to him for the world .
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 8]: I entreat , I order you ! '
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 7]: ` Good Heaven , aunt ! '
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 12]: said I. ` He is nothing but a sturdy beggar . '
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 10]: ` You do n't know what he is ! '
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 4]: replied my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 9]: ` You do n't know who he is !
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 9]: You do n't know what you say ! '
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 19]: We had stopped in an empty door-way , while this was passing , and he had stopped too .
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 8]: ` Do n't look at him ! '
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 32]: said my aunt , as I turned my head indignantly , ` but get me a coach , my dear , and wait for me in St. Paul 's Churchyard . '
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 6]: ` Wait for you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 3]: I replied .
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 9]: ` Yes , ' rejoined my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 5]: I must go alone .
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 7]: I must go with him . '
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 6]: ` With him , aunt ?
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 5]: This man ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 18]: I am in my senses , ' she replied , ` and I tell you I must .
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 5]: Get mea coach ! '
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 24]: However much astonished I might be , I was sensible that I had no right to refuse compliance with such a peremptory command .
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 16]: I hurried away a few paces , and called a hackney-chariot which was passing empty .
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 25]: Almost before I could let down the steps , my aunt sprang in , I do n't know how , and the man followed .
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 28]: She waved her hand to me to go away , so earnestly , that , all confounded as I was , I turned from them at once .
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 16]: In doing so , I heard her say to the coachman , ` Drive anywhere !
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 5]: Drive straight on ! '
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 12]: and presently the chariot passed me , going up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 25]: What Mr. Dick had told me , and what I had supposed to be a delusion of his , now came into my mind .
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 40]: I could not doubt that this person was the person of whom he had made such mysterious mention , though what the nature of his hold upon my aunt could possibly be , I was quite unable to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 17]: After half an hour 's cooling in the churchyard , I saw the chariot coming back .
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 15]: The driver stopped beside me , and my aunt was sitting in it alone .
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 21]: She had not yet sufficiently recovered from her agitation to be quite prepared for the visit we had to make .
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 24]: She desired me to get into the chariot , and to tell the coachman to drive slowly up and down a little while .
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 51]: She said no more , except , ` My dear child , never ask me what it was , and do n't refer to it , ' until she had perfectly regained her composure , when she told me she was quite herself now , and we might get out .
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 27]: On her giving me her purse to pay the driver , I found that all the guineas were gone , and only the loose silver remained .
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 11]: Doctors ' Commons was approached by a little low archway .
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 31]: Before we had taken many paces down the street beyond it , the noise of the city seemed to melt , as if by magic , into a softened distance .
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 44]: A few dull courts and narrow ways brought us to the sky-lighted offices of Spenlow and Jorkins ; in the vestibule of which temple , accessible to pilgrims without the ceremony of knocking , three or four clerks were at work as copyists .
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 44]: One of these , a little dry man , sitting by himself , who wore a stiff brown wig that looked as if it were made of gingerbread , rose to receive my aunt , and show us into Mr. Spenlow 's room .
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 37]: ` Mr. Spenlow 's in Court , ma'am , ' said the dry man ; ` it 's an Arches day ; but it 's close by , and I 'll send for him directly . '
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 21]: As we were left to look about us while Mr. Spenlow was fetched , I availed myself of the opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 37]: The furniture of the room was old-fashioned and dusty ; and the green baize on the top of the writing-table had lost all its colour , and was as withered and pale as an old pauper .
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 92]: There were a great many bundles of papers on it , some endorsed as Allegations , and some -LRB- to my surprise -RRB- as Libels , and some as being in the Consistory Court , and some in the Arches Court , and some in the Prerogative Court , and some in the Admiralty Court , and some in the Delegates ' Court ; giving me occasion to wonder much , how many Courts there might be in the gross , and how long it would take to understand them all .
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 44]: Besides these , there were sundry immense manuscript Books of Evidence taken on affidavit , strongly bound , and tied together in massive sets , a set to each cause , as if every cause were a history in ten or twenty volumes .
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 21]: All this looked tolerably expensive , I thought , and gave me an agreeable notion of a proctor 's business .
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 50]: I was casting my eyes with increasing complacency over these and many similar objects , when hasty footsteps were heard in the room outside , and Mr. Spenlow , in a black gown trimmed with white fur , came hurrying in , taking off his hat as he came .
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 20]: He was a little light-haired gentleman , with undeniable boots , and the stiffest of white cravats and shirt-collars .
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 28]: He was buttoned up , mighty trim and tight , and must have taken a great deal of pains with his whiskers , which were accurately curled .
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 42]: His gold watch-chain was so massive , that a fancy came across me , that he ought to have a sinewy golden arm , to draw it out with , like those which are put up over the goldbeaters ' shops .
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 56]: He was got up with such care , and was so stiff , that he could hardly bend himself ; being obliged , when he glanced at some papers on his desk , after sitting down in his chair , to move his whole body , from the bottom of his spine , like Punch .
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 15]: I had previously been presented by my aunt , and had been courteously received .
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 19]: He now said : ` And so , Mr. Copperfield , you think of entering into our profession ?
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 41]: I casually mentioned to Miss Trotwood , when I had the pleasure of an interview with her the other day , ' -- with another inclination of his body -- Punch again -- ` that there was a vacancy here .
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 30]: Miss Trotwood was good enough to mention that she had a nephew who was her peculiar care , and for whom she was seeking to provide genteelly in life .
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 17]: That nephew , I believe , I have now the pleasure of ' -- Punch again .
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 31]: I bowed my acknowledgements , and said , my aunt had mentioned to me that there was that opening , and that I believed I should like it very much .
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 17]: That I was strongly inclined to like it , and had taken immediately to the proposal .
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 19]: That I could not absolutely pledge myself to like it , until I knew something more about it .
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 34]: That although it was little else than a matter of form , I presumed I should have an opportunity of trying how I liked it , before I bound myself to it irrevocably .
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 4]: ` Oh surely !
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 3]: surely ! '
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 4]: said Mr. Spenlow .
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 16]: ` We always , in this house , propose a month -- an initiatory month .
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 27]: I should be happy , myself , to propose two months -- three -- an indefinite period , in fact -- but I have a partner .
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 4]: Mr. Jorkins . '
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 18]: ` And the premium , sir , ' I returned , ` is a thousand pounds ? '
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 18]: ` And the premium , Stamp included , is a thousand pounds , ' said Mr. Spenlow .
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 47]: ` As I have mentioned to Miss Trotwood , I am actuated by no mercenary considerations ; few men are less so , I believe ; but Mr. Jorkins has his opinions on these subjects , and I am bound to respect Mr. Jorkins 's opinions .
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 14]: Mr. Jorkins thinks a thousand pounds too little , in short . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 115]: I suppose , sir , ' said I , still desiring to spare my aunt , ` that it is not the custom here , if an articled clerk were particularly useful , and made himself a perfect master of his profession ' -- I could not help blushing , this looked so like praising myself -- ' I suppose it is not the custom , in the later years of his time , to allow him any -- ' Mr. Spenlow , by a great effort , just lifted his head far enough out of his cravat to shake it , and answered , anticipating the word ` salary ' : ` No .
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 22]: I will not say what consideration I might give to that point myself , Mr. Copperfield , if I were unfettered .
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 6]: Mr. Jorkins is immovable . '
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 12]: I was quite dismayed by the idea of this terrible Jorkins .
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 44]: But I found out afterwards that he was a mild man of a heavy temperament , whose place in the business was to keep himself in the background , and be constantly exhibited by name as the most obdurate and ruthless of men .
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 18]: If a clerk wanted his salary raised , Mr. Jorkins would n't listen to such a proposition .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 47]: If a client were slow to settle his bill of costs , Mr. Jorkins was resolved to have it paid ; and however painful these things might be -LRB- and always were -RRB- to the feelings of Mr. Spenlow , Mr. Jorkins would have his bond .
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 22]: The heart and hand of the good angel Spenlow would have been always open , but for the restraining demon Jorkins .
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 26]: As I have grown older , I think I have had experience of some other houses doing business on the principle of Spenlow and Jorkins !
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 59]: It was settled that I should begin my month 's probation as soon as I pleased , and that my aunt need neither remain in town nor return at its expiration , as the articles of agreement , of which I was to be the subject , could easily be sent to her at home for her signature .
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 29]: When we had got so far , Mr. Spenlow offered to take me into Court then and there , and show me what sort of place it was .
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 57]: As I was willing enough to know , we went out with this object , leaving my aunt behind ; who would trust herself , she said , in no such place , and who , I think , regarded all Courts of Law as a sort of powder-mills that might blow up at any time .
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 63]: Mr. Spenlow conducted me through a paved courtyard formed of grave brick houses , which I inferred , from the Doctors ' names upon the doors , to be the official abiding-places of the learned advocates of whom Steerforth had told me ; and into a large dull room , not unlike a chapel to my thinking , on the left hand .
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 55]: The upper part of this room was fenced off from the rest ; and there , on the two sides of a raised platform of the horse-shoe form , sitting on easy old-fashioned dining-room chairs , were sundry gentlemen in red gowns and grey wigs , whom I found to be the Doctors aforesaid .
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 52]: Blinking over a little desk like a pulpit-desk , in the curve of the horse-shoe , was an old gentleman , whom , if I had seen him in an aviary , I should certainly have taken for an owl , but who , I learned , was the presiding judge .
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 55]: In the space within the horse-shoe , lower than these , that is to say , on about the level of the floor , were sundry other gentlemen , of Mr. Spenlow 's rank , and dressed like him in black gowns with white fur upon them , sitting at a long green table .
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 56]: Their cravats were in general stiff , I thought , and their looks haughty ; but in this last respect I presently conceived I had done them an injustice , for when two or three of them had to rise and answer a question of the presiding dignitary , I never saw anything more sheepish .
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 37]: The public , represented by a boy with a comforter , and a shabby-genteel man secretly eating crumbs out of his coat pockets , was warming itself at a stove in the centre of the Court .
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 57]: The languid stillness of the place was only broken by the chirping of this fire and by the voice of one of the Doctors , who was wandering slowly through a perfect library of evidence , and stopping to put up , from time to time , at little roadside inns of argument on the journey .
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 55]: Altogether , I have never , on any occasion , made one at such a cosey , dosey , old-fashioned , time-forgotten , sleepy-headed little family-party in all my life ; and I felt it would be quite a soothing opiate to belong to it in any character -- except perhaps as a suitor .
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 70]: Very well satisfied with the dreamy nature of this retreat , I informed Mr. Spenlow that I had seen enough for that time , and we rejoined my aunt ; in company with whom I presently departed from the Commons , feeling very young when I went out of Spenlow and Jorkins 's , on account of the clerks poking one another with their pens to point me out .
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 31]: We arrived at Lincoln 's Inn Fields without any new adventures , except encountering an unlucky donkey in a costermonger 's cart , who suggested painful associations to my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 70]: We had another long talk about my plans , when we were safely housed ; and as I knew she was anxious to get home , and , between fire , food , and pickpockets , could never be considered at her ease for half-an-hour in London , I urged her not to be uncomfortable on my account , but to leave me to take care of myself . '
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 21]: I have not been here a week tomorrow , without considering that too , my dear , ' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 28]: ` There is a furnished little set of chambers to be let in the Adelphi , Trot , which ought to suit you to a marvel . '
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 79]: With this brief introduction , she produced from her pocket an advertisement , carefully cut out of a newspaper , setting forth that in Buckingham Street in the Adelphi there was to be let furnished , with a view of the river , a singularly desirable , and compact set of chambers , forming a genteel residence for a young gentleman , a member of one of the Inns of Court , or otherwise , with immediate possession .
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 15]: Terms moderate , and could be taken for a month only , if required .
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 12]: ` Why , this is the very thing , aunt ! '
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 13]: said I , flushed with the possible dignity of living in chambers .
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 21]: ` Then come , ' replied my aunt , immediately resuming the bonnet she had a minute before laid aside .
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 10]: ` We 'll go and look at 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 4]: Away we went .
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 29]: The advertisement directed us to apply to Mrs. Crupp on the premises , and we rung the area bell , which we supposed to communicate with Mrs. Crupp .
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 44]: It was not until we had rung three or four times that we could prevail on Mrs. Crupp to communicate with us , but at last she appeared , being a stout lady with a flounce of flannel petticoat below a nankeen gown .
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 20]: ` Let us see these chambers of yours , if you please , ma'am , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 6]: ` For this gentleman ? '
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 12]: said Mrs. Crupp , feeling in her pocket for her keys .
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 12]: ` Yes , for my nephew , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 11]: ` And a sweet set they is for sich ! '
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 4]: said Mrs. Crupp .
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 5]: So we went upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 54]: They were on the top of the house -- a great point with my aunt , being near the fire-escape -- and consisted of a little half-blind entry where you could see hardly anything , a little stone-blind pantry where you could see nothing at all , a sitting-room , and a bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 25]: The furniture was rather faded , but quite good enough for me ; and , sure enough , the river was outside the windows .
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 49]: As I was delighted with the place , my aunt and Mrs. Crupp withdrew into the pantry to discuss the terms , while I remained on the sitting-room sofa , hardly daring to think it possible that I could be destined to live in such a noble residence .
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 36]: After a single combat of some duration they returned , and I saw , to my joy , both in Mrs. Crupp 's countenance and in my aunt 's , that the deed was done .
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 10]: ` Is it the last occupant 's furniture ? '
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 4]: inquired my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 13]: ` Yes , it is , ma'am , ' said Mrs. Crupp .
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 8]: ` What 's become of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 4]: asked my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 20]: Mrs. Crupp was taken with a troublesome cough , in the midst of which she articulated with much difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 13]: ` He was took ill here , ma'am , and -- ugh !
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 2]: ugh !
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 2]: ugh !
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 3]: dear me !
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 6]: -- and he died ! '
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 3]: ` Hey !
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 7]: What did he die of ? '
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 4]: asked my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 18]: ` Well , ma'am , he died of drink , ' said Mrs. Crupp , in confidence .
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 5]: ` And smoke . '
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 3]: ` Smoke ?
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 7]: You do n't mean chimneys ? '
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 10]: ` No , ma'am , ' returned Mrs. Crupp .
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 6]: ` Cigars and pipes . '
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 21]: ` That 's not catching , Trot , at any rate , ' remarked my aunt , turning to me .
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 9]: ` No , indeed , ' said I .
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 34]: In short , my aunt , seeing how enraptured I was with the premises , took them for a month , with leave to remain for twelve months when that time was out .
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 34]: Mrs. Crupp was to find linen , and to cook ; every other necessary was already provided ; and Mrs. Crupp expressly intimated that she should always yearn towards me as a son .
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 27]: I was to take possession the day after tomorrow , and Mrs. Crupp said , thank Heaven she had now found summun she could care for !
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 34]: On our way back , my aunt informed me how she confidently trusted that the life I was now to lead would make me firm and self-reliant , which was all I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 63]: She repeated this several times next day , in the intervals of our arranging for the transmission of my clothes and books from Mr. Wickfield 's ; relative to which , and to all my late holiday , I wrote a long letter to Agnes , of which my aunt took charge , as she was to leave on the succeeding day .
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 120]: Not to lengthen these particulars , I need only add , that she made a handsome provision for all my possible wants during my month of trial ; that Steerforth , to my great disappointment and hers too , did not make his appearance before she went away ; that I saw her safely seated in the Dover coach , exulting in the coming discomfiture of the vagrant donkeys , with Janet at her side ; and that when the coach was gone , I turned my face to the Adelphi , pondering on the old days when I used to roam about its subterranean arches , and on the happy changes which had brought me to the surface .
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 50]: Chapter 24 My First Dissipation It was a wonderfully fine thing to have that lofty castle to myself , and to feel , when I shut my outer door , like Robinson Crusoe , when he had got into his fortification , and pulled his ladder up after him .
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 52]: It was a wonderfully fine thing to walk about town with the key of my house in my pocket , and to know that I could ask any fellow to come home , and make quite sure of its being inconvenient to nobody , if it were not so to me .
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 53]: It was a wonderfully fine thing to let myself in and out , and to come and go without a word to anyone , and to ring Mrs. Crupp up , gasping , from the depths of the earth , when I wanted her -- and when she was disposed to come .
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 27]: All this , I say , was wonderfully fine ; but I must say , too , that there were times when it was very dreary .
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 13]: It was fine in the morning , particularly in the fine mornings .
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 22]: It looked a very fresh , free life , by daylight : still fresher , and more free , by sunlight .
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 14]: But as the day declined , the life seemed to go down too .
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 15]: I do n't know how it was ; it seldom looked well by candle-light .
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 9]: I wanted somebody to talk to , then .
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 4]: I missed Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 17]: I found a tremendous blank , in the place of that smiling repository of my confidence .
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 10]: Mrs. Crupp appeared to be a long way off .
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 36]: I thought about my predecessor , who had died of drink and smoke ; and I could have wished he had been so good as to live , and not bother me with his decease .
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 40]: After two days and nights , I felt as if I had lived there for a year , and yet I was not an hour older , but was quite as much tormented by my own youthfulness as ever .
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 32]: Steerforth not yet appearing , which induced me to apprehend that he must be ill , I left the Commons early on the third day , and walked out to Highgate .
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 40]: Mrs. Steerforth was very glad to see me , and said that he had gone away with one of his Oxford friends to see another who lived near St. Albans , but that she expected him to return tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 17]: I was so fond of him , that I felt quite jealous of his Oxford friends .
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 24]: As she pressed me to stay to dinner , I remained , and I believe we talked about nothing but him all day .
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 21]: I told her how much the people liked him at Yarmouth , and what a delightful companion he had been .
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 31]: Miss Dartle was full of hints and mysterious questions , but took a great interest in all our proceedings there , and said , ` Was it really though ? '
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 19]: and so forth , so often , that she got everything out of me she wanted to know .
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 46]: Her appearance was exactly what I have described it , when I first saw her ; but the society of the two ladies was so agreeable , and came so natural to me , that I felt myself falling a little in love with her .
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 34]: I could not help thinking , several times in the course of the evening , and particularly when I walked home at night , what delightful company she would be in Buckingham Street .
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 54]: I was taking my coffee and roll in the morning , before going to the Commons -- and I may observe in this place that it is surprising how much coffee Mrs. Crupp used , and how weak it was , considering -- when Steerforth himself walked in , to my unbounded joy .
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 23]: ` My dear Steerforth , ' cried I , ' I began to think I should never see you again ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 24]: I was carried off , by force of arms , ' said Steerforth , ` the very next morning after I got home .
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 14]: Why , Daisy , what a rare old bachelor you are here ! '
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 24]: I showed him over the establishment , not omitting the pantry , with no little pride , and he commended it highly . '
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 32]: I tell you what , old boy , ' he added , ' I shall make quite a town-house of this place , unless you give me notice to quit . '
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 6]: This was a delightful hearing .
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 17]: I told him if he waited for that , he would have to wait till doomsday .
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 9]: ` But you shall have some breakfast ! '
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 41]: said I , with my hand on the bell-rope , ` and Mrs. Crupp shall make you some fresh coffee , and I 'll toast you some bacon in a bachelor 's Dutch-oven , that I have got here . '
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 6]: ` No , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 5]: ` Do n't ring !
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 4]: I ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 22]: I am going to breakfast with one of these fellows who is at the Piazza Hotel , in Covent Garden . '
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 10]: ` But you 'll come back to dinner ? '
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 11]: said I. ' I ca n't , upon my life .
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 17]: There 's nothing I should like better , but I must remain with these two fellows .
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 10]: We are all three off together tomorrow morning . '
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 12]: ` Then bring them here to dinner , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 9]: ` Do you think they would come ? '
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 17]: they would come fast enough , ' said Steerforth ; ` but we should inconvenience you .
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 11]: You had better come and dine with us somewhere . '
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 35]: I would not by any means consent to this , for it occurred to me that I really ought to have a little house-warming , and that there never could be a better opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 25]: I had a new pride in my rooms after his approval of them , and burned with a desire to develop their utmost resources .
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 23]: I therefore made him promise positively in the names of his two friends , and we appointed six o'clock as the dinner-hour .
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 19]: When he was gone , I rang for Mrs. Crupp , and acquainted her with my desperate design .
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 55]: Mrs. Crupp said , in the first place , of course it was well known she could n't be expected to wait , but she knew a handy young man , who she thought could be prevailed upon to do it , and whose terms would be five shillings , and what I pleased .
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 9]: I said , certainly we would have him .
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 53]: Next Mrs. Crupp said it was clear she could n't be in two places at once -LRB- which I felt to be reasonable -RRB- , and that ' a young gal ' stationed in the pantry with a bedroom candle , there never to desist from washing plates , would be indispensable .
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 13]: I said , what would be the expense of this young female ?
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 15]: and Mrs. Crupp said she supposed eighteenpence would neither make me nor break me .
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 11]: I said I supposed not ; and THAT was settled .
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 10]: Then Mrs. Crupp said , Now about the dinner .
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 37]: It was a remarkable instance of want of forethought on the part of the ironmonger who had made Mrs. Crupp 's kitchen fireplace , that it was capable of cooking nothing but chops and mashed potatoes .
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 11]: As to a fish-kittle , Mrs. Crupp said , well !
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 10]: would I only come and look at the range ?
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 8]: She could n't say fairer than that .
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 8]: Would I come and look at it ?
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 28]: As I should not have been much the wiser if I HAD looked at it , I declined , and said , ` Never mind fish . '
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 18]: But Mrs. Crupp said , Do n't say that ; oysters was in , why not them ?
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 5]: So THAT was settled .
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 12]: Mrs. Crupp then said what she would recommend would be this .
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 65]: A pair of hot roast fowls -- from the pastry-cook 's ; a dish of stewed beef , with vegetables -- from the pastry-cook 's ; two little corner things , as a raised pie and a dish of kidneys -- from the pastrycook 's ; a tart , and -LRB- if I liked -RRB- a shape of jelly -- from the pastrycook 's .
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 37]: This , Mrs. Crupp said , would leave her at full liberty to concentrate her mind on the potatoes , and to serve up the cheese and celery as she could wish to see it done .
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 18]: I acted on Mrs. Crupp 's opinion , and gave the order at the pastry-cook 's myself .
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 60]: Walking along the Strand , afterwards , and observing a hard mottled substance in the window of a ham and beef shop , which resembled marble , but was labelled ` Mock Turtle ' , I went in and bought a slab of it , which I have since seen reason to believe would have sufficed for fifteen people .
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 41]: This preparation , Mrs. Crupp , after some difficulty , consented to warm up ; and it shrunk so much in a liquid state , that we found it what Steerforth called ` rather a tight fit ' for four .
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 30]: These preparations happily completed , I bought a little dessert in Covent Garden Market , and gave a rather extensive order at a retail wine-merchant 's in that vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 49]: When I came home in the afternoon , and saw the bottles drawn up in a square on the pantry floor , they looked so numerous -LRB- though there were two missing , which made Mrs. Crupp very uncomfortable -RRB- , that I was absolutely frightened at them .
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 14]: One of Steerforth 's friends was named Grainger , and the other Markham .
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 29]: They were both very gay and lively fellows ; Grainger , something older than Steerforth ; Markham , youthful-looking , and I should say not more than twenty .
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 28]: I observed that the latter always spoke of himself indefinitely , as ' a man ' , and seldom or never in the first person singular . '
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 19]: A man might get on very well here , Mr. Copperfield , ' said Markham - meaning himself .
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 22]: ` It 's not a bad situation , ' said I , ` and the rooms are really commodious . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 11]: I hope you have both brought appetites with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 19]: ` Upon my honour , ' returned Markham , ` town seems to sharpen a man 's appetite .
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 8]: A man is hungry all day long .
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 7]: A man is perpetually eating . '
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 36]: Being a little embarrassed at first , and feeling much too young to preside , I made Steerforth take the head of the table when dinner was announced , and seated myself opposite to him .
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 35]: Everything was very good ; we did not spare the wine ; and he exerted himself so brilliantly to make the thing pass off well , that there was no pause in our festivity .
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 70]: I was not quite such good company during dinner as I could have wished to be , for my chair was opposite the door , and my attention was distracted by observing that the handy young man went out of the room very often , and that his shadow always presented itself , immediately afterwards , on the wall of the entry , with a bottle at its mouth .
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 26]: The ` young gal ' likewise occasioned me some uneasiness : not so much by neglecting to wash the plates , as by breaking them .
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 67]: For being of an inquisitive disposition , and unable to confine herself -LRB- as her positive instructions were -RRB- to the pantry , she was constantly peering in at us , and constantly imagining herself detected ; in which belief , she several times retired upon the plates -LRB- with which she had carefully paved the floor -RRB- , and did a great deal of destruction .
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 41]: These , however , were small drawbacks , and easily forgotten when the cloth was cleared , and the dessert put on the table ; at which period of the entertainment the handy young man was discovered to be speechless .
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 31]: Giving him private directions to seek the society of Mrs. Crupp , and to remove the ` young gal ' to the basement also , I abandoned myself to enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 36]: I began , by being singularly cheerful and light-hearted ; all sorts of half-forgotten things to talk about , came rushing into my mind , and made me hold forth in a most unwonted manner .
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 84]: I laughed heartily at my own jokes , and everybody else 's ; called Steerforth to order for not passing the wine ; made several engagements to go to Oxford ; announced that I meant to have a dinner-party exactly like that , once a week , until further notice ; and madly took so much snuff out of Grainger 's box , that I was obliged to go into the pantry , and have a private fit of sneezing ten minutes long .
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 31]: I went on , by passing the wine faster and faster yet , and continually starting up with a corkscrew to open more wine , long before any was needed .
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 6]: I proposed Steerforth 's health .
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 21]: I said he was my dearest friend , the protector of my boyhood , and the companion of my prime .
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 10]: I said I was delighted to propose his health .
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 26]: I said I owed him more obligations than I could ever repay , and held him in a higher admiration than I could ever express .
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 12]: I finished by saying , ` I 'll give you Steerforth !
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 4]: God bless him !
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 3]: Hurrah ! '
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 18]: We gave him three times three , and another , and a good one to finish with .
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 31]: I broke my glass in going round the table to shake hands with him , and I said -LRB- in two words -RRB- ` Steerforth -- you ` retheguidingstarofmyexistence . '
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 17]: I went on , by finding suddenly that somebody was in the middle of a song .
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 21]: Markham was the singer , and he sang ` When the heart of a man is depressed with care ' .
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 17]: He said , when he had sung it , he would give us ` Woman ! '
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 13]: I took objection to that , and I could n't allow it .
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 34]: I said it was not a respectful way of proposing the toast , and I would never permit that toast to be drunk in my house otherwise than as ` The Ladies ! '
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 30]: I was very high with him , mainly I think because I saw Steerforth and Grainger laughing at me -- or at him -- or at both of us .
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 11]: He said a man was not to be dictated to .
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 6]: I said a man was .
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 12]: He said a man was not to be insulted , then .
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 25]: I said he was right there -- never under my roof , where the Lares were sacred , and the laws of hospitality paramount .
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 21]: He said it was no derogation from a man 's dignity to confess that I was a devilish good fellow .
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 6]: I instantly proposed his health .
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 4]: Somebody was smoking .
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 5]: We were all smoking .
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 14]: I was smoking , and trying to suppress a rising tendency to shudder .
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 21]: Steerforth had made a speech about me , in the course of which I had been affected almost to tears .
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 41]: I returned thanks , and hoped the present company would dine with me tomorrow , and the day after -- each day at five o'clock , that we might enjoy the pleasures of conversation and society through a long evening .
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 9]: I felt called upon to propose an individual .
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 7]: I would give them my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 10]: Miss Betsey Trotwood , the best of her sex !
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 28]: Somebody was leaning out of my bedroom window , refreshing his forehead against the cool stone of the parapet , and feeling the air upon his face .
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 4]: It was myself .
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 20]: I was addressing myself as ` Copperfield ' , and saying , ` Why did you try to smoke ?
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 11]: You might have known you could n't do it . '
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 12]: Now , somebody was unsteadily contemplating his features in the looking-glass .
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 5]: That was I too .
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 29]: I was very pale in the looking-glass ; my eyes had a vacant appearance ; and my hair -- only my hair , nothing else -- looked drunk .
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 16]: Somebody said to me , ` Let us go to the theatre , Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 46]: There was no bedroom before me , but again the jingling table covered with glasses ; the lamp ; Grainger on my right hand , Markham on my left , and Steerforth opposite -- all sitting in a mist , and a long way off .
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 3]: The theatre ?
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 4]: To be sure .
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 4]: The very thing .
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 3]: Come along !
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 23]: But they must excuse me if I saw everybody out first , and turned the lamp off -- in case of fire .
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 13]: Owing to some confusion in the dark , the door was gone .
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 24]: I was feeling for it in the window-curtains , when Steerforth , laughing , took me by the arm and led me out .
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 8]: We went downstairs , one behind another .
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 11]: Near the bottom , somebody fell , and rolled down .
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 7]: Somebody else said it was Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 31]: I was angry at that false report , until , finding myself on my back in the passage , I began to think there might be some foundation for it .
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 15]: A very foggy night , with great rings round the lamps in the streets !
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 10]: There was an indistinct talk of its being wet .
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 5]: I considered it frosty .
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 34]: Steerforth dusted me under a lamp-post , and put my hat into shape , which somebody produced from somewhere in a most extraordinary manner , for I had n't had it on before .
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 17]: Steerforth then said , ` You are all right , Copperfield , are you not ? '
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 9]: and I told him , ` Neverberrer . '
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 57]: A man , sitting in a pigeon-hole-place , looked out of the fog , and took money from somebody , inquiring if I was one of the gentlemen paid for , and appearing rather doubtful -LRB- as I remember in the glimpse I had of him -RRB- whether to take the money for me or not .
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 39]: Shortly afterwards , we were very high up in a very hot theatre , looking down into a large pit , that seemed to me to smoke ; the people with whom it was crammed were so indistinct .
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 36]: There was a great stage , too , looking very clean and smooth after the streets ; and there were people upon it , talking about something or other , but not at all intelligibly .
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 30]: There was an abundance of bright lights , and there was music , and there were ladies down in the boxes , and I do n't know what more .
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 30]: The whole building looked to me as if it were learning to swim ; it conducted itself in such an unaccountable manner , when I tried to steady it .
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 19]: On somebody 's motion , we resolved to go downstairs to the dress-boxes , where the ladies were .
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 35]: A gentleman lounging , full dressed , on a sofa , with an opera-glass in his hand , passed before my view , and also my own figure at full length in a glass .
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 30]: Then I was being ushered into one of these boxes , and found myself saying something as I sat down , and people about me crying ` Silence ! '
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 15]: to somebody , and ladies casting indignant glances at me , and -- what !
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 2]: yes !
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 29]: -- Agnes , sitting on the seat before me , in the same box , with a lady and gentleman beside her , whom I did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 28]: I see her face now , better than I did then , I dare say , with its indelible look of regret and wonder turned upon me .
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 4]: ` Agnes ! '
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 8]: I said , thickly , ` Lorblessmer !
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 3]: Agnes ! '
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 3]: ` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 3]: Pray ! '
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 9]: she answered , I could not conceive why .
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 6]: ` You disturb the company .
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 6]: Look at the stage ! '
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 27]: I tried , on her injunction , to fix it , and to hear something of what was going on there , but quite in vain .
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 26]: I looked at her again by and by , and saw her shrink into her corner , and put her gloved hand to her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 4]: ` Agnes ! '
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 8]: ` I ` mafraidyou ` renorwell . '
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 5]: ` Yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 11]: Do not mind me , Trotwood , ' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 3]: ` Listen !
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 7]: Are you going away soon ? '
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 4]: ` Amigoarawaysoo ? '
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 3]: I repeated .
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 19]: I had a stupid intention of replying that I was going to wait , to hand her downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 55]: I suppose I expressed it , somehow ; for after she had looked at me attentively for a little while , she appeared to understand , and replied in a low tone : ' I know you will do as I ask you , if I tell you I am very earnest in it .
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 20]: Go away now , Trotwood , for my sake , and ask your friends to take you home . '
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 31]: She had so far improved me , for the time , that though I was angry with her , I felt ashamed , and with a short ` Goori ! '
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 11]: -LRB- which I intended for ` Good night ! ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 6]: got up and went away .
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 59]: They followed , and I stepped at once out of the box-door into my bedroom , where only Steerforth was with me , helping me to undress , and where I was by turns telling him that Agnes was my sister , and adjuring him to bring the corkscrew , that I might open another bottle of wine .
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 38]: How somebody , lying in my bed , lay saying and doing all this over again , at cross purposes , in a feverish dream all night -- the bed a rocking sea that was never still !
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 69]: How , as that somebody slowly settled down into myself , did I begin to parch , and feel as if my outer covering of skin were a hard board ; my tongue the bottom of an empty kettle , furred with long service , and burning up over a slow fire ; the palms of my hands , hot plates of metal which no ice could cool !
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 20]: But the agony of mind , the remorse , and shame I felt when I became conscious next day !
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 101]: My horror of having committed a thousand offences I had forgotten , and which nothing could ever expiate -- my recollection of that indelible look which Agnes had given me -- the torturing impossibility of communicating with her , not knowing , Beast that I was , how she came to be in London , or where she stayed - my disgust of the very sight of the room where the revel had been held -- my racking head -- the smell of smoke , the sight of glasses , the impossibility of going out , or even getting up !
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 8]: Oh , what a day it was !
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 65]: Oh , what an evening , when I sat down by my fire to a basin of mutton broth , dimpled all over with fat , and thought I was going the way of my predecessor , and should succeed to his dismal story as well as to his chambers , and had half a mind to rush express to Dover and reveal all !
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 64]: What an evening , when Mrs. Crupp , coming in to take away the broth-basin , produced one kidney on a cheese-plate as the entire remains of yesterday 's feast , and I was really inclined to fall upon her nankeen breast and say , in heartfelt penitence , ` Oh , Mrs. Crupp , Mrs. Crupp , never mind the broken meats !
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 6]: I am very miserable ! '
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 24]: -- only that I doubted , even at that pass , if Mrs. Crupp were quite the sort of woman to confide in !
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 79]: Chapter 25 Good and Bad Angels I was going out at my door on the morning after that deplorable day of headache , sickness , and repentance , with an odd confusion in my mind relative to the date of my dinner-party , as if a body of Titans had taken an enormous lever and pushed the day before yesterday some months back , when I saw a ticket-porter coming upstairs , with a letter in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 52]: He was taking his time about his errand , then ; but when he saw me on the top of the staircase , looking at him over the banisters , he swung into a trot , and came up panting as if he had run himself into a state of exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 19]: ` T. Copperfield , Esquire , ' said the ticket-porter , touching his hat with his little cane .
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 23]: I could scarcely lay claim to the name : I was so disturbed by the conviction that the letter came from Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 30]: However , I told him I was T. Copperfield , Esquire , and he believed it , and gave me the letter , which he said required an answer .
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 59]: I shut him out on the landing to wait for the answer , and went into my chambers again , in such a nervous state that I was fain to lay the letter down on my breakfast table , and familiarize myself with the outside of it a little , before I could resolve to break the seal .
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 27]: I found , when I did open it , that it was a very kind note , containing no reference to my condition at the theatre .
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 10]: All it said was , ` My dear Trotwood .
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 20]: I am staying at the house of papa 's agent , Mr. Waterbrook , in Ely Place , Holborn .
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 16]: Will you come and see me today , at any time you like to appoint ?
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 7]: Ever yours affectionately , Agnes . '
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 38]: It took me such a long time to write an answer at all to my satisfaction , that I do n't know what the ticket-porter can have thought , unless he thought I was learning to write .
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 9]: I must have written half-a-dozen answers at least .
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 39]: I began one , ` How can I ever hope , my dear Agnes , to efface from your remembrance the disgusting impression ' -- there I did n't like it , and then I tore it up .
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 41]: I began another , ` Shakespeare has observed , my dear Agnes , how strange it is that a man should put an enemy into his mouth ' -- that reminded me of Markham , and it got no farther .
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 5]: I even tried poetry .
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 33]: I began one note , in a six-syllable line , ` Oh , do not remember ' -- but that associated itself with the fifth of November , and became an absurdity .
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 12]: After many attempts , I wrote , ` My dear Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 21]: Your letter is like you , and what could I say of it that would be higher praise than that ?
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 7]: I will come at four o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 38]: Affectionately and sorrowfully , T.C. ' With this missive -LRB- which I was in twenty minds at once about recalling , as soon as it was out of my hands -RRB- , the ticket-porter at last departed .
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 39]: If the day were half as tremendous to any other professional gentleman in Doctors ' Commons as it was to me , I sincerely believe he made some expiation for his share in that rotten old ecclesiastical cheese .
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 71]: Although I left the office at half past three , and was prowling about the place of appointment within a few minutes afterwards , the appointed time was exceeded by a full quarter of an hour , according to the clock of St. Andrew 's , Holborn , before I could muster up sufficient desperation to pull the private bell-handle let into the left-hand door-post of Mr. Waterbrook 's house .
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 35]: The professional business of Mr. Waterbrook 's establishment was done on the ground-floor , and the genteel business -LRB- of which there was a good deal -RRB- in the upper part of the building .
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 20]: I was shown into a pretty but rather close drawing-room , and there sat Agnes , netting a purse .
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 61]: She looked so quiet and good , and reminded me so strongly of my airy fresh school days at Canterbury , and the sodden , smoky , stupid wretch I had been the other night , that , nobody being by , I yielded to my self-reproach and shame , and -- in short , made a fool of myself .
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 9]: I can not deny that I shed tears .
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 25]: To this hour I am undecided whether it was upon the whole the wisest thing I could have done , or the most ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 31]: ` If it had been anyone but you , Agnes , ' said I , turning away my head , ' I should not have minded it half so much .
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 11]: But that it should have been you who saw me !
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 11]: I almost wish I had been dead , first . '
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 44]: She put her hand -- its touch was like no other hand -- upon my arm for a moment ; and I felt so befriended and comforted , that I could not help moving it to my lips , and gratefully kissing it .
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 10]: ` Sit down , ' said Agnes , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 8]: ` Do n't be unhappy , Trotwood .
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 14]: If you can not confidently trust me , whom will you trust ? '
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 6]: ` Ah , Agnes ! '
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 3]: I returned .
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 8]: ` You are my good Angel ! '
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 13]: She smiled rather sadly , I thought , and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 9]: ` Yes , Agnes , my good Angel !
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 6]: Always my good Angel ! '
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 29]: ` If I were , indeed , Trotwood , ' she returned , ` there is one thing that I should set my heart on very much . '
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 15]: I looked at her inquiringly ; but already with a foreknowledge of her meaning .
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 21]: ` On warning you , ' said Agnes , with a steady glance , ` against your bad Angel . '
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 26]: ` My dear Agnes , ' I began , ` if you mean Steerforth -- ' ' I do , Trotwood , ' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 11]: ` Then , Agnes , you wrong him very much .
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 9]: He my bad Angel , or anyone 's !
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 16]: He , anything but a guide , a support , and a friend to me !
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 4]: My dear Agnes !
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 26]: Now , is it not unjust , and unlike you , to judge him from what you saw of me the other night ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 20]: I do not judge him from what I saw of you the other night , ' she quietly replied .
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 7]: ` From what , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 26]: ` From many things -- trifles in themselves , but they do not seem to me to be so , when they are put together .
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 26]: I judge him , partly from your account of him , Trotwood , and your character , and the influence he has over you . '
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 23]: There was always something in her modest voice that seemed to touch a chord within me , answering to that sound alone .
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 28]: It was always earnest ; but when it was very earnest , as it was now , there was a thrill in it that quite subdued me .
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 41]: I sat looking at her as she cast her eyes down on her work ; I sat seeming still to listen to her ; and Steerforth , in spite of all my attachment to him , darkened in that tone .
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 49]: ` It is very bold in me , ' said Agnes , looking up again , ` who have lived in such seclusion , and can know so little of the world , to give you my advice so confidently , or even to have this strong opinion .
Parsing [sent. 7884 len. 36]: But I know in what it is engendered , Trotwood , -- in how true a remembrance of our having grown up together , and in how true an interest in all relating to you .
Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 8]: It is that which makes me bold .
Parsing [sent. 7886 len. 10]: I am certain that what I say is right .
Parsing [sent. 7887 len. 7]: I am quite sure it is .
Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 29]: I feel as if it were someone else speaking to you , and not I , when I caution you that you have made a dangerous friend . '
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 33]: Again I looked at her , again I listened to her after she was silent , and again his image , though it was still fixed in my heart , darkened . '
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 60]: I am not so unreasonable as to expect , ' said Agnes , resuming her usual tone , after a little while , ` that you will , or that you can , at once , change any sentiment that has become a conviction to you ; least of all a sentiment that is rooted in your trusting disposition .
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 8]: You ought not hastily to do that .
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 53]: I only ask you , Trotwood , if you ever think of me -- I mean , ' with a quiet smile , for I was going to interrupt her , and she knew why , ` as often as you think of me -- to think of what I have said .
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 10]: Do you forgive me for all this ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 31]: I will forgive you , Agnes , ' I replied , ` when you come to do Steerforth justice , and to like him as well as I do . '
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 6]: ` Not until then ? '
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 3]: said Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 36]: I saw a passing shadow on her face when I made this mention of him , but she returned my smile , and we were again as unreserved in our mutual confidence as of old .
Parsing [sent. 7898 len. 20]: ` And when , Agnes , ' said I , ` will you forgive me the other night ? '
Parsing [sent. 7899 len. 10]: ` When I recall it , ' said Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 48]: She would have dismissed the subject so , but I was too full of it to allow that , and insisted on telling her how it happened that I had disgraced myself , and what chain of accidental circumstances had had the theatre for its final link .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 37]: It was a great relief to me to do this , and to enlarge on the obligation that I owed to Steerforth for his care of me when I was unable to take care of myself .
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 45]: ` You must not forget , ' said Agnes , calmly changing the conversation as soon as I had concluded , ` that you are always to tell me , not only when you fall into trouble , but when you fall in love .
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 10]: Who has succeeded to Miss Larkins , Trotwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 7]: ` No one , Agnes . '
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 17]: ` Someone , Trotwood , ' said Agnes , laughing , and holding up her finger .
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 9]: ` No , Agnes , upon my word !
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 37]: There is a lady , certainly , at Mrs. Steerforth 's house , who is very clever , and whom I like to talk to - Miss Dartle -- but I do n't adore her . '
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 63]: Agnes laughed again at her own penetration , and told me that if I were faithful to her in my confidence she thought she should keep a little register of my violent attachments , with the date , duration , and termination of each , like the table of the reigns of the kings and queens , in the History of England .
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 10]: Then she asked me if I had seen Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 5]: ` Uriah Heep ? '
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 5]: said I. ` No .
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 6]: Is he in London ? '
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 15]: ` He comes to the office downstairs , every day , ' returned Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 10]: ` He was in London a week before me .
Parsing [sent. 7915 len. 10]: I am afraid on disagreeable business , Trotwood . '
Parsing [sent. 7916 len. 24]: ` On some business that makes you uneasy , Agnes , I see , ' said I. ` What can that be ? '
Parsing [sent. 7917 len. 44]: Agnes laid aside her work , and replied , folding her hands upon one another , and looking pensively at me out of those beautiful soft eyes of hers : ' I believe he is going to enter into partnership with papa . '
Parsing [sent. 7918 len. 3]: ` What ?
Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 2]: Uriah ?
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 13]: That mean , fawning fellow , worm himself into such promotion ! '
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 5]: I cried , indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 11]: ` Have you made no remonstrance about it , Agnes ?
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 10]: Consider what a connexion it is likely to be .
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 5]: You must speak out .
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 13]: You must not allow your father to take such a mad step .
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 13]: You must prevent it , Agnes , while there 's time . '
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 35]: Still looking at me , Agnes shook her head while I was speaking , with a faint smile at my warmth : and then replied : ` You remember our last conversation about papa ?
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 28]: It was not long after that -- not more than two or three days -- when he gave me the first intimation of what I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 36]: It was sad to see him struggling between his desire to represent it to me as a matter of choice on his part , and his inability to conceal that it was forced upon him .
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 6]: I felt very sorry . '
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 7]: ` Forced upon him , Agnes !
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 7]: Who forces it upon him ? '
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 21]: ` Uriah , ' she replied , after a moment 's hesitation , ` has made himself indispensable to papa .
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 6]: He is subtle and watchful .
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 39]: He has mastered papa 's weaknesses , fostered them , and taken advantage of them , until -- to say all that I mean in a word , Trotwood , -- until papa is afraid of him . '
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 23]: There was more that she might have said ; more that she knew , or that she suspected ; I clearly saw .
Parsing [sent. 7937 len. 27]: I could not give her pain by asking what it was , for I knew that she withheld it from me , to spare her father .
Parsing [sent. 7938 len. 39]: It had long been going on to this , I was sensible : yes , I could not but feel , on the least reflection , that it had been going on to this for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 4]: I remained silent .
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 15]: ` His ascendancy over papa , ' said Agnes , ` is very great .
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 37]: He professes humility and gratitude -- with truth , perhaps : I hope so - but his position is really one of power , and I fear he makes a hard use of his power . '
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 20]: I said he was a hound , which , at the moment , was a great satisfaction to me .
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 50]: ` At the time I speak of , as the time when papa spoke to me , ' pursued Agnes , ` he had told papa that he was going away ; that he was very sorry , and unwilling to leave , but that he had better prospects .
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 49]: Papa was very much depressed then , and more bowed down by care than ever you or I have seen him ; but he seemed relieved by this expedient of the partnership , though at the same time he seemed hurt by it and ashamed of it . '
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 12]: ` And how did you receive it , Agnes ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 16]: I did , Trotwood , ' she replied , ` what I hope was right .
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 24]: Feeling sure that it was necessary for papa 's peace that the sacrifice should be made , I entreated him to make it .
Parsing [sent. 7948 len. 16]: I said it would lighten the load of his life -- I hope it will !
Parsing [sent. 7949 len. 14]: -- and that it would give me increased opportunities of being his companion .
Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 5]: Oh , Trotwood ! '
Parsing [sent. 7951 len. 36]: cried Agnes , putting her hands before her face , as her tears started on it , ' I almost feel as if I had been papa 's enemy , instead of his loving child .
Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 14]: For I know how he has altered , in his devotion to me .
Parsing [sent. 7953 len. 24]: I know how he has narrowed the circle of his sympathies and duties , in the concentration of his whole mind upon me .
Parsing [sent. 7954 len. 42]: I know what a multitude of things he has shut out for my sake , and how his anxious thoughts of me have shadowed his life , and weakened his strength and energy , by turning them always upon one idea .
Parsing [sent. 7955 len. 8]: If I could ever set this right !
Parsing [sent. 7956 len. 22]: If I could ever work out his restoration , as I have so innocently been the cause of his decline ! '
Parsing [sent. 7957 len. 8]: I had never before seen Agnes cry .
Parsing [sent. 7958 len. 59]: I had seen tears in her eyes when I had brought new honours home from school , and I had seen them there when we last spoke about her father , and I had seen her turn her gentle head aside when we took leave of one another ; but I had never seen her grieve like this .
Parsing [sent. 7959 len. 26]: It made me so sorry that I could only say , in a foolish , helpless manner , ` Pray , Agnes , do n't !
Parsing [sent. 7960 len. 8]: Do n't , my dear sister ! '
Parsing [sent. 7961 len. 36]: But Agnes was too superior to me in character and purpose , as I know well now , whatever I might know or not know then , to be long in need of my entreaties .
Parsing [sent. 7962 len. 33]: The beautiful , calm manner , which makes her so different in my remembrance from everybody else , came back again , as if a cloud had passed from a serene sky .
Parsing [sent. 7963 len. 37]: ` We are not likely to remain alone much longer , ' said Agnes , ` and while I have an opportunity , let me earnestly entreat you , Trotwood , to be friendly to Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 7964 len. 5]: Do n't repel him .
Parsing [sent. 7965 len. 24]: Do n't resent -LRB- as I think you have a general disposition to do -RRB- what may be uncongenial to you in him .
Parsing [sent. 7966 len. 15]: He may not deserve it , for we know no certain ill of him .
Parsing [sent. 7967 len. 12]: In any case , think first of papa and me ! '
Parsing [sent. 7968 len. 55]: Agnes had no time to say more , for the room door opened , and Mrs. Waterbrook , who was a large lady -- or who wore a large dress : I do n't exactly know which , for I do n't know which was dress and which was lady -- came sailing in .
Parsing [sent. 7969 len. 46]: I had a dim recollection of having seen her at the theatre , as if I had seen her in a pale magic lantern ; but she appeared to remember me perfectly , and still to suspect me of being in a state of intoxication .
Parsing [sent. 7970 len. 54]: Finding by degrees , however , that I was sober , and -LRB- I hope -RRB- that I was a modest young gentleman , Mrs. Waterbrook softened towards me considerably , and inquired , firstly , if I went much into the parks , and secondly , if I went much into society .
Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 39]: On my replying to both these questions in the negative , it occurred to me that I fell again in her good opinion ; but she concealed the fact gracefully , and invited me to dinner next day .
Parsing [sent. 7972 len. 33]: I accepted the invitation , and took my leave , making a call on Uriah in the office as I went out , and leaving a card for him in his absence .
Parsing [sent. 7973 len. 63]: When I went to dinner next day , and on the street door being opened , plunged into a vapour-bath of haunch of mutton , I divined that I was not the only guest , for I immediately identified the ticket-porter in disguise , assisting the family servant , and waiting at the foot of the stairs to carry up my name .
Parsing [sent. 7974 len. 41]: He looked , to the best of his ability , when he asked me for it confidentially , as if he had never seen me before ; but well did I know him , and well did he know me .
Parsing [sent. 7975 len. 7]: Conscience made cowards of us both .
Parsing [sent. 7976 len. 36]: I found Mr. Waterbrook to be a middle-aged gentleman , with a short throat , and a good deal of shirt-collar , who only wanted a black nose to be the portrait of a pug-dog .
Parsing [sent. 7977 len. 68]: He told me he was happy to have the honour of making my acquaintance ; and when I had paid my homage to Mrs. Waterbrook , presented me , with much ceremony , to a very awful lady in a black velvet dress , and a great black velvet hat , whom I remember as looking like a near relation of Hamlet 's -- say his aunt .
Parsing [sent. 7978 len. 37]: Mrs. Henry Spiker was this lady 's name ; and her husband was there too : so cold a man , that his head , instead of being grey , seemed to be sprinkled with hoar-frost .
Parsing [sent. 7979 len. 44]: Immense deference was shown to the Henry Spikers , male and female ; which Agnes told me was on account of Mr. Henry Spiker being solicitor to something Or to Somebody , I forget what or which , remotely connected with the Treasury .
Parsing [sent. 7980 len. 19]: I found Uriah Heep among the company , in a suit of black , and in deep humility .
Parsing [sent. 7981 len. 33]: He told me , when I shook hands with him , that he was proud to be noticed by me , and that he really felt obliged to me for my condescension .
Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 57]: I could have wished he had been less obliged to me , for he hovered about me in his gratitude all the rest of the evening ; and whenever I said a word to Agnes , was sure , with his shadowless eyes and cadaverous face , to be looking gauntly down upon us from behind .
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 20]: There were other guests -- all iced for the occasion , as it struck me , like the wine .
Parsing [sent. 7984 len. 24]: But there was one who attracted my attention before he came in , on account of my hearing him announced as Mr. Traddles !
Parsing [sent. 7985 len. 24]: My mind flew back to Salem House ; and could it be Tommy , I thought , who used to draw the skeletons !
Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 9]: I looked for Mr. Traddles with unusual interest .
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 47]: He was a sober , steady-looking young man of retiring manners , with a comic head of hair , and eyes that were rather wide open ; and he got into an obscure corner so soon , that I had some difficulty in making him out .
Parsing [sent. 7988 len. 25]: At length I had a good view of him , and either my vision deceived me , or it was the old unfortunate Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 7989 len. 25]: I made my way to Mr. Waterbrook , and said , that I believed I had the pleasure of seeing an old schoolfellow there .
Parsing [sent. 7990 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 7991 len. 6]: said Mr. Waterbrook , surprised .
Parsing [sent. 7992 len. 16]: ` You are too young to have been at school with Mr. Henry Spiker ? '
Parsing [sent. 7993 len. 10]: ` Oh , I do n't mean him ! '
Parsing [sent. 7994 len. 4]: I returned . '
Parsing [sent. 7995 len. 8]: I mean the gentleman named Traddles . '
Parsing [sent. 7996 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7997 len. 4]: Aye , aye !
Parsing [sent. 7998 len. 3]: Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 7999 len. 9]: said my host , with much diminished interest .
Parsing [sent. 8000 len. 4]: ` Possibly . '
Parsing [sent. 8001 len. 39]: ` If it 's really the same person , ' said I , glancing towards him , ` it was at a place called Salem House where we were together , and he was an excellent fellow . '
Parsing [sent. 8002 len. 4]: ` Oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 8003 len. 19]: Traddles is a good fellow , ' returned my host nodding his head with an air of toleration .
Parsing [sent. 8004 len. 9]: ` Traddles is quite a good fellow . '
Parsing [sent. 8005 len. 67]: ` It 's a curious coincidence , ' said I. ` It is really , ' returned my host , ` quite a coincidence , that Traddles should be here at all : as Traddles was only invited this morning , when the place at table , intended to be occupied by Mrs. Henry Spiker 's brother , became vacant , in consequence of his indisposition .
Parsing [sent. 8006 len. 15]: A very gentlemanly man , Mrs. Henry Spiker 's brother , Mr. Copperfield . '
Parsing [sent. 8007 len. 31]: I murmured an assent , which was full of feeling , considering that I knew nothing at all about him ; and I inquired what Mr. Traddles was by profession .
Parsing [sent. 8008 len. 18]: ` Traddles , ' returned Mr. Waterbrook , ` is a young man reading for the bar .
Parsing [sent. 8009 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8010 len. 15]: He is quite a good fellow -- nobody 's enemy but his own . '
Parsing [sent. 8011 len. 8]: ` Is he his own enemy ? '
Parsing [sent. 8012 len. 8]: said I , sorry to hear this .
Parsing [sent. 8013 len. 29]: ` Well , ' returned Mr. Waterbrook , pursing up his mouth , and playing with his watch-chain , in a comfortable , prosperous sort of way . '
Parsing [sent. 8014 len. 16]: I should say he was one of those men who stand in their own light .
Parsing [sent. 8015 len. 18]: Yes , I should say he would never , for example , be worth five hundred pound .
Parsing [sent. 8016 len. 10]: Traddles was recommended to me by a professional friend .
Parsing [sent. 8017 len. 3]: Oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 8018 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8019 len. 19]: He has a kind of talent for drawing briefs , and stating a case in writing , plainly .
Parsing [sent. 8020 len. 25]: I am able to throw something in Traddles 's way , in the course of the year ; something - for him -- considerable .
Parsing [sent. 8021 len. 3]: Oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 8022 len. 3]: Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 8023 len. 30]: I was much impressed by the extremely comfortable and satisfied manner in which Mr. Waterbrook delivered himself of this little word ` Yes ' , every now and then .
Parsing [sent. 8024 len. 7]: There was wonderful expression in it .
Parsing [sent. 8025 len. 70]: It completely conveyed the idea of a man who had been born , not to say with a silver spoon , but with a scaling-ladder , and had gone on mounting all the heights of life one after another , until now he looked , from the top of the fortifications , with the eye of a philosopher and a patron , on the people down in the trenches .
Parsing [sent. 8026 len. 14]: My reflections on this theme were still in progress when dinner was announced .
Parsing [sent. 8027 len. 9]: Mr. Waterbrook went down with Hamlet 's aunt .
Parsing [sent. 8028 len. 7]: Mr. Henry Spiker took Mrs. Waterbrook .
Parsing [sent. 8029 len. 21]: Agnes , whom I should have liked to take myself , was given to a simpering fellow with weak legs .
Parsing [sent. 8030 len. 23]: Uriah , Traddles , and I , as the junior part of the company , went down last , how we could .
Parsing [sent. 8031 len. 58]: I was not so vexed at losing Agnes as I might have been , since it gave me an opportunity of making myself known to Traddles on the stairs , who greeted me with great fervour ; while Uriah writhed with such obtrusive satisfaction and self-abasement , that I could gladly have pitched him over the banisters .
Parsing [sent. 8032 len. 35]: Traddles and I were separated at table , being billeted in two remote corners : he in the glare of a red velvet lady ; I , in the gloom of Hamlet 's aunt .
Parsing [sent. 8033 len. 17]: The dinner was very long , and the conversation was about the Aristocracy -- and Blood .
Parsing [sent. 8034 len. 17]: Mrs. Waterbrook repeatedly told us , that if she had a weakness , it was Blood .
Parsing [sent. 8035 len. 23]: It occurred to me several times that we should have got on better , if we had not been quite so genteel .
Parsing [sent. 8036 len. 13]: We were so exceedingly genteel , that our scope was very limited .
Parsing [sent. 8037 len. 54]: A Mr. and Mrs. Gulpidge were of the party , who had something to do at second-hand -LRB- at least , Mr. Gulpidge had -RRB- with the law business of the Bank ; and what with the Bank , and what with the Treasury , we were as exclusive as the Court Circular .
Parsing [sent. 8038 len. 35]: To mend the matter , Hamlet 's aunt had the family failing of indulging in soliloquy , and held forth in a desultory manner , by herself , on every topic that was introduced .
Parsing [sent. 8039 len. 32]: These were few enough , to be sure ; but as we always fell back upon Blood , she had as wide a field for abstract speculation as her nephew himself .
Parsing [sent. 8040 len. 18]: We might have been a party of Ogres , the conversation assumed such a sanguine complexion . '
Parsing [sent. 8041 len. 22]: I confess I am of Mrs. Waterbrook 's opinion , ' said Mr. Waterbrook , with his wine-glass at his eye .
Parsing [sent. 8042 len. 17]: ` Other things are all very well in their way , but give me Blood ! '
Parsing [sent. 8043 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8044 len. 16]: There is nothing , ' observed Hamlet 's aunt , ` so satisfactory to one !
Parsing [sent. 8045 len. 22]: There is nothing that is so much one 's beau-ideal of -- of all that sort of thing , speaking generally .
Parsing [sent. 8046 len. 34]: There are some low minds -LRB- not many , I am happy to believe , but there are some -RRB- that would prefer to do what I should call bow down before idols .
Parsing [sent. 8047 len. 3]: Positively Idols !
Parsing [sent. 8048 len. 9]: Before service , intellect , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 8049 len. 6]: But these are intangible points .
Parsing [sent. 8050 len. 5]: Blood is not so .
Parsing [sent. 8051 len. 12]: We see Blood in a nose , and we know it .
Parsing [sent. 8052 len. 17]: We meet with it in a chin , and we say , `` There it is !
Parsing [sent. 8053 len. 5]: That 's Blood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8054 len. 8]: It is an actual matter of fact .
Parsing [sent. 8055 len. 5]: We point it out .
Parsing [sent. 8056 len. 7]: It admits of no doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 8057 len. 24]: The simpering fellow with the weak legs , who had taken Agnes down , stated the question more decisively yet , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 8058 len. 34]: ` Oh , you know , deuce take it , ' said this gentleman , looking round the board with an imbecile smile , ` we ca n't forego Blood , you know .
Parsing [sent. 8059 len. 8]: We must have Blood , you know .
Parsing [sent. 8060 len. 68]: Some young fellows , you know , may be a little behind their station , perhaps , in point of education and behaviour , and may go a little wrong , you know , and get themselves and other people into a variety of fixes -- and all that -- but deuce take it , it 's delightful to reflect that they 've got Blood in 'em !
Parsing [sent. 8061 len. 35]: Myself , I 'd rather at any time be knocked down by a man who had got Blood in him , than I 'd be picked up by a man who had n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 8062 len. 29]: This sentiment , as compressing the general question into a nutshell , gave the utmost satisfaction , and brought the gentleman into great notice until the ladies retired .
Parsing [sent. 8063 len. 46]: After that , I observed that Mr. Gulpidge and Mr. Henry Spiker , who had hitherto been very distant , entered into a defensive alliance against us , the common enemy , and exchanged a mysterious dialogue across the table for our defeat and overthrow .
Parsing [sent. 8064 len. 29]: ` That affair of the first bond for four thousand five hundred pounds has not taken the course that was expected , Spiker , ' said Mr. Gulpidge .
Parsing [sent. 8065 len. 11]: ` Do you mean the D. of A. 's ? '
Parsing [sent. 8066 len. 4]: said Mr. Spiker .
Parsing [sent. 8067 len. 8]: ` The C. of B. 's ! '
Parsing [sent. 8068 len. 4]: said Mr. Gulpidge .
Parsing [sent. 8069 len. 11]: Mr. Spiker raised his eyebrows , and looked much concerned .
Parsing [sent. 8070 len. 59]: ` When the question was referred to Lord -- I need n't name him , ' said Mr. Gulpidge , checking himself -- ' I understand , ' said Mr. Spiker , ` N. ' Mr. Gulpidge darkly nodded -- ` was referred to him , his answer was , `` Money , or no release . '' '
Parsing [sent. 8071 len. 7]: ` Lord bless my soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 8072 len. 5]: cried Mr. Spiker . ''
Parsing [sent. 8073 len. 15]: ` Money , or no release , '' ' repeated Mr. Gulpidge , firmly .
Parsing [sent. 8074 len. 11]: ` The next in reversion -- you understand me ? '
Parsing [sent. 8075 len. 14]: ` K. , ' said Mr. Spiker , with an ominous look . '
Parsing [sent. 8076 len. 8]: - K. then positively refused to sign .
Parsing [sent. 8077 len. 18]: He was attended at Newmarket for that purpose , and he point-blank refused to do it . '
Parsing [sent. 8078 len. 12]: Mr. Spiker was so interested , that he became quite stony .
Parsing [sent. 8079 len. 21]: ` So the matter rests at this hour , ' said Mr. Gulpidge , throwing himself back in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 8080 len. 26]: ` Our friend Waterbrook will excuse me if I forbear to explain myself generally , on account of the magnitude of the interests involved . '
Parsing [sent. 8081 len. 30]: Mr. Waterbrook was only too happy , as it appeared to me , to have such interests , and such names , even hinted at , across his table .
Parsing [sent. 8082 len. 35]: He assumed an expression of gloomy intelligence -LRB- though I am persuaded he knew no more about the discussion than I did -RRB- , and highly approved of the discretion that had been observed .
Parsing [sent. 8083 len. 71]: Mr. Spiker , after the receipt of such a confidence , naturally desired to favour his friend with a confidence of his own ; therefore the foregoing dialogue was succeeded by another , in which it was Mr. Gulpidge 's turn to be surprised , and that by another in which the surprise came round to Mr. Spiker 's turn again , and so on , turn and turn about .
Parsing [sent. 8084 len. 37]: All this time we , the outsiders , remained oppressed by the tremendous interests involved in the conversation ; and our host regarded us with pride , as the victims of a salutary awe and astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 8085 len. 41]: I was very glad indeed to get upstairs to Agnes , and to talk with her in a corner , and to introduce Traddles to her , who was shy , but agreeable , and the same good-natured creature still .
Parsing [sent. 8086 len. 55]: As he was obliged to leave early , on account of going away next morning for a month , I had not nearly so much conversation with him as I could have wished ; but we exchanged addresses , and promised ourselves the pleasure of another meeting when he should come back to town .
Parsing [sent. 8087 len. 30]: He was greatly interested to hear that I knew Steerforth , and spoke of him with such warmth that I made him tell Agnes what he thought of him .
Parsing [sent. 8088 len. 21]: But Agnes only looked at me the while , and very slightly shook her head when only I observed her .
Parsing [sent. 8089 len. 49]: As she was not among people with whom I believed she could be very much at home , I was almost glad to hear that she was going away within a few days , though I was sorry at the prospect of parting from her again so soon .
Parsing [sent. 8090 len. 12]: This caused me to remain until all the company were gone .
Parsing [sent. 8091 len. 74]: Conversing with her , and hearing her sing , was such a delightful reminder to me of my happy life in the grave old house she had made so beautiful , that I could have remained there half the night ; but , having no excuse for staying any longer , when the lights of Mr. Waterbrook 's society were all snuffed out , I took my leave very much against my inclination .
Parsing [sent. 8092 len. 50]: I felt then , more than ever , that she was my better Angel ; and if I thought of her sweet face and placid smile , as though they had shone on me from some removed being , like an Angel , I hope I thought no harm .
Parsing [sent. 8093 len. 37]: I have said that the company were all gone ; but I ought to have excepted Uriah , whom I do n't include in that denomination , and who had never ceased to hover near us .
Parsing [sent. 8094 len. 10]: He was close behind me when I went downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 8095 len. 34]: He was close beside me , when I walked away from the house , slowly fitting his long skeleton fingers into the still longer fingers of a great Guy Fawkes pair of gloves .
Parsing [sent. 8096 len. 40]: It was in no disposition for Uriah 's company , but in remembrance of the entreaty Agnes had made to me , that I asked him if he would come home to my rooms , and have some coffee .
Parsing [sent. 8097 len. 52]: ` Oh , really , Master Copperfield , ' he rejoined -- ' I beg your pardon , Mister Copperfield , but the other comes so natural , I do n't like that you should put a constraint upon yourself to ask a numble person like me to your ouse . '
Parsing [sent. 8098 len. 19]: ` There is no constraint in the case , ' said I. ` Will you come ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8099 len. 16]: I should like to , very much , ' replied Uriah , with a writhe .
Parsing [sent. 8100 len. 9]: ` Well , then , come along ! '
Parsing [sent. 8101 len. 20]: said I. I could not help being rather short with him , but he appeared not to mind it .
Parsing [sent. 8102 len. 51]: We went the nearest way , without conversing much upon the road ; and he was so humble in respect of those scarecrow gloves , that he was still putting them on , and seemed to have made no advance in that labour , when we got to my place .
Parsing [sent. 8103 len. 42]: I led him up the dark stairs , to prevent his knocking his head against anything , and really his damp cold hand felt so like a frog in mine , that I was tempted to drop it and run away .
Parsing [sent. 8104 len. 15]: Agnes and hospitality prevailed , however , and I conducted him to my fireside .
Parsing [sent. 8105 len. 89]: When I lighted my candles , he fell into meek transports with the room that was revealed to him ; and when I heated the coffee in an unassuming block-tin vessel in which Mrs. Crupp delighted to prepare it -LRB- chiefly , I believe , because it was not intended for the purpose , being a shaving-pot , and because there was a patent invention of great price mouldering away in the pantry -RRB- , he professed so much emotion , that I could joyfully have scalded him .
Parsing [sent. 8106 len. 33]: ` Oh , really , Master Copperfield , -- I mean Mister Copperfield , ' said Uriah , ` to see you waiting upon me is what I never could have expected !
Parsing [sent. 8107 len. 39]: But , one way and another , so many things happen to me which I never could have expected , I am sure , in my umble station , that it seems to rain blessings on my ed .
Parsing [sent. 8108 len. 27]: You have heard something , I des-say , of a change in my expectations , Master Copperfield , -- I should say , Mister Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 8109 len. 103]: As he sat on my sofa , with his long knees drawn up under his coffee-cup , his hat and gloves upon the ground close to him , his spoon going softly round and round , his shadowless red eyes , which looked as if they had scorched their lashes off , turned towards me without looking at me , the disagreeable dints I have formerly described in his nostrils coming and going with his breath , and a snaky undulation pervading his frame from his chin to his boots , I decided in my own mind that I disliked him intensely .
Parsing [sent. 8110 len. 28]: It made me very uncomfortable to have him for a guest , for I was young then , and unused to disguise what I so strongly felt .
Parsing [sent. 8111 len. 28]: ` You have heard something , I des-say , of a change in my expectations , Master Copperfield , -- I should say , Mister Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 8112 len. 3]: observed Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 8113 len. 11]: ` Yes , ' said I , ` something . '
Parsing [sent. 8114 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8115 len. 10]: I thought Miss Agnes would know of it ! '
Parsing [sent. 8116 len. 4]: he quietly returned .
Parsing [sent. 8117 len. 12]: ` I 'm glad to find Miss Agnes knows of it .
Parsing [sent. 8118 len. 11]: Oh , thank you , Master -- Mister Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 8119 len. 32]: I could have thrown my bootjack at him -LRB- it lay ready on the rug -RRB- , for having entrapped me into the disclosure of anything concerning Agnes , however immaterial .
Parsing [sent. 8120 len. 7]: But I only drank my coffee .
Parsing [sent. 8121 len. 13]: ` What a prophet you have shown yourself , Mister Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 8122 len. 3]: pursued Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 8123 len. 14]: ` Dear me , what a prophet you have proved yourself to be !
Parsing [sent. 8124 len. 31]: Do n't you remember saying to me once , that perhaps I should be a partner in Mr. Wickfield 's business , and perhaps it might be Wickfield and Heep ?
Parsing [sent. 8125 len. 25]: You may not recollect it ; but when a person is umble , Master Copperfield , a person treasures such things up ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 8126 len. 23]: I recollect talking about it , ' said I , ` though I certainly did not think it very likely then . '
Parsing [sent. 8127 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8128 len. 11]: who would have thought it likely , Mister Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 8129 len. 6]: returned Uriah , enthusiastically . '
Parsing [sent. 8130 len. 8]: I am sure I did n't myself .
Parsing [sent. 8131 len. 14]: I recollect saying with my own lips that I was much too umble .
Parsing [sent. 8132 len. 9]: So I considered myself really and truly . '
Parsing [sent. 8133 len. 22]: He sat , with that carved grin on his face , looking at the fire , as I looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 8134 len. 22]: ` But the umblest persons , Master Copperfield , ' he presently resumed , ` may be the instruments of good .
Parsing [sent. 8135 len. 24]: I am glad to think I have been the instrument of good to Mr. Wickfield , and that I may be more so .
Parsing [sent. 8136 len. 20]: Oh what a worthy man he is , Mister Copperfield , but how imprudent he has been ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 8137 len. 25]: I am sorry to hear it , ' said I. I could not help adding , rather pointedly , ` on all accounts . '
Parsing [sent. 8138 len. 11]: ` Decidedly so , Mister Copperfield , ' replied Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 8139 len. 5]: ` On all accounts .
Parsing [sent. 8140 len. 6]: Miss Agnes 's above all !
Parsing [sent. 8141 len. 34]: You do n't remember your own eloquent expressions , Master Copperfield ; but I remember how you said one day that everybody must admire her , and how I thanked you for it !
Parsing [sent. 8142 len. 14]: You have forgot that , I have no doubt , Master Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 8143 len. 9]: ` No , ' said I , drily .
Parsing [sent. 8144 len. 11]: ` Oh how glad I am you have not ! '
Parsing [sent. 8145 len. 3]: exclaimed Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 8146 len. 28]: ` To think that you should be the first to kindle the sparks of ambition in my umble breast , and that you 've not forgot it !
Parsing [sent. 8147 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8148 len. 13]: -- Would you excuse me asking for a cup more coffee ? '
Parsing [sent. 8149 len. 44]: Something in the emphasis he laid upon the kindling of those sparks , and something in the glance he directed at me as he said it , had made me start as if I had seen him illuminated by a blaze of light .
Parsing [sent. 8150 len. 66]: Recalled by his request , preferred in quite another tone of voice , I did the honours of the shaving-pot ; but I did them with an unsteadiness of hand , a sudden sense of being no match for him , and a perplexed suspicious anxiety as to what he might be going to say next , which I felt could not escape his observation .
Parsing [sent. 8151 len. 6]: He said nothing at all .
Parsing [sent. 8152 len. 70]: He stirred his coffee round and round , he sipped it , he felt his chin softly with his grisly hand , he looked at the fire , he looked about the room , he gasped rather than smiled at me , he writhed and undulated about , in his deferential servility , he stirred and sipped again , but he left the renewal of the conversation to me .
Parsing [sent. 8153 len. 61]: ` So , Mr. Wickfield , ' said I , at last , ` who is worth five hundred of you -- or me ' ; for my life , I think , I could not have helped dividing that part of the sentence with an awkward jerk ; ` has been imprudent , has he , Mr. Heep ? '
Parsing [sent. 8154 len. 17]: ` Oh , very imprudent indeed , Master Copperfield , ' returned Uriah , sighing modestly .
Parsing [sent. 8155 len. 7]: ` Oh , very much so !
Parsing [sent. 8156 len. 13]: But I wish you 'd call me Uriah , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 8157 len. 7]: It 's like old times . '
Parsing [sent. 8158 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 8159 len. 13]: Uriah , ' said I , bolting it out with some difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 8160 len. 11]: ` Thank you , ' he returned , with fervour .
Parsing [sent. 8161 len. 7]: ` Thank you , Master Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 8162 len. 20]: It 's like the blowing of old breezes or the ringing of old bellses to hear YOU say Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 8163 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 8164 len. 7]: Was I making any observation ? '
Parsing [sent. 8165 len. 9]: ` About Mr. Wickfield , ' I suggested .
Parsing [sent. 8166 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8167 len. 8]: Yes , truly , ' said Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 8168 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8169 len. 6]: Great imprudence , Master Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 8170 len. 17]: It 's a topic that I would n't touch upon , to any soul but you .
Parsing [sent. 8171 len. 14]: Even to you I can only touch upon it , and no more .
Parsing [sent. 8172 len. 39]: If anyone else had been in my place during the last few years , by this time he would have had Mr. Wickfield -LRB- oh , what a worthy man he is , Master Copperfield , too ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 8173 len. 4]: under his thumb .
Parsing [sent. 8174 len. 42]: Un -- der -- his thumb , ' said Uriah , very slowly , as he stretched out his cruel-looking hand above my table , and pressed his own thumb upon it , until it shook , and shook the room .
Parsing [sent. 8175 len. 29]: If I had been obliged to look at him with him splay foot on Mr. Wickfield 's head , I think I could scarcely have hated him more .
Parsing [sent. 8176 len. 49]: ` Oh , dear , yes , Master Copperfield , ' he proceeded , in a soft voice , most remarkably contrasting with the action of his thumb , which did not diminish its hard pressure in the least degree , ` there 's no doubt of it .
Parsing [sent. 8177 len. 16]: There would have been loss , disgrace , I do n't know what at all .
Parsing [sent. 8178 len. 5]: Mr. Wickfield knows it .
Parsing [sent. 8179 len. 25]: I am the umble instrument of umbly serving him , and he puts me on an eminence I hardly could have hoped to reach .
Parsing [sent. 8180 len. 7]: How thankful should I be ! '
Parsing [sent. 8181 len. 49]: With his face turned towards me , as he finished , but without looking at me , he took his crooked thumb off the spot where he had planted it , and slowly and thoughtfully scraped his lank jaw with it , as if he were shaving himself .
Parsing [sent. 8182 len. 32]: I recollect well how indignantly my heart beat , as I saw his crafty face , with the appropriately red light of the fire upon it , preparing for something else .
Parsing [sent. 8183 len. 17]: ` Master Copperfield , ' he began -- ` but am I keeping you up ? '
Parsing [sent. 8184 len. 8]: ` You are not keeping me up .
Parsing [sent. 8185 len. 8]: I generally go to bed late . '
Parsing [sent. 8186 len. 7]: ` Thank you , Master Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 8187 len. 25]: I have risen from my umble station since first you used to address me , it is true ; but I am umble still .
Parsing [sent. 8188 len. 10]: I hope I never shall be otherwise than umble .
Parsing [sent. 8189 len. 22]: You will not think the worse of my umbleness , if I make a little confidence to you , Master Copperfield ?
Parsing [sent. 8190 len. 4]: Will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8191 len. 12]: ` Oh no , ' said I , with an effort .
Parsing [sent. 8192 len. 5]: ` Thank you ! '
Parsing [sent. 8193 len. 15]: He took out his pocket-handkerchief , and began wiping the palms of his hands .
Parsing [sent. 8194 len. 14]: ` Miss Agnes , Master Copperfield -- ' ` Well , Uriah ? '
Parsing [sent. 8195 len. 13]: ` Oh , how pleasant to be called Uriah , spontaneously ! '
Parsing [sent. 8196 len. 14]: he cried ; and gave himself a jerk , like a convulsive fish .
Parsing [sent. 8197 len. 14]: ` You thought her looking very beautiful tonight , Master Copperfield ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8198 len. 24]: I thought her looking as she always does : superior , in all respects , to everyone around her , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 8199 len. 6]: ` Oh , thank you !
Parsing [sent. 8200 len. 6]: It 's so true ! '
Parsing [sent. 8201 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 8202 len. 11]: ` Oh , thank you very much for that ! '
Parsing [sent. 8203 len. 11]: ` Not at all , ' I said , loftily .
Parsing [sent. 8204 len. 12]: ` There is no reason why you should thank me . '
Parsing [sent. 8205 len. 30]: ` Why that , Master Copperfield , ' said Uriah , ` is , in fact , the confidence that I am going to take the liberty of reposing .
Parsing [sent. 8206 len. 91]: Umble as I am , ' he wiped his hands harder , and looked at them and at the fire by turns , ` umble as my mother is , and lowly as our poor but honest roof has ever been , the image of Miss Agnes -LRB- I do n't mind trusting you with my secret , Master Copperfield , for I have always overflowed towards you since the first moment I had the pleasure of beholding you in a pony-shay -RRB- has been in my breast for years .
Parsing [sent. 8207 len. 21]: Oh , Master Copperfield , with what a pure affection do I love the ground my Agnes walks on ! '
Parsing [sent. 8208 len. 24]: I believe I had a delirious idea of seizing the red-hot poker out of the fire , and running him through with it .
Parsing [sent. 8209 len. 62]: It went from me with a shock , like a ball fired from a rifle : but the image of Agnes , outraged by so much as a thought of this red-headed animal 's , remained in my mind when I looked at him , sitting all awry as if his mean soul griped his body , and made me giddy .
Parsing [sent. 8210 len. 67]: He seemed to swell and grow before my eyes ; the room seemed full of the echoes of his voice ; and the strange feeling -LRB- to which , perhaps , no one is quite a stranger -RRB- that all this had occurred before , at some indefinite time , and that I knew what he was going to say next , took possession of me .
Parsing [sent. 8211 len. 41]: A timely observation of the sense of power that there was in his face , did more to bring back to my remembrance the entreaty of Agnes , in its full force , than any effort I could have made .
Parsing [sent. 8212 len. 30]: I asked him , with a better appearance of composure than I could have thought possible a minute before , whether he had made his feelings known to Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 8213 len. 8]: ` Oh no , Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 8214 len. 9]: he returned ; ` oh dear , no !
Parsing [sent. 8215 len. 6]: Not to anyone but you .
Parsing [sent. 8216 len. 12]: You see I am only just emerging from my lowly station .
Parsing [sent. 8217 len. 47]: I rest a good deal of hope on her observing how useful I am to her father -LRB- for I trust to be very useful to him indeed , Master Copperfield -RRB- , and how I smooth the way for him , and keep him straight .
Parsing [sent. 8218 len. 25]: She 's so much attached to her father , Master Copperfield -LRB- oh , what a lovely thing it is in a daughter ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 8219 len. 19]: , that I think she may come , on his account , to be kind to me . '
Parsing [sent. 8220 len. 19]: I fathomed the depth of the rascal 's whole scheme , and understood why he laid it bare .
Parsing [sent. 8221 len. 40]: ` If you 'll have the goodness to keep my secret , Master Copperfield , ' he pursued , ` and not , in general , to go against me , I shall take it as a particular favour .
Parsing [sent. 8222 len. 8]: You would n't wish to make unpleasantness .
Parsing [sent. 8223 len. 49]: I know what a friendly heart you 've got ; but having only known me on my umble footing -LRB- on my umblest I should say , for I am very umble still -RRB- , you might , unbeknown , go against me rather , with my Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 8224 len. 11]: I call her mine , you see , Master Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 8225 len. 19]: There 's a song that says , `` I 'd crowns resign , to call her mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8226 len. 12]: I hope to do it , one of these days . '
Parsing [sent. 8227 len. 3]: Dear Agnes !
Parsing [sent. 8228 len. 33]: So much too loving and too good for anyone that I could think of , was it possible that she was reserved to be the wife of such a wretch as this !
Parsing [sent. 8229 len. 37]: ` There 's no hurry at present , you know , Master Copperfield , ' Uriah proceeded , in his slimy way , as I sat gazing at him , with this thought in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 8230 len. 35]: ` My Agnes is very young still ; and mother and me will have to work our way upwards , and make a good many new arrangements , before it would be quite convenient .
Parsing [sent. 8231 len. 18]: So I shall have time gradually to make her familiar with my hopes , as opportunities offer .
Parsing [sent. 8232 len. 13]: Oh , I 'm so much obliged to you for this confidence !
Parsing [sent. 8233 len. 44]: Oh , it 's such a relief , you ca n't think , to know that you understand our situation , and are certain -LRB- as you would n't wish to make unpleasantness in the family -RRB- not to go against me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8234 len. 24]: He took the hand which I dared not withhold , and having given it a damp squeeze , referred to his pale-faced watch .
Parsing [sent. 8235 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8236 len. 9]: he said , ` it 's past one .
Parsing [sent. 8237 len. 25]: The moments slip away so , in the confidence of old times , Master Copperfield , that it 's almost half past one ! '
Parsing [sent. 8238 len. 10]: I answered that I had thought it was later .
Parsing [sent. 8239 len. 17]: Not that I had really thought so , but because my conversational powers were effectually scattered .
Parsing [sent. 8240 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8241 len. 5]: he said , considering .
Parsing [sent. 8242 len. 39]: ` The ouse that I am stopping at - a sort of a private hotel and boarding ouse , Master Copperfield , near the New River ed -- will have gone to bed these two hours . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8243 len. 36]: I am sorry , ' I returned , ` that there is only one bed here , and that I -- ' ` Oh , do n't think of mentioning beds , Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 8244 len. 9]: he rejoined ecstatically , drawing up one leg .
Parsing [sent. 8245 len. 16]: ` But would you have any objections to my laying down before the fire ? '
Parsing [sent. 8246 len. 27]: ` If it comes to that , ' I said , ` pray take my bed , and I 'll lie down before the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 8247 len. 106]: His repudiation of this offer was almost shrill enough , in the excess of its surprise and humility , to have penetrated to the ears of Mrs. Crupp , then sleeping , I suppose , in a distant chamber , situated at about the level of low-water mark , soothed in her slumbers by the ticking of an incorrigible clock , to which she always referred me when we had any little difference on the score of punctuality , and which was never less than three-quarters of an hour too slow , and had always been put right in the morning by the best authorities .
Parsing [sent. 8248 len. 45]: As no arguments I could urge , in my bewildered condition , had the least effect upon his modesty in inducing him to accept my bedroom , I was obliged to make the best arrangements I could , for his repose before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 8249 len. 52]: The mattress of the sofa -LRB- which was a great deal too short for his lank figure -RRB- , the sofa pillows , a blanket , the table-cover , a clean breakfast-cloth , and a great-coat , made him a bed and covering , for which he was more than thankful .
Parsing [sent. 8250 len. 38]: Having lent him a night-cap , which he put on at once , and in which he made such an awful figure , that I have never worn one since , I left him to his rest .
Parsing [sent. 8251 len. 7]: I never shall forget that night .
Parsing [sent. 8252 len. 68]: I never shall forget how I turned and tumbled ; how I wearied myself with thinking about Agnes and this creature ; how I considered what could I do , and what ought I to do ; how I could come to no other conclusion than that the best course for her peace was to do nothing , and to keep to myself what I had heard .
Parsing [sent. 8253 len. 51]: If I went to sleep for a few moments , the image of Agnes with her tender eyes , and of her father looking fondly on her , as I had so often seen him look , arose before me with appealing faces , and filled me with vague terrors .
Parsing [sent. 8254 len. 46]: When I awoke , the recollection that Uriah was lying in the next room , sat heavy on me like a waking nightmare ; and oppressed me with a leaden dread , as if I had had some meaner quality of devil for a lodger .
Parsing [sent. 8255 len. 15]: The poker got into my dozing thoughts besides , and would n't come out .
Parsing [sent. 8256 len. 32]: I thought , between sleeping and waking , that it was still red hot , and I had snatched it out of the fire , and run him through the body .
Parsing [sent. 8257 len. 31]: I was so haunted at last by the idea , though I knew there was nothing in it , that I stole into the next room to look at him .
Parsing [sent. 8258 len. 41]: There I saw him , lying on his back , with his legs extending to I do n't know where , gurglings taking place in his throat , stoppages in his nose , and his mouth open like a post-office .
Parsing [sent. 8259 len. 44]: He was so much worse in reality than in my distempered fancy , that afterwards I was attracted to him in very repulsion , and could not help wandering in and out every half-hour or so , and taking another look at him .
Parsing [sent. 8260 len. 25]: Still , the long , long night seemed heavy and hopeless as ever , and no promise of day was in the murky sky .
Parsing [sent. 8261 len. 16]: When I saw him going downstairs early in the morning -LRB- for , thank Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 8262 len. 23]: he would not stay to breakfast -RRB- , it appeared to me as if the night was going away in his person .
Parsing [sent. 8263 len. 34]: When I went out to the Commons , I charged Mrs. Crupp with particular directions to leave the windows open , that my sitting-room might be aired , and purged of his presence .
Parsing [sent. 8264 len. 22]: Chapter 26 I Fall into Captivity I saw no more of Uriah Heep , until the day when Agnes left town .
Parsing [sent. 8265 len. 29]: I was at the coach office to take leave of her and see her go ; and there was he , returning to Canterbury by the same conveyance .
Parsing [sent. 8266 len. 75]: It was some small satisfaction to me to observe his spare , short-waisted , high-shouldered , mulberry-coloured great-coat perched up , in company with an umbrella like a small tent , on the edge of the back seat on the roof , while Agnes was , of course , inside ; but what I underwent in my efforts to be friendly with him , while Agnes looked on , perhaps deserved that little recompense .
Parsing [sent. 8267 len. 42]: At the coach window , as at the dinner-party , he hovered about us without a moment 's intermission , like a great vulture : gorging himself on every syllable that I said to Agnes , or Agnes said to me .
Parsing [sent. 8268 len. 34]: In the state of trouble into which his disclosure by my fire had thrown me , I had thought very much of the words Agnes had used in reference to the partnership . '
Parsing [sent. 8269 len. 8]: I did what I hope was right .
Parsing [sent. 8270 len. 25]: Feeling sure that it was necessary for papa 's peace that the sacrifice should be made , I entreated him to make it . '
Parsing [sent. 8271 len. 32]: A miserable foreboding that she would yield to , and sustain herself by , the same feeling in reference to any sacrifice for his sake , had oppressed me ever since .
Parsing [sent. 8272 len. 7]: I knew how she loved him .
Parsing [sent. 8273 len. 10]: I knew what the devotion of her nature was .
Parsing [sent. 8274 len. 31]: I knew from her own lips that she regarded herself as the innocent cause of his errors , and as owing him a great debt she ardently desired to pay .
Parsing [sent. 8275 len. 49]: I had no consolation in seeing how different she was from this detestable Rufus with the mulberry-coloured great-coat , for I felt that in the very difference between them , in the self-denial of her pure soul and the sordid baseness of his , the greatest danger lay .
Parsing [sent. 8276 len. 19]: All this , doubtless , he knew thoroughly , and had , in his cunning , considered well .
Parsing [sent. 8277 len. 67]: Yet I was so certain that the prospect of such a sacrifice afar off , must destroy the happiness of Agnes ; and I was so sure , from her manner , of its being unseen by her then , and having cast no shadow on her yet ; that I could as soon have injured her , as given her any warning of what impended .
Parsing [sent. 8278 len. 40]: Thus it was that we parted without explanation : she waving her hand and smiling farewell from the coach window ; her evil genius writhing on the roof , as if he had her in his clutches and triumphed .
Parsing [sent. 8279 len. 15]: I could not get over this farewell glimpse of them for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 8280 len. 23]: When Agnes wrote to tell me of her safe arrival , I was as miserable as when I saw her going away .
Parsing [sent. 8281 len. 26]: Whenever I fell into a thoughtful state , this subject was sure to present itself , and all my uneasiness was sure to be redoubled .
Parsing [sent. 8282 len. 10]: Hardly a night passed without my dreaming of it .
Parsing [sent. 8283 len. 19]: It became a part of my life , and as inseparable from my life as my own head .
Parsing [sent. 8284 len. 37]: I had ample leisure to refine upon my uneasiness : for Steerforth was at Oxford , as he wrote to me , and when I was not at the Commons , I was very much alone .
Parsing [sent. 8285 len. 13]: I believe I had at this time some lurking distrust of Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 8286 len. 32]: I wrote to him most affectionately in reply to his , but I think I was glad , upon the whole , that he could not come to London just then .
Parsing [sent. 8287 len. 46]: I suspect the truth to be , that the influence of Agnes was upon me , undisturbed by the sight of him ; and that it was the more powerful with me , because she had so large a share in my thoughts and interest .
Parsing [sent. 8288 len. 10]: In the meantime , days and weeks slipped away .
Parsing [sent. 8289 len. 8]: I was articled to Spenlow and Jorkins .
Parsing [sent. 8290 len. 20]: I had ninety pounds a year -LRB- exclusive of my house-rent and sundry collateral matters -RRB- from my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 8291 len. 65]: My rooms were engaged for twelve months certain : and though I still found them dreary of an evening , and the evenings long , I could settle down into a state of equable low spirits , and resign myself to coffee ; which I seem , on looking back , to have taken by the gallon at about this period of my existence .
Parsing [sent. 8292 len. 89]: At about this time , too , I made three discoveries : first , that Mrs. Crupp was a martyr to a curious disorder called ` the spazzums ' , which was generally accompanied with inflammation of the nose , and required to be constantly treated with peppermint ; secondly , that something peculiar in the temperature of my pantry , made the brandy-bottles burst ; thirdly , that I was alone in the world , and much given to record that circumstance in fragments of English versification .
Parsing [sent. 8293 len. 35]: On the day when I was articled , no festivity took place , beyond my having sandwiches and sherry into the office for the clerks , and going alone to the theatre at night .
Parsing [sent. 8294 len. 37]: I went to see The Stranger , as a Doctors ' Commons sort of play , and was so dreadfully cut up , that I hardly knew myself in my own glass when I got home .
Parsing [sent. 8295 len. 61]: Mr. Spenlow remarked , on this occasion , when we concluded our business , that he should have been happy to have seen me at his house at Norwood to celebrate our becoming connected , but for his domestic arrangements being in some disorder , on account of the expected return of his daughter from finishing her education at Paris .
Parsing [sent. 8296 len. 20]: But , he intimated that when she came home he should hope to have the pleasure of entertaining me .
Parsing [sent. 8297 len. 16]: I knew that he was a widower with one daughter , and expressed my acknowledgements .
Parsing [sent. 8298 len. 9]: Mr. Spenlow was as good as his word .
Parsing [sent. 8299 len. 40]: In a week or two , he referred to this engagement , and said , that if I would do him the favour to come down next Saturday , and stay till Monday , he would be extremely happy .
Parsing [sent. 8300 len. 28]: Of course I said I would do him the favour ; and he was to drive me down in his phaeton , and to bring me back .
Parsing [sent. 8301 len. 29]: When the day arrived , my very carpet-bag was an object of veneration to the stipendiary clerks , to whom the house at Norwood was a sacred mystery .
Parsing [sent. 8302 len. 36]: One of them informed me that he had heard that Mr. Spenlow ate entirely off plate and china ; and another hinted at champagne being constantly on draught , after the usual custom of table-beer .
Parsing [sent. 8303 len. 37]: The old clerk with the wig , whose name was Mr. Tiffey , had been down on business several times in the course of his career , and had on each occasion penetrated to the breakfast-parlour .
Parsing [sent. 8304 len. 36]: He described it as an apartment of the most sumptuous nature , and said that he had drunk brown East India sherry there , of a quality so precious as to make a man wink .
Parsing [sent. 8305 len. 57]: We had an adjourned cause in the Consistory that day -- about excommunicating a baker who had been objecting in a vestry to a paving-rate -- and as the evidence was just twice the length of Robinson Crusoe , according to a calculation I made , it was rather late in the day before we finished .
Parsing [sent. 8306 len. 60]: However , we got him excommunicated for six weeks , and sentenced in no end of costs ; and then the baker 's proctor , and the judge , and the advocates on both sides -LRB- who were all nearly related -RRB- , went out of town together , and Mr. Spenlow and I drove away in the phaeton .
Parsing [sent. 8307 len. 29]: The phaeton was a very handsome affair ; the horses arched their necks and lifted up their legs as if they knew they belonged to Doctors ' Commons .
Parsing [sent. 8308 len. 74]: There was a good deal of competition in the Commons on all points of display , and it turned out some very choice equipages then ; though I always have considered , and always shall consider , that in my time the great article of competition there was starch : which I think was worn among the proctors to as great an extent as it is in the nature of man to bear .
Parsing [sent. 8309 len. 21]: We were very pleasant , going down , and Mr. Spenlow gave me some hints in reference to my profession .
Parsing [sent. 8310 len. 43]: He said it was the genteelest profession in the world , and must on no account be confounded with the profession of a solicitor : being quite another sort of thing , infinitely more exclusive , less mechanical , and more profitable .
Parsing [sent. 8311 len. 32]: We took things much more easily in the Commons than they could be taken anywhere else , he observed , and that set us , as a privileged class , apart .
Parsing [sent. 8312 len. 45]: He said it was impossible to conceal the disagreeable fact , that we were chiefly employed by solicitors ; but he gave me to understand that they were an inferior race of men , universally looked down upon by all proctors of any pretensions .
Parsing [sent. 8313 len. 14]: I asked Mr. Spenlow what he considered the best sort of professional business ?
Parsing [sent. 8314 len. 35]: He replied , that a good case of a disputed will , where there was a neat little estate of thirty or forty thousand pounds , was , perhaps , the best of all .
Parsing [sent. 8315 len. 93]: In such a case , he said , not only were there very pretty pickings , in the way of arguments at every stage of the proceedings , and mountains upon mountains of evidence on interrogatory and counter-interrogatory -LRB- to say nothing of an appeal lying , first to the Delegates , and then to the Lords -RRB- , but , the costs being pretty sure to come out of the estate at last , both sides went at it in a lively and spirited manner , and expense was no consideration .
Parsing [sent. 8316 len. 12]: Then , he launched into a general eulogium on the Commons .
Parsing [sent. 8317 len. 18]: What was to be particularly admired -LRB- he said -RRB- in the Commons , was its compactness .
Parsing [sent. 8318 len. 11]: It was the most conveniently organized place in the world .
Parsing [sent. 8319 len. 8]: It was the complete idea of snugness .
Parsing [sent. 8320 len. 6]: It lay in a nutshell .
Parsing [sent. 8321 len. 18]: For example : You brought a divorce case , or a restitution case , into the Consistory .
Parsing [sent. 8322 len. 3]: Very good .
Parsing [sent. 8323 len. 7]: You tried it in the Consistory .
Parsing [sent. 8324 len. 23]: You made a quiet little round game of it , among a family group , and you played it out at leisure .
Parsing [sent. 8325 len. 15]: Suppose you were not satisfied with the Consistory , what did you do then ?
Parsing [sent. 8326 len. 8]: Why , you went into the Arches .
Parsing [sent. 8327 len. 5]: What was the Arches ?
Parsing [sent. 8328 len. 36]: The same court , in the same room , with the same bar , and the same practitioners , but another judge , for there the Consistory judge could plead any court-day as an advocate .
Parsing [sent. 8329 len. 10]: Well , you played your round game out again .
Parsing [sent. 8330 len. 6]: Still you were not satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 8331 len. 3]: Very good .
Parsing [sent. 8332 len. 6]: What did you do then ?
Parsing [sent. 8333 len. 8]: Why , you went to the Delegates .
Parsing [sent. 8334 len. 5]: Who were the Delegates ?
Parsing [sent. 8335 len. 69]: Why , the Ecclesiastical Delegates were the advocates without any business , who had looked on at the round game when it was playing in both courts , and had seen the cards shuffled , and cut , and played , and had talked to all the players about it , and now came fresh , as judges , to settle the matter to the satisfaction of everybody !
Parsing [sent. 8336 len. 81]: Discontented people might talk of corruption in the Commons , closeness in the Commons , and the necessity of reforming the Commons , said Mr. Spenlow solemnly , in conclusion ; but when the price of wheat per bushel had been highest , the Commons had been busiest ; and a man might lay his hand upon his heart , and say this to the whole world , -- ` Touch the Commons , and down comes the country ! '
Parsing [sent. 8337 len. 43]: I listened to all this with attention ; and though , I must say , I had my doubts whether the country was quite as much obliged to the Commons as Mr. Spenlow made out , I respectfully deferred to his opinion .
Parsing [sent. 8338 len. 25]: That about the price of wheat per bushel , I modestly felt was too much for my strength , and quite settled the question .
Parsing [sent. 8339 len. 17]: I have never , to this hour , got the better of that bushel of wheat .
Parsing [sent. 8340 len. 20]: It has reappeared to annihilate me , all through my life , in connexion with all kinds of subjects .
Parsing [sent. 8341 len. 66]: I do n't know now , exactly , what it has to do with me , or what right it has to crush me , on an infinite variety of occasions ; but whenever I see my old friend the bushel brought in by the head and shoulders -LRB- as he always is , I observe -RRB- , I give up a subject for lost .
Parsing [sent. 8342 len. 5]: This is a digression .
Parsing [sent. 8343 len. 16]: I was not the man to touch the Commons , and bring down the country .
Parsing [sent. 8344 len. 48]: I submissively expressed , by my silence , my acquiescence in all I had heard from my superior in years and knowledge ; and we talked about The Stranger and the Drama , and the pairs of horses , until we came to Mr. Spenlow 's gate .
Parsing [sent. 8345 len. 39]: There was a lovely garden to Mr. Spenlow 's house ; and though that was not the best time of the year for seeing a garden , it was so beautifully kept , that I was quite enchanted .
Parsing [sent. 8346 len. 42]: There was a charming lawn , there were clusters of trees , and there were perspective walks that I could just distinguish in the dark , arched over with trellis-work , on which shrubs and flowers grew in the growing season .
Parsing [sent. 8347 len. 12]: ` Here Miss Spenlow walks by herself , ' I thought .
Parsing [sent. 8348 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8349 len. 37]: We went into the house , which was cheerfully lighted up , and into a hall where there were all sorts of hats , caps , great-coats , plaids , gloves , whips , and walking-sticks .
Parsing [sent. 8350 len. 7]: ` Where is Miss Dora ? '
Parsing [sent. 8351 len. 7]: said Mr. Spenlow to the servant .
Parsing [sent. 8352 len. 4]: ` Dora ! '
Parsing [sent. 8353 len. 3]: I thought .
Parsing [sent. 8354 len. 7]: ` What a beautiful name ! '
Parsing [sent. 8355 len. 51]: We turned into a room near at hand -LRB- I think it was the identical breakfast-room , made memorable by the brown East Indian sherry -RRB- , and I heard a voice say , ` Mr. Copperfield , my daughter Dora , and my daughter Dora 's confidential friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 8356 len. 27]: It was , no doubt , Mr. Spenlow 's voice , but I did n't know it , and I did n't care whose it was .
Parsing [sent. 8357 len. 7]: All was over in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 8358 len. 6]: I had fulfilled my destiny .
Parsing [sent. 8359 len. 8]: I was a captive and a slave .
Parsing [sent. 8360 len. 7]: I loved Dora Spenlow to distraction !
Parsing [sent. 8361 len. 8]: She was more than human to me .
Parsing [sent. 8362 len. 30]: She was a Fairy , a Sylph , I do n't know what she was -- anything that no one ever saw , and everything that everybody ever wanted .
Parsing [sent. 8363 len. 13]: I was swallowed up in an abyss of love in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 8364 len. 33]: There was no pausing on the brink ; no looking down , or looking back ; I was gone , headlong , before I had sense to say a word to her .
Parsing [sent. 8365 len. 25]: ` I , ' observed a well-remembered voice , when I had bowed and murmured something , ` have seen Mr. Copperfield before . '
Parsing [sent. 8366 len. 6]: The speaker was not Dora .
Parsing [sent. 8367 len. 9]: No ; the confidential friend , Miss Murdstone !
Parsing [sent. 8368 len. 9]: I do n't think I was much astonished .
Parsing [sent. 8369 len. 16]: To the best of my judgement , no capacity of astonishment was left in me .
Parsing [sent. 8370 len. 19]: There was nothing worth mentioning in the material world , but Dora Spenlow , to be astonished about .
Parsing [sent. 8371 len. 12]: I said , ` How do you do , Miss Murdstone ?
Parsing [sent. 8372 len. 7]: I hope you are well . '
Parsing [sent. 8373 len. 8]: She answered , ` Very well . '
Parsing [sent. 8374 len. 10]: I said , ` How is Mr. Murdstone ? '
Parsing [sent. 8375 len. 16]: She replied , ` My brother is robust , I am obliged to you . '
Parsing [sent. 8376 len. 25]: Mr. Spenlow , who , I suppose , had been surprised to see us recognize each other , then put in his word . '
Parsing [sent. 8377 len. 23]: I am glad to find , ' he said , ` Copperfield , that you and Miss Murdstone are already acquainted . '
Parsing [sent. 8378 len. 19]: ` Mr. Copperfield and myself , ' said Miss Murdstone , with severe composure , ` are connexions .
Parsing [sent. 8379 len. 6]: We were once slightly acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 8380 len. 7]: It was in his childish days .
Parsing [sent. 8381 len. 6]: Circumstances have separated us since .
Parsing [sent. 8382 len. 8]: I should not have known him . '
Parsing [sent. 8383 len. 11]: I replied that I should have known her , anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 8384 len. 5]: Which was true enough .
Parsing [sent. 8385 len. 36]: ` Miss Murdstone has had the goodness , ' said Mr. Spenlow to me , ` to accept the office -- if I may so describe it -- of my daughter Dora 's confidential friend .
Parsing [sent. 8386 len. 23]: My daughter Dora having , unhappily , no mother , Miss Murdstone is obliging enough to become her companion and protector . '
Parsing [sent. 8387 len. 31]: A passing thought occurred to me that Miss Murdstone , like the pocket instrument called a life-preserver , was not so much designed for purposes of protection as of assault .
Parsing [sent. 8388 len. 74]: But as I had none but passing thoughts for any subject save Dora , I glanced at her , directly afterwards , and was thinking that I saw , in her prettily pettish manner , that she was not very much inclined to be particularly confidential to her companion and protector , when a bell rang , which Mr. Spenlow said was the first dinner-bell , and so carried me off to dress .
Parsing [sent. 8389 len. 29]: The idea of dressing one 's self , or doing anything in the way of action , in that state of love , was a little too ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 8390 len. 28]: I could only sit down before my fire , biting the key of my carpet-bag , and think of the captivating , girlish , bright-eyed lovely Dora .
Parsing [sent. 8391 len. 21]: What a form she had , what a face she had , what a graceful , variable , enchanting manner !
Parsing [sent. 8392 len. 33]: The bell rang again so soon that I made a mere scramble of my dressing , instead of the careful operation I could have wished under the circumstances , and went downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 8393 len. 5]: There was some company .
Parsing [sent. 8394 len. 12]: Dora was talking to an old gentleman with a grey head .
Parsing [sent. 8395 len. 24]: Grey as he was -- and a great-grandfather into the bargain , for he said so -- I was madly jealous of him .
Parsing [sent. 8396 len. 9]: What a state of mind I was in !
Parsing [sent. 8397 len. 6]: I was jealous of everybody .
Parsing [sent. 8398 len. 16]: I could n't bear the idea of anybody knowing Mr. Spenlow better than I did .
Parsing [sent. 8399 len. 19]: It was torturing to me to hear them talk of occurrences in which I had had no share .
Parsing [sent. 8400 len. 45]: When a most amiable person , with a highly polished bald head , asked me across the dinner table , if that were the first occasion of my seeing the grounds , I could have done anything to him that was savage and revengeful .
Parsing [sent. 8401 len. 11]: I do n't remember who was there , except Dora .
Parsing [sent. 8402 len. 15]: I have not the least idea what we had for dinner , besides Dora .
Parsing [sent. 8403 len. 19]: My impression is , that I dined off Dora , entirely , and sent away half-a-dozen plates untouched .
Parsing [sent. 8404 len. 6]: I sat next to her .
Parsing [sent. 8405 len. 5]: I talked to her .
Parsing [sent. 8406 len. 31]: She had the most delightful little voice , the gayest little laugh , the pleasantest and most fascinating little ways , that ever led a lost youth into hopeless slavery .
Parsing [sent. 8407 len. 6]: She was rather diminutive altogether .
Parsing [sent. 8408 len. 9]: So much the more precious , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 8409 len. 41]: When she went out of the room with Miss Murdstone -LRB- no other ladies were of the party -RRB- , I fell into a reverie , only disturbed by the cruel apprehension that Miss Murdstone would disparage me to her .
Parsing [sent. 8410 len. 20]: The amiable creature with the polished head told me a long story , which I think was about gardening .
Parsing [sent. 8411 len. 15]: I think I heard him say , ` my gardener ' , several times .
Parsing [sent. 8412 len. 26]: I seemed to pay the deepest attention to him , but I was wandering in a garden of Eden all the while , with Dora .
Parsing [sent. 8413 len. 31]: My apprehensions of being disparaged to the object of my engrossing affection were revived when we went into the drawing-room , by the grim and distant aspect of Miss Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 8414 len. 11]: But I was relieved of them in an unexpected manner .
Parsing [sent. 8415 len. 17]: ` David Copperfield , ' said Miss Murdstone , beckoning me aside into a window . '
Parsing [sent. 8416 len. 4]: A word . '
Parsing [sent. 8417 len. 6]: I confronted Miss Murdstone alone .
Parsing [sent. 8418 len. 18]: ` David Copperfield , ' said Miss Murdstone , ' I need not enlarge upon family circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 8419 len. 8]: They are not a tempting subject . '
Parsing [sent. 8420 len. 11]: ` Far from it , ma'am , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 8421 len. 11]: ` Far from it , ' assented Miss Murdstone . '
Parsing [sent. 8422 len. 17]: I do not wish to revive the memory of past differences , or of past outrages .
Parsing [sent. 8423 len. 44]: I have received outrages from a person -- a female I am sorry to say , for the credit of my sex -- who is not to be mentioned without scorn and disgust ; and therefore I would rather not mention her . '
Parsing [sent. 8424 len. 29]: I felt very fiery on my aunt 's account ; but I said it would certainly be better , if Miss Murdstone pleased , not to mention her .
Parsing [sent. 8425 len. 20]: I could not hear her disrespectfully mentioned , I added , without expressing my opinion in a decided tone .
Parsing [sent. 8426 len. 46]: Miss Murdstone shut her eyes , and disdainfully inclined her head ; then , slowly opening her eyes , resumed : ` David Copperfield , I shall not attempt to disguise the fact , that I formed an unfavourable opinion of you in your childhood .
Parsing [sent. 8427 len. 17]: It may have been a mistaken one , or you may have ceased to justify it .
Parsing [sent. 8428 len. 9]: That is not in question between us now .
Parsing [sent. 8429 len. 25]: I belong to a family remarkable , I believe , for some firmness ; and I am not the creature of circumstance or change .
Parsing [sent. 8430 len. 8]: I may have my opinion of you .
Parsing [sent. 8431 len. 9]: You may have your opinion of me . '
Parsing [sent. 8432 len. 9]: I inclined my head , in my turn .
Parsing [sent. 8433 len. 22]: ` But it is not necessary , ' said Miss Murdstone , ` that these opinions should come into collision here .
Parsing [sent. 8434 len. 16]: Under existing circumstances , it is as well on all accounts that they should not .
Parsing [sent. 8435 len. 32]: As the chances of life have brought us together again , and may bring us together on other occasions , I would say , let us meet here as distant acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 8436 len. 32]: Family circumstances are a sufficient reason for our only meeting on that footing , and it is quite unnecessary that either of us should make the other the subject of remark .
Parsing [sent. 8437 len. 7]: Do you approve of this ? '
Parsing [sent. 8438 len. 28]: ` Miss Murdstone , ' I returned , ' I think you and Mr. Murdstone used me very cruelly , and treated my mother with great unkindness .
Parsing [sent. 8439 len. 12]: I shall always think so , as long as I live .
Parsing [sent. 8440 len. 10]: But I quite agree in what you propose . '
Parsing [sent. 8441 len. 12]: Miss Murdstone shut her eyes again , and bent her head .
Parsing [sent. 8442 len. 57]: Then , just touching the back of my hand with the tips of her cold , stiff fingers , she walked away , arranging the little fetters on her wrists and round her neck ; which seemed to be the same set , in exactly the same state , as when I had seen her last .
Parsing [sent. 8443 len. 36]: These reminded me , in reference to Miss Murdstone 's nature , of the fetters over a jail door ; suggesting on the outside , to all beholders , what was to be expected within .
Parsing [sent. 8444 len. 52]: All I know of the rest of the evening is , that I heard the empress of my heart sing enchanted ballads in the French language , generally to the effect that , whatever was the matter , we ought always to dance , Ta ra la , Ta ra la !
Parsing [sent. 8445 len. 11]: accompanying herself on a glorified instrument , resembling a guitar .
Parsing [sent. 8446 len. 8]: That I was lost in blissful delirium .
Parsing [sent. 8447 len. 5]: That I refused refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 8448 len. 8]: That my soul recoiled from punch particularly .
Parsing [sent. 8449 len. 22]: That when Miss Murdstone took her into custody and led her away , she smiled and gave me her delicious hand .
Parsing [sent. 8450 len. 17]: That I caught a view of myself in a mirror , looking perfectly imbecile and idiotic .
Parsing [sent. 8451 len. 23]: That I retired to bed in a most maudlin state of mind , and got up in a crisis of feeble infatuation .
Parsing [sent. 8452 len. 36]: It was a fine morning , and early , and I thought I would go and take a stroll down one of those wire-arched walks , and indulge my passion by dwelling on her image .
Parsing [sent. 8453 len. 22]: On my way through the hall , I encountered her little dog , who was called Jip -- short for Gipsy .
Parsing [sent. 8454 len. 37]: I approached him tenderly , for I loved even him ; but he showed his whole set of teeth , got under a chair expressly to snarl , and would n't hear of the least familiarity .
Parsing [sent. 8455 len. 7]: The garden was cool and solitary .
Parsing [sent. 8456 len. 24]: I walked about , wondering what my feelings of happiness would be , if I could ever become engaged to this dear wonder .
Parsing [sent. 8457 len. 30]: As to marriage , and fortune , and all that , I believe I was almost as innocently undesigning then , as when I loved little Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 8458 len. 60]: To be allowed to call her ` Dora ' , to write to her , to dote upon and worship her , to have reason to think that when she was with other people she was yet mindful of me , seemed to me the summit of human ambition -- I am sure it was the summit of mine .
Parsing [sent. 8459 len. 42]: There is no doubt whatever that I was a lackadaisical young spooney ; but there was a purity of heart in all this , that prevents my having quite a contemptuous recollection of it , let me laugh as I may .
Parsing [sent. 8460 len. 17]: I had not been walking long , when I turned a corner , and met her .
Parsing [sent. 8461 len. 22]: I tingle again from head to foot as my recollection turns that corner , and my pen shakes in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 8462 len. 34]: ` You -- are -- out early , Miss Spenlow , ' said I. ` It 's so stupid at home , ' she replied , ` and Miss Murdstone is so absurd !
Parsing [sent. 8463 len. 20]: She talks such nonsense about its being necessary for the day to be aired , before I come out .
Parsing [sent. 8464 len. 3]: Aired ! '
Parsing [sent. 8465 len. 13]: -LRB- She laughed , here , in the most melodious manner . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 8466 len. 17]: ` On a Sunday morning , when I do n't practise , I must do something .
Parsing [sent. 8467 len. 11]: So I told papa last night I must come out .
Parsing [sent. 8468 len. 12]: Besides , it 's the brightest time of the whole day .
Parsing [sent. 8469 len. 7]: Do n't you think so ? '
Parsing [sent. 8470 len. 34]: I hazarded a bold flight , and said -LRB- not without stammering -RRB- that it was very bright to me then , though it had been very dark to me a minute before .
Parsing [sent. 8471 len. 8]: ` Do you mean a compliment ? '
Parsing [sent. 8472 len. 13]: said Dora , ` or that the weather has really changed ? '
Parsing [sent. 8473 len. 34]: I stammered worse than before , in replying that I meant no compliment , but the plain truth ; though I was not aware of any change having taken place in the weather .
Parsing [sent. 8474 len. 19]: It was in the state of my own feelings , I added bashfully : to clench the explanation .
Parsing [sent. 8475 len. 17]: I never saw such curls -- how could I , for there never were such curls !
Parsing [sent. 8476 len. 11]: -- as those she shook out to hide her blushes .
Parsing [sent. 8477 len. 41]: As to the straw hat and blue ribbons which was on the top of the curls , if I could only have hung it up in my room in Buckingham Street , what a priceless possession it would have been !
Parsing [sent. 8478 len. 19]: ` You have just come home from Paris , ' said I. ` Yes , ' said she .
Parsing [sent. 8479 len. 8]: ` Have you ever been there ? '
Parsing [sent. 8480 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 8481 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8482 len. 7]: I hope you 'll go soon !
Parsing [sent. 8483 len. 8]: You would like it so much ! '
Parsing [sent. 8484 len. 9]: Traces of deep-seated anguish appeared in my countenance .
Parsing [sent. 8485 len. 21]: That she should hope I would go , that she should think it possible I could go , was insupportable .
Parsing [sent. 8486 len. 8]: I depreciated Paris ; I depreciated France .
Parsing [sent. 8487 len. 17]: I said I would n't leave England , under existing circumstances , for any earthly consideration .
Parsing [sent. 8488 len. 5]: Nothing should induce me .
Parsing [sent. 8489 len. 23]: In short , she was shaking the curls again , when the little dog came running along the walk to our relief .
Parsing [sent. 8490 len. 14]: He was mortally jealous of me , and persisted in barking at me .
Parsing [sent. 8491 len. 12]: She took him up in her arms -- oh my goodness !
Parsing [sent. 8492 len. 12]: -- and caressed him , but he persisted upon barking still .
Parsing [sent. 8493 len. 18]: He would n't let me touch him , when I tried ; and then she beat him .
Parsing [sent. 8494 len. 43]: It increased my sufferings greatly to see the pats she gave him for punishment on the bridge of his blunt nose , while he winked his eyes , and licked her hand , and still growled within himself like a little double-bass .
Parsing [sent. 8495 len. 18]: At length he was quiet -- well he might be with her dimpled chin upon his head !
Parsing [sent. 8496 len. 11]: -- and we walked away to look at a greenhouse .
Parsing [sent. 8497 len. 14]: ` You are not very intimate with Miss Murdstone , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8498 len. 3]: said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 8499 len. 6]: -- ` My pet . '
Parsing [sent. 8500 len. 10]: -LRB- The two last words were to the dog .
Parsing [sent. 8501 len. 11]: Oh , if they had only been to me ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 8502 len. 7]: ` No , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 8503 len. 7]: ` Not at all so . '
Parsing [sent. 8504 len. 14]: ` She is a tiresome creature , ' said Dora , pouting . '
Parsing [sent. 8505 len. 23]: I ca n't think what papa can have been about , when he chose such a vexatious thing to be my companion .
Parsing [sent. 8506 len. 5]: Who wants a protector ?
Parsing [sent. 8507 len. 10]: I am sure I do n't want a protector .
Parsing [sent. 8508 len. 22]: Jip can protect me a great deal better than Miss Murdstone , -- ca n't you , Jip , dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 8509 len. 14]: He only winked lazily , when she kissed his ball of a head .
Parsing [sent. 8510 len. 23]: ` Papa calls her my confidential friend , but I am sure she is no such thing -- is she , Jip ?
Parsing [sent. 8511 len. 16]: We are not going to confide in any such cross people , Jip and I .
Parsing [sent. 8512 len. 34]: We mean to bestow our confidence where we like , and to find out our own friends , instead of having them found out for us -- do n't we , Jip ? '
Parsing [sent. 8513 len. 18]: jip made a comfortable noise , in answer , a little like a tea-kettle when it sings .
Parsing [sent. 8514 len. 18]: As for me , every word was a new heap of fetters , riveted above the last .
Parsing [sent. 8515 len. 43]: ` It is very hard , because we have not a kind Mama , that we are to have , instead , a sulky , gloomy old thing like Miss Murdstone , always following us about -- is n't it , Jip ?
Parsing [sent. 8516 len. 5]: Never mind , Jip .
Parsing [sent. 8517 len. 39]: We wo n't be confidential , and we 'll make ourselves as happy as we can in spite of her , and we 'll tease her , and not please her -- wo n't we , Jip ? '
Parsing [sent. 8518 len. 40]: If it had lasted any longer , I think I must have gone down on my knees on the gravel , with the probability before me of grazing them , and of being presently ejected from the premises besides .
Parsing [sent. 8519 len. 20]: But , by good fortune the greenhouse was not far off , and these words brought us to it .
Parsing [sent. 8520 len. 9]: It contained quite a show of beautiful geraniums .
Parsing [sent. 8521 len. 59]: We loitered along in front of them , and Dora often stopped to admire this one or that one , and I stopped to admire the same one , and Dora , laughing , held the dog up childishly , to smell the flowers ; and if we were not all three in Fairyland , certainly I was .
Parsing [sent. 8522 len. 72]: The scent of a geranium leaf , at this day , strikes me with a half comical half serious wonder as to what change has come over me in a moment ; and then I see a straw hat and blue ribbons , and a quantity of curls , and a little black dog being held up , in two slender arms , against a bank of blossoms and bright leaves .
Parsing [sent. 8523 len. 8]: Miss Murdstone had been looking for us .
Parsing [sent. 8524 len. 27]: She found us here ; and presented her uncongenial cheek , the little wrinkles in it filled with hair powder , to Dora to be kissed .
Parsing [sent. 8525 len. 23]: Then she took Dora 's arm in hers , and marched us into breakfast as if it were a soldier 's funeral .
Parsing [sent. 8526 len. 18]: How many cups of tea I drank , because Dora made it , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 8527 len. 32]: But , I perfectly remember that I sat swilling tea until my whole nervous system , if I had had any in those days , must have gone by the board .
Parsing [sent. 8528 len. 8]: By and by we went to church .
Parsing [sent. 8529 len. 22]: Miss Murdstone was between Dora and me in the pew ; but I heard her sing , and the congregation vanished .
Parsing [sent. 8530 len. 24]: A sermon was delivered -- about Dora , of course -- and I am afraid that is all I know of the service .
Parsing [sent. 8531 len. 6]: We had a quiet day .
Parsing [sent. 8532 len. 40]: No company , a walk , a family dinner of four , and an evening of looking over books and pictures ; Miss Murdstone with a homily before her , and her eye upon us , keeping guard vigilantly .
Parsing [sent. 8533 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8534 len. 39]: little did Mr. Spenlow imagine , when he sat opposite to me after dinner that day , with his pocket-handkerchief over his head , how fervently I was embracing him , in my fancy , as his son-in-law !
Parsing [sent. 8535 len. 39]: Little did he think , when I took leave of him at night , that he had just given his full consent to my being engaged to Dora , and that I was invoking blessings on his head !
Parsing [sent. 8536 len. 72]: We departed early in the morning , for we had a Salvage case coming on in the Admiralty Court , requiring a rather accurate knowledge of the whole science of navigation , in which -LRB- as we could n't be expected to know much about those matters in the Commons -RRB- the judge had entreated two old Trinity Masters , for charity 's sake , to come and help him out .
Parsing [sent. 8537 len. 42]: Dora was at the breakfast-table to make the tea again , however ; and I had the melancholy pleasure of taking off my hat to her in the phaeton , as she stood on the door-step with Jip in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 8538 len. 117]: What the Admiralty was to me that day ; what nonsense I made of our case in my mind , as I listened to it ; how I saw ` DORA ' engraved upon the blade of the silver oar which they lay upon the table , as the emblem of that high jurisdiction ; and how I felt when Mr. Spenlow went home without me -LRB- I had had an insane hope that he might take me back again -RRB- , as if I were a mariner myself , and the ship to which I belonged had sailed away and left me on a desert island ; I shall make no fruitless effort to describe .
Parsing [sent. 8539 len. 31]: If that sleepy old court could rouse itself , and present in any visible form the daydreams I have had in it about Dora , it would reveal my truth .
Parsing [sent. 8540 len. 29]: I do n't mean the dreams that I dreamed on that day alone , but day after day , from week to week , and term to term .
Parsing [sent. 8541 len. 19]: I went there , not to attend to what was going on , but to think about Dora .
Parsing [sent. 8542 len. 83]: If ever I bestowed a thought upon the cases , as they dragged their slow length before me , it was only to wonder , in the matrimonial cases -LRB- remembering Dora -RRB- , how it was that married people could ever be otherwise than happy ; and , in the Prerogative cases , to consider , if the money in question had been left to me , what were the foremost steps I should immediately have taken in regard to Dora .
Parsing [sent. 8543 len. 52]: Within the first week of my passion , I bought four sumptuous waistcoats -- not for myself ; I had no pride in them ; for Dora -- and took to wearing straw-coloured kid gloves in the streets , and laid the foundations of all the corns I have ever had .
Parsing [sent. 8544 len. 39]: If the boots I wore at that period could only be produced and compared with the natural size of my feet , they would show what the state of my heart was , in a most affecting manner .
Parsing [sent. 8545 len. 30]: And yet , wretched cripple as I made myself by this act of homage to Dora , I walked miles upon miles daily in the hope of seeing her .
Parsing [sent. 8546 len. 25]: Not only was I soon as well known on the Norwood Road as the postmen on that beat , but I pervaded London likewise .
Parsing [sent. 8547 len. 39]: I walked about the streets where the best shops for ladies were , I haunted the Bazaar like an unquiet spirit , I fagged through the Park again and again , long after I was quite knocked up .
Parsing [sent. 8548 len. 14]: Sometimes , at long intervals and on rare occasions , I saw her .
Parsing [sent. 8549 len. 31]: Perhaps I saw her glove waved in a carriage window ; perhaps I met her , walked with her and Miss Murdstone a little way , and spoke to her .
Parsing [sent. 8550 len. 43]: In the latter case I was always very miserable afterwards , to think that I had said nothing to the purpose ; or that she had no idea of the extent of my devotion , or that she cared nothing about me .
Parsing [sent. 8551 len. 20]: I was always looking out , as may be supposed , for another invitation to Mr. Spenlow 's house .
Parsing [sent. 8552 len. 11]: I was always being disappointed , for I got none .
Parsing [sent. 8553 len. 88]: Mrs. Crupp must have been a woman of penetration ; for when this attachment was but a few weeks old , and I had not had the courage to write more explicitly even to Agnes , than that I had been to Mr. Spenlow 's house , ` whose family , ' I added , ` consists of one daughter ' ; -- I say Mrs. Crupp must have been a woman of penetration , for , even in that early stage , she found it out .
Parsing [sent. 8554 len. 87]: She came up to me one evening , when I was very low , to ask -LRB- she being then afflicted with the disorder I have mentioned -RRB- if I could oblige her with a little tincture of cardamums mixed with rhubarb , and flavoured with seven drops of the essence of cloves , which was the best remedy for her complaint ; -- or , if I had not such a thing by me , with a little brandy , which was the next best .
Parsing [sent. 8555 len. 19]: It was not , she remarked , so palatable to her , but it was the next best .
Parsing [sent. 8556 len. 55]: As I had never even heard of the first remedy , and always had the second in the closet , I gave Mrs. Crupp a glass of the second , which -LRB- that I might have no suspicion of its being devoted to any improper use -RRB- she began to take in my presence .
Parsing [sent. 8557 len. 12]: ` Cheer up , sir , ' said Mrs. Crupp . '
Parsing [sent. 8558 len. 18]: I ca n't abear to see you so , sir : I 'm a mother myself . '
Parsing [sent. 8559 len. 28]: I did not quite perceive the application of this fact to myself , but I smiled on Mrs. Crupp , as benignly as was in my power .
Parsing [sent. 8560 len. 10]: ` Come , sir , ' said Mrs. Crupp .
Parsing [sent. 8561 len. 4]: ` Excuse me .
Parsing [sent. 8562 len. 8]: I know what it is , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8563 len. 9]: There 's a lady in the case . '
Parsing [sent. 8564 len. 5]: ` Mrs. Crupp ? '
Parsing [sent. 8565 len. 5]: I returned , reddening .
Parsing [sent. 8566 len. 6]: ` Oh , bless you !
Parsing [sent. 8567 len. 8]: Keep a good heart , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 8568 len. 7]: said Mrs. Crupp , nodding encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 8569 len. 7]: ` Never say die , sir !
Parsing [sent. 8570 len. 15]: If She do n't smile upon you , there 's a many as will .
Parsing [sent. 8571 len. 23]: You are a young gentleman to be smiled on , Mr. Copperfull , and you must learn your walue , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8572 len. 37]: Mrs. Crupp always called me Mr. Copperfull : firstly , no doubt , because it was not my name ; and secondly , I am inclined to think , in some indistinct association with a washing-day .
Parsing [sent. 8573 len. 18]: ` What makes you suppose there is any young lady in the case , Mrs. Crupp ? '
Parsing [sent. 8574 len. 26]: said I. ` Mr. Copperfull , ' said Mrs. Crupp , with a great deal of feeling , ` I 'm a mother myself . '
Parsing [sent. 8575 len. 27]: For some time Mrs. Crupp could only lay her hand upon her nankeen bosom , and fortify herself against returning pain with sips of her medicine .
Parsing [sent. 8576 len. 6]: At length she spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 8577 len. 37]: ` When the present set were took for you by your dear aunt , Mr. Copperfull , ' said Mrs. Crupp , ` my remark were , I had now found summun I could care for .
Parsing [sent. 8578 len. 7]: `` Thank Ev ` in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8579 len. 16]: were the expression , `` I have now found summun I can care for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8580 len. 14]: -- You do n't eat enough , sir , nor yet drink . '
Parsing [sent. 8581 len. 14]: ` Is that what you found your supposition on , Mrs. Crupp ? '
Parsing [sent. 8582 len. 27]: said I. ` Sir , ' said Mrs. Crupp , in a tone approaching to severity , ` I 've laundressed other young gentlemen besides yourself .
Parsing [sent. 8583 len. 17]: A young gentleman may be over-careful of himself , or he may be under-careful of himself .
Parsing [sent. 8584 len. 12]: He may brush his hair too regular , or too un-regular .
Parsing [sent. 8585 len. 16]: He may wear his boots much too large for him , or much too small .
Parsing [sent. 8586 len. 13]: That is according as the young gentleman has his original character formed .
Parsing [sent. 8587 len. 23]: But let him go to which extreme he may , sir , there 's a young lady in both of 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 8588 len. 21]: Mrs. Crupp shook her head in such a determined manner , that I had not an inch of vantage-ground left .
Parsing [sent. 8589 len. 42]: ` It was but the gentleman which died here before yourself , ' said Mrs. Crupp , ` that fell in love -- with a barmaid -- and had his waistcoats took in directly , though much swelled by drinking . '
Parsing [sent. 8590 len. 37]: ` Mrs. Crupp , ' said I , ' I must beg you not to connect the young lady in my case with a barmaid , or anything of that sort , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 8591 len. 20]: ` Mr. Copperfull , ' returned Mrs. Crupp , ` I 'm a mother myself , and not likely .
Parsing [sent. 8592 len. 11]: I ask your pardon , sir , if I intrude .
Parsing [sent. 8593 len. 12]: I should never wish to intrude where I were not welcome .
Parsing [sent. 8594 len. 36]: But you are a young gentleman , Mr. Copperfull , and my adwice to you is , to cheer up , sir , to keep a good heart , and to know your own walue .
Parsing [sent. 8595 len. 44]: If you was to take to something , sir , ' said Mrs. Crupp , ` if you was to take to skittles , now , which is healthy , you might find it divert your mind , and do you good . '
Parsing [sent. 8596 len. 31]: With these words , Mrs. Crupp , affecting to be very careful of the brandy -- which was all gone -- thanked me with a majestic curtsey , and retired .
Parsing [sent. 8597 len. 70]: As her figure disappeared into the gloom of the entry , this counsel certainly presented itself to my mind in the light of a slight liberty on Mrs. Crupp 's part ; but , at the same time , I was content to receive it , in another point of view , as a word to the wise , and a warning in future to keep my secret better .
Parsing [sent. 8598 len. 58]: Chapter 27 Tommy Traddles It may have been in consequence of Mrs. Crupp 's advice , and , perhaps , for no better reason than because there was a certain similarity in the sound of the word skittles and Traddles , that it came into my head , next day , to go and look after Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 8599 len. 63]: The time he had mentioned was more than out , and he lived in a little street near the Veterinary College at Camden Town , which was principally tenanted , as one of our clerks who lived in that direction informed me , by gentlemen students , who bought live donkeys , and made experiments on those quadrupeds in their private apartments .
Parsing [sent. 8600 len. 28]: Having obtained from this clerk a direction to the academic grove in question , I set out , the same afternoon , to visit my old schoolfellow .
Parsing [sent. 8601 len. 26]: I found that the street was not as desirable a one as I could have wished it to be , for the sake of Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 8602 len. 42]: The inhabitants appeared to have a propensity to throw any little trifles they were not in want of , into the road : which not only made it rank and sloppy , but untidy too , on account of the cabbage-leaves .
Parsing [sent. 8603 len. 44]: The refuse was not wholly vegetable either , for I myself saw a shoe , a doubled-up saucepan , a black bonnet , and an umbrella , in various stages of decomposition , as I was looking out for the number I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 8604 len. 21]: The general air of the place reminded me forcibly of the days when I lived with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 8605 len. 75]: An indescribable character of faded gentility that attached to the house I sought , and made it unlike all the other houses in the street -- though they were all built on one monotonous pattern , and looked like the early copies of a blundering boy who was learning to make houses , and had not yet got out of his cramped brick-and-mortar pothooks -- reminded me still more of Mr. and Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 8606 len. 27]: Happening to arrive at the door as it was opened to the afternoon milkman , I was reminded of Mr. and Mrs. Micawber more forcibly yet .
Parsing [sent. 8607 len. 14]: ` Now , ' said the milkman to a very youthful servant girl .
Parsing [sent. 8608 len. 13]: ` Has that there little bill of mine been heerd on ? '
Parsing [sent. 8609 len. 17]: ` Oh , master says he 'll attend to it immediate , ' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 8610 len. 89]: ` Because , ' said the milkman , going on as if he had received no answer , and speaking , as I judged from his tone , rather for the edification of somebody within the house , than of the youthful servant -- an impression which was strengthened by his manner of glaring down the passage -- ` because that there little bill has been running so long , that I begin to believe it 's run away altogether , and never wo n't be heerd of .
Parsing [sent. 8611 len. 15]: Now , I 'm not a going to stand it , you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 8612 len. 18]: said the milkman , still throwing his voice into the house , and glaring down the passage .
Parsing [sent. 8613 len. 22]: As to his dealing in the mild article of milk , by the by , there never was a greater anomaly .
Parsing [sent. 8614 len. 13]: His deportment would have been fierce in a butcher or a brandy-merchant .
Parsing [sent. 8615 len. 34]: The voice of the youthful servant became faint , but she seemed to me , from the action of her lips , again to murmur that it would be attended to immediate . '
Parsing [sent. 8616 len. 34]: I tell you what , ' said the milkman , looking hard at her for the first time , and taking her by the chin , ` are you fond of milk ? '
Parsing [sent. 8617 len. 11]: ` Yes , I likes it , ' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 8618 len. 8]: ` Good , ' said the milkman .
Parsing [sent. 8619 len. 9]: ` Then you wo n't have none tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 8620 len. 3]: D'ye hear ?
Parsing [sent. 8621 len. 12]: Not a fragment of milk you wo n't have tomorrow . '
Parsing [sent. 8622 len. 18]: I thought she seemed , upon the whole , relieved by the prospect of having any today .
Parsing [sent. 8623 len. 35]: The milkman , after shaking his head at her darkly , released her chin , and with anything rather than good-will opened his can , and deposited the usual quantity in the family jug .
Parsing [sent. 8624 len. 24]: This done , he went away , muttering , and uttered the cry of his trade next door , in a vindictive shriek .
Parsing [sent. 8625 len. 8]: ` Does Mr. Traddles live here ? '
Parsing [sent. 8626 len. 4]: I then inquired .
Parsing [sent. 8627 len. 14]: A mysterious voice from the end of the passage replied ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 8628 len. 10]: Upon which the youthful servant replied ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 8629 len. 7]: ` Is he at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 8630 len. 18]: said I. Again the mysterious voice replied in the affirmative , and again the servant echoed it .
Parsing [sent. 8631 len. 43]: Upon this , I walked in , and in pursuance of the servant 's directions walked upstairs ; conscious , as I passed the back parlour-door , that I was surveyed by a mysterious eye , probably belonging to the mysterious voice .
Parsing [sent. 8632 len. 31]: When I got to the top of the stairs -- the house was only a story high above the ground floor -- Traddles was on the landing to meet me .
Parsing [sent. 8633 len. 21]: He was delighted to see me , and gave me welcome , with great heartiness , to his little room .
Parsing [sent. 8634 len. 17]: It was in the front of the house , and extremely neat , though sparely furnished .
Parsing [sent. 8635 len. 36]: It was his only room , I saw ; for there was a sofa-bedstead in it , and his blacking-brushes and blacking were among his books -- on the top shelf , behind a dictionary .
Parsing [sent. 8636 len. 18]: His table was covered with papers , and he was hard at work in an old coat .
Parsing [sent. 8637 len. 49]: I looked at nothing , that I know of , but I saw everything , even to the prospect of a church upon his china inkstand , as I sat down -- and this , too , was a faculty confirmed in me in the old Micawber times .
Parsing [sent. 8638 len. 78]: Various ingenious arrangements he had made , for the disguise of his chest of drawers , and the accommodation of his boots , his shaving-glass , and so forth , particularly impressed themselves upon me , as evidences of the same Traddles who used to make models of elephants ' dens in writing-paper to put flies in ; and to comfort himself under ill usage , with the memorable works of art I have so often mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 8639 len. 17]: In a corner of the room was something neatly covered up with a large white cloth .
Parsing [sent. 8640 len. 9]: I could not make out what that was .
Parsing [sent. 8641 len. 29]: ` Traddles , ' said I , shaking hands with him again , after I had sat down , ' I am delighted to see you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8642 len. 14]: I am delighted to see YOU , Copperfield , ' he returned . '
Parsing [sent. 8643 len. 9]: I am very glad indeed to see you .
Parsing [sent. 8644 len. 42]: It was because I was thoroughly glad to see you when we met in Ely Place , and was sure you were thoroughly glad to see me , that I gave you this address instead of my address at chambers . '
Parsing [sent. 8645 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8646 len. 5]: You have chambers ? '
Parsing [sent. 8647 len. 27]: said I. ` Why , I have the fourth of a room and a passage , and the fourth of a clerk , ' returned Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 8648 len. 24]: ` Three others and myself unite to have a set of chambers -- to look business-like -- and we quarter the clerk too .
Parsing [sent. 8649 len. 8]: Half-a-crown a week he costs me . '
Parsing [sent. 8650 len. 33]: His old simple character and good temper , and something of his old unlucky fortune also , I thought , smiled at me in the smile with which he made this explanation .
Parsing [sent. 8651 len. 31]: ` It 's not because I have the least pride , Copperfield , you understand , ' said Traddles , ` that I do n't usually give my address here .
Parsing [sent. 8652 len. 20]: It 's only on account of those who come to me , who might not like to come here .
Parsing [sent. 8653 len. 31]: For myself , I am fighting my way on in the world against difficulties , and it would be ridiculous if I made a pretence of doing anything else . '
Parsing [sent. 8654 len. 14]: ` You are reading for the bar , Mr. Waterbrook informed me ? '
Parsing [sent. 8655 len. 20]: said I. ` Why , yes , ' said Traddles , rubbing his hands slowly over one another . '
Parsing [sent. 8656 len. 7]: I am reading for the bar .
Parsing [sent. 8657 len. 19]: The fact is , I have just begun to keep my terms , after rather a long delay .
Parsing [sent. 8658 len. 21]: It 's some time since I was articled , but the payment of that hundred pounds was a great pull .
Parsing [sent. 8659 len. 5]: A great pull ! '
Parsing [sent. 8660 len. 16]: said Traddles , with a wince , as if he had had a tooth out .
Parsing [sent. 8661 len. 23]: ` Do you know what I ca n't help thinking of , Traddles , as I sit here looking at you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8662 len. 4]: I asked him .
Parsing [sent. 8663 len. 7]: ` No , ' said he .
Parsing [sent. 8664 len. 10]: ` That sky-blue suit you used to wear . '
Parsing [sent. 8665 len. 8]: ` Lord , to be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 8666 len. 5]: cried Traddles , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 8667 len. 11]: ` Tight in the arms and legs , you know ?
Parsing [sent. 8668 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 8669 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 8670 len. 11]: Those were happy times , were n't they ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8671 len. 26]: I think our schoolmaster might have made them happier , without doing any harm to any of us , I acknowledge , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 8672 len. 9]: ` Perhaps he might , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 8673 len. 15]: ` But dear me , there was a good deal of fun going on .
Parsing [sent. 8674 len. 9]: Do you remember the nights in the bedroom ?
Parsing [sent. 8675 len. 8]: When we used to have the suppers ?
Parsing [sent. 8676 len. 9]: And when you used to tell the stories ?
Parsing [sent. 8677 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 8678 len. 14]: And do you remember when I got caned for crying about Mr. Mell ?
Parsing [sent. 8679 len. 3]: Old Creakle !
Parsing [sent. 8680 len. 11]: I should like to see him again , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 8681 len. 33]: ` He was a brute to you , Traddles , ' said I , indignantly ; for his good humour made me feel as if I had seen him beaten but yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 8682 len. 7]: ` Do you think so ? '
Parsing [sent. 8683 len. 3]: returned Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 8684 len. 3]: ` Really ?
Parsing [sent. 8685 len. 5]: Perhaps he was rather .
Parsing [sent. 8686 len. 10]: But it 's all over , a long while .
Parsing [sent. 8687 len. 4]: Old Creakle ! '
Parsing [sent. 8688 len. 12]: ` You were brought up by an uncle , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 8689 len. 9]: said I. ` Of course I was ! '
Parsing [sent. 8690 len. 3]: said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 8691 len. 11]: ` The one I was always going to write to .
Parsing [sent. 8692 len. 7]: And always did n't , eh !
Parsing [sent. 8693 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 8694 len. 8]: Yes , I had an uncle then .
Parsing [sent. 8695 len. 9]: He died soon after I left school . '
Parsing [sent. 8696 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 8697 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8698 len. 11]: He was a retired -- what do you call it !
Parsing [sent. 8699 len. 12]: -- draper -- cloth-merchant -- and had made me his heir .
Parsing [sent. 8700 len. 12]: But he did n't like me when I grew up . '
Parsing [sent. 8701 len. 8]: ` Do you really mean that ? '
Parsing [sent. 8702 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 8703 len. 15]: He was so composed , that I fancied he must have some other meaning .
Parsing [sent. 8704 len. 8]: ` Oh dear , yes , Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 8705 len. 8]: I mean it , ' replied Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 8706 len. 16]: ` It was an unfortunate thing , but he did n't like me at all .
Parsing [sent. 8707 len. 19]: He said I was n't at all what he expected , and so he married his housekeeper . '
Parsing [sent. 8708 len. 8]: ` And what did you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 8709 len. 4]: I asked . '
Parsing [sent. 8710 len. 13]: I did n't do anything in particular , ' said Traddles . '
Parsing [sent. 8711 len. 45]: I lived with them , waiting to be put out in the world , until his gout unfortunately flew to his stomach -- and so he died , and so she married a young man , and so I was n't provided for . '
Parsing [sent. 8712 len. 12]: ` Did you get nothing , Traddles , after all ? '
Parsing [sent. 8713 len. 7]: ` Oh dear , yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 8714 len. 4]: said Traddles . '
Parsing [sent. 8715 len. 5]: I got fifty pounds .
Parsing [sent. 8716 len. 24]: I had never been brought up to any profession , and at first I was at a loss what to do for myself .
Parsing [sent. 8717 len. 32]: However , I began , with the assistance of the son of a professional man , who had been to Salem House -- Yawler , with his nose on one side .
Parsing [sent. 8718 len. 6]: Do you recollect him ? '
Parsing [sent. 8719 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 8720 len. 17]: He had not been there with me ; all the noses were straight in my day .
Parsing [sent. 8721 len. 11]: ` It do n't matter , ' said Traddles . '
Parsing [sent. 8722 len. 14]: I began , by means of his assistance , to copy law writings .
Parsing [sent. 8723 len. 27]: That did n't answer very well ; and then I began to state cases for them , and make abstracts , and that sort of work .
Parsing [sent. 8724 len. 22]: For I am a plodding kind of fellow , Copperfield , and had learnt the way of doing such things pithily .
Parsing [sent. 8725 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 8726 len. 28]: That put it in my head to enter myself as a law student ; and that ran away with all that was left of the fifty pounds .
Parsing [sent. 8727 len. 26]: Yawler recommended me to one or two other offices , however -- Mr. Waterbrook 's for one -- and I got a good many jobs .
Parsing [sent. 8728 len. 54]: I was fortunate enough , too , to become acquainted with a person in the publishing way , who was getting up an Encyclopaedia , and he set me to work ; and , indeed ' -LRB- glancing at his table -RRB- , ' I am at work for him at this minute .
Parsing [sent. 8729 len. 38]: I am not a bad compiler , Copperfield , ' said Traddles , preserving the same air of cheerful confidence in all he said , ` but I have no invention at all ; not a particle .
Parsing [sent. 8730 len. 16]: I suppose there never was a young man with less originality than I have . '
Parsing [sent. 8731 len. 41]: As Traddles seemed to expect that I should assent to this as a matter of course , I nodded ; and he went on , with the same sprightly patience -- I can find no better expression -- as before .
Parsing [sent. 8732 len. 64]: ` So , by little and little , and not living high , I managed to scrape up the hundred pounds at last , ' said Traddles ; ` and thank Heaven that 's paid -- though it was -- though it certainly was , ' said Traddles , wincing again as if he had had another tooth out , ' a pull .
Parsing [sent. 8733 len. 40]: I am living by the sort of work I have mentioned , still , and I hope , one of these days , to get connected with some newspaper : which would almost be the making of my fortune .
Parsing [sent. 8734 len. 36]: Now , Copperfield , you are so exactly what you used to be , with that agreeable face , and it 's so pleasant to see you , that I sha 'n' t conceal anything .
Parsing [sent. 8735 len. 10]: Therefore you must know that I am engaged . '
Parsing [sent. 8736 len. 2]: Engaged !
Parsing [sent. 8737 len. 4]: Oh , Dora !
Parsing [sent. 8738 len. 21]: ` She is a curate 's daughter , ' said Traddles ; ` one of ten , down in Devonshire .
Parsing [sent. 8739 len. 3]: Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 8740 len. 15]: For he saw me glance , involuntarily , at the prospect on the inkstand .
Parsing [sent. 8741 len. 6]: ` That 's the church !
Parsing [sent. 8742 len. 45]: You come round here to the left , out of this gate , ' tracing his finger along the inkstand , ` and exactly where I hold this pen , there stands the house -- facing , you understand , towards the church . '
Parsing [sent. 8743 len. 40]: The delight with which he entered into these particulars , did not fully present itself to me until afterwards ; for my selfish thoughts were making a ground-plan of Mr. Spenlow 's house and garden at the same moment .
Parsing [sent. 8744 len. 9]: ` She is such a dear girl ! '
Parsing [sent. 8745 len. 15]: said Traddles ; ' a little older than me , but the dearest girl !
Parsing [sent. 8746 len. 10]: I told you I was going out of town ?
Parsing [sent. 8747 len. 6]: I have been down there .
Parsing [sent. 8748 len. 17]: I walked there , and I walked back , and I had the most delightful time !
Parsing [sent. 8749 len. 23]: I dare say ours is likely to be a rather long engagement , but our motto is `` Wait and hope ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8750 len. 5]: We always say that .
Parsing [sent. 8751 len. 10]: `` Wait and hope , '' we always say .
Parsing [sent. 8752 len. 22]: And she would wait , Copperfield , till she was sixty -- any age you can mention -- for me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8753 len. 24]: Traddles rose from his chair , and , with a triumphant smile , put his hand upon the white cloth I had observed .
Parsing [sent. 8754 len. 21]: ` However , ' he said , ` it 's not that we have n't made a beginning towards housekeeping .
Parsing [sent. 8755 len. 8]: No , no ; we have begun .
Parsing [sent. 8756 len. 12]: We must get on by degrees , but we have begun .
Parsing [sent. 8757 len. 23]: Here , ' drawing the cloth off with great pride and care , ` are two pieces of furniture to commence with .
Parsing [sent. 8758 len. 9]: This flower-pot and stand , she bought herself .
Parsing [sent. 8759 len. 40]: You put that in a parlour window , ' said Traddles , falling a little back from it to survey it with the greater admiration , ` with a plant in it , and - and there you are !
Parsing [sent. 8760 len. 21]: This little round table with the marble top -LRB- it 's two feet ten in circumference -RRB- , I bought .
Parsing [sent. 8761 len. 42]: You want to lay a book down , you know , or somebody comes to see you or your wife , and wants a place to stand a cup of tea upon , and -- and there you are again ! '
Parsing [sent. 8762 len. 3]: said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 8763 len. 15]: ` It 's an admirable piece of workmanship -- firm as a rock ! '
Parsing [sent. 8764 len. 20]: I praised them both , highly , and Traddles replaced the covering as carefully as he had removed it .
Parsing [sent. 8765 len. 21]: ` It 's not a great deal towards the furnishing , ' said Traddles , ` but it 's something .
Parsing [sent. 8766 len. 20]: The table-cloths , and pillow-cases , and articles of that kind , are what discourage me most , Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 8767 len. 25]: So does the ironmongery -- candle-boxes , and gridirons , and that sort of necessaries -- because those things tell , and mount up .
Parsing [sent. 8768 len. 8]: However , `` wait and hope ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8769 len. 12]: And I assure you she 's the dearest girl ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 8770 len. 46]: I am quite certain of it , ' said I. ` In the meantime , ' said Traddles , coming back to his chair ; ` and this is the end of my prosing about myself , I get on as well as I can .
Parsing [sent. 8771 len. 13]: I do n't make much , but I do n't spend much .
Parsing [sent. 8772 len. 17]: In general , I board with the people downstairs , who are very agreeable people indeed .
Parsing [sent. 8773 len. 19]: Both Mr. and Mrs. Micawber have seen a good deal of life , and are excellent company . '
Parsing [sent. 8774 len. 6]: ` My dear Traddles ! '
Parsing [sent. 8775 len. 4]: I quickly exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 8776 len. 8]: ` What are you talking about ? '
Parsing [sent. 8777 len. 15]: Traddles looked at me , as if he wondered what I was talking about .
Parsing [sent. 8778 len. 7]: ` Mr. and Mrs. Micawber ! '
Parsing [sent. 8779 len. 3]: I repeated .
Parsing [sent. 8780 len. 11]: ` Why , I am intimately acquainted with them ! '
Parsing [sent. 8781 len. 47]: An opportune double knock at the door , which I knew well from old experience in Windsor Terrace , and which nobody but Mr. Micawber could ever have knocked at that door , resolved any doubt in my mind as to their being my old friends .
Parsing [sent. 8782 len. 11]: I begged Traddles to ask his landlord to walk up .
Parsing [sent. 8783 len. 49]: Traddles accordingly did so , over the banister ; and Mr. Micawber , not a bit changed -- his tights , his stick , his shirt-collar , and his eye-glass , all the same as ever -- came into the room with a genteel and youthful air . '
Parsing [sent. 8784 len. 32]: I beg your pardon , Mr. Traddles , ' said Mr. Micawber , with the old roll in his voice , as he checked himself in humming a soft tune . '
Parsing [sent. 8785 len. 20]: I was not aware that there was any individual , alien to this tenement , in your sanctum . '
Parsing [sent. 8786 len. 13]: Mr. Micawber slightly bowed to me , and pulled up his shirt-collar .
Parsing [sent. 8787 len. 10]: ` How do you do , Mr. Micawber ? '
Parsing [sent. 8788 len. 16]: said I. ` Sir , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` you are exceedingly obliging .
Parsing [sent. 8789 len. 7]: I am in statu quo . '
Parsing [sent. 8790 len. 6]: ` And Mrs. Micawber ? '
Parsing [sent. 8791 len. 3]: I pursued .
Parsing [sent. 8792 len. 21]: ` Sir , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` she is also , thank God , in statu quo . '
Parsing [sent. 8793 len. 9]: ` And the children , Mr. Micawber ? '
Parsing [sent. 8794 len. 26]: ` Sir , ' said Mr. Micawber , ' I rejoice to reply that they are , likewise , in the enjoyment of salubrity . '
Parsing [sent. 8795 len. 24]: All this time , Mr. Micawber had not known me in the least , though he had stood face to face with me .
Parsing [sent. 8796 len. 25]: But now , seeing me smile , he examined my features with more attention , fell back , cried , ` Is it possible !
Parsing [sent. 8797 len. 10]: Have I the pleasure of again beholding Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 8798 len. 11]: and shook me by both hands with the utmost fervour .
Parsing [sent. 8799 len. 8]: ` Good Heaven , Mr. Traddles ! '
Parsing [sent. 8800 len. 26]: said Mr. Micawber , ` to think that I should find you acquainted with the friend of my youth , the companion of earlier days !
Parsing [sent. 8801 len. 4]: My dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 8802 len. 25]: calling over the banisters to Mrs. Micawber , while Traddles looked -LRB- with reason -RRB- not a little amazed at this description of me .
Parsing [sent. 8803 len. 27]: ` Here is a gentleman in Mr. Traddles 's apartment , whom he wishes to have the pleasure of presenting to you , my love ! '
Parsing [sent. 8804 len. 12]: Mr. Micawber immediately reappeared , and shook hands with me again .
Parsing [sent. 8805 len. 13]: ` And how is our good friend the Doctor , Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 8806 len. 14]: said Mr. Micawber , ` and all the circle at Canterbury ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8807 len. 26]: I have none but good accounts of them , ' said I. ' I am most delighted to hear it , ' said Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 8808 len. 10]: ` It was at Canterbury where we last met .
Parsing [sent. 8809 len. 48]: Within the shadow , I may figuratively say , of that religious edifice immortalized by Chaucer , which was anciently the resort of Pilgrims from the remotest corners of -- in short , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` in the immediate neighbourhood of the Cathedral . '
Parsing [sent. 8810 len. 6]: I replied that it was .
Parsing [sent. 8811 len. 60]: Mr. Micawber continued talking as volubly as he could ; but not , I thought , without showing , by some marks of concern in his countenance , that he was sensible of sounds in the next room , as of Mrs. Micawber washing her hands , and hurriedly opening and shutting drawers that were uneasy in their action .
Parsing [sent. 8812 len. 58]: ` You find us , Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber , with one eye on Traddles , ` at present established , on what may be designated as a small and unassuming scale ; but , you are aware that I have , in the course of my career , surmounted difficulties , and conquered obstacles .
Parsing [sent. 8813 len. 64]: You are no stranger to the fact , that there have been periods of my life , when it has been requisite that I should pause , until certain expected events should turn up ; when it has been necessary that I should fall back , before making what I trust I shall not be accused of presumption in terming -- a spring .
Parsing [sent. 8814 len. 14]: The present is one of those momentous stages in the life of man .
Parsing [sent. 8815 len. 29]: You find me , fallen back , FOR a spring ; and I have every reason to believe that a vigorous leap will shortly be the result . '
Parsing [sent. 8816 len. 52]: I was expressing my satisfaction , when Mrs. Micawber came in ; a little more slatternly than she used to be , or so she seemed now , to my unaccustomed eyes , but still with some preparation of herself for company , and with a pair of brown gloves on .
Parsing [sent. 8817 len. 35]: ` My dear , ' said Mr. Micawber , leading her towards me , ` here is a gentleman of the name of Copperfield , who wishes to renew his acquaintance with you . '
Parsing [sent. 8818 len. 73]: It would have been better , as it turned out , to have led gently up to this announcement , for Mrs. Micawber , being in a delicate state of health , was overcome by it , and was taken so unwell , that Mr. Micawber was obliged , in great trepidation , to run down to the water-butt in the backyard , and draw a basinful to lave her brow with .
Parsing [sent. 8819 len. 14]: She presently revived , however , and was really pleased to see me .
Parsing [sent. 8820 len. 54]: We had half-an-hour 's talk , all together ; and I asked her about the twins , who , she said , were ` grown great creatures ' ; and after Master and Miss Micawber , whom she described as ` absolute giants ' , but they were not produced on that occasion .
Parsing [sent. 8821 len. 12]: Mr. Micawber was very anxious that I should stay to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 8822 len. 35]: I should not have been averse to do so , but that I imagined I detected trouble , and calculation relative to the extent of the cold meat , in Mrs. Micawber 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 8823 len. 25]: I therefore pleaded another engagement ; and observing that Mrs. Micawber 's spirits were immediately lightened , I resisted all persuasion to forego it .
Parsing [sent. 8824 len. 33]: But I told Traddles , and Mr. and Mrs. Micawber , that before I could think of leaving , they must appoint a day when they would come and dine with me .
Parsing [sent. 8825 len. 39]: The occupations to which Traddles stood pledged , rendered it necessary to fix a somewhat distant one ; but an appointment was made for the purpose , that suited us all , and then I took my leave .
Parsing [sent. 8826 len. 49]: Mr. Micawber , under pretence of showing me a nearer way than that by which I had come , accompanied me to the corner of the street ; being anxious -LRB- he explained to me -RRB- to say a few words to an old friend , in confidence .
Parsing [sent. 8827 len. 55]: ` My dear Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber , ' I need hardly tell you that to have beneath our roof , under existing circumstances , a mind like that which gleams -- if I may be allowed the expression -- which gleams -- in your friend Traddles , is an unspeakable comfort .
Parsing [sent. 8828 len. 44]: With a washerwoman , who exposes hard-bake for sale in her parlour-window , dwelling next door , and a Bow-street officer residing over the way , you may imagine that his society is a source of consolation to myself and to Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 8829 len. 18]: I am at present , my dear Copperfield , engaged in the sale of corn upon commission .
Parsing [sent. 8830 len. 32]: It is not an avocation of a remunerative description -- in other words , it does not pay -- and some temporary embarrassments of a pecuniary nature have been the consequence .
Parsing [sent. 8831 len. 60]: I am , however , delighted to add that I have now an immediate prospect of something turning up -LRB- I am not at liberty to say in what direction -RRB- , which I trust will enable me to provide , permanently , both for myself and for your friend Traddles , in whom I have an unaffected interest .
Parsing [sent. 8832 len. 46]: You may , perhaps , be prepared to hear that Mrs. Micawber is in a state of health which renders it not wholly improbable that an addition may be ultimately made to those pledges of affection which -- in short , to the infantine group .
Parsing [sent. 8833 len. 19]: Mrs. Micawber 's family have been so good as to express their dissatisfaction at this state of things .
Parsing [sent. 8834 len. 35]: I have merely to observe , that I am not aware that it is any business of theirs , and that I repel that exhibition of feeling with scorn , and with defiance ! '
Parsing [sent. 8835 len. 13]: Mr. Micawber then shook hands with me again , and left me .
Parsing [sent. 8836 len. 29]: Chapter 28 Mr. Micawber 's Gauntlet Until the day arrived on which I was to entertain my newly-found old friends , I lived principally on Dora and coffee .
Parsing [sent. 8837 len. 40]: In my love-lorn condition , my appetite languished ; and I was glad of it , for I felt as though it would have been an act of perfidy towards Dora to have a natural relish for my dinner .
Parsing [sent. 8838 len. 27]: The quantity of walking exercise I took , was not in this respect attended with its usual consequence , as the disappointment counteracted the fresh air .
Parsing [sent. 8839 len. 44]: I have my doubts , too , founded on the acute experience acquired at this period of my life , whether a sound enjoyment of animal food can develop itself freely in any human subject who is always in torment from tight boots .
Parsing [sent. 8840 len. 18]: I think the extremities require to be at peace before the stomach will conduct itself with vigour .
Parsing [sent. 8841 len. 18]: On the occasion of this domestic little party , I did not repeat my former extensive preparations .
Parsing [sent. 8842 len. 18]: I merely provided a pair of soles , a small leg of mutton , and a pigeon-pie .
Parsing [sent. 8843 len. 35]: Mrs. Crupp broke out into rebellion on my first bashful hint in reference to the cooking of the fish and joint , and said , with a dignified sense of injury , ` No !
Parsing [sent. 8844 len. 4]: No , sir !
Parsing [sent. 8845 len. 37]: You will not ask me sich a thing , for you are better acquainted with me than to suppose me capable of doing what I can not do with ampial satisfaction to my own feelings ! '
Parsing [sent. 8846 len. 32]: But , in the end , a compromise was effected ; and Mrs. Crupp consented to achieve this feat , on condition that I dined from home for a fortnight afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 8847 len. 27]: And here I may remark , that what I underwent from Mrs. Crupp , in consequence of the tyranny she established over me , was dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 8848 len. 9]: I never was so much afraid of anyone .
Parsing [sent. 8849 len. 7]: We made a compromise of everything .
Parsing [sent. 8850 len. 34]: If I hesitated , she was taken with that wonderful disorder which was always lying in ambush in her system , ready , at the shortest notice , to prey upon her vitals .
Parsing [sent. 8851 len. 80]: If I rang the bell impatiently , after half-a-dozen unavailing modest pulls , and she appeared at last -- which was not by any means to be relied upon -- she would appear with a reproachful aspect , sink breathless on a chair near the door , lay her hand upon her nankeen bosom , and become so ill , that I was glad , at any sacrifice of brandy or anything else , to get rid of her .
Parsing [sent. 8852 len. 46]: If I objected to having my bed made at five o'clock in the afternoon -- which I do still think an uncomfortable arrangement -- one motion of her hand towards the same nankeen region of wounded sensibility was enough to make me falter an apology .
Parsing [sent. 8853 len. 28]: In short , I would have done anything in an honourable way rather than give Mrs. Crupp offence ; and she was the terror of my life .
Parsing [sent. 8854 len. 57]: I bought a second-hand dumb-waiter for this dinner-party , in preference to re-engaging the handy young man ; against whom I had conceived a prejudice , in consequence of meeting him in the Strand , one Sunday morning , in a waistcoat remarkably like one of mine , which had been missing since the former occasion .
Parsing [sent. 8855 len. 61]: The ` young gal ' was re-engaged ; but on the stipulation that she should only bring in the dishes , and then withdraw to the landing-place , beyond the outer door ; where a habit of sniffing she had contracted would be lost upon the guests , and where her retiring on the plates would be a physical impossibility .
Parsing [sent. 8856 len. 83]: Having laid in the materials for a bowl of punch , to be compounded by Mr. Micawber ; having provided a bottle of lavender-water , two wax-candles , a paper of mixed pins , and a pincushion , to assist Mrs. Micawber in her toilette at my dressing-table ; having also caused the fire in my bedroom to be lighted for Mrs. Micawber 's convenience ; and having laid the cloth with my own hands , I awaited the result with composure .
Parsing [sent. 8857 len. 11]: At the appointed time , my three visitors arrived together .
Parsing [sent. 8858 len. 40]: Mr. Micawber with more shirt-collar than usual , and a new ribbon to his eye-glass ; Mrs. Micawber with her cap in a whitey-brown paper parcel ; Traddles carrying the parcel , and supporting Mrs. Micawber on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 8859 len. 8]: They were all delighted with my residence .
Parsing [sent. 8860 len. 39]: When I conducted Mrs. Micawber to my dressing-table , and she saw the scale on which it was prepared for her , she was in such raptures , that she called Mr. Micawber to come in and look .
Parsing [sent. 8861 len. 15]: ` My dear Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` this is luxurious .
Parsing [sent. 8862 len. 40]: This is a way of life which reminds me of the period when I was myself in a state of celibacy , and Mrs. Micawber had not yet been solicited to plight her faith at the Hymeneal altar . '
Parsing [sent. 8863 len. 18]: ` He means , solicited by him , Mr. Copperfield , ' said Mrs. Micawber , archly .
Parsing [sent. 8864 len. 9]: ` He can not answer for others . '
Parsing [sent. 8865 len. 22]: ` My dear , ' returned Mr. Micawber with sudden seriousness , ' I have no desire to answer for others .
Parsing [sent. 8866 len. 53]: I am too well aware that when , in the inscrutable decrees of Fate , you were reserved for me , it is possible you may have been reserved for one , destined , after a protracted struggle , at length to fall a victim to pecuniary involvements of a complicated nature .
Parsing [sent. 8867 len. 8]: I understand your allusion , my love .
Parsing [sent. 8868 len. 11]: I regret it , but I can bear it . '
Parsing [sent. 8869 len. 4]: ` Micawber ! '
Parsing [sent. 8870 len. 7]: exclaimed Mrs. Micawber , in tears .
Parsing [sent. 8871 len. 6]: ` Have I deserved this !
Parsing [sent. 8872 len. 17]: I , who never have deserted you ; who never WILL desert you , Micawber ! '
Parsing [sent. 8873 len. 76]: ` My love , ' said Mr. Micawber , much affected , ` you will forgive , and our old and tried friend Copperfield will , I am sure , forgive , the momentary laceration of a wounded spirit , made sensitive by a recent collision with the Minion of Power -- in other words , with a ribald Turncock attached to the water-works -- and will pity , not condemn , its excesses . '
Parsing [sent. 8874 len. 46]: Mr. Micawber then embraced Mrs. Micawber , and pressed my hand ; leaving me to infer from this broken allusion that his domestic supply of water had been cut off that afternoon , in consequence of default in the payment of the company 's rates .
Parsing [sent. 8875 len. 31]: To divert his thoughts from this melancholy subject , I informed Mr. Micawber that I relied upon him for a bowl of punch , and led him to the lemons .
Parsing [sent. 8876 len. 15]: His recent despondency , not to say despair , was gone in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 8877 len. 37]: I never saw a man so thoroughly enjoy himself amid the fragrance of lemon-peel and sugar , the odour of burning rum , and the steam of boiling water , as Mr. Micawber did that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 8878 len. 53]: It was wonderful to see his face shining at us out of a thin cloud of these delicate fumes , as he stirred , and mixed , and tasted , and looked as if he were making , instead of punch , a fortune for his family down to the latest posterity .
Parsing [sent. 8879 len. 47]: As to Mrs. Micawber , I do n't know whether it was the effect of the cap , or the lavender-water , or the pins , or the fire , or the wax-candles , but she came out of my room , comparatively speaking , lovely .
Parsing [sent. 8880 len. 11]: And the lark was never gayer than that excellent woman .
Parsing [sent. 8881 len. 26]: I suppose -- I never ventured to inquire , but I suppose -- that Mrs. Crupp , after frying the soles , was taken ill .
Parsing [sent. 8882 len. 8]: Because we broke down at that point .
Parsing [sent. 8883 len. 44]: The leg of mutton came up very red within , and very pale without : besides having a foreign substance of a gritty nature sprinkled over it , as if if had had a fall into the ashes of that remarkable kitchen fireplace .
Parsing [sent. 8884 len. 52]: But we were not in condition to judge of this fact from the appearance of the gravy , forasmuch as the ` young gal ' had dropped it all upon the stairs -- where it remained , by the by , in a long train , until it was worn out .
Parsing [sent. 8885 len. 35]: The pigeon-pie was not bad , but it was a delusive pie : the crust being like a disappointing head , phrenologically speaking : full of lumps and bumps , with nothing particular underneath .
Parsing [sent. 8886 len. 56]: In short , the banquet was such a failure that I should have been quite unhappy -- about the failure , I mean , for I was always unhappy about Dora -- if I had not been relieved by the great good humour of my company , and by a bright suggestion from Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 8887 len. 72]: ` My dear friend Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` accidents will occur in the best-regulated families ; and in families not regulated by that pervading influence which sanctifies while it enhances the - a -- I would say , in short , by the influence of Woman , in the lofty character of Wife , they may be expected with confidence , and must be borne with philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 8888 len. 72]: If you will allow me to take the liberty of remarking that there are few comestibles better , in their way , than a Devil , and that I believe , with a little division of labour , we could accomplish a good one if the young person in attendance could produce a gridiron , I would put it to you , that this little misfortune may be easily repaired . '
Parsing [sent. 8889 len. 18]: There was a gridiron in the pantry , on which my morning rasher of bacon was cooked .
Parsing [sent. 8890 len. 22]: We had it in , in a twinkling , and immediately applied ourselves to carrying Mr. Micawber 's idea into effect .
Parsing [sent. 8891 len. 86]: The division of labour to which he had referred was this : -- Traddles cut the mutton into slices ; Mr. Micawber -LRB- who could do anything of this sort to perfection -RRB- covered them with pepper , mustard , salt , and cayenne ; I put them on the gridiron , turned them with a fork , and took them off , under Mr. Micawber 's direction ; and Mrs. Micawber heated , and continually stirred , some mushroom ketchup in a little saucepan .
Parsing [sent. 8892 len. 49]: When we had slices enough done to begin upon , we fell-to , with our sleeves still tucked up at the wrist , more slices sputtering and blazing on the fire , and our attention divided between the mutton on our plates , and the mutton then preparing .
Parsing [sent. 8893 len. 83]: What with the novelty of this cookery , the excellence of it , the bustle of it , the frequent starting up to look after it , the frequent sitting down to dispose of it as the crisp slices came off the gridiron hot and hot , the being so busy , so flushed with the fire , so amused , and in the midst of such a tempting noise and savour , we reduced the leg of mutton to the bone .
Parsing [sent. 8894 len. 7]: My own appetite came back miraculously .
Parsing [sent. 8895 len. 19]: I am ashamed to record it , but I really believe I forgot Dora for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 8896 len. 26]: I am satisfied that Mr. and Mrs. Micawber could not have enjoyed the feast more , if they had sold a bed to provide it .
Parsing [sent. 8897 len. 16]: Traddles laughed as heartily , almost the whole time , as he ate and worked .
Parsing [sent. 8898 len. 20]: Indeed we all did , all at once ; and I dare say there was never a greater success .
Parsing [sent. 8899 len. 68]: We were at the height of our enjoyment , and were all busily engaged , in our several departments , endeavouring to bring the last batch of slices to a state of perfection that should crown the feast , when I was aware of a strange presence in the room , and my eyes encountered those of the staid Littimer , standing hat in hand before me .
Parsing [sent. 8900 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 8901 len. 5]: I involuntarily asked . '
Parsing [sent. 8902 len. 14]: I beg your pardon , sir , I was directed to come in .
Parsing [sent. 8903 len. 9]: Is my master not here , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8904 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 8905 len. 10]: ` Have you not seen him , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8906 len. 11]: ` No ; do n't you come from him ? '
Parsing [sent. 8907 len. 8]: ` Not immediately so , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8908 len. 12]: ` Did he tell you you would find him here ? '
Parsing [sent. 8909 len. 7]: ` Not exactly so , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8910 len. 19]: But I should think he might be here tomorrow , as he has not been here today . '
Parsing [sent. 8911 len. 10]: ` Is he coming up from Oxford ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8912 len. 25]: I beg , sir , ' he returned respectfully , ` that you will be seated , and allow me to do this . '
Parsing [sent. 8913 len. 27]: With which he took the fork from my unresisting hand , and bent over the gridiron , as if his whole attention were concentrated on it .
Parsing [sent. 8914 len. 35]: We should not have been much discomposed , I dare say , by the appearance of Steerforth himself , but we became in a moment the meekest of the meek before his respectable serving-man .
Parsing [sent. 8915 len. 45]: Mr. Micawber , humming a tune , to show that he was quite at ease , subsided into his chair , with the handle of a hastily concealed fork sticking out of the bosom of his coat , as if he had stabbed himself .
Parsing [sent. 8916 len. 14]: Mrs. Micawber put on her brown gloves , and assumed a genteel languor .
Parsing [sent. 8917 len. 23]: Traddles ran his greasy hands through his hair , and stood it bolt upright , and stared in confusion on the table-cloth .
Parsing [sent. 8918 len. 42]: As for me , I was a mere infant at the head of my own table ; and hardly ventured to glance at the respectable phenomenon , who had come from Heaven knows where , to put my establishment to rights .
Parsing [sent. 8919 len. 15]: Meanwhile he took the mutton off the gridiron , and gravely handed it round .
Parsing [sent. 8920 len. 23]: We all took some , but our appreciation of it was gone , and we merely made a show of eating it .
Parsing [sent. 8921 len. 19]: As we severally pushed away our plates , he noiselessly removed them , and set on the cheese .
Parsing [sent. 8922 len. 42]: He took that off , too , when it was done with ; cleared the table ; piled everything on the dumb-waiter ; gave us our wine-glasses ; and , of his own accord , wheeled the dumb-waiter into the pantry .
Parsing [sent. 8923 len. 21]: All this was done in a perfect manner , and he never raised his eyes from what he was about .
Parsing [sent. 8924 len. 29]: Yet his very elbows , when he had his back towards me , seemed to teem with the expression of his fixed opinion that I was extremely young .
Parsing [sent. 8925 len. 10]: ` Can I do anything more , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8926 len. 16]: I thanked him and said , No ; but would he take no dinner himself ?
Parsing [sent. 8927 len. 12]: ` None , I am obliged to you , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8928 len. 10]: ` Is Mr. Steerforth coming from Oxford ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8929 len. 8]: I beg your pardon , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8930 len. 10]: ` Is Mr. Steerforth coming from Oxford ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8931 len. 12]: I should imagine that he might be here tomorrow , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8932 len. 12]: I rather thought he might have been here today , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8933 len. 11]: The mistake is mine , no doubt , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8934 len. 31]: ` If you should see him first -- ' said I. ` If you 'll excuse me , sir , I do n't think I shall see him first . '
Parsing [sent. 8935 len. 33]: ` In case you do , ' said I , ` pray say that I am sorry he was not here today , as an old schoolfellow of his was here . '
Parsing [sent. 8936 len. 6]: ` Indeed , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 8937 len. 17]: and he divided a bow between me and Traddles , with a glance at the latter .
Parsing [sent. 8938 len. 34]: He was moving softly to the door , when , in a forlorn hope of saying something naturally -- which I never could , to this man -- I said : ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8939 len. 3]: Littimer ! '
Parsing [sent. 8940 len. 4]: ` Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 8941 len. 12]: ` Did you remain long at Yarmouth , that time ? '
Parsing [sent. 8942 len. 8]: ` Not particularly so , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8943 len. 8]: ` You saw the boat completed ? '
Parsing [sent. 8944 len. 5]: ` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8945 len. 13]: I remained behind on purpose to see the boat completed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8946 len. 4]: I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 8947 len. 8]: He raised his eyes to mine respectfully .
Parsing [sent. 8948 len. 14]: ` Mr. Steerforth has not seen it yet , I suppose ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8949 len. 8]: I really ca n't say , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8950 len. 12]: I think -- but I really ca n't say , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8951 len. 9]: I wish you good night , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8952 len. 19]: He comprehended everybody present , in the respectful bow with which he followed these words , and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 8953 len. 75]: My visitors seemed to breathe more freely when he was gone ; but my own relief was very great , for besides the constraint , arising from that extraordinary sense of being at a disadvantage which I always had in this man 's presence , my conscience had embarrassed me with whispers that I had mistrusted his master , and I could not repress a vague uneasy dread that he might find it out .
Parsing [sent. 8954 len. 26]: How was it , having so little in reality to conceal , that I always DID feel as if this man were finding me out ?
Parsing [sent. 8955 len. 41]: Mr. Micawber roused me from this reflection , which was blended with a certain remorseful apprehension of seeing Steerforth himself , by bestowing many encomiums on the absent Littimer as a most respectable fellow , and a thoroughly admirable servant .
Parsing [sent. 8956 len. 25]: Mr. Micawber , I may remark , had taken his full share of the general bow , and had received it with infinite condescension .
Parsing [sent. 8957 len. 27]: ` But punch , my dear Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber , tasting it , ` like time and tide , waits for no man .
Parsing [sent. 8958 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8959 len. 10]: it is at the present moment in high flavour .
Parsing [sent. 8960 len. 11]: My love , will you give me your opinion ? '
Parsing [sent. 8961 len. 6]: Mrs. Micawber pronounced it excellent .
Parsing [sent. 8962 len. 48]: ` Then I will drink , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` if my friend Copperfield will permit me to take that social liberty , to the days when my friend Copperfield and myself were younger , and fought our way in the world side by side .
Parsing [sent. 8963 len. 45]: I may say , of myself and Copperfield , in words we have sung together before now , that We twa hae run about the braes And pu 'd the gowans ' fine - in a figurative point of view -- on several occasions .
Parsing [sent. 8964 len. 60]: I am not exactly aware , ' said Mr. Micawber , with the old roll in his voice , and the old indescribable air of saying something genteel , ` what gowans may be , but I have no doubt that Copperfield and myself would frequently have taken a pull at them , if it had been feasible . '
Parsing [sent. 8965 len. 16]: Mr. Micawber , at the then present moment , took a pull at his punch .
Parsing [sent. 8966 len. 29]: So we all did : Traddles evidently lost in wondering at what distant time Mr. Micawber and I could have been comrades in the battle of the world .
Parsing [sent. 8967 len. 4]: ` Ahem ! '
Parsing [sent. 8968 len. 18]: said Mr. Micawber , clearing his throat , and warming with the punch and with the fire .
Parsing [sent. 8969 len. 8]: ` My dear , another glass ? '
Parsing [sent. 8970 len. 22]: Mrs. Micawber said it must be very little ; but we could n't allow that , so it was a glassful .
Parsing [sent. 8971 len. 44]: ` As we are quite confidential here , Mr. Copperfield , ' said Mrs. Micawber , sipping her punch , ` Mr. Traddles being a part of our domesticity , I should much like to have your opinion on Mr. Micawber 's prospects .
Parsing [sent. 8972 len. 29]: For corn , ' said Mrs. Micawber argumentatively , ` as I have repeatedly said to Mr. Micawber , may be gentlemanly , but it is not remunerative .
Parsing [sent. 8973 len. 24]: Commission to the extent of two and ninepence in a fortnight can not , however limited our ideas , be considered remunerative . '
Parsing [sent. 8974 len. 7]: We were all agreed upon that .
Parsing [sent. 8975 len. 47]: ` Then , ' said Mrs. Micawber , who prided herself on taking a clear view of things , and keeping Mr. Micawber straight by her woman 's wisdom , when he might otherwise go a little crooked , ` then I ask myself this question .
Parsing [sent. 8976 len. 12]: If corn is not to be relied upon , what is ?
Parsing [sent. 8977 len. 7]: Are coals to be relied upon ?
Parsing [sent. 8978 len. 4]: Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 8979 len. 23]: We have turned our attention to that experiment , on the suggestion of my family , and we find it fallacious . '
Parsing [sent. 8980 len. 37]: Mr. Micawber , leaning back in his chair with his hands in his pockets , eyed us aside , and nodded his head , as much as to say that the case was very clearly put .
Parsing [sent. 8981 len. 57]: ` The articles of corn and coals , ' said Mrs. Micawber , still more argumentatively , ` being equally out of the question , Mr. Copperfield , I naturally look round the world , and say , `` What is there in which a person of Mr. Micawber 's talent is likely to succeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8982 len. 16]: And I exclude the doing anything on commission , because commission is not a certainty .
Parsing [sent. 8983 len. 23]: What is best suited to a person of Mr. Micawber 's peculiar temperament is , I am convinced , a certainty . '
Parsing [sent. 8984 len. 32]: Traddles and I both expressed , by a feeling murmur , that this great discovery was no doubt true of Mr. Micawber , and that it did him much credit . '
Parsing [sent. 8985 len. 34]: I will not conceal from you , my dear Mr. Copperfield , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` that I have long felt the Brewing business to be particularly adapted to Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 8986 len. 6]: Look at Barclay and Perkins !
Parsing [sent. 8987 len. 9]: Look at Truman , Hanbury , and Buxton !
Parsing [sent. 8988 len. 35]: It is on that extensive footing that Mr. Micawber , I know from my own knowledge of him , is calculated to shine ; and the profits , I am told , are e-NOR-MOUS !
Parsing [sent. 8989 len. 39]: But if Mr. Micawber can not get into those firms -- which decline to answer his letters , when he offers his services even in an inferior capacity -- what is the use of dwelling upon that idea ?
Parsing [sent. 8990 len. 2]: None .
Parsing [sent. 8991 len. 15]: I may have a conviction that Mr. Micawber 's manners -- ' ` Hem !
Parsing [sent. 8992 len. 10]: Really , my dear , ' interposed Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 8993 len. 21]: ` My love , be silent , ' said Mrs. Micawber , laying her brown glove on his hand . '
Parsing [sent. 8994 len. 22]: I may have a conviction , Mr. Copperfield , that Mr. Micawber 's manners peculiarly qualify him for the Banking business .
Parsing [sent. 8995 len. 37]: I may argue within myself , that if I had a deposit at a banking-house , the manners of Mr. Micawber , as representing that banking-house , would inspire confidence , and must extend the connexion .
Parsing [sent. 8996 len. 34]: But if the various banking-houses refuse to avail themselves of Mr. Micawber 's abilities , or receive the offer of them with contumely , what is the use of dwelling upon THAT idea ?
Parsing [sent. 8997 len. 2]: None .
Parsing [sent. 8998 len. 39]: As to originating a banking-business , I may know that there are members of my family who , if they chose to place their money in Mr. Micawber 's hands , might found an establishment of that description .
Parsing [sent. 8999 len. 28]: But if they do NOT choose to place their money in Mr. Micawber 's hands -- which they do n't -- what is the use of that ?
Parsing [sent. 9000 len. 15]: Again I contend that we are no farther advanced than we were before . '
Parsing [sent. 9001 len. 14]: I shook my head , and said , ` Not a bit . '
Parsing [sent. 9002 len. 15]: Traddles also shook his head , and said , ` Not a bit . '
Parsing [sent. 9003 len. 9]: ` What do I deduce from this ? '
Parsing [sent. 9004 len. 18]: Mrs. Micawber went on to say , still with the same air of putting a case lucidly .
Parsing [sent. 9005 len. 18]: ` What is the conclusion , my dear Mr. Copperfield , to which I am irresistibly brought ?
Parsing [sent. 9006 len. 15]: Am I wrong in saying , it is clear that we must live ? '
Parsing [sent. 9007 len. 8]: I answered ` Not at all ! '
Parsing [sent. 9008 len. 9]: and Traddles answered ` Not at all ! '
Parsing [sent. 9009 len. 19]: and I found myself afterwards sagely adding , alone , that a person must either live or die .
Parsing [sent. 9010 len. 15]: ` Just so , ' returned Mrs. Micawber , ` It is precisely that .
Parsing [sent. 9011 len. 26]: And the fact is , my dear Mr. Copperfield , that we can not live without something widely different from existing circumstances shortly turning up .
Parsing [sent. 9012 len. 33]: Now I am convinced , myself , and this I have pointed out to Mr. Micawber several times of late , that things can not be expected to turn up of themselves .
Parsing [sent. 9013 len. 13]: We must , in a measure , assist to turn them up .
Parsing [sent. 9014 len. 13]: I may be wrong , but I have formed that opinion . '
Parsing [sent. 9015 len. 8]: Both Traddles and I applauded it highly .
Parsing [sent. 9016 len. 9]: ` Very well , ' said Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 9017 len. 7]: ` Then what do I recommend ?
Parsing [sent. 9018 len. 26]: Here is Mr. Micawber with a variety of qualifications -- with great talent -- ' ` Really , my love , ' said Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 9019 len. 11]: ` Pray , my dear , allow me to conclude .
Parsing [sent. 9020 len. 42]: Here is Mr. Micawber , with a variety of qualifications , with great talent -- I should say , with genius , but that may be the partiality of a wife -- ' Traddles and I both murmured ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 9021 len. 13]: ` And here is Mr. Micawber without any suitable position or employment .
Parsing [sent. 9022 len. 6]: Where does that responsibility rest ?
Parsing [sent. 9023 len. 4]: Clearly on society .
Parsing [sent. 9024 len. 19]: Then I would make a fact so disgraceful known , and boldly challenge society to set it right .
Parsing [sent. 9025 len. 50]: It appears to me , my dear Mr. Copperfield , ' said Mrs. Micawber , forcibly , ` that what Mr. Micawber has to do , is to throw down the gauntlet to society , and say , in effect , `` Show me who will take that up .
Parsing [sent. 9026 len. 9]: Let the party immediately step forward . '' '
Parsing [sent. 9027 len. 13]: I ventured to ask Mrs. Micawber how this was to be done .
Parsing [sent. 9028 len. 15]: ` By advertising , ' said Mrs. Micawber -- ` in all the papers .
Parsing [sent. 9029 len. 99]: It appears to me , that what Mr. Micawber has to do , in justice to himself , in justice to his family , and I will even go so far as to say in justice to society , by which he has been hitherto overlooked , is to advertise in all the papers ; to describe himself plainly as so-and-so , with such and such qualifications and to put it thus : `` Now employ me , on remunerative terms , and address , post-paid , to W. M. , Post Office , Camden Town . '' '
Parsing [sent. 9030 len. 57]: ` This idea of Mrs. Micawber 's , my dear Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber , making his shirt-collar meet in front of his chin , and glancing at me sideways , ` is , in fact , the Leap to which I alluded , when I last had the pleasure of seeing you . '
Parsing [sent. 9031 len. 12]: ` Advertising is rather expensive , ' I remarked , dubiously .
Parsing [sent. 9032 len. 5]: ` Exactly so ! '
Parsing [sent. 9033 len. 10]: said Mrs. Micawber , preserving the same logical air .
Parsing [sent. 9034 len. 9]: ` Quite true , my dear Mr. Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 9035 len. 10]: I have made the identical observation to Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 9036 len. 50]: It is for that reason especially , that I think Mr. Micawber ought -LRB- as I have already said , in justice to himself , in justice to his family , and in justice to society -RRB- to raise a certain sum of money -- on a bill . '
Parsing [sent. 9037 len. 39]: Mr. Micawber , leaning back in his chair , trifled with his eye-glass and cast his eyes up at the ceiling ; but I thought him observant of Traddles , too , who was looking at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 9038 len. 57]: ` If no member of my family , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` is possessed of sufficient natural feeling to negotiate that bill -- I believe there is a better business-term to express what I mean -- ' Mr. Micawber , with his eyes still cast up at the ceiling , suggested ` Discount . '
Parsing [sent. 9039 len. 46]: ` To discount that bill , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` then my opinion is , that Mr. Micawber should go into the City , should take that bill into the Money Market , and should dispose of it for what he can get .
Parsing [sent. 9040 len. 24]: If the individuals in the Money Market oblige Mr. Micawber to sustain a great sacrifice , that is between themselves and their consciences .
Parsing [sent. 9041 len. 10]: I view it , steadily , as an investment .
Parsing [sent. 9042 len. 38]: I recommend Mr. Micawber , my dear Mr. Copperfield , to do the same ; to regard it as an investment which is sure of return , and to make up his mind to any sacrifice . '
Parsing [sent. 9043 len. 32]: I felt , but I am sure I do n't know why , that this was self-denying and devoted in Mrs. Micawber , and I uttered a murmur to that effect .
Parsing [sent. 9044 len. 19]: Traddles , who took his tone from me , did likewise , still looking at the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 9045 len. 46]: I will not , ' said Mrs. Micawber , finishing her punch , and gathering her scarf about her shoulders , preparatory to her withdrawal to my bedroom : ' I will not protract these remarks on the subject of Mr. Micawber 's pecuniary affairs .
Parsing [sent. 9046 len. 50]: At your fireside , my dear Mr. Copperfield , and in the presence of Mr. Traddles , who , though not so old a friend , is quite one of ourselves , I could not refrain from making you acquainted with the course I advise Mr. Micawber to take .
Parsing [sent. 9047 len. 33]: I feel that the time is arrived when Mr. Micawber should exert himself and -- I will add -- assert himself , and it appears to me that these are the means .
Parsing [sent. 9048 len. 73]: I am aware that I am merely a female , and that a masculine judgement is usually considered more competent to the discussion of such questions ; still I must not forget that , when I lived at home with my papa and mama , my papa was in the habit of saying , `` Emma 's form is fragile , but her grasp of a subject is inferior to none . ''
Parsing [sent. 9049 len. 35]: That my papa was too partial , I well know ; but that he was an observer of character in some degree , my duty and my reason equally forbid me to doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 9050 len. 29]: With these words , and resisting our entreaties that she would grace the remaining circulation of the punch with her presence , Mrs. Micawber retired to my bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 9051 len. 37]: And really I felt that she was a noble woman -- the sort of woman who might have been a Roman matron , and done all manner of heroic things , in times of public trouble .
Parsing [sent. 9052 len. 17]: In the fervour of this impression , I congratulated Mr. Micawber on the treasure he possessed .
Parsing [sent. 9053 len. 4]: So did Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 9054 len. 35]: Mr. Micawber extended his hand to each of us in succession , and then covered his face with his pocket-handkerchief , which I think had more snuff upon it than he was aware of .
Parsing [sent. 9055 len. 14]: He then returned to the punch , in the highest state of exhilaration .
Parsing [sent. 9056 len. 6]: He was full of eloquence .
Parsing [sent. 9057 len. 32]: He gave us to understand that in our children we lived again , and that , under the pressure of pecuniary difficulties , any accession to their number was doubly welcome .
Parsing [sent. 9058 len. 25]: He said that Mrs. Micawber had latterly had her doubts on this point , but that he had dispelled them , and reassured her .
Parsing [sent. 9059 len. 36]: As to her family , they were totally unworthy of her , and their sentiments were utterly indifferent to him , and they might -- I quote his own expression -- go to the Devil .
Parsing [sent. 9060 len. 10]: Mr. Micawber then delivered a warm eulogy on Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 9061 len. 35]: He said Traddles 's was a character , to the steady virtues of which he -LRB- Mr. Micawber -RRB- could lay no claim , but which , he thanked Heaven , he could admire .
Parsing [sent. 9062 len. 33]: He feelingly alluded to the young lady , unknown , whom Traddles had honoured with his affection , and who had reciprocated that affection by honouring and blessing Traddles with her affection .
Parsing [sent. 9063 len. 5]: Mr. Micawber pledged her .
Parsing [sent. 9064 len. 36]: So did I. Traddles thanked us both , by saying , with a simplicity and honesty I had sense enough to be quite charmed with , ' I am very much obliged to you indeed .
Parsing [sent. 9065 len. 12]: And I do assure you , she 's the dearest girl !
Parsing [sent. 9066 len. 29]: -- ' Mr. Micawber took an early opportunity , after that , of hinting , with the utmost delicacy and ceremony , at the state of My affections .
Parsing [sent. 9067 len. 31]: Nothing but the serious assurance of his friend Copperfield to the contrary , he observed , could deprive him of the impression that his friend Copperfield loved and was beloved .
Parsing [sent. 9068 len. 36]: After feeling very hot and uncomfortable for some time , and after a good deal of blushing , stammering , and denying , I said , having my glass in my hand , ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 9069 len. 7]: I would give them D. ! '
Parsing [sent. 9070 len. 49]: which so excited and gratified Mr. Micawber , that he ran with a glass of punch into my bedroom , in order that Mrs. Micawber might drink D. , who drank it with enthusiasm , crying from within , in a shrill voice , ` Hear , hear !
Parsing [sent. 9071 len. 9]: My dear Mr. Copperfield , I am delighted .
Parsing [sent. 9072 len. 3]: Hear ! '
Parsing [sent. 9073 len. 11]: and tapping at the wall , by way of applause .
Parsing [sent. 9074 len. 49]: Our conversation , afterwards , took a more worldly turn ; Mr. Micawber telling us that he found Camden Town inconvenient , and that the first thing he contemplated doing , when the advertisement should have been the cause of something satisfactory turning up , was to move .
Parsing [sent. 9075 len. 43]: He mentioned a terrace at the western end of Oxford Street , fronting Hyde Park , on which he had always had his eye , but which he did not expect to attain immediately , as it would require a large establishment .
Parsing [sent. 9076 len. 85]: There would probably be an interval , he explained , in which he should content himself with the upper part of a house , over some respectable place of business -- say in Piccadilly , -- which would be a cheerful situation for Mrs. Micawber ; and where , by throwing out a bow-window , or carrying up the roof another story , or making some little alteration of that sort , they might live , comfortably and reputably , for a few years .
Parsing [sent. 9077 len. 40]: Whatever was reserved for him , he expressly said , or wherever his abode might be , we might rely on this -- there would always be a room for Traddles , and a knife and fork for me .
Parsing [sent. 9078 len. 38]: We acknowledged his kindness ; and he begged us to forgive his having launched into these practical and business-like details , and to excuse it as natural in one who was making entirely new arrangements in life .
Parsing [sent. 9079 len. 25]: Mrs. Micawber , tapping at the wall again to know if tea were ready , broke up this particular phase of our friendly conversation .
Parsing [sent. 9080 len. 63]: She made tea for us in a most agreeable manner ; and , whenever I went near her , in handing about the tea-cups and bread-and-butter , asked me , in a whisper , whether D. was fair , or dark , or whether she was short , or tall : or something of that kind ; which I think I liked .
Parsing [sent. 9081 len. 68]: After tea , we discussed a variety of topics before the fire ; and Mrs. Micawber was good enough to sing us -LRB- in a small , thin , flat voice , which I remembered to have considered , when I first knew her , the very table-beer of acoustics -RRB- the favourite ballads of ` The Dashing White Sergeant ' , and ` Little Tafflin ' .
Parsing [sent. 9082 len. 21]: For both of these songs Mrs. Micawber had been famous when she lived at home with her papa and mama .
Parsing [sent. 9083 len. 60]: Mr. Micawber told us , that when he heard her sing the first one , on the first occasion of his seeing her beneath the parental roof , she had attracted his attention in an extraordinary degree ; but that when it came to Little Tafflin , he had resolved to win that woman or perish in the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 9084 len. 28]: It was between ten and eleven o'clock when Mrs. Micawber rose to replace her cap in the whitey-brown paper parcel , and to put on her bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 9085 len. 33]: Mr. Micawber took the opportunity of Traddles putting on his great-coat , to slip a letter into my hand , with a whispered request that I would read it at my leisure .
Parsing [sent. 9086 len. 50]: I also took the opportunity of my holding a candle over the banisters to light them down , when Mr. Micawber was going first , leading Mrs. Micawber , and Traddles was following with the cap , to detain Traddles for a moment on the top of the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 9087 len. 34]: ` Traddles , ' said I , ` Mr. Micawber do n't mean any harm , poor fellow : but , if I were you , I would n't lend him anything . '
Parsing [sent. 9088 len. 21]: ` My dear Copperfield , ' returned Traddles , smiling , ' I have n't got anything to lend . '
Parsing [sent. 9089 len. 16]: ` You have got a name , you know , ' said I. ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9090 len. 8]: You call THAT something to lend ? '
Parsing [sent. 9091 len. 8]: returned Traddles , with a thoughtful look .
Parsing [sent. 9092 len. 4]: ` Certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 9093 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 9094 len. 3]: said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 9095 len. 7]: ` Yes , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 9096 len. 23]: I am very much obliged to you , Copperfield ; but -- I am afraid I have lent him that already . '
Parsing [sent. 9097 len. 13]: ` For the bill that is to be a certain investment ? '
Parsing [sent. 9098 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 9099 len. 7]: ` No , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 9100 len. 6]: ` Not for that one .
Parsing [sent. 9101 len. 11]: This is the first I have heard of that one .
Parsing [sent. 9102 len. 18]: I have been thinking that he will most likely propose that one , on the way home .
Parsing [sent. 9103 len. 6]: Mine 's another . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9104 len. 23]: I hope there will be nothing wrong about it , ' said I. ' I hope not , ' said Traddles . '
Parsing [sent. 9105 len. 23]: I should think not , though , because he told me , only the other day , that it was provided for .
Parsing [sent. 9106 len. 13]: That was Mr. Micawber 's expression , `` Provided for . '' '
Parsing [sent. 9107 len. 22]: Mr. Micawber looking up at this juncture to where we were standing , I had only time to repeat my caution .
Parsing [sent. 9108 len. 7]: Traddles thanked me , and descended .
Parsing [sent. 9109 len. 44]: But I was much afraid , when I observed the good-natured manner in which he went down with the cap in his hand , and gave Mrs. Micawber his arm , that he would be carried into the Money Market neck and heels .
Parsing [sent. 9110 len. 39]: I returned to my fireside , and was musing , half gravely and half laughing , on the character of Mr. Micawber and the old relations between us , when I heard a quick step ascending the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 9111 len. 49]: At first , I thought it was Traddles coming back for something Mrs. Micawber had left behind ; but as the step approached , I knew it , and felt my heart beat high , and the blood rush to my face , for it was Steerforth 's .
Parsing [sent. 9112 len. 33]: I was never unmindful of Agnes , and she never left that sanctuary in my thoughts -- if I may call it so -- where I had placed her from the first .
Parsing [sent. 9113 len. 40]: But when he entered , and stood before me with his hand out , the darkness that had fallen on him changed to light , and I felt confounded and ashamed of having doubted one I loved so heartily .
Parsing [sent. 9114 len. 58]: I loved her none the less ; I thought of her as the same benignant , gentle angel in my life ; I reproached myself , not her , with having done him an injury ; and I would have made him any atonement if I had known what to make , and how to make it .
Parsing [sent. 9115 len. 11]: ` Why , Daisy , old boy , dumb-foundered ! '
Parsing [sent. 9116 len. 14]: laughed Steerforth , shaking my hand heartily , and throwing it gaily away .
Parsing [sent. 9117 len. 12]: ` Have I detected you in another feast , you Sybarite !
Parsing [sent. 9118 len. 26]: These Doctors ' Commons fellows are the gayest men in town , I believe , and beat us sober Oxford people all to nothing ! '
Parsing [sent. 9119 len. 37]: His bright glance went merrily round the room , as he took the seat on the sofa opposite to me , which Mrs. Micawber had recently vacated , and stirred the fire into a blaze . '
Parsing [sent. 9120 len. 35]: I was so surprised at first , ' said I , giving him welcome with all the cordiality I felt , ` that I had hardly breath to greet you with , Steerforth . '
Parsing [sent. 9121 len. 37]: ` Well , the sight of me is good for sore eyes , as the Scotch say , ' replied Steerforth , ` and so is the sight of you , Daisy , in full bloom .
Parsing [sent. 9122 len. 9]: How are you , my Bacchanal ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9123 len. 27]: I am very well , ' said I ; ` and not at all Bacchanalian tonight , though I confess to another party of three . '
Parsing [sent. 9124 len. 20]: ` All of whom I met in the street , talking loud in your praise , ' returned Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 9125 len. 10]: ` Who 's our friend in the tights ? '
Parsing [sent. 9126 len. 18]: I gave him the best idea I could , in a few words , of Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 9127 len. 26]: He laughed heartily at my feeble portrait of that gentleman , and said he was a man to know , and he must know him .
Parsing [sent. 9128 len. 12]: ` But who do you suppose our other friend is ? '
Parsing [sent. 9129 len. 7]: said I , in my turn .
Parsing [sent. 9130 len. 8]: ` Heaven knows , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 9131 len. 8]: ` Not a bore , I hope ?
Parsing [sent. 9132 len. 10]: I thought he looked a little like one . '
Parsing [sent. 9133 len. 4]: ` Traddles ! '
Parsing [sent. 9134 len. 5]: I replied , triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 9135 len. 6]: ` Who 's he ? '
Parsing [sent. 9136 len. 8]: asked Steerforth , in his careless way .
Parsing [sent. 9137 len. 7]: ` Do n't you remember Traddles ?
Parsing [sent. 9138 len. 9]: Traddles in our room at Salem House ? '
Parsing [sent. 9139 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9140 len. 4]: That fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 9141 len. 19]: said Steerforth , beating a lump of coal on the top of the fire , with the poker .
Parsing [sent. 9142 len. 8]: ` Is he as soft as ever ?
Parsing [sent. 9143 len. 11]: And where the deuce did you pick him up ? '
Parsing [sent. 9144 len. 21]: I extolled Traddles in reply , as highly as I could ; for I felt that Steerforth rather slighted him .
Parsing [sent. 9145 len. 48]: Steerforth , dismissing the subject with a light nod , and a smile , and the remark that he would be glad to see the old fellow too , for he had always been an odd fish , inquired if I could give him anything to eat ?
Parsing [sent. 9146 len. 33]: During most of this short dialogue , when he had not been speaking in a wild vivacious manner , he had sat idly beating on the lump of coal with the poker .
Parsing [sent. 9147 len. 23]: I observed that he did the same thing while I was getting out the remains of the pigeon-pie , and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 9148 len. 14]: ` Why , Daisy , here 's a supper for a king ! '
Parsing [sent. 9149 len. 21]: he exclaimed , starting out of his silence with a burst , and taking his seat at the table . '
Parsing [sent. 9150 len. 15]: I shall do it justice , for I have come from Yarmouth . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9151 len. 8]: I thought you came from Oxford ? '
Parsing [sent. 9152 len. 3]: I returned .
Parsing [sent. 9153 len. 9]: ` Not I , ' said Steerforth . '
Parsing [sent. 9154 len. 9]: I have been seafaring -- better employed . '
Parsing [sent. 9155 len. 42]: ` Littimer was here today , to inquire for you , ' I remarked , ` and I understood him that you were at Oxford ; though , now I think of it , he certainly did not say so . '
Parsing [sent. 9156 len. 37]: ` Littimer is a greater fool than I thought him , to have been inquiring for me at all , ' said Steerforth , jovially pouring out a glass of wine , and drinking to me .
Parsing [sent. 9157 len. 25]: ` As to understanding him , you are a cleverer fellow than most of us , Daisy , if you can do that . '
Parsing [sent. 9158 len. 18]: ` That 's true , indeed , ' said I , moving my chair to the table .
Parsing [sent. 9159 len. 11]: ` So you have been at Yarmouth , Steerforth ! '
Parsing [sent. 9160 len. 7]: interested to know all about it .
Parsing [sent. 9161 len. 8]: ` Have you been there long ? '
Parsing [sent. 9162 len. 7]: ` No , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 9163 len. 10]: ` An escapade of a week or so . '
Parsing [sent. 9164 len. 7]: ` And how are they all ?
Parsing [sent. 9165 len. 11]: Of course , little Emily is not married yet ? '
Parsing [sent. 9166 len. 4]: ` Not yet .
Parsing [sent. 9167 len. 20]: Going to be , I believe -- in so many weeks , or months , or something or other .
Parsing [sent. 9168 len. 8]: I have not seen much of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 9169 len. 38]: By the by ' ; he laid down his knife and fork , which he had been using with great diligence , and began feeling in his pockets ; ' I have a letter for you . '
Parsing [sent. 9170 len. 5]: ` From whom ? '
Parsing [sent. 9171 len. 22]: ` Why , from your old nurse , ' he returned , taking some papers out of his breast pocket . ''
Parsing [sent. 9172 len. 19]: ` J. Steerforth , Esquire , debtor , to The Willing Mind '' ; that 's not it .
Parsing [sent. 9173 len. 9]: Patience , and we 'll find it presently .
Parsing [sent. 9174 len. 21]: Old what 's - his-name 's in a bad way , and it 's about that , I believe . '
Parsing [sent. 9175 len. 8]: ` Barkis , do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 9176 len. 4]: ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 9177 len. 25]: still feeling in his pockets , and looking over their contents : ` it 's all over with poor Barkis , I am afraid .
Parsing [sent. 9178 len. 22]: I saw a little apothecary there -- surgeon , or whatever he is -- who brought your worship into the world .
Parsing [sent. 9179 len. 30]: He was mighty learned about the case , to me ; but the upshot of his opinion was , that the carrier was making his last journey rather fast .
Parsing [sent. 9180 len. 25]: -- Put your hand into the breast pocket of my great-coat on the chair yonder , and I think you 'll find the letter .
Parsing [sent. 9181 len. 5]: Is it there ? '
Parsing [sent. 9182 len. 6]: ` Here it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 9183 len. 8]: said I. ` That 's right ! '
Parsing [sent. 9184 len. 14]: It was from Peggotty ; something less legible than usual , and brief .
Parsing [sent. 9185 len. 34]: It informed me of her husband 's hopeless state , and hinted at his being ' a little nearer ' than heretofore , and consequently more difficult to manage for his own comfort .
Parsing [sent. 9186 len. 14]: It said nothing of her weariness and watching , and praised him highly .
Parsing [sent. 9187 len. 33]: It was written with a plain , unaffected , homely piety that I knew to be genuine , and ended with ` my duty to my ever darling ' -- meaning myself .
Parsing [sent. 9188 len. 12]: While I deciphered it , Steerforth continued to eat and drink .
Parsing [sent. 9189 len. 41]: ` It 's a bad job , ' he said , when I had done ; ` but the sun sets every day , and people die every minute , and we must n't be scared by the common lot .
Parsing [sent. 9190 len. 32]: If we failed to hold our own , because that equal foot at all men 's doors was heard knocking somewhere , every object in this world would slip from us .
Parsing [sent. 9191 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 9192 len. 3]: Ride on !
Parsing [sent. 9193 len. 15]: Rough-shod if need be , smooth-shod if that will do , but ride on !
Parsing [sent. 9194 len. 12]: Ride on over all obstacles , and win the race ! '
Parsing [sent. 9195 len. 7]: ` And win what race ? '
Parsing [sent. 9196 len. 15]: said I. ` The race that one has started in , ' said he .
Parsing [sent. 9197 len. 5]: ` Ride on ! '
Parsing [sent. 9198 len. 87]: I noticed , I remember , as he paused , looking at me with his handsome head a little thrown back , and his glass raised in his hand , that , though the freshness of the sea-wind was on his face , and it was ruddy , there were traces in it , made since I last saw it , as if he had applied himself to some habitual strain of the fervent energy which , when roused , was so passionately roused within him .
Parsing [sent. 9199 len. 59]: I had it in my thoughts to remonstrate with him upon his desperate way of pursuing any fancy that he took -- such as this buffeting of rough seas , and braving of hard weather , for example - when my mind glanced off to the immediate subject of our conversation again , and pursued that instead . '
Parsing [sent. 9200 len. 48]: I tell you what , Steerforth , ' said I , ` if your high spirits will listen to me -- ' ` They are potent spirits , and will do whatever you like , ' he answered , moving from the table to the fireside again .
Parsing [sent. 9201 len. 9]: ` Then I tell you what , Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 9202 len. 12]: I think I will go down and see my old nurse .
Parsing [sent. 9203 len. 43]: It is not that I can do her any good , or render her any real service ; but she is so attached to me that my visit will have as much effect on her , as if I could do both .
Parsing [sent. 9204 len. 17]: She will take it so kindly that it will be a comfort and support to her .
Parsing [sent. 9205 len. 23]: It is no great effort to make , I am sure , for such a friend as she has been to me .
Parsing [sent. 9206 len. 17]: Would n't you go a day 's journey , if you were in my place ? '
Parsing [sent. 9207 len. 23]: His face was thoughtful , and he sat considering a little before he answered , in a low voice , ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 9208 len. 2]: Go .
Parsing [sent. 9209 len. 7]: You can do no harm . '
Parsing [sent. 9210 len. 27]: ` You have just come back , ' said I , ` and it would be in vain to ask you to go with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 9211 len. 8]: ` Quite , ' he returned . '
Parsing [sent. 9212 len. 6]: I am for Highgate tonight .
Parsing [sent. 9213 len. 31]: I have not seen my mother this long time , and it lies upon my conscience , for it 's something to be loved as she loves her prodigal son .
Parsing [sent. 9214 len. 3]: -- Bah !
Parsing [sent. 9215 len. 2]: Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 9216 len. 11]: -- You mean to go tomorrow , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 9217 len. 20]: he said , holding me out at arm 's length , with a hand on each of my shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 9218 len. 8]: ` Yes , I think so . '
Parsing [sent. 9219 len. 12]: ` Well , then , do n't go till next day .
Parsing [sent. 9220 len. 13]: I wanted you to come and stay a few days with us .
Parsing [sent. 9221 len. 18]: Here I am , on purpose to bid you , and you fly off to Yarmouth ! '
Parsing [sent. 9222 len. 27]: ` You are a nice fellow to talk of flying off , Steerforth , who are always running wild on some unknown expedition or other ! '
Parsing [sent. 9223 len. 29]: He looked at me for a moment without speaking , and then rejoined , still holding me as before , and giving me a shake : ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 9224 len. 17]: Say the next day , and pass as much of tomorrow as you can with us !
Parsing [sent. 9225 len. 10]: Who knows when we may meet again , else ?
Parsing [sent. 9226 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 9227 len. 5]: Say the next day !
Parsing [sent. 9228 len. 17]: I want you to stand between Rosa Dartle and me , and keep us asunder . '
Parsing [sent. 9229 len. 13]: ` Would you love each other too much , without me ? '
Parsing [sent. 9230 len. 15]: ` Yes ; or hate , ' laughed Steerforth ; ` no matter which .
Parsing [sent. 9231 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 9232 len. 6]: Say the next day ! '
Parsing [sent. 9233 len. 24]: I said the next day ; and he put on his great-coat and lighted his cigar , and set off to walk home .
Parsing [sent. 9234 len. 50]: Finding him in this intention , I put on my own great-coat -LRB- but did not light my own cigar , having had enough of that for one while -RRB- and walked with him as far as the open road : a dull road , then , at night .
Parsing [sent. 9235 len. 45]: He was in great spirits all the way ; and when we parted , and I looked after him going so gallantly and airily homeward , I thought of his saying , ` Ride on over all obstacles , and win the race ! '
Parsing [sent. 9236 len. 17]: and wished , for the first time , that he had some worthy race to run .
Parsing [sent. 9237 len. 18]: I was undressing in my own room , when Mr. Micawber 's letter tumbled on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 9238 len. 14]: Thus reminded of it , I broke the seal and read as follows .
Parsing [sent. 9239 len. 11]: It was dated an hour and a half before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 9240 len. 40]: I am not sure whether I have mentioned that , when Mr. Micawber was at any particularly desperate crisis , he used a sort of legal phraseology , which he seemed to think equivalent to winding up his affairs .
Parsing [sent. 9241 len. 27]: ` SIR -- for I dare not say my dear Copperfield , ` It is expedient that I should inform you that the undersigned is Crushed .
Parsing [sent. 9242 len. 36]: Some flickering efforts to spare you the premature knowledge of his calamitous position , you may observe in him this day ; but hope has sunk beneath the horizon , and the undersigned is Crushed .
Parsing [sent. 9243 len. 36]: ` The present communication is penned within the personal range -LRB- I can not call it the society -RRB- of an individual , in a state closely bordering on intoxication , employed by a broker .
Parsing [sent. 9244 len. 16]: That individual is in legal possession of the premises , under a distress for rent .
Parsing [sent. 9245 len. 47]: His inventory includes , not only the chattels and effects of every description belonging to the undersigned , as yearly tenant of this habitation , but also those appertaining to Mr. Thomas Traddles , lodger , a member of the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple .
Parsing [sent. 9246 len. 77]: ` If any drop of gloom were wanting in the overflowing cup , which is now `` commended '' -LRB- in the language of an immortal Writer -RRB- to the lips of the undersigned , it would be found in the fact , that a friendly acceptance granted to the undersigned , by the before-mentioned Mr. Thomas Traddles , for the sum Of 23l 4s 9 12d is over due , and is NOT provided for .
Parsing [sent. 9247 len. 60]: Also , in the fact that the living responsibilities clinging to the undersigned will , in the course of nature , be increased by the sum of one more helpless victim ; whose miserable appearance may be looked for -- in round numbers -- at the expiration of a period not exceeding six lunar months from the present date .
Parsing [sent. 9248 len. 37]: ` After premising thus much , it would be a work of supererogation to add , that dust and ashes are for ever scattered ` On ` The ` Head ` Of ` WILKINS MICAWBER . '
Parsing [sent. 9249 len. 3]: Poor Traddles !
Parsing [sent. 9250 len. 71]: I knew enough of Mr. Micawber by this time , to foresee that he might be expected to recover the blow ; but my night 's rest was sorely distressed by thoughts of Traddles , and of the curate 's daughter , who was one of ten , down in Devonshire , and who was such a dear girl , and who would wait for Traddles -LRB- ominous praise ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 9251 len. 13]: until she was sixty , or any age that could be mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 9252 len. 59]: Chapter 29 I Visit Steerforth at His Home , Again I mentioned to Mr. Spenlow in the morning , that I wanted leave of absence for a short time ; and as I was not in the receipt of any salary , and consequently was not obnoxious to the implacable Jorkins , there was no difficulty about it .
Parsing [sent. 9253 len. 70]: I took that opportunity , with my voice sticking in my throat , and my sight failing as I uttered the words , to express my hope that Miss Spenlow was quite well ; to which Mr. Spenlow replied , with no more emotion than if he had been speaking of an ordinary human being , that he was much obliged to me , and she was very well .
Parsing [sent. 9254 len. 31]: We articled clerks , as germs of the patrician order of proctors , were treated with so much consideration , that I was almost my own master at all times .
Parsing [sent. 9255 len. 69]: As I did not care , however , to get to Highgate before one or two o'clock in the day , and as we had another little excommunication case in court that morning , which was called The office of the judge promoted by Tipkins against Bullock for his soul 's correction , I passed an hour or two in attendance on it with Mr. Spenlow very agreeably .
Parsing [sent. 9256 len. 51]: It arose out of a scuffle between two churchwardens , one of whom was alleged to have pushed the other against a pump ; the handle of which pump projecting into a school-house , which school-house was under a gable of the church-roof , made the push an ecclesiastical offence .
Parsing [sent. 9257 len. 41]: It was an amusing case ; and sent me up to Highgate , on the box of the stage-coach , thinking about the Commons , and what Mr. Spenlow had said about touching the Commons and bringing down the country .
Parsing [sent. 9258 len. 14]: Mrs. Steerforth was pleased to see me , and so was Rosa Dartle .
Parsing [sent. 9259 len. 56]: I was agreeably surprised to find that Littimer was not there , and that we were attended by a modest little parlour-maid , with blue ribbons in her cap , whose eye it was much more pleasant , and much less disconcerting , to catch by accident , than the eye of that respectable man .
Parsing [sent. 9260 len. 63]: But what I particularly observed , before I had been half-an-hour in the house , was the close and attentive watch Miss Dartle kept upon me ; and the lurking manner in which she seemed to compare my face with Steerforth 's , and Steerforth 's with mine , and to lie in wait for something to come out between the two .
Parsing [sent. 9261 len. 45]: So surely as I looked towards her , did I see that eager visage , with its gaunt black eyes and searching brow , intent on mine ; or passing suddenly from mine to Steerforth 's ; or comprehending both of us at once .
Parsing [sent. 9262 len. 37]: In this lynx-like scrutiny she was so far from faltering when she saw I observed it , that at such a time she only fixed her piercing look upon me with a more intent expression still .
Parsing [sent. 9263 len. 38]: Blameless as I was , and knew that I was , in reference to any wrong she could possibly suspect me of , I shrunk before her strange eyes , quite unable to endure their hungry lustre .
Parsing [sent. 9264 len. 11]: All day , she seemed to pervade the whole house .
Parsing [sent. 9265 len. 20]: If I talked to Steerforth in his room , I heard her dress rustle in the little gallery outside .
Parsing [sent. 9266 len. 44]: When he and I engaged in some of our old exercises on the lawn behind the house , I saw her face pass from window to window , like a wandering light , until it fixed itself in one , and watched us .
Parsing [sent. 9267 len. 45]: When we all four went out walking in the afternoon , she closed her thin hand on my arm like a spring , to keep me back , while Steerforth and his mother went on out of hearing : and then spoke to me .
Parsing [sent. 9268 len. 17]: ` You have been a long time , ' she said , ` without coming here .
Parsing [sent. 9269 len. 15]: Is your profession really so engaging and interesting as to absorb your whole attention ?
Parsing [sent. 9270 len. 15]: I ask because I always want to be informed , when I am ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 9271 len. 7]: Is it really , though ? '
Parsing [sent. 9272 len. 21]: I replied that I liked it well enough , but that I certainly could not claim so much for it .
Parsing [sent. 9273 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9274 len. 25]: I am glad to know that , because I always like to be put right when I am wrong , ' said Rosa Dartle .
Parsing [sent. 9275 len. 12]: ` You mean it is a little dry , perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 9276 len. 16]: ` Well , ' I replied ; ` perhaps it was a little dry . '
Parsing [sent. 9277 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9278 len. 18]: and that 's a reason why you want relief and change -- excitement and all that ? '
Parsing [sent. 9279 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 9280 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9281 len. 3]: very true !
Parsing [sent. 9282 len. 9]: But is n't it a little -- Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 9283 len. 11]: -- for him ; I do n't mean you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9284 len. 37]: A quick glance of her eye towards the spot where Steerforth was walking , with his mother leaning on his arm , showed me whom she meant ; but beyond that , I was quite lost .
Parsing [sent. 9285 len. 10]: And I looked so , I have no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 9286 len. 26]: ` Do n't it -- I do n't say that it does , mind I want to know -- do n't it rather engross him ?
Parsing [sent. 9287 len. 24]: Do n't it make him , perhaps , a little more remiss than usual in his visits to his blindly-doting -- eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 9288 len. 22]: With another quick glance at them , and such a glance at me as seemed to look into my innermost thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 9289 len. 21]: ` Miss Dartle , ' I returned , ` pray do not think -- ' ' I do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 9290 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 9291 len. 13]: ` Oh dear me , do n't suppose that I think anything !
Parsing [sent. 9292 len. 5]: I am not suspicious .
Parsing [sent. 9293 len. 6]: I only ask a question .
Parsing [sent. 9294 len. 7]: I do n't state any opinion .
Parsing [sent. 9295 len. 12]: I want to found an opinion on what you tell me .
Parsing [sent. 9296 len. 7]: Then , it 's not so ?
Parsing [sent. 9297 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 9298 len. 9]: I am very glad to know it . '
Parsing [sent. 9299 len. 53]: ` It certainly is not the fact , ' said I , perplexed , ` that I am accountable for Steerforth 's having been away from home longer than usual -- if he has been : which I really do n't know at this moment , unless I understand it from you .
Parsing [sent. 9300 len. 14]: I have not seen him this long while , until last night . '
Parsing [sent. 9301 len. 4]: ` No ? '
Parsing [sent. 9302 len. 9]: ` Indeed , Miss Dartle , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 9303 len. 46]: As she looked full at me , I saw her face grow sharper and paler , and the marks of the old wound lengthen out until it cut through the disfigured lip , and deep into the nether lip , and slanted down the face .
Parsing [sent. 9304 len. 34]: There was something positively awful to me in this , and in the brightness of her eyes , as she said , looking fixedly at me : ` What is he doing ? '
Parsing [sent. 9305 len. 15]: I repeated the words , more to myself than her , being so amazed .
Parsing [sent. 9306 len. 7]: ` What is he doing ? '
Parsing [sent. 9307 len. 16]: she said , with an eagerness that seemed enough to consume her like a fire .
Parsing [sent. 9308 len. 22]: ` In what is that man assisting him , who never looks at me without an inscrutable falsehood in his eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 9309 len. 17]: If you are honourable and faithful , I do n't ask you to betray your friend .
Parsing [sent. 9310 len. 44]: I ask you only to tell me , is it anger , is it hatred , is it pride , is it restlessness , is it some wild fancy , is it love , what is it , that is leading him ? '
Parsing [sent. 9311 len. 40]: ` Miss Dartle , ' I returned , ` how shall I tell you , so that you will believe me , that I know of nothing in Steerforth different from what there was when I first came here ?
Parsing [sent. 9312 len. 6]: I can think of nothing .
Parsing [sent. 9313 len. 7]: I firmly believe there is nothing .
Parsing [sent. 9314 len. 9]: I hardly understand even what you mean . '
Parsing [sent. 9315 len. 53]: As she still stood looking fixedly at me , a twitching or throbbing , from which I could not dissociate the idea of pain , came into that cruel mark ; and lifted up the corner of her lip as if with scorn , or with a pity that despised its object .
Parsing [sent. 9316 len. 65]: She put her hand upon it hurriedly -- a hand so thin and delicate , that when I had seen her hold it up before the fire to shade her face , I had compared it in my thoughts to fine porcelain -- and saying , in a quick , fierce , passionate way , ' I swear you to secrecy about this ! '
Parsing [sent. 9317 len. 6]: said not a word more .
Parsing [sent. 9318 len. 26]: Mrs. Steerforth was particularly happy in her son 's society , and Steerforth was , on this occasion , particularly attentive and respectful to her .
Parsing [sent. 9319 len. 57]: It was very interesting to me to see them together , not only on account of their mutual affection , but because of the strong personal resemblance between them , and the manner in which what was haughty or impetuous in him was softened by age and sex , in her , to a gracious dignity .
Parsing [sent. 9320 len. 56]: I thought , more than once , that it was well no serious cause of division had ever come between them ; or two such natures -- I ought rather to express it , two such shades of the same nature -- might have been harder to reconcile than the two extremest opposites in creation .
Parsing [sent. 9321 len. 25]: The idea did not originate in my own discernment , I am bound to confess , but in a speech of Rosa Dartle 's .
Parsing [sent. 9322 len. 34]: She said at dinner : ` Oh , but do tell me , though , somebody , because I have been thinking about it all day , and I want to know . '
Parsing [sent. 9323 len. 10]: ` You want to know what , Rosa ? '
Parsing [sent. 9324 len. 4]: returned Mrs. Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 9325 len. 13]: ` Pray , pray , Rosa , do not be mysterious . '
Parsing [sent. 9326 len. 4]: ` Mysterious ! '
Parsing [sent. 9327 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 9328 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9329 len. 2]: really ?
Parsing [sent. 9330 len. 7]: Do you consider me so ? '
Parsing [sent. 9331 len. 24]: ` Do I constantly entreat you , ' said Mrs. Steerforth , ` to speak plainly , in your own natural manner ? '
Parsing [sent. 9332 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9333 len. 9]: then this is not my natural manner ? '
Parsing [sent. 9334 len. 3]: she rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 9335 len. 15]: ` Now you must really bear with me , because I ask for information .
Parsing [sent. 9336 len. 6]: We never know ourselves . '
Parsing [sent. 9337 len. 54]: ` It has become a second nature , ' said Mrs. Steerforth , without any displeasure ; ` but I remember , -- and so must you , I think , -- when your manner was different , Rosa ; when it was not so guarded , and was more trustful . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9338 len. 23]: I am sure you are right , ' she returned ; ` and so it is that bad habits grow upon one !
Parsing [sent. 9339 len. 2]: Really ?
Parsing [sent. 9340 len. 6]: Less guarded and more trustful ?
Parsing [sent. 9341 len. 12]: How can I , imperceptibly , have changed , I wonder !
Parsing [sent. 9342 len. 7]: Well , that 's very odd !
Parsing [sent. 9343 len. 11]: I must study to regain my former self . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9344 len. 14]: I wish you would , ' said Mrs. Steerforth , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 9345 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9346 len. 8]: I really will , you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 9347 len. 4]: she answered . '
Parsing [sent. 9348 len. 14]: I will learn frankness from -- let me see -- from James . '
Parsing [sent. 9349 len. 54]: ` You can not learn frankness , Rosa , ' said Mrs. Steerforth quickly -- for there was always some effect of sarcasm in what Rosa Dartle said , though it was said , as this was , in the most unconscious manner in the world -- ` in a better school . '
Parsing [sent. 9350 len. 15]: ` That I am sure of , ' she answered , with uncommon fervour .
Parsing [sent. 9351 len. 21]: ` If I am sure of anything , of course , you know , I am sure of that . '
Parsing [sent. 9352 len. 46]: Mrs. Steerforth appeared to me to regret having been a little nettled ; for she presently said , in a kind tone : ` Well , my dear Rosa , we have not heard what it is that you want to be satisfied about ? '
Parsing [sent. 9353 len. 10]: ` That I want to be satisfied about ? '
Parsing [sent. 9354 len. 7]: she replied , with provoking coldness .
Parsing [sent. 9355 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9356 len. 22]: It was only whether people , who are like each other in their moral constitution -- is that the phrase ? '
Parsing [sent. 9357 len. 14]: ` It 's as good a phrase as another , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 9358 len. 48]: ` Thank you : -- whether people , who are like each other in their moral constitution , are in greater danger than people not so circumstanced , supposing any serious cause of variance to arise between them , of being divided angrily and deeply ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9359 len. 9]: I should say yes , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 9360 len. 5]: ` Should you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9361 len. 3]: she retorted .
Parsing [sent. 9362 len. 4]: ` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 9363 len. 28]: Supposing then , for instance -- any unlikely thing will do for a supposition -- that you and your mother were to have a serious quarrel . '
Parsing [sent. 9364 len. 19]: ` My dear Rosa , ' interposed Mrs. Steerforth , laughing good-naturedly , ` suggest some other supposition !
Parsing [sent. 9365 len. 16]: James and I know our duty to each other better , I pray Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 9366 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 9367 len. 9]: said Miss Dartle , nodding her head thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 9368 len. 5]: ` To be sure .
Parsing [sent. 9369 len. 5]: That would prevent it ?
Parsing [sent. 9370 len. 7]: Why , of course it would .
Parsing [sent. 9371 len. 2]: Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 9372 len. 34]: Now , I am glad I have been so foolish as to put the case , for it is so very good to know that your duty to each other would prevent it !
Parsing [sent. 9373 len. 6]: Thank you very much . '
Parsing [sent. 9374 len. 31]: One other little circumstance connected with Miss Dartle I must not omit ; for I had reason to remember it thereafter , when all the irremediable past was rendered plain .
Parsing [sent. 9375 len. 43]: During the whole of this day , but especially from this period of it , Steerforth exerted himself with his utmost skill , and that was with his utmost ease , to charm this singular creature into a pleasant and pleased companion .
Parsing [sent. 9376 len. 13]: That he should succeed , was no matter of surprise to me .
Parsing [sent. 9377 len. 37]: That she should struggle against the fascinating influence of his delightful art -- delightful nature I thought it then -- did not surprise me either ; for I knew that she was sometimes jaundiced and perverse .
Parsing [sent. 9378 len. 109]: I saw her features and her manner slowly change ; I saw her look at him with growing admiration ; I saw her try , more and more faintly , but always angrily , as if she condemned a weakness in herself , to resist the captivating power that he possessed ; and finally , I saw her sharp glance soften , and her smile become quite gentle , and I ceased to be afraid of her as I had really been all day , and we all sat about the fire , talking and laughing together , with as little reserve as if we had been children .
Parsing [sent. 9379 len. 46]: Whether it was because we had sat there so long , or because Steerforth was resolved not to lose the advantage he had gained , I do not know ; but we did not remain in the dining-room more than five minutes after her departure .
Parsing [sent. 9380 len. 38]: ` She is playing her harp , ' said Steerforth , softly , at the drawing-room door , ` and nobody but my mother has heard her do that , I believe , these three years . '
Parsing [sent. 9381 len. 24]: He said it with a curious smile , which was gone directly ; and we went into the room and found her alone .
Parsing [sent. 9382 len. 24]: ` Do n't get up , ' said Steerforth -LRB- which she had already done -RRB- ' my dear Rosa , do n't !
Parsing [sent. 9383 len. 13]: Be kind for once , and sing us an Irish song . '
Parsing [sent. 9384 len. 11]: ` What do you care for an Irish song ? '
Parsing [sent. 9385 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 9386 len. 4]: ` Much ! '
Parsing [sent. 9387 len. 3]: said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 9388 len. 8]: ` Much more than for any other .
Parsing [sent. 9389 len. 12]: Here is Daisy , too , loves music from his soul .
Parsing [sent. 9390 len. 8]: Sing us an Irish song , Rosa !
Parsing [sent. 9391 len. 13]: and let me sit and listen as I used to do . '
Parsing [sent. 9392 len. 22]: He did not touch her , or the chair from which she had risen , but sat himself near the harp .
Parsing [sent. 9393 len. 31]: She stood beside it for some little while , in a curious way , going through the motion of playing it with her right hand , but not sounding it .
Parsing [sent. 9394 len. 21]: At length she sat down , and drew it to her with one sudden action , and played and sang .
Parsing [sent. 9395 len. 33]: I do n't know what it was , in her touch or voice , that made that song the most unearthly I have ever heard in my life , or can imagine .
Parsing [sent. 9396 len. 10]: There was something fearful in the reality of it .
Parsing [sent. 9397 len. 43]: It was as if it had never been written , or set to music , but sprung out of passion within her ; which found imperfect utterance in the low sounds of her voice , and crouched again when all was still .
Parsing [sent. 9398 len. 24]: I was dumb when she leaned beside the harp again , playing it , but not sounding it , with her right hand .
Parsing [sent. 9399 len. 55]: A minute more , and this had roused me from my trance : -- Steerforth had left his seat , and gone to her , and had put his arm laughingly about her , and had said , ` Come , Rosa , for the future we will love each other very much ! '
Parsing [sent. 9400 len. 27]: And she had struck him , and had thrown him off with the fury of a wild cat , and had burst out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 9401 len. 9]: ` What is the matter with Rosa ? '
Parsing [sent. 9402 len. 7]: said Mrs. Steerforth , coming in .
Parsing [sent. 9403 len. 35]: ` She has been an angel , mother , ' returned Steerforth , ` for a little while ; and has run into the opposite extreme , since , by way of compensation . '
Parsing [sent. 9404 len. 12]: ` You should be careful not to irritate her , James .
Parsing [sent. 9405 len. 16]: Her temper has been soured , remember , and ought not to be tried . '
Parsing [sent. 9406 len. 28]: Rosa did not come back ; and no other mention was made of her , until I went with Steerforth into his room to say Good night .
Parsing [sent. 9407 len. 22]: Then he laughed about her , and asked me if I had ever seen such a fierce little piece of incomprehensibility .
Parsing [sent. 9408 len. 34]: I expressed as much of my astonishment as was then capable of expression , and asked if he could guess what it was that she had taken so much amiss , so suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 9409 len. 10]: ` Oh , Heaven knows , ' said Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 9410 len. 8]: ` Anything you like -- or nothing !
Parsing [sent. 9411 len. 18]: I told you she took everything , herself included , to a grindstone , and sharpened it .
Parsing [sent. 9412 len. 13]: She is an edge-tool , and requires great care in dealing with .
Parsing [sent. 9413 len. 5]: She is always dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 9414 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 9415 len. 5]: ` Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 9416 len. 8]: said I , ` my dear Steerforth !
Parsing [sent. 9417 len. 11]: I shall be gone before you wake in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 9418 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 9419 len. 33]: He was unwilling to let me go ; and stood , holding me out , with a hand on each of my shoulders , as he had done in my own room .
Parsing [sent. 9420 len. 56]: ` Daisy , ' he said , with a smile -- ` for though that 's not the name your godfathers and godmothers gave you , it 's the name I like best to call you by -- and I wish , I wish , I wish , you could give it to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 9421 len. 35]: ` Why so I can , if I choose , ' said I. ` Daisy , if anything should ever separate us , you must think of me at my best , old boy .
Parsing [sent. 9422 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 9423 len. 6]: Let us make that bargain .
Parsing [sent. 9424 len. 15]: Think of me at my best , if circumstances should ever part us ! '
Parsing [sent. 9425 len. 19]: ` You have no best to me , Steerforth , ' said I , ` and no worst .
Parsing [sent. 9426 len. 13]: You are always equally loved , and cherished in my heart . '
Parsing [sent. 9427 len. 34]: So much compunction for having ever wronged him , even by a shapeless thought , did I feel within me , that the confession of having done so was rising to my lips .
Parsing [sent. 9428 len. 50]: But for the reluctance I had to betray the confidence of Agnes , but for my uncertainty how to approach the subject with no risk of doing so , it would have reached them before he said , ` God bless you , Daisy , and good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 9429 len. 19]: In my doubt , it did NOT reach them ; and we shook hands , and we parted .
Parsing [sent. 9430 len. 23]: I was up with the dull dawn , and , having dressed as quietly as I could , looked into his room .
Parsing [sent. 9431 len. 26]: He was fast asleep ; lying , easily , with his head upon his arm , as I had often seen him lie at school .
Parsing [sent. 9432 len. 29]: The time came in its season , and that was very soon , when I almost wondered that nothing troubled his repose , as I looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 9433 len. 34]: But he slept -- let me think of him so again -- as I had often seen him sleep at school ; and thus , in this silent hour , I left him .
Parsing [sent. 9434 len. 11]: - Never more , oh God forgive you , Steerforth !
Parsing [sent. 9435 len. 10]: to touch that passive hand in love and friendship .
Parsing [sent. 9436 len. 5]: Never , never more !
Parsing [sent. 9437 len. 19]: Chapter 30 A Loss I got down to Yarmouth in the evening , and went to the inn .
Parsing [sent. 9438 len. 61]: I knew that Peggotty 's spare room -- my room -- was likely to have occupation enough in a little while , if that great Visitor , before whose presence all the living must give place , were not already in the house ; so I betook myself to the inn , and dined there , and engaged my bed .
Parsing [sent. 9439 len. 9]: It was ten o'clock when I went out .
Parsing [sent. 9440 len. 13]: Many of the shops were shut , and the town was dull .
Parsing [sent. 9441 len. 22]: When I came to Omer and Joram 's , I found the shutters up , but the shop door standing open .
Parsing [sent. 9442 len. 30]: As I could obtain a perspective view of Mr. Omer inside , smoking his pipe by the parlour door , I entered , and asked him how he was .
Parsing [sent. 9443 len. 10]: ` Why , bless my life and soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 9444 len. 11]: said Mr. Omer , ` how do you find yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 9445 len. 4]: Take a seat .
Parsing [sent. 9446 len. 9]: -- Smoke not disagreeable , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 9447 len. 20]: ` By no means , ' said I. ' I like it -- in somebody else 's pipe . '
Parsing [sent. 9448 len. 11]: ` What , not in your own , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 9449 len. 6]: Mr. Omer returned , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 9450 len. 7]: ` All the better , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9451 len. 7]: Bad habit for a young man .
Parsing [sent. 9452 len. 4]: Take a seat .
Parsing [sent. 9453 len. 10]: I smoke , myself , for the asthma . '
Parsing [sent. 9454 len. 13]: Mr. Omer had made room for me , and placed a chair .
Parsing [sent. 9455 len. 32]: He now sat down again very much out of breath , gasping at his pipe as if it contained a supply of that necessary , without which he must perish . '
Parsing [sent. 9456 len. 16]: I am sorry to have heard bad news of Mr. Barkis , ' said I .
Parsing [sent. 9457 len. 16]: Mr. Omer looked at me , with a steady countenance , and shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 9458 len. 10]: ` Do you know how he is tonight ? '
Parsing [sent. 9459 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 9460 len. 25]: ` The very question I should have put to you , sir , ' returned Mr. Omer , ` but on account of delicacy .
Parsing [sent. 9461 len. 12]: It 's one of the drawbacks of our line of business .
Parsing [sent. 9462 len. 16]: When a party 's ill , we ca n't ask how the party is . '
Parsing [sent. 9463 len. 27]: The difficulty had not occurred to me ; though I had had my apprehensions too , when I went in , of hearing the old tune .
Parsing [sent. 9464 len. 16]: On its being mentioned , I recognized it , however , and said as much .
Parsing [sent. 9465 len. 17]: ` Yes , yes , you understand , ' said Mr. Omer , nodding his head .
Parsing [sent. 9466 len. 7]: ` We durs n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 9467 len. 36]: Bless you , it would be a shock that the generality of parties might n't recover , to say `` Omer and Joram 's compliments , and how do you find yourself this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9468 len. 11]: -- or this afternoon -- as it may be . '
Parsing [sent. 9469 len. 22]: Mr. Omer and I nodded at each other , and Mr. Omer recruited his wind by the aid of his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 9470 len. 26]: ` It 's one of the things that cut the trade off from attentions they could often wish to show , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 9471 len. 4]: ` Take myself .
Parsing [sent. 9472 len. 23]: If I have known Barkis a year , to move to as he went by , I have known him forty years .
Parsing [sent. 9473 len. 15]: But I ca n't go and say , `` how is he ? '' '
Parsing [sent. 9474 len. 16]: I felt it was rather hard on Mr. Omer , and I told him so .
Parsing [sent. 9475 len. 19]: ` I 'm not more self-interested , I hope , than another man , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 9476 len. 5]: ` Look at me !
Parsing [sent. 9477 len. 29]: My wind may fail me at any moment , and it ai n't likely that , to my own knowledge , I 'd be self-interested under such circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 9478 len. 43]: I say it ai n't likely , in a man who knows his wind will go , when it DOES go , as if a pair of bellows was cut open ; and that man a grandfather , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 9479 len. 9]: I said , ` Not at all . '
Parsing [sent. 9480 len. 18]: ` It ai n't that I complain of my line of business , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 9481 len. 6]: ` It ai n't that .
Parsing [sent. 9482 len. 14]: Some good and some bad goes , no doubt , to all callings .
Parsing [sent. 9483 len. 13]: What I wish is , that parties was brought up stronger-minded . '
Parsing [sent. 9484 len. 47]: Mr. Omer , with a very complacent and amiable face , took several puffs in silence ; and then said , resuming his first point : ` Accordingly we 're obleeged , in ascertaining how Barkis goes on , to limit ourselves to Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 9485 len. 29]: She knows what our real objects are , and she do n't have any more alarms or suspicions about us , than if we was so many lambs .
Parsing [sent. 9486 len. 58]: Minnie and Joram have just stepped down to the house , in fact -LRB- she 's there , after hours , helping her aunt a bit -RRB- , to ask her how he is tonight ; and if you was to please to wait till they come back , they 'd give you full partic ` lers .
Parsing [sent. 9487 len. 5]: Will you take something ?
Parsing [sent. 9488 len. 9]: A glass of srub and water , now ?
Parsing [sent. 9489 len. 40]: I smoke on srub and water , myself , ' said Mr. Omer , taking up his glass , ` because it 's considered softening to the passages , by which this troublesome breath of mine gets into action .
Parsing [sent. 9490 len. 25]: But , Lord bless you , ' said Mr. Omer , huskily , ` it ai n't the passages that 's out of order !
Parsing [sent. 9491 len. 26]: `` Give me breath enough , '' said I to my daughter Minnie , `` and I 'll find passages , my dear . '' '
Parsing [sent. 9492 len. 18]: He really had no breath to spare , and it was very alarming to see him laugh .
Parsing [sent. 9493 len. 65]: When he was again in a condition to be talked to , I thanked him for the proffered refreshment , which I declined , as I had just had dinner ; and , observing that I would wait , since he was so good as to invite me , until his daughter and his son-in-law came back , I inquired how little Emily was ?
Parsing [sent. 9494 len. 39]: ` Well , sir , ' said Mr. Omer , removing his pipe , that he might rub his chin : ' I tell you truly , I shall be glad when her marriage has taken place . '
Parsing [sent. 9495 len. 5]: ` Why so ? '
Parsing [sent. 9496 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 9497 len. 14]: ` Well , she 's unsettled at present , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 9498 len. 27]: ` It ai n't that she 's not as pretty as ever , for she 's prettier -- I do assure you , she is prettier .
Parsing [sent. 9499 len. 17]: It ai n't that she do n't work as well as ever , for she does .
Parsing [sent. 9500 len. 13]: She WAS worth any six , and she IS worth any six .
Parsing [sent. 9501 len. 6]: But somehow she wants heart .
Parsing [sent. 9502 len. 53]: If you understand , ' said Mr. Omer , after rubbing his chin again , and smoking a little , ` what I mean in a general way by the expression , `` A long pull , and a strong pull , and a pull altogether , my hearties , hurrah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9503 len. 24]: I should say to you , that that was -- in a general way -- what I miss in Em ` ly . '
Parsing [sent. 9504 len. 24]: Mr. Omer 's face and manner went for so much , that I could conscientiously nod my head , as divining his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 9505 len. 34]: My quickness of apprehension seemed to please him , and he went on : ` Now I consider this is principally on account of her being in an unsettled state , you see .
Parsing [sent. 9506 len. 36]: We have talked it over a good deal , her uncle and myself , and her sweetheart and myself , after business ; and I consider it is principally on account of her being unsettled .
Parsing [sent. 9507 len. 30]: You must always recollect of Em ` ly , ' said Mr. Omer , shaking his head gently , ` that she 's a most extraordinary affectionate little thing .
Parsing [sent. 9508 len. 20]: The proverb says , `` You ca n't make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear . ''
Parsing [sent. 9509 len. 9]: Well , I do n't know about that .
Parsing [sent. 9510 len. 13]: I rather think you may , if you begin early in life .
Parsing [sent. 9511 len. 23]: She has made a home out of that old boat , sir , that stone and marble could n't beat . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9512 len. 7]: I am sure she has ! '
Parsing [sent. 9513 len. 50]: said I. ` To see the clinging of that pretty little thing to her uncle , ' said Mr. Omer ; ` to see the way she holds on to him , tighter and tighter , and closer and closer , every day , is to see a sight .
Parsing [sent. 9514 len. 17]: Now , you know , there 's a struggle going on when that 's the case .
Parsing [sent. 9515 len. 13]: Why should it be made a longer one than is needful ? '
Parsing [sent. 9516 len. 22]: I listened attentively to the good old fellow , and acquiesced , with all my heart , in what he said .
Parsing [sent. 9517 len. 23]: ` Therefore , I mentioned to them , ' said Mr. Omer , in a comfortable , easy-going tone , ` this .
Parsing [sent. 9518 len. 22]: I said , `` Now , do n't consider Em ` ly nailed down in point of time , at all .
Parsing [sent. 9519 len. 6]: Make it your own time .
Parsing [sent. 9520 len. 38]: Her services have been more valuable than was supposed ; her learning has been quicker than was supposed ; Omer and Joram can run their pen through what remains ; and she 's free when you wish .
Parsing [sent. 9521 len. 27]: If she likes to make any little arrangement , afterwards , in the way of doing any little thing for us at home , very well .
Parsing [sent. 9522 len. 9]: If she do n't , very well still .
Parsing [sent. 9523 len. 8]: We 're no losers , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 9524 len. 56]: For -- do n't you see , ' said Mr. Omer , touching me with his pipe , ` it ai n't likely that a man so short of breath as myself , and a grandfather too , would go and strain points with a little bit of a blue-eyed blossom , like her ? '
Parsing [sent. 9525 len. 17]: ` Not at all , I am certain , ' said I. ` Not at all !
Parsing [sent. 9526 len. 5]: You 're right ! '
Parsing [sent. 9527 len. 4]: said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 9528 len. 23]: ` Well , sir , her cousin - you know it 's a cousin she 's going to be married to ? '
Parsing [sent. 9529 len. 9]: ` Oh yes , ' I replied . '
Parsing [sent. 9530 len. 6]: I know him well . '
Parsing [sent. 9531 len. 11]: ` Of course you do , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 9532 len. 5]: ` Well , sir !
Parsing [sent. 9533 len. 70]: Her cousin being , as it appears , in good work , and well to do , thanked me in a very manly sort of manner for this -LRB- conducting himself altogether , I must say , in a way that gives me a high opinion of him -RRB- , and went and took as comfortable a little house as you or I could wish to clap eyes on .
Parsing [sent. 9534 len. 50]: That little house is now furnished right through , as neat and complete as a doll 's parlour ; and but for Barkis 's illness having taken this bad turn , poor fellow , they would have been man and wife -- I dare say , by this time .
Parsing [sent. 9535 len. 10]: As it is , there 's a postponement . '
Parsing [sent. 9536 len. 8]: ` And Emily , Mr. Omer ? '
Parsing [sent. 9537 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 9538 len. 8]: ` Has she become more settled ? '
Parsing [sent. 9539 len. 24]: ` Why that , you know , ' he returned , rubbing his double chin again , ` ca n't naturally be expected .
Parsing [sent. 9540 len. 32]: The prospect of the change and separation , and all that , is , as one may say , close to her and far away from her , both at once .
Parsing [sent. 9541 len. 15]: Barkis 's death need n't put it off much , but his lingering might .
Parsing [sent. 9542 len. 15]: Anyway , it 's an uncertain state of matters , you see . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9543 len. 42]: I see , ' said I. ` Consequently , ' pursued Mr. Omer , 'Em ` ly 's still a little down , and a little fluttered ; perhaps , upon the whole , she 's more so than she was .
Parsing [sent. 9544 len. 23]: Every day she seems to get fonder and fonder of her uncle , and more loth to part from all of us .
Parsing [sent. 9545 len. 33]: A kind word from me brings the tears into her eyes ; and if you was to see her with my daughter Minnie 's little girl , you 'd never forget it .
Parsing [sent. 9546 len. 6]: Bless my heart alive ! '
Parsing [sent. 9547 len. 14]: said Mr. Omer , pondering , ` how she loves that child ! '
Parsing [sent. 9548 len. 38]: Having so favourable an opportunity , it occurred to me to ask Mr. Omer , before our conversation should be interrupted by the return of his daughter and her husband , whether he knew anything of Martha .
Parsing [sent. 9549 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 9550 len. 13]: he rejoined , shaking his head , and looking very much dejected .
Parsing [sent. 9551 len. 4]: ` No good .
Parsing [sent. 9552 len. 13]: A sad story , sir , however you come to know it .
Parsing [sent. 9553 len. 10]: I never thought there was harm in the girl .
Parsing [sent. 9554 len. 25]: I would n't wish to mention it before my daughter Minnie -- for she 'd take me up directly -- but I never did .
Parsing [sent. 9555 len. 7]: None of us ever did . '
Parsing [sent. 9556 len. 29]: Mr. Omer , hearing his daughter 's footstep before I heard it , touched me with his pipe , and shut up one eye , as a caution .
Parsing [sent. 9557 len. 9]: She and her husband came in immediately afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 9558 len. 69]: Their report was , that Mr. Barkis was ` as bad as bad could be ' ; that he was quite unconscious ; and that Mr. Chillip had mournfully said in the kitchen , on going away just now , that the College of Physicians , the College of Surgeons , and Apothecaries ' Hall , if they were all called in together , could n't help him .
Parsing [sent. 9559 len. 18]: He was past both Colleges , Mr. Chillip said , and the Hall could only poison him .
Parsing [sent. 9560 len. 21]: Hearing this , and learning that Mr. Peggotty was there , I determined to go to the house at once .
Parsing [sent. 9561 len. 37]: I bade good night to Mr. Omer , and to Mr. and Mrs. Joram ; and directed my steps thither , with a solemn feeling , which made Mr. Barkis quite a new and different creature .
Parsing [sent. 9562 len. 12]: My low tap at the door was answered by Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 9563 len. 14]: He was not so much surprised to see me as I had expected .
Parsing [sent. 9564 len. 41]: I remarked this in Peggotty , too , when she came down ; and I have seen it since ; and I think , in the expectation of that dread surprise , all other changes and surprises dwindle into nothing .
Parsing [sent. 9565 len. 20]: I shook hands with Mr. Peggotty , and passed into the kitchen , while he softly closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 9566 len. 15]: Little Emily was sitting by the fire , with her hands before her face .
Parsing [sent. 9567 len. 6]: Ham was standing near her .
Parsing [sent. 9568 len. 18]: We spoke in whispers ; listening , between whiles , for any sound in the room above .
Parsing [sent. 9569 len. 33]: I had not thought of it on the occasion of my last visit , but how strange it was to me , now , to miss Mr. Barkis out of the kitchen !
Parsing [sent. 9570 len. 18]: ` This is very kind of you , Mas ' r Davy , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 9571 len. 10]: ` It 's oncommon kind , ' said Ham .
Parsing [sent. 9572 len. 12]: 'Em ` ly , my dear , ' cried Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 9573 len. 4]: ` See here !
Parsing [sent. 9574 len. 8]: Here 's Mas ' r Davy come !
Parsing [sent. 9575 len. 7]: What , cheer up , pretty !
Parsing [sent. 9576 len. 10]: Not a wured to Mas ' r Davy ? '
Parsing [sent. 9577 len. 13]: There was a trembling upon her , that I can see now .
Parsing [sent. 9578 len. 15]: The coldness of her hand when I touched it , I can feel yet .
Parsing [sent. 9579 len. 41]: Its only sign of animation was to shrink from mine ; and then she glided from the chair , and creeping to the other side of her uncle , bowed herself , silently and trembling still , upon his breast .
Parsing [sent. 9580 len. 34]: ` It 's such a loving art , ' said Mr. Peggotty , smoothing her rich hair with his great hard hand , ` that it ca n't abear the sorrer of this .
Parsing [sent. 9581 len. 39]: It 's nat ` ral in young folk , Mas ' r Davy , when they 're new to these here trials , and timid , like my little bird , -- it 's nat ` ral . '
Parsing [sent. 9582 len. 19]: She clung the closer to him , but neither lifted up her face , nor spoke a word .
Parsing [sent. 9583 len. 26]: ` It 's getting late , my dear , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` and here 's Ham come fur to take you home .
Parsing [sent. 9584 len. 2]: Theer !
Parsing [sent. 9585 len. 9]: Go along with t ` other loving art !
Parsing [sent. 9586 len. 6]: What ' Em ` ly ?
Parsing [sent. 9587 len. 6]: Eh , my pretty ? '
Parsing [sent. 9588 len. 34]: The sound of her voice had not reached me , but he bent his head as if he listened to her , and then said : ` Let you stay with your uncle ?
Parsing [sent. 9589 len. 11]: Why , you doe n't mean to ask me that !
Parsing [sent. 9590 len. 7]: Stay with your uncle , Moppet ?
Parsing [sent. 9591 len. 17]: When your husband that 'll be so soon , is here fur to take you home ?
Parsing [sent. 9592 len. 65]: Now a person would n't think it , fur to see this little thing alongside a rough-weather chap like me , ' said Mr. Peggotty , looking round at both of us , with infinite pride ; ` but the sea ai n't more salt in it than she has fondness in her for her uncle -- a foolish little Em ` ly ! '
Parsing [sent. 9593 len. 16]: 'Em ` ly 's in the right in that , Mas ' r Davy ! '
Parsing [sent. 9594 len. 3]: said Ham .
Parsing [sent. 9595 len. 4]: ` Lookee here !
Parsing [sent. 9596 len. 27]: As Em ` ly wishes of it , and as she 's hurried and frightened , like , besides , I 'll leave her till morning .
Parsing [sent. 9597 len. 6]: Let me stay too ! '
Parsing [sent. 9598 len. 10]: ` No , no , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 9599 len. 28]: ` You doe n't ought -- a married man like you -- or what 's as good -- to take and hull away a day 's work .
Parsing [sent. 9600 len. 11]: And you doe n't ought to watch and work both .
Parsing [sent. 9601 len. 5]: That wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 9602 len. 7]: You go home and turn in .
Parsing [sent. 9603 len. 19]: You ai n't afeerd of Em ` ly not being took good care on , I know . '
Parsing [sent. 9604 len. 13]: Ham yielded to this persuasion , and took his hat to go .
Parsing [sent. 9605 len. 6]: Even when he kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 9606 len. 41]: -- and I never saw him approach her , but I felt that nature had given him the soul of a gentleman -- she seemed to cling closer to her uncle , even to the avoidance of her chosen husband .
Parsing [sent. 9607 len. 34]: I shut the door after him , that it might cause no disturbance of the quiet that prevailed ; and when I turned back , I found Mr. Peggotty still talking to her .
Parsing [sent. 9608 len. 33]: ` Now , I 'm a going upstairs to tell your aunt as Mas ' r Davy 's here , and that 'll cheer her up a bit , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 9609 len. 21]: ` Sit ye down by the fire , the while , my dear , and warm those mortal cold hands .
Parsing [sent. 9610 len. 15]: You doe n't need to be so fearsome , and take on so much .
Parsing [sent. 9611 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 9612 len. 7]: You 'll go along with me ?
Parsing [sent. 9613 len. 3]: -- Well !
Parsing [sent. 9614 len. 7]: come along with me -- come !
Parsing [sent. 9615 len. 51]: If her uncle was turned out of house and home , and forced to lay down in a dyke , Mas ' r Davy , ' said Mr. Peggotty , with no less pride than before , ` it 's my belief she 'd go along with him , now !
Parsing [sent. 9616 len. 20]: But there 'll be someone else , soon , -- someone else , soon , Em ` ly ! '
Parsing [sent. 9617 len. 38]: Afterwards , when I went upstairs , as I passed the door of my little chamber , which was dark , I had an indistinct impression of her being within it , cast down upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 9618 len. 27]: But , whether it was really she , or whether it was a confusion of the shadows in the room , I do n't know now .
Parsing [sent. 9619 len. 86]: I had leisure to think , before the kitchen fire , of pretty little Emily 's dread of death -- which , added to what Mr. Omer had told me , I took to be the cause of her being so unlike herself -- and I had leisure , before Peggotty came down , even to think more leniently of the weakness of it : as I sat counting the ticking of the clock , and deepening my sense of the solemn hush around me .
Parsing [sent. 9620 len. 34]: Peggotty took me in her arms , and blessed and thanked me over and over again for being such a comfort to her -LRB- that was what she said -RRB- in her distress .
Parsing [sent. 9621 len. 68]: She then entreated me to come upstairs , sobbing that Mr. Barkis had always liked me and admired me ; that he had often talked of me , before he fell into a stupor ; and that she believed , in case of his coming to himself again , he would brighten up at sight of me , if he could brighten up at any earthly thing .
Parsing [sent. 9622 len. 22]: The probability of his ever doing so , appeared to me , when I saw him , to be very small .
Parsing [sent. 9623 len. 32]: He was lying with his head and shoulders out of bed , in an uncomfortable attitude , half resting on the box which had cost him so much pain and trouble .
Parsing [sent. 9624 len. 62]: I learned , that , when he was past creeping out of bed to open it , and past assuring himself of its safety by means of the divining rod I had seen him use , he had required to have it placed on the chair at the bed-side , where he had ever since embraced it , night and day .
Parsing [sent. 9625 len. 7]: His arm lay on it now .
Parsing [sent. 9626 len. 35]: Time and the world were slipping from beneath him , but the box was there ; and the last words he had uttered were -LRB- in an explanatory tone -RRB- ` Old clothes ! '
Parsing [sent. 9627 len. 7]: ` Barkis , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 9628 len. 22]: said Peggotty , almost cheerfully : bending over him , while her brother and I stood at the bed 's foot .
Parsing [sent. 9629 len. 21]: ` Here 's my dear boy -- my dear boy , Master Davy , who brought us together , Barkis !
Parsing [sent. 9630 len. 9]: That you sent messages by , you know !
Parsing [sent. 9631 len. 9]: Wo n't you speak to Master Davy ? '
Parsing [sent. 9632 len. 21]: He was as mute and senseless as the box , from which his form derived the only expression it had .
Parsing [sent. 9633 len. 21]: ` He 's a going out with the tide , ' said Mr. Peggotty to me , behind his hand .
Parsing [sent. 9634 len. 24]: My eyes were dim and so were Mr. Peggotty 's ; but I repeated in a whisper , ` With the tide ? '
Parsing [sent. 9635 len. 25]: ` People ca n't die , along the coast , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` except when the tide 's pretty nigh out .
Parsing [sent. 9636 len. 20]: They ca n't be born , unless it 's pretty nigh in -- not properly born , till flood .
Parsing [sent. 9637 len. 9]: He 's a going out with the tide .
Parsing [sent. 9638 len. 13]: It 's ebb at half-arter three , slack water half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 9639 len. 26]: If he lives till it turns , he 'll hold his own till past the flood , and go out with the next tide . '
Parsing [sent. 9640 len. 13]: We remained there , watching him , a long time -- hours .
Parsing [sent. 9641 len. 44]: What mysterious influence my presence had upon him in that state of his senses , I shall not pretend to say ; but when he at last began to wander feebly , it is certain he was muttering about driving me to school .
Parsing [sent. 9642 len. 11]: ` He 's coming to himself , ' said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 9643 len. 13]: Mr. Peggotty touched me , and whispered with much awe and reverence .
Parsing [sent. 9644 len. 9]: ` They are both a-going out fast . '
Parsing [sent. 9645 len. 7]: ` Barkis , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 9646 len. 3]: said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 9647 len. 10]: ` C. P. Barkis , ' he cried faintly .
Parsing [sent. 9648 len. 7]: ` No better woman anywhere ! '
Parsing [sent. 9649 len. 3]: ` Look !
Parsing [sent. 9650 len. 6]: Here 's Master Davy ! '
Parsing [sent. 9651 len. 3]: said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 9652 len. 7]: For he now opened his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 9653 len. 41]: I was on the point of asking him if he knew me , when he tried to stretch out his arm , and said to me , distinctly , with a pleasant smile : ` Barkis is willin ' ! '
Parsing [sent. 9654 len. 14]: And , it being low water , he went out with the tide .
Parsing [sent. 9655 len. 42]: Chapter 31 A Greater Loss It was not difficult for me , on Peggotty 's solicitation , to resolve to stay where I was , until after the remains of the poor carrier should have made their last journey to Blunderstone .
Parsing [sent. 9656 len. 45]: She had long ago bought , out of her own savings , a little piece of ground in our old churchyard near the grave of ` her sweet girl ' , as she always called my mother ; and there they were to rest .
Parsing [sent. 9657 len. 41]: In keeping Peggotty company , and doing all I could for her -LRB- little enough at the utmost -RRB- , I was as grateful , I rejoice to think , as even now I could wish myself to have been .
Parsing [sent. 9658 len. 31]: But I am afraid I had a supreme satisfaction , of a personal and professional nature , in taking charge of Mr. Barkis 's will , and expounding its contents .
Parsing [sent. 9659 len. 21]: I may claim the merit of having originated the suggestion that the will should be looked for in the box .
Parsing [sent. 9660 len. 156]: After some search , it was found in the box , at the bottom of a horse 's nose-bag ; wherein -LRB- besides hay -RRB- there was discovered an old gold watch , with chain and seals , which Mr. Barkis had worn on his wedding-day , and which had never been seen before or since ; a silver tobacco-stopper , in the form of a leg ; an imitation lemon , full of minute cups and saucers , which I have some idea Mr. Barkis must have purchased to present to me when I was a child , and afterwards found himself unable to part with ; eighty-seven guineas and a half , in guineas and half-guineas ; two hundred and ten pounds , in perfectly clean Bank notes ; certain receipts for Bank of England stock ; an old horseshoe , a bad shilling , a piece of camphor , and an oyster-shell .
Parsing [sent. 9661 len. 40]: From the circumstance of the latter article having been much polished , and displaying prismatic colours on the inside , I conclude that Mr. Barkis had some general ideas about pearls , which never resolved themselves into anything definite .
Parsing [sent. 9662 len. 20]: For years and years , Mr. Barkis had carried this box , on all his journeys , every day .
Parsing [sent. 9663 len. 51]: That it might the better escape notice , he had invented a fiction that it belonged to ` Mr. Blackboy ' , and was ` to be left with Barkis till called for ' ; a fable he had elaborately written on the lid , in characters now scarcely legible .
Parsing [sent. 9664 len. 15]: He had hoarded , all these years , I found , to good purpose .
Parsing [sent. 9665 len. 11]: His property in money amounted to nearly three thousand pounds .
Parsing [sent. 9666 len. 48]: Of this he bequeathed the interest of one thousand to Mr. Peggotty for his life ; on his decease , the principal to be equally divided between Peggotty , little Emily , and me , or the survivor or survivors of us , share and share alike .
Parsing [sent. 9667 len. 30]: All the rest he died possessed of , he bequeathed to Peggotty ; whom he left residuary legatee , and sole executrix of that his last will and testament .
Parsing [sent. 9668 len. 34]: I felt myself quite a proctor when I read this document aloud with all possible ceremony , and set forth its provisions , any number of times , to those whom they concerned .
Parsing [sent. 9669 len. 15]: I began to think there was more in the Commons than I had supposed .
Parsing [sent. 9670 len. 37]: I examined the will with the deepest attention , pronounced it perfectly formal in all respects , made a pencil-mark or so in the margin , and thought it rather extraordinary that I knew so much .
Parsing [sent. 9671 len. 56]: In this abstruse pursuit ; in making an account for Peggotty , of all the property into which she had come ; in arranging all the affairs in an orderly manner ; and in being her referee and adviser on every point , to our joint delight ; I passed the week before the funeral .
Parsing [sent. 9672 len. 24]: I did not see little Emily in that interval , but they told me she was to be quietly married in a fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 9673 len. 17]: I did not attend the funeral in character , if I may venture to say so .
Parsing [sent. 9674 len. 48]: I mean I was not dressed up in a black coat and a streamer , to frighten the birds ; but I walked over to Blunderstone early in the morning , and was in the churchyard when it came , attended only by Peggotty and her brother .
Parsing [sent. 9675 len. 57]: The mad gentleman looked on , out of my little window ; Mr. Chillip 's baby wagged its heavy head , and rolled its goggle eyes , at the clergyman , over its nurse 's shoulder ; Mr. Omer breathed short in the background ; no one else was there ; and it was very quiet .
Parsing [sent. 9676 len. 28]: We walked about the churchyard for an hour , after all was over ; and pulled some young leaves from the tree above my mother 's grave .
Parsing [sent. 9677 len. 7]: A dread falls on me here .
Parsing [sent. 9678 len. 17]: A cloud is lowering on the distant town , towards which I retraced my solitary steps .
Parsing [sent. 9679 len. 6]: I fear to approach it .
Parsing [sent. 9680 len. 27]: I can not bear to think of what did come , upon that memorable night ; of what must come again , if I go on .
Parsing [sent. 9681 len. 11]: It is no worse , because I write of it .
Parsing [sent. 9682 len. 14]: It would be no better , if I stopped my most unwilling hand .
Parsing [sent. 9683 len. 4]: It is done .
Parsing [sent. 9684 len. 15]: Nothing can undo it ; nothing can make it otherwise than as it was .
Parsing [sent. 9685 len. 20]: My old nurse was to go to London with me next day , on the business of the will .
Parsing [sent. 9686 len. 11]: Little Emily was passing that day at Mr. Omer 's .
Parsing [sent. 9687 len. 12]: We were all to meet in the old boathouse that night .
Parsing [sent. 9688 len. 9]: Ham would bring Emily at the usual hour .
Parsing [sent. 9689 len. 8]: I would walk back at my leisure .
Parsing [sent. 9690 len. 26]: The brother and sister would return as they had come , and be expecting us , when the day closed in , at the fireside .
Parsing [sent. 9691 len. 42]: I parted from them at the wicket-gate , where visionary Strap had rested with Roderick Random 's knapsack in the days of yore ; and , instead of going straight back , walked a little distance on the road to Lowestoft .
Parsing [sent. 9692 len. 10]: Then I turned , and walked back towards Yarmouth .
Parsing [sent. 9693 len. 37]: I stayed to dine at a decent alehouse , some mile or two from the Ferry I have mentioned before ; and thus the day wore away , and it was evening when I reached it .
Parsing [sent. 9694 len. 30]: Rain was falling heavily by that time , and it was a wild night ; but there was a moon behind the clouds , and it was not dark .
Parsing [sent. 9695 len. 22]: I was soon within sight of Mr. Peggotty 's house , and of the light within it shining through the window .
Parsing [sent. 9696 len. 22]: A little floundering across the sand , which was heavy , brought me to the door , and I went in .
Parsing [sent. 9697 len. 6]: It looked very comfortable indeed .
Parsing [sent. 9698 len. 18]: Mr. Peggotty had smoked his evening pipe and there were preparations for some supper by and by .
Parsing [sent. 9699 len. 23]: The fire was bright , the ashes were thrown up , the locker was ready for little Emily in her old place .
Parsing [sent. 9700 len. 26]: In her own old place sat Peggotty , once more , looking -LRB- but for her dress -RRB- as if she had never left it .
Parsing [sent. 9701 len. 48]: She had fallen back , already , on the society of the work-box with St. Paul 's upon the lid , the yard-measure in the cottage , and the bit of wax-candle ; and there they all were , just as if they had never been disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 9702 len. 22]: Mrs. Gummidge appeared to be fretting a little , in her old corner ; and consequently looked quite natural , too .
Parsing [sent. 9703 len. 14]: ` You 're first of the lot , Mas ' r Davy ! '
Parsing [sent. 9704 len. 8]: said Mr. Peggotty with a happy face .
Parsing [sent. 9705 len. 16]: ` Doe n't keep in that coat , sir , if it 's wet . '
Parsing [sent. 9706 len. 20]: ` Thank you , Mr. Peggotty , ' said I , giving him my outer coat to hang up .
Parsing [sent. 9707 len. 7]: ` It 's quite dry . '
Parsing [sent. 9708 len. 6]: ` So 't is ! '
Parsing [sent. 9709 len. 8]: said Mr. Peggotty , feeling my shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 9710 len. 5]: ` As a chip !
Parsing [sent. 9711 len. 6]: Sit ye down , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9712 len. 22]: It ai n't o ' no use saying welcome to you , but you 're welcome , kind and hearty . '
Parsing [sent. 9713 len. 13]: ` Thank you , Mr. Peggotty , I am sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 9714 len. 5]: Well , Peggotty ! '
Parsing [sent. 9715 len. 8]: said I , giving her a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 9716 len. 10]: ` And how are you , old woman ? '
Parsing [sent. 9717 len. 6]: ` Ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 9718 len. 60]: laughed Mr. Peggotty , sitting down beside us , and rubbing his hands in his sense of relief from recent trouble , and in the genuine heartiness of his nature ; ` there 's not a woman in the wureld , sir -- as I tell her -- that need to feel more easy in her mind than her !
Parsing [sent. 9719 len. 47]: She done her dooty by the departed , and the departed know 'd it ; and the departed done what was right by her , as she done what was right by the departed ; -- and -- and -- and it 's all right ! '
Parsing [sent. 9720 len. 4]: Mrs. Gummidge groaned .
Parsing [sent. 9721 len. 9]: ` Cheer up , my pritty mawther ! '
Parsing [sent. 9722 len. 4]: said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 9723 len. 29]: -LRB- But he shook his head aside at us , evidently sensible of the tendency of the late occurrences to recall the memory of the old one . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 9724 len. 6]: ` Doe n't be down !
Parsing [sent. 9725 len. 30]: Cheer up , for your own self , on ' y a little bit , and see if a good deal more doe n't come nat ` ral ! '
Parsing [sent. 9726 len. 14]: ` Not to me , Dan ` l , ' returned Mrs. Gummidge .
Parsing [sent. 9727 len. 16]: ` Nothink 's nat ` ral to me but to be lone and lorn . '
Parsing [sent. 9728 len. 14]: ` No , no , ' said Mr. Peggotty , soothing her sorrows .
Parsing [sent. 9729 len. 10]: ` Yes , yes , Dan ` l ! '
Parsing [sent. 9730 len. 5]: said Mrs. Gummidge . '
Parsing [sent. 9731 len. 15]: I ai n't a person to live with them as has had money left .
Parsing [sent. 9732 len. 7]: Thinks go too contrary with me .
Parsing [sent. 9733 len. 8]: I had better be a riddance . '
Parsing [sent. 9734 len. 13]: ` Why , how should I ever spend it without you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9735 len. 11]: said Mr. Peggotty , with an air of serious remonstrance .
Parsing [sent. 9736 len. 8]: ` What are you a talking on ?
Parsing [sent. 9737 len. 15]: Doe n't I want you more now , than ever I did ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9738 len. 10]: I know 'd I was never wanted before ! '
Parsing [sent. 9739 len. 17]: cried Mrs. Gummidge , with a pitiable whimper , ` and now I 'm told so !
Parsing [sent. 9740 len. 19]: How could I expect to be wanted , being so lone and lorn , and so contrary ! '
Parsing [sent. 9741 len. 37]: Mr. Peggotty seemed very much shocked at himself for having made a speech capable of this unfeeling construction , but was prevented from replying , by Peggotty 's pulling his sleeve , and shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 9742 len. 35]: After looking at Mrs. Gummidge for some moments , in sore distress of mind , he glanced at the Dutch clock , rose , snuffed the candle , and put it in the window .
Parsing [sent. 9743 len. 3]: ` Theer !
Parsing [sent. 9744 len. 7]: ` said Mr. Peggotty , cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 9745 len. 9]: ` Theer we are , Missis Gummidge ! '
Parsing [sent. 9746 len. 5]: Mrs. Gummidge slightly groaned .
Parsing [sent. 9747 len. 9]: ` Lighted up , accordin ' to custom !
Parsing [sent. 9748 len. 12]: You 're a wonderin ' what that 's fur , sir !
Parsing [sent. 9749 len. 11]: Well , it 's fur our little Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 9750 len. 38]: You see , the path ai n't over light or cheerful arter dark ; and when I 'm here at the hour as she 's a comin ' home , I puts the light in the winder .
Parsing [sent. 9751 len. 22]: That , you see , ' said Mr. Peggotty , bending over me with great glee , ` meets two objects .
Parsing [sent. 9752 len. 14]: She says , says Em ` ly , `` Theer 's home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9753 len. 3]: she says .
Parsing [sent. 9754 len. 15]: And likewise , says Em ` ly , `` My uncle 's theer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9755 len. 15]: Fur if I ai n't theer , I never have no light showed . '
Parsing [sent. 9756 len. 7]: ` You 're a baby ! '
Parsing [sent. 9757 len. 15]: said Peggotty ; very fond of him for it , if she thought so .
Parsing [sent. 9758 len. 41]: ` Well , ' returned Mr. Peggotty , standing with his legs pretty wide apart , and rubbing his hands up and down them in his comfortable satisfaction , as he looked alternately at us and at the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 9759 len. 8]: I doe n't know but I am .
Parsing [sent. 9760 len. 10]: Not , you see , to look at . '
Parsing [sent. 9761 len. 8]: ` Not azackly , ' observed Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 9762 len. 24]: ` No , ' laughed Mr. Peggotty , ` not to look at , but to -- to consider on , you know .
Parsing [sent. 9763 len. 8]: I doe n't care , bless you !
Parsing [sent. 9764 len. 5]: Now I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 9765 len. 38]: When I go a looking and looking about that theer pritty house of our Em ` ly 's , I 'm -- I 'm Gormed , ' said Mr. Peggotty , with sudden emphasis - ` theer !
Parsing [sent. 9766 len. 23]: I ca n't say more -- if I doe n't feel as if the littlest things was her , a ` most .
Parsing [sent. 9767 len. 26]: I takes 'em up and I put 'em down , and I touches of 'em as delicate as if they was our Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 9768 len. 10]: So 't is with her little bonnets and that .
Parsing [sent. 9769 len. 18]: I could n't see one on 'em rough used a purpose -- not fur the whole wureld .
Parsing [sent. 9770 len. 17]: There 's a babby fur you , in the form of a great Sea Porkypine ! '
Parsing [sent. 9771 len. 13]: said Mr. Peggotty , relieving his earnestness with a roar of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 9772 len. 11]: Peggotty and I both laughed , but not so loud .
Parsing [sent. 9773 len. 80]: ` It 's my opinion , you see , ' said Mr. Peggotty , with a delighted face , after some further rubbing of his legs , ` as this is along of my havin ' played with her so much , and made believe as we was Turks , and French , and sharks , and every wariety of forinners -- bless you , yes ; and lions and whales , and I doe n't know what all !
Parsing [sent. 9774 len. 11]: - when she war n't no higher than my knee .
Parsing [sent. 9775 len. 12]: I 've got into the way on it , you know .
Parsing [sent. 9776 len. 9]: Why , this here candle , now ! '
Parsing [sent. 9777 len. 38]: said Mr. Peggotty , gleefully holding out his hand towards it , ' I know wery well that arter she 's married and gone , I shall put that candle theer , just the same as now .
Parsing [sent. 9778 len. 32]: I know wery well that when I 'm here o ' nights -LRB- and where else should I live , bless your arts , whatever fortun ' I come into ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 9779 len. 40]: and she ai n't here or I ai n't theer , I shall put the candle in the winder , and sit afore the fire , pretending I 'm expecting of her , like I 'm a doing now .
Parsing [sent. 9780 len. 25]: THERE 'S a babby for you , ' said Mr. Peggotty , with another roar , ` in the form of a Sea Porkypine !
Parsing [sent. 9781 len. 28]: Why , at the present minute , when I see the candle sparkle up , I says to myself , `` She 's a looking at it !
Parsing [sent. 9782 len. 8]: Em ` ly 's a coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9783 len. 15]: THERE 'S a babby for you , in the form of a Sea Porkypine !
Parsing [sent. 9784 len. 28]: Right for all that , ' said Mr. Peggotty , stopping in his roar , and smiting his hands together ; ` fur here she is ! '
Parsing [sent. 9785 len. 5]: It was only Ham .
Parsing [sent. 9786 len. 28]: The night should have turned more wet since I came in , for he had a large sou ` wester hat on , slouched over his face .
Parsing [sent. 9787 len. 8]: ` Wheer 's Em ` ly ? '
Parsing [sent. 9788 len. 4]: said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 9789 len. 14]: Ham made a motion with his head , as if she were outside .
Parsing [sent. 9790 len. 63]: Mr. Peggotty took the light from the window , trimmed it , put it on the table , and was busily stirring the fire , when Ham , who had not moved , said : ` Mas ' r Davy , will you come out a minute , and see what Em ` ly and me has got to show you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9791 len. 4]: We went out .
Parsing [sent. 9792 len. 23]: As I passed him at the door , I saw , to my astonishment and fright , that he was deadly pale .
Parsing [sent. 9793 len. 16]: He pushed me hastily into the open air , and closed the door upon us .
Parsing [sent. 9794 len. 5]: Only upon us two .
Parsing [sent. 9795 len. 3]: ` Ham !
Parsing [sent. 9796 len. 6]: what 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 9797 len. 6]: ` Mas ' r Davy !
Parsing [sent. 9798 len. 14]: -- ' Oh , for his broken heart , how dreadfully he wept !
Parsing [sent. 9799 len. 10]: I was paralysed by the sight of such grief .
Parsing [sent. 9800 len. 13]: I do n't know what I thought , or what I dreaded .
Parsing [sent. 9801 len. 7]: I could only look at him .
Parsing [sent. 9802 len. 3]: ` Ham !
Parsing [sent. 9803 len. 4]: Poor good fellow !
Parsing [sent. 9804 len. 13]: For Heaven 's sake , tell me what 's the matter ! '
Parsing [sent. 9805 len. 36]: ` My love , Mas ' r Davy -- the pride and hope of my art -- her that I 'd have died for , and would die for now -- she 's gone ! '
Parsing [sent. 9806 len. 4]: ` Gone ! '
Parsing [sent. 9807 len. 7]: 'Em ` ly 's run away !
Parsing [sent. 9808 len. 46]: Oh , Mas ' r Davy , think HOW she 's run away , when I pray my good and gracious God to kill her -LRB- her that is so dear above all things -RRB- sooner than let her come to ruin and disgrace ! '
Parsing [sent. 9809 len. 38]: The face he turned up to the troubled sky , the quivering of his clasped hands , the agony of his figure , remain associated with the lonely waste , in my remembrance , to this hour .
Parsing [sent. 9810 len. 16]: It is always night there , and he is the only object in the scene .
Parsing [sent. 9811 len. 21]: ` You 're a scholar , ' he said , hurriedly , ` and know what 's right and best .
Parsing [sent. 9812 len. 8]: What am I to say , indoors ?
Parsing [sent. 9813 len. 16]: How am I ever to break it to him , Mas ' r Davy ? '
Parsing [sent. 9814 len. 24]: I saw the door move , and instinctively tried to hold the latch on the outside , to gain a moment 's time .
Parsing [sent. 9815 len. 5]: It was too late .
Parsing [sent. 9816 len. 32]: Mr. Peggotty thrust forth his face ; and never could I forget the change that came upon it when he saw us , if I were to live five hundred years .
Parsing [sent. 9817 len. 80]: I remember a great wail and cry , and the women hanging about him , and we all standing in the room ; I with a paper in my hand , which Ham had given me ; Mr. Peggotty , with his vest torn open , his hair wild , his face and lips quite white , and blood trickling down his bosom -LRB- it had sprung from his mouth , I think -RRB- , looking fixedly at me .
Parsing [sent. 9818 len. 16]: ` Read it , sir , ' he said , in a low shivering voice .
Parsing [sent. 9819 len. 5]: ` Slow , please .
Parsing [sent. 9820 len. 10]: I doe n't know as I can understand . '
Parsing [sent. 9821 len. 54]: In the midst of the silence of death , I read thus , from a blotted letter : ' `` When you , who love me so much better than I ever have deserved , even when my mind was innocent , see this , I shall be far away . '' ' '
Parsing [sent. 9822 len. 11]: I shall be fur away , ' he repeated slowly .
Parsing [sent. 9823 len. 3]: ` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 9824 len. 6]: Em ` ly fur away .
Parsing [sent. 9825 len. 4]: Well ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 9826 len. 18]: `` When I leave my dear home -- my dear home -- oh , my dear home !
Parsing [sent. 9827 len. 35]: -- in the morning , '' ' the letter bore date on the previous night : ' '' - it will be never to come back , unless he brings me back a lady .
Parsing [sent. 9828 len. 15]: This will be found at night , many hours after , instead of me .
Parsing [sent. 9829 len. 11]: Oh , if you knew how my heart is torn .
Parsing [sent. 9830 len. 24]: If even you , that I have wronged so much , that never can forgive me , could only know what I suffer !
Parsing [sent. 9831 len. 9]: I am too wicked to write about myself !
Parsing [sent. 9832 len. 12]: Oh , take comfort in thinking that I am so bad .
Parsing [sent. 9833 len. 20]: Oh , for mercy 's sake , tell uncle that I never loved him half so dear as now .
Parsing [sent. 9834 len. 44]: Oh , do n't remember how affectionate and kind you have all been to me -- do n't remember we were ever to be married -- but try to think as if I died when I was little , and was buried somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 9835 len. 15]: Pray Heaven that I am going away from , have compassion on my uncle !
Parsing [sent. 9836 len. 11]: Tell him that I never loved him half so dear .
Parsing [sent. 9837 len. 4]: Be his comfort .
Parsing [sent. 9838 len. 32]: Love some good girl that will be what I was once to uncle , and be true to you , and worthy of you , and know no shame but me .
Parsing [sent. 9839 len. 4]: God bless all !
Parsing [sent. 9840 len. 12]: I 'll pray for all , often , on my knees .
Parsing [sent. 9841 len. 26]: If he do n't bring me back a lady , and I do n't pray for my own self , I 'll pray for all .
Parsing [sent. 9842 len. 6]: My parting love to uncle .
Parsing [sent. 9843 len. 14]: My last tears , and my last thanks , for uncle ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 9844 len. 4]: That was all .
Parsing [sent. 9845 len. 16]: He stood , long after I had ceased to read , still looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 9846 len. 29]: At length I ventured to take his hand , and to entreat him , as well as I could , to endeavour to get some command of himself .
Parsing [sent. 9847 len. 13]: He replied , ' I thankee , sir , I thankee ! '
Parsing [sent. 9848 len. 3]: without moving .
Parsing [sent. 9849 len. 5]: Ham spoke to him .
Parsing [sent. 9850 len. 35]: Mr. Peggotty was so far sensible of HIS affliction , that he wrung his hand ; but , otherwise , he remained in the same state , and no one dared to disturb him .
Parsing [sent. 9851 len. 29]: Slowly , at last , he moved his eyes from my face , as if he were waking from a vision , and cast them round the room .
Parsing [sent. 9852 len. 15]: Then he said , in a low voice : ` Who 's the man ?
Parsing [sent. 9853 len. 8]: I want to know his name . '
Parsing [sent. 9854 len. 16]: Ham glanced at me , and suddenly I felt a shock that struck me back .
Parsing [sent. 9855 len. 12]: ` There 's a man suspected , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 9856 len. 6]: ` Who is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 9857 len. 7]: ` Mas ' r Davy ! '
Parsing [sent. 9858 len. 3]: implored Ham .
Parsing [sent. 9859 len. 15]: ` Go out a bit , and let me tell him what I must .
Parsing [sent. 9860 len. 11]: You doe n't ought to hear it , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 9861 len. 6]: I felt the shock again .
Parsing [sent. 9862 len. 27]: I sank down in a chair , and tried to utter some reply ; but my tongue was fettered , and my sight was weak . '
Parsing [sent. 9863 len. 8]: I want to know his name ! '
Parsing [sent. 9864 len. 6]: I heard said once more .
Parsing [sent. 9865 len. 23]: ` For some time past , ' Ham faltered , ` there 's been a servant about here , at odd times .
Parsing [sent. 9866 len. 10]: There 's been a gen ` lm 'n too .
Parsing [sent. 9867 len. 9]: Both of 'em belonged to one another . '
Parsing [sent. 9868 len. 13]: Mr. Peggotty stood fixed as before , but now looking at him .
Parsing [sent. 9869 len. 21]: ` The servant , ' pursued Ham , ` was seen along with -- our poor girl -- last night .
Parsing [sent. 9870 len. 13]: He 's been in hiding about here , this week or over .
Parsing [sent. 9871 len. 12]: He was thought to have gone , but he was hiding .
Parsing [sent. 9872 len. 13]: Doe n't stay , Mas ' r Davy , doe n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 9873 len. 27]: I felt Peggotty 's arm round my neck , but I could not have moved if the house had been about to fall upon me . '
Parsing [sent. 9874 len. 30]: A strange chay and hosses was outside town , this morning , on the Norwich road , a ` most afore the day broke , ' Ham went on .
Parsing [sent. 9875 len. 18]: ` The servant went to it , and come from it , and went to it again .
Parsing [sent. 9876 len. 14]: When he went to it again , Em ` ly was nigh him .
Parsing [sent. 9877 len. 7]: The t ` other was inside .
Parsing [sent. 9878 len. 6]: He 's the man . '
Parsing [sent. 9879 len. 30]: ` For the Lord 's love , ' said Mr. Peggotty , falling back , and putting out his hand , as if to keep off what he dreaded .
Parsing [sent. 9880 len. 11]: ` Doe n't tell me his name 's Steerforth ! '
Parsing [sent. 9881 len. 49]: ` Mas ' r Davy , ' exclaimed Ham , in a broken voice , ` it ai n't no fault of yourn -- and I am far from laying of it to you -- but his name is Steerforth , and he 's a damned villain ! '
Parsing [sent. 9882 len. 40]: Mr. Peggotty uttered no cry , and shed no tear , and moved no more , until he seemed to wake again , all at once , and pulled down his rough coat from its peg in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 9883 len. 7]: ` Bear a hand with this !
Parsing [sent. 9884 len. 19]: I 'm struck of a heap , and ca n't do it , ' he said , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 9885 len. 8]: ` Bear a hand and help me .
Parsing [sent. 9886 len. 3]: Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 9887 len. 6]: when somebody had done so .
Parsing [sent. 9888 len. 9]: ` Now give me that theer hat ! '
Parsing [sent. 9889 len. 8]: Ham asked him whither he was going .
Parsing [sent. 9890 len. 10]: ` I 'm a going to seek my niece .
Parsing [sent. 9891 len. 11]: I 'm a going to seek my Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 9892 len. 43]: I 'm a going , first , to stave in that theer boat , and sink it where I would have drownded him , as I 'm a living soul , if I had had one thought of what was in him !
Parsing [sent. 9893 len. 47]: As he sat afore me , ' he said , wildly , holding out his clenched right hand , ` as he sat afore me , face to face , strike me down dead , but I 'd have drownded him , and thought it right !
Parsing [sent. 9894 len. 11]: -- I 'm a going to seek my niece . '
Parsing [sent. 9895 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 9896 len. 9]: cried Ham , interposing himself before the door .
Parsing [sent. 9897 len. 3]: ` Anywhere !
Parsing [sent. 9898 len. 12]: I 'm a going to seek my niece through the wureld .
Parsing [sent. 9899 len. 18]: I 'm a going to find my poor niece in her shame , and bring her back .
Parsing [sent. 9900 len. 5]: No one stop me !
Parsing [sent. 9901 len. 13]: I tell you I 'm a going to seek my niece ! '
Parsing [sent. 9902 len. 6]: ` No , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 9903 len. 14]: cried Mrs. Gummidge , coming between them , in a fit of crying .
Parsing [sent. 9904 len. 15]: ` No , no , Dan ` l , not as you are now .
Parsing [sent. 9905 len. 21]: Seek her in a little while , my lone lorn Dan ` l , and that 'll be but right !
Parsing [sent. 9906 len. 7]: but not as you are now .
Parsing [sent. 9907 len. 31]: Sit ye down , and give me your forgiveness for having ever been a worrit to you , Dan ' l -- what have my contraries ever been to this !
Parsing [sent. 9908 len. 38]: -- and let us speak a word about them times when she was first an orphan , and when Ham was too , and when I was a poor widder woman , and you took me in .
Parsing [sent. 9909 len. 83]: It 'll soften your poor heart , Dan ` l , ' laying her head upon his shoulder , ` and you 'll bear your sorrow better ; for you know the promise , Dan ` l , `` As you have done it unto one of the least of these , you have done it unto me '' , - and that can never fail under this roof , that 's been our shelter for so many , many year ! '
Parsing [sent. 9910 len. 63]: He was quite passive now ; and when I heard him crying , the impulse that had been upon me to go down upon my knees , and ask their pardon for the desolation I had caused , and curse Steer - forth , yielded to a better feeling , My overcharged heart found the same relief , and I cried too .
Parsing [sent. 9911 len. 51]: Chapter 32 The Beginning of a Long Journey What is natural in me , is natural in many other men , I infer , and so I am not afraid to write that I never had loved Steerforth better than when the ties that bound me to him were broken .
Parsing [sent. 9912 len. 70]: In the keen distress of the discovery of his unworthiness , I thought more of all that was brilliant in him , I softened more towards all that was good in him , I did more justice to the qualities that might have made him a man of a noble nature and a great name , than ever I had done in the height of my devotion to him .
Parsing [sent. 9913 len. 38]: Deeply as I felt my own unconscious part in his pollution of an honest home , I believed that if I had been brought face to face with him , I could not have uttered one reproach .
Parsing [sent. 9914 len. 61]: I should have loved him so well still -- though he fascinated me no longer -- I should have held in so much tenderness the memory of my affection for him , that I think I should have been as weak as a spirit-wounded child , in all but the entertainment of a thought that we could ever be re-united .
Parsing [sent. 9915 len. 6]: That thought I never had .
Parsing [sent. 9916 len. 17]: I felt , as he had felt , that all was at an end between us .
Parsing [sent. 9917 len. 40]: What his remembrances of me were , I have never known -- they were light enough , perhaps , and easily dismissed -- but mine of him were as the remembrances of a cherished friend , who was dead .
Parsing [sent. 9918 len. 14]: Yes , Steerforth , long removed from the scenes of this poor history !
Parsing [sent. 9919 len. 26]: My sorrow may bear involuntary witness against you at the judgement Throne ; but my angry thoughts or my reproaches never will , I know !
Parsing [sent. 9920 len. 34]: The news of what had happened soon spread through the town ; insomuch that as I passed along the streets next morning , I overheard the people speaking of it at their doors .
Parsing [sent. 9921 len. 27]: Many were hard upon her , some few were hard upon him , but towards her second father and her lover there was but one sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 9922 len. 22]: Among all kinds of people a respect for them in their distress prevailed , which was full of gentleness and delicacy .
Parsing [sent. 9923 len. 31]: The seafaring men kept apart , when those two were seen early , walking with slow steps on the beach ; and stood in knots , talking compassionately among themselves .
Parsing [sent. 9924 len. 17]: It was on the beach , close down by the sea , that I found them .
Parsing [sent. 9925 len. 40]: It would have been easy to perceive that they had not slept all last night , even if Peggotty had failed to tell me of their still sitting just as I left them , when it was broad day .
Parsing [sent. 9926 len. 27]: They looked worn ; and I thought Mr. Peggotty 's head was bowed in one night more than in all the years I had known him .
Parsing [sent. 9927 len. 56]: But they were both as grave and steady as the sea itself , then lying beneath a dark sky , waveless -- yet with a heavy roll upon it , as if it breathed in its rest -- and touched , on the horizon , with a strip of silvery light from the unseen sun .
Parsing [sent. 9928 len. 42]: ` We have had a mort of talk , sir , ' said Mr. Peggotty to me , when we had all three walked a little while in silence , ` of what we ought and doe n't ought to do .
Parsing [sent. 9929 len. 8]: But we see our course now . '
Parsing [sent. 9930 len. 62]: I happened to glance at Ham , then looking out to sea upon the distant light , and a frightful thought came into my mind -- not that his face was angry , for it was not ; I recall nothing but an expression of stern determination in it -- that if ever he encountered Steerforth , he would kill him .
Parsing [sent. 9931 len. 16]: ` My dooty here , sir , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` is done .
Parsing [sent. 9932 len. 29]: I 'm a going to seek my -- ' he stopped , and went on in a firmer voice : ` I 'm a going to seek her .
Parsing [sent. 9933 len. 7]: That 's my dooty evermore . '
Parsing [sent. 9934 len. 24]: He shook his head when I asked him where he would seek her , and inquired if I were going to London tomorrow ?
Parsing [sent. 9935 len. 33]: I told him I had not gone today , fearing to lose the chance of being of any service to him ; but that I was ready to go when he would .
Parsing [sent. 9936 len. 23]: ` I 'll go along with you , sir , ' he rejoined , ` if you 're agreeable , tomorrow . '
Parsing [sent. 9937 len. 11]: We walked again , for a while , in silence .
Parsing [sent. 9938 len. 26]: ` Ham , ` he presently resumed , ` he 'll hold to his present work , and go and live along with my sister .
Parsing [sent. 9939 len. 18]: The old boat yonder -- ' ` Will you desert the old boat , Mr. Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 9940 len. 4]: I gently interposed .
Parsing [sent. 9941 len. 44]: ` My station , Mas ' r Davy , ' he returned , ` ai n't there no longer ; and if ever a boat foundered , since there was darkness on the face of the deep , that one 's gone down .
Parsing [sent. 9942 len. 17]: But no , sir , no ; I doe n't mean as it should be deserted .
Parsing [sent. 9943 len. 5]: Fur from that . '
Parsing [sent. 9944 len. 47]: We walked again for a while , as before , until he explained : ` My wishes is , sir , as it shall look , day and night , winter and summer , as it has always looked , since she fust know 'd it .
Parsing [sent. 9945 len. 68]: If ever she should come a wandering back , I would n't have the old place seem to cast her off , you understand , but seem to tempt her to draw nigher to ` t , and to peep in , maybe , like a ghost , out of the wind and rain , through the old winder , at the old seat by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 9946 len. 52]: Then , maybe , Mas ' r Davy , seein ' none but Missis Gummidge there , she might take heart to creep in , trembling ; and might come to be laid down in her old bed , and rest her weary head where it was once so gay . '
Parsing [sent. 9947 len. 13]: I could not speak to him in reply , though I tried .
Parsing [sent. 9948 len. 55]: ` Every night , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` as reg ` lar as the night comes , the candle must be stood in its old pane of glass , that if ever she should see it , it may seem to say `` Come back , my child , come back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9949 len. 33]: If ever there 's a knock , Ham -LRB- partic ` ler a soft knock -RRB- , arter dark , at your aunt 's door , doe n't you go nigh it .
Parsing [sent. 9950 len. 15]: Let it be her -- not you -- that sees my fallen child ! '
Parsing [sent. 9951 len. 17]: He walked a little in front of us , and kept before us for some minutes .
Parsing [sent. 9952 len. 34]: During this interval , I glanced at Ham again , and observing the same expression on his face , and his eyes still directed to the distant light , I touched his arm .
Parsing [sent. 9953 len. 27]: Twice I called him by his name , in the tone in which I might have tried to rouse a sleeper , before he heeded me .
Parsing [sent. 9954 len. 33]: When I at last inquired on what his thoughts were so bent , he replied : ` On what 's afore me , Mas ' r Davy ; and over yon . '
Parsing [sent. 9955 len. 12]: ` On the life before you , do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 9956 len. 8]: He had pointed confusedly out to sea .
Parsing [sent. 9957 len. 8]: ` Ay , Mas ' r Davy .
Parsing [sent. 9958 len. 43]: I doe n't rightly know how 't is , but from over yon there seemed to me to come -- the end of it like , ' looking at me as if he were waking , but with the same determined face .
Parsing [sent. 9959 len. 5]: ` What end ? '
Parsing [sent. 9960 len. 10]: I asked , possessed by my former fear . '
Parsing [sent. 9961 len. 34]: I doe n't know , ` he said , thoughtfully ; ' I was calling to mind that the beginning of it all did take place here -- and then the end come .
Parsing [sent. 9962 len. 5]: But it 's gone !
Parsing [sent. 9963 len. 64]: Mas ' r Davy , ' he added ; answering , as I think , my look ; ` you ha n't no call to be afeerd of me : but I 'm kiender muddled ; I do n't fare to feel no matters , ' -- which was as much as to say that he was not himself , and quite confounded .
Parsing [sent. 9964 len. 18]: Mr. Peggotty stopping for us to join him : we did so , and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 9965 len. 30]: The remembrance of this , in connexion with my former thought , however , haunted me at intervals , even until the inexorable end came at its appointed time .
Parsing [sent. 9966 len. 10]: We insensibly approached the old boat , and entered .
Parsing [sent. 9967 len. 16]: Mrs. Gummidge , no longer moping in her especial corner , was busy preparing breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 9968 len. 27]: She took Mr. Peggotty 's hat , and placed his seat for him , and spoke so comfortably and softly , that I hardly knew her .
Parsing [sent. 9969 len. 34]: ` Dan ` l , my good man , ' said she , ` you must eat and drink , and keep up your strength , for without it you 'll do nowt .
Parsing [sent. 9970 len. 8]: Try , that 's a dear soul !
Parsing [sent. 9971 len. 30]: An if I disturb you with my clicketten , ' she meant her chattering , ` tell me so , Dan ` l , and I wo n't . '
Parsing [sent. 9972 len. 47]: When she had served us all , she withdrew to the window , where she sedulously employed herself in repairing some shirts and other clothes belonging to Mr. Peggotty , and neatly folding and packing them in an old oilskin bag , such as sailors carry .
Parsing [sent. 9973 len. 47]: Meanwhile , she continued talking , in the same quiet manner : ` All times and seasons , you know , Dan ` l , ' said Mrs. Gummidge , ' I shall be allus here , and everythink will look accordin ' to your wishes .
Parsing [sent. 9974 len. 31]: I 'm a poor scholar , but I shall write to you , odd times , when you 're away , and send my letters to Mas ' r Davy .
Parsing [sent. 9975 len. 30]: Maybe you 'll write to me too , Dan ` l , odd times , and tell me how you fare to feel upon your lone lorn journies . '
Parsing [sent. 9976 len. 14]: ` You 'll be a solitary woman heer , I 'm afeerd ! '
Parsing [sent. 9977 len. 4]: said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 9978 len. 20]: ` No , no , Dan ` l , ' she returned , ' I sha n't be that .
Parsing [sent. 9979 len. 6]: Doe n't you mind me .
Parsing [sent. 9980 len. 45]: I shall have enough to do to keep a Beein for you ' -LRB- Mrs. Gummidge meant a home -RRB- , ` again you come back -- to keep a Beein here for any that may hap to come back , Dan ` l .
Parsing [sent. 9981 len. 17]: In the fine time , I shall set outside the door as I used to do .
Parsing [sent. 9982 len. 23]: If any should come nigh , they shall see the old widder woman true to 'em , a long way off . '
Parsing [sent. 9983 len. 11]: What a change in Mrs. Gummidge in a little time !
Parsing [sent. 9984 len. 5]: She was another woman .
Parsing [sent. 9985 len. 56]: She was so devoted , she had such a quick perception of what it would be well to say , and what it would be well to leave unsaid ; she was so forgetful of herself , and so regardful of the sorrow about her , that I held her in a sort of veneration .
Parsing [sent. 9986 len. 7]: The work she did that day !
Parsing [sent. 9987 len. 110]: There were many things to be brought up from the beach and stored in the outhouse -- as oars , nets , sails , cordage , spars , lobster-pots , bags of ballast , and the like ; and though there was abundance of assistance rendered , there being not a pair of working hands on all that shore but would have laboured hard for Mr. Peggotty , and been well paid in being asked to do it , yet she persisted , all day long , in toiling under weights that she was quite unequal to , and fagging to and fro on all sorts of unnecessary errands .
Parsing [sent. 9988 len. 20]: As to deploring her misfortunes , she appeared to have entirely lost the recollection of ever having had any .
Parsing [sent. 9989 len. 28]: She preserved an equable cheerfulness in the midst of her sympathy , which was not the least astonishing part of the change that had come over her .
Parsing [sent. 9990 len. 7]: Querulousness was out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 9991 len. 87]: I did not even observe her voice to falter , or a tear to escape from her eyes , the whole day through , until twilight ; when she and I and Mr. Peggotty being alone together , and he having fallen asleep in perfect exhaustion , she broke into a half-suppressed fit of sobbing and crying , and taking me to the door , said , ` Ever bless you , Mas ' r Davy , be a friend to him , poor dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 9992 len. 36]: Then , she immediately ran out of the house to wash her face , in order that she might sit quietly beside him , and be found at work there , when he should awake .
Parsing [sent. 9993 len. 48]: In short I left her , when I went away at night , the prop and staff of Mr. Peggotty 's affliction ; and I could not meditate enough upon the lesson that I read in Mrs. Gummidge , and the new experience she unfolded to me .
Parsing [sent. 9994 len. 26]: It was between nine and ten o'clock when , strolling in a melancholy manner through the town , I stopped at Mr. Omer 's door .
Parsing [sent. 9995 len. 36]: Mr. Omer had taken it so much to heart , his daughter told me , that he had been very low and poorly all day , and had gone to bed without his pipe . '
Parsing [sent. 9996 len. 11]: A deceitful , bad-hearted girl , ' said Mrs. Joram .
Parsing [sent. 9997 len. 11]: ` There was no good in her , ever ! '
Parsing [sent. 9998 len. 10]: ` Do n't say so , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 9999 len. 8]: ` You do n't think so . '
Parsing [sent. 10000 len. 7]: ` Yes , I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 10001 len. 6]: cried Mrs. Joram , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 10002 len. 36]: ` No , no , ' said I. Mrs. Joram tossed her head , endeavouring to be very stern and cross ; but she could not command her softer self , and began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 10003 len. 37]: I was young , to be sure ; but I thought much the better of her for this sympathy , and fancied it became her , as a virtuous wife and mother , very well indeed .
Parsing [sent. 10004 len. 8]: ` What will she ever do ! '
Parsing [sent. 10005 len. 3]: sobbed Minnie .
Parsing [sent. 10006 len. 6]: ` Where will she go !
Parsing [sent. 10007 len. 6]: What will become of her !
Parsing [sent. 10008 len. 15]: Oh , how could she be so cruel , to herself and him ! '
Parsing [sent. 10009 len. 25]: I remembered the time when Minnie was a young and pretty girl ; and I was glad she remembered it too , so feelingly .
Parsing [sent. 10010 len. 20]: ` My little Minnie , ' said Mrs. Joram , ` has only just now been got to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 10011 len. 12]: Even in her sleep she is sobbing for Em ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 10012 len. 27]: All day long , little Minnie has cried for her , and asked me , over and over again , whether Em ` ly was wicked ?
Parsing [sent. 10013 len. 45]: What can I say to her , when Em ` ly tied a ribbon off her own neck round little Minnie 's the last night she was here , and laid her head down on the pillow beside her till she was fast asleep !
Parsing [sent. 10014 len. 11]: The ribbon 's round my little Minnie 's neck now .
Parsing [sent. 10015 len. 14]: It ought not to be , perhaps , but what can I do ?
Parsing [sent. 10016 len. 15]: Em ` ly is very bad , but they were fond of one another .
Parsing [sent. 10017 len. 7]: And the child knows nothing ! '
Parsing [sent. 10018 len. 16]: Mrs. Joram was so unhappy that her husband came out to take care of her .
Parsing [sent. 10019 len. 24]: Leaving them together , I went home to Peggotty 's ; more melancholy myself , if possible , than I had been yet .
Parsing [sent. 10020 len. 32]: That good creature -- I mean Peggotty -- all untired by her late anxieties and sleepless nights , was at her brother 's , where she meant to stay till morning .
Parsing [sent. 10021 len. 36]: An old woman , who had been employed about the house for some weeks past , while Peggotty had been unable to attend to it , was the house 's only other occupant besides myself .
Parsing [sent. 10022 len. 39]: As I had no occasion for her services , I sent her to bed , by no means against her will , and sat down before the kitchen fire a little while , to think about all this .
Parsing [sent. 10023 len. 48]: I was blending it with the deathbed of the late Mr. Barkis , and was driving out with the tide towards the distance at which Ham had looked so singularly in the morning , when I was recalled from my wanderings by a knock at the door .
Parsing [sent. 10024 len. 18]: There was a knocker upon the door , but it was not that which made the sound .
Parsing [sent. 10025 len. 23]: The tap was from a hand , and low down upon the door , as if it were given by a child .
Parsing [sent. 10026 len. 22]: It made me start as much as if it had been the knock of a footman to a person of distinction .
Parsing [sent. 10027 len. 30]: I opened the door ; and at first looked down , to my amazement , on nothing but a great umbrella that appeared to be walking about of itself .
Parsing [sent. 10028 len. 10]: But presently I discovered underneath it , Miss Mowcher .
Parsing [sent. 10029 len. 61]: I might not have been prepared to give the little creature a very kind reception , if , on her removing the umbrella , which her utmost efforts were unable to shut up , she had shown me the ` volatile ' expression of face which had made so great an impression on me at our first and last meeting .
Parsing [sent. 10030 len. 56]: But her face , as she turned it up to mine , was so earnest ; and when I relieved her of the umbrella -LRB- which would have been an inconvenient one for the Irish Giant -RRB- , she wrung her little hands in such an afflicted manner ; that I rather inclined towards her .
Parsing [sent. 10031 len. 5]: ` Miss Mowcher ! '
Parsing [sent. 10032 len. 29]: said I , after glancing up and down the empty street , without distinctly knowing what I expected to see besides ; ` how do you come here ?
Parsing [sent. 10033 len. 6]: What is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 10034 len. 27]: She motioned to me with her short right arm , to shut the umbrella for her ; and passing me hurriedly , went into the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 10035 len. 72]: When I had closed the door , and followed , with the umbrella in my hand , I found her sitting on the corner of the fender -- it was a low iron one , with two flat bars at top to stand plates upon -- in the shadow of the boiler , swaying herself backwards and forwards , and chafing her hands upon her knees like a person in pain .
Parsing [sent. 10036 len. 38]: Quite alarmed at being the only recipient of this untimely visit , and the only spectator of this portentous behaviour , I exclaimed again , ` Pray tell me , Miss Mowcher , what is the matter !
Parsing [sent. 10037 len. 5]: are you ill ? '
Parsing [sent. 10038 len. 23]: ` My dear young soul , ' returned Miss Mowcher , squeezing her hands upon her heart one over the other . '
Parsing [sent. 10039 len. 10]: I am ill here , I am very ill .
Parsing [sent. 10040 len. 30]: To think that it should come to this , when I might have known it and perhaps prevented it , if I had n't been a thoughtless fool ! '
Parsing [sent. 10041 len. 44]: Again her large bonnet -LRB- very disproportionate to the figure -RRB- went backwards and forwards , in her swaying of her little body to and fro ; while a most gigantic bonnet rocked , in unison with it , upon the wall . '
Parsing [sent. 10042 len. 23]: I am surprised , ' I began , ` to see you so distressed and serious ' - when she interrupted me .
Parsing [sent. 10043 len. 9]: ` Yes , it 's always so ! '
Parsing [sent. 10044 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 10045 len. 28]: ` They are all surprised , these inconsiderate young people , fairly and full grown , to see any natural feeling in a little thing like me !
Parsing [sent. 10046 len. 36]: They make a plaything of me , use me for their amusement , throw me away when they are tired , and wonder that I feel more than a toy horse or a wooden soldier !
Parsing [sent. 10047 len. 9]: Yes , yes , that 's the way .
Parsing [sent. 10048 len. 5]: The old way ! '
Parsing [sent. 10049 len. 24]: ` It may be , with others , ' I returned , ` but I do assure you it is not with me .
Parsing [sent. 10050 len. 24]: Perhaps I ought not to be at all surprised to see you as you are now : I know so little of you .
Parsing [sent. 10051 len. 11]: I said , without consideration , what I thought . '
Parsing [sent. 10052 len. 7]: ` What can I do ? '
Parsing [sent. 10053 len. 17]: returned the little woman , standing up , and holding out her arms to show herself .
Parsing [sent. 10054 len. 3]: ` See !
Parsing [sent. 10055 len. 18]: What I am , my father was ; and my sister is ; and my brother is .
Parsing [sent. 10056 len. 19]: I have worked for sister and brother these many years -- hard , Mr. Copperfield -- all day .
Parsing [sent. 10057 len. 4]: I must live .
Parsing [sent. 10058 len. 5]: I do no harm .
Parsing [sent. 10059 len. 38]: If there are people so unreflecting or so cruel , as to make a jest of me , what is left for me to do but to make a jest of myself , them , and everything ?
Parsing [sent. 10060 len. 14]: If I do so , for the time , whose fault is that ?
Parsing [sent. 10061 len. 3]: Mine ? '
Parsing [sent. 10062 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 10063 len. 8]: Not Miss Mowcher 's , I perceived .
Parsing [sent. 10064 len. 48]: ` If I had shown myself a sensitive dwarf to your false friend , ' pursued the little woman , shaking her head at me , with reproachful earnestness , ` how much of his help or good will do you think I should ever have had ?
Parsing [sent. 10065 len. 46]: If little Mowcher -LRB- who had no hand , young gentleman , in the making of herself -RRB- addressed herself to him , or the like of him , because of her misfortunes , when do you suppose her small voice would have been heard ?
Parsing [sent. 10066 len. 27]: Little Mowcher would have as much need to live , if she was the bitterest and dullest of pigmies ; but she could n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 10067 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 10068 len. 15]: She might whistle for her bread and butter till she died of Air . '
Parsing [sent. 10069 len. 20]: Miss Mowcher sat down on the fender again , and took out her handkerchief , and wiped her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 10070 len. 42]: ` Be thankful for me , if you have a kind heart , as I think you have , ' she said , ` that while I know well what I am , I can be cheerful and endure it all .
Parsing [sent. 10071 len. 55]: I am thankful for myself , at any rate , that I can find my tiny way through the world , without being beholden to anyone ; and that in return for all that is thrown at me , in folly or vanity , as I go along , I can throw bubbles back .
Parsing [sent. 10072 len. 24]: If I do n't brood over all I want , it is the better for me , and not the worse for anyone .
Parsing [sent. 10073 len. 15]: If I am a plaything for you giants , be gentle with me . '
Parsing [sent. 10074 len. 33]: Miss Mowcher replaced her handkerchief in her pocket , looking at me with very intent expression all the while , and pursued : ' I saw you in the street just now .
Parsing [sent. 10075 len. 41]: You may suppose I am not able to walk as fast as you , with my short legs and short breath , and I could n't overtake you ; but I guessed where you came , and came after you .
Parsing [sent. 10076 len. 18]: I have been here before , today , but the good woman was n't at home . '
Parsing [sent. 10077 len. 7]: ` Do you know her ? '
Parsing [sent. 10078 len. 4]: I demanded . '
Parsing [sent. 10079 len. 19]: I know of her , and about her , ' she replied , ` from Omer and Joram .
Parsing [sent. 10080 len. 9]: I was there at seven o'clock this morning .
Parsing [sent. 10081 len. 25]: Do you remember what Steerforth said to me about this unfortunate girl , that time when I saw you both at the inn ? '
Parsing [sent. 10082 len. 30]: The great bonnet on Miss Mowcher 's head , and the greater bonnet on the wall , began to go backwards and forwards again when she asked this question .
Parsing [sent. 10083 len. 20]: I remembered very well what she referred to , having had it in my thoughts many times that day .
Parsing [sent. 10084 len. 5]: I told her so .
Parsing [sent. 10085 len. 52]: ` May the Father of all Evil confound him , ' said the little woman , holding up her forefinger between me and her sparkling eyes , ` and ten times more confound that wicked servant ; but I believed it was YOU who had a boyish passion for her ! '
Parsing [sent. 10086 len. 4]: ` I ? '
Parsing [sent. 10087 len. 3]: I repeated .
Parsing [sent. 10088 len. 5]: ` Child , child !
Parsing [sent. 10089 len. 44]: In the name of blind ill-fortune , ' cried Miss Mowcher , wringing her hands impatiently , as she went to and fro again upon the fender , ` why did you praise her so , and blush , and look disturbed ? '
Parsing [sent. 10090 len. 22]: I could not conceal from myself that I had done this , though for a reason very different from her supposition .
Parsing [sent. 10091 len. 7]: ` What did I know ? '
Parsing [sent. 10092 len. 36]: said Miss Mowcher , taking out her handkerchief again , and giving one little stamp on the ground whenever , at short intervals , she applied it to her eyes with both hands at once .
Parsing [sent. 10093 len. 24]: ` He was crossing you and wheedling you , I saw ; and you were soft wax in his hands , I saw .
Parsing [sent. 10094 len. 84]: Had I left the room a minute , when his man told me that `` Young Innocence '' -LRB- so he called you , and you may call him `` Old Guilt '' all the days of your life -RRB- had set his heart upon her , and she was giddy and liked him , but his master was resolved that no harm should come of it -- more for your sake than for hers -- and that that was their business here ?
Parsing [sent. 10095 len. 7]: How could I BUT believe him ?
Parsing [sent. 10096 len. 13]: I saw Steerforth soothe and please you by his praise of her !
Parsing [sent. 10097 len. 9]: You were the first to mention her name .
Parsing [sent. 10098 len. 9]: You owned to an old admiration of her .
Parsing [sent. 10099 len. 22]: You were hot and cold , and red and white , all at once when I spoke to you of her .
Parsing [sent. 10100 len. 46]: What could I think -- what DID I think -- but that you were a young libertine in everything but experience , and had fallen into hands that had experience enough , and could manage you -LRB- having the fancy -RRB- for your own good ?
Parsing [sent. 10101 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 10102 len. 2]: oh !
Parsing [sent. 10103 len. 2]: oh !
Parsing [sent. 10104 len. 57]: They were afraid of my finding out the truth , ' exclaimed Miss Mowcher , getting off the fender , and trotting up and down the kitchen with her two short arms distressfully lifted up , ` because I am a sharp little thing -- I need be , to get through the world at all !
Parsing [sent. 10105 len. 39]: -- and they deceived me altogether , and I gave the poor unfortunate girl a letter , which I fully believe was the beginning of her ever speaking to Littimer , who was left behind on purpose ! '
Parsing [sent. 10106 len. 64]: I stood amazed at the revelation of all this perfidy , looking at Miss Mowcher as she walked up and down the kitchen until she was out of breath : when she sat upon the fender again , and , drying her face with her handkerchief , shook her head for a long time , without otherwise moving , and without breaking silence .
Parsing [sent. 10107 len. 25]: ` My country rounds , ' she added at length , ` brought me to Norwich , Mr. Copperfield , the night before last .
Parsing [sent. 10108 len. 30]: What I happened to find there , about their secret way of coming and going , without you -- which was strange -- led to my suspecting something wrong .
Parsing [sent. 10109 len. 22]: I got into the coach from London last night , as it came through Norwich , and was here this morning .
Parsing [sent. 10110 len. 6]: Oh , oh , oh !
Parsing [sent. 10111 len. 4]: too late ! '
Parsing [sent. 10112 len. 47]: Poor little Mowcher turned so chilly after all her crying and fretting , that she turned round on the fender , putting her poor little wet feet in among the ashes to warm them , and sat looking at the fire , like a large doll .
Parsing [sent. 10113 len. 31]: I sat in a chair on the other side of the hearth , lost in unhappy reflections , and looking at the fire too , and sometimes at her . '
Parsing [sent. 10114 len. 15]: I must go , ' she said at last , rising as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 10115 len. 5]: ` It 's late .
Parsing [sent. 10116 len. 7]: You do n't mistrust me ? '
Parsing [sent. 10117 len. 29]: Meeting her sharp glance , which was as sharp as ever when she asked me , I could not on that short challenge answer no , quite frankly .
Parsing [sent. 10118 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 10119 len. 41]: said she , accepting the offer of my hand to help her over the fender , and looking wistfully up into my face , ` you know you would n't mistrust me , if I was a full-sized woman ! '
Parsing [sent. 10120 len. 18]: I felt that there was much truth in this ; and I felt rather ashamed of myself .
Parsing [sent. 10121 len. 13]: ` You are a young man , ' she said , nodding .
Parsing [sent. 10122 len. 13]: ` Take a word of advice , even from three foot nothing .
Parsing [sent. 10123 len. 20]: Try not to associate bodily defects with mental , my good friend , except for a solid reason . '
Parsing [sent. 10124 len. 16]: She had got over the fender now , and I had got over my suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 10125 len. 28]: I told her that I believed she had given me a faithful account of herself , and that we had both been hapless instruments in designing hands .
Parsing [sent. 10126 len. 12]: She thanked me , and said I was a good fellow .
Parsing [sent. 10127 len. 6]: ` Now , mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 10128 len. 24]: she exclaimed , turning back on her way to the door , and looking shrewdly at me , with her forefinger up again .
Parsing [sent. 10129 len. 38]: - ' I have some reason to suspect , from what I have heard -- my ears are always open ; I ca n't afford to spare what powers I have -- that they are gone abroad .
Parsing [sent. 10130 len. 38]: But if ever they return , if ever any one of them returns , while I am alive , I am more likely than another , going about as I do , to find it out soon .
Parsing [sent. 10131 len. 8]: Whatever I know , you shall know .
Parsing [sent. 10132 len. 22]: If ever I can do anything to serve the poor betrayed girl , I will do it faithfully , please Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 10133 len. 16]: And Littimer had better have a bloodhound at his back , than little Mowcher ! '
Parsing [sent. 10134 len. 20]: I placed implicit faith in this last statement , when I marked the look with which it was accompanied .
Parsing [sent. 10135 len. 33]: ` Trust me no more , but trust me no less , than you would trust a full-sized woman , ' said the little creature , touching me appealingly on the wrist .
Parsing [sent. 10136 len. 32]: ` If ever you see me again , unlike what I am now , and like what I was when you first saw me , observe what company I am in .
Parsing [sent. 10137 len. 14]: Call to mind that I am a very helpless and defenceless little thing .
Parsing [sent. 10138 len. 23]: Think of me at home with my brother like myself and sister like myself , when my day 's work is done .
Parsing [sent. 10139 len. 23]: Perhaps you wo n't , then , be very hard upon me , or surprised if I can be distressed and serious .
Parsing [sent. 10140 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 10141 len. 31]: I gave Miss Mowcher my hand , with a very different opinion of her from that which I had hitherto entertained , and opened the door to let her out .
Parsing [sent. 10142 len. 81]: It was not a trifling business to get the great umbrella up , and properly balanced in her grasp ; but at last I successfully accomplished this , and saw it go bobbing down the street through the rain , without the least appearance of having anybody underneath it , except when a heavier fall than usual from some over-charged water-spout sent it toppling over , on one side , and discovered Miss Mowcher struggling violently to get it right .
Parsing [sent. 10143 len. 46]: After making one or two sallies to her relief , which were rendered futile by the umbrella 's hopping on again , like an immense bird , before I could reach it , I came in , went to bed , and slept till morning .
Parsing [sent. 10144 len. 40]: In the morning I was joined by Mr. Peggotty and by my old nurse , and we went at an early hour to the coach office , where Mrs. Gummidge and Ham were waiting to take leave of us .
Parsing [sent. 10145 len. 33]: ` Mas ' r Davy , ' Ham whispered , drawing me aside , while Mr. Peggotty was stowing his bag among the luggage , ` his life is quite broke up .
Parsing [sent. 10146 len. 57]: He doe n't know wheer he 's going ; he doe n't know -- what 's afore him ; he 's bound upon a voyage that 'll last , on and off , all the rest of his days , take my wured for ` t , unless he finds what he 's a seeking of .
Parsing [sent. 10147 len. 17]: I am sure you 'll be a friend to him , Mas ' r Davy ? '
Parsing [sent. 10148 len. 18]: ` Trust me , I will indeed , ' said I , shaking hands with Ham earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 10149 len. 3]: ` Thankee .
Parsing [sent. 10150 len. 7]: Thankee , very kind , sir .
Parsing [sent. 10151 len. 4]: One thing furder .
Parsing [sent. 10152 len. 27]: I 'm in good employ , you know , Mas ' r Davy , and I ha n't no way now of spending what I gets .
Parsing [sent. 10153 len. 14]: Money 's of no use to me no more , except to live .
Parsing [sent. 10154 len. 19]: If you can lay it out for him , I shall do my work with a better art .
Parsing [sent. 10155 len. 45]: Though as to that , sir , ' and he spoke very steadily and mildly , ` you 're not to think but I shall work at all times , like a man , and act the best that lays in my power ! '
Parsing [sent. 10156 len. 36]: I told him I was well convinced of it ; and I hinted that I hoped the time might even come , when he would cease to lead the lonely life he naturally contemplated now .
Parsing [sent. 10157 len. 25]: ` No , sir , ' he said , shaking his head , ` all that 's past and over with me , sir .
Parsing [sent. 10158 len. 11]: No one can never fill the place that 's empty .
Parsing [sent. 10159 len. 23]: But you 'll bear in mind about the money , as theer 's at all times some laying by for him ? '
Parsing [sent. 10160 len. 33]: Reminding him of the fact , that Mr. Peggotty derived a steady , though certainly a very moderate income from the bequest of his late brother-in-law , I promised to do so .
Parsing [sent. 10161 len. 8]: We then took leave of each other .
Parsing [sent. 10162 len. 24]: I can not leave him even now , without remembering with a pang , at once his modest fortitude and his great sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 10163 len. 66]: As to Mrs. Gummidge , if I were to endeavour to describe how she ran down the street by the side of the coach , seeing nothing but Mr. Peggotty on the roof , through the tears she tried to repress , and dashing herself against the people who were coming in the opposite direction , I should enter on a task of some difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 10164 len. 43]: Therefore I had better leave her sitting on a baker 's door-step , out of breath , with no shape at all remaining in her bonnet , and one of her shoes off , lying on the pavement at a considerable distance .
Parsing [sent. 10165 len. 31]: When we got to our journey 's end , our first pursuit was to look about for a little lodging for Peggotty , where her brother could have a bed .
Parsing [sent. 10166 len. 30]: We were so fortunate as to find one , of a very clean and cheap description , over a chandler 's shop , only two streets removed from me .
Parsing [sent. 10167 len. 47]: When we had engaged this domicile , I bought some cold meat at an eating-house , and took my fellow-travellers home to tea ; a proceeding , I regret to state , which did not meet with Mrs. Crupp 's approval , but quite the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 10168 len. 50]: I ought to observe , however , in explanation of that lady 's state of mind , that she was much offended by Peggotty 's tucking up her widow 's gown before she had been ten minutes in the place , and setting to work to dust my bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 10169 len. 25]: This Mrs. Crupp regarded in the light of a liberty , and a liberty , she said , was a thing she never allowed .
Parsing [sent. 10170 len. 20]: Mr. Peggotty had made a communication to me on the way to London for which I was not unprepared .
Parsing [sent. 10171 len. 11]: It was , that he purposed first seeing Mrs. Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 10172 len. 38]: As I felt bound to assist him in this , and also to mediate between them ; with the view of sparing the mother 's feelings as much as possible , I wrote to her that night .
Parsing [sent. 10173 len. 22]: I told her as mildly as I could what his wrong was , and what my own share in his injury .
Parsing [sent. 10174 len. 41]: I said he was a man in very common life , but of a most gentle and upright character ; and that I ventured to express a hope that she would not refuse to see him in his heavy trouble .
Parsing [sent. 10175 len. 28]: I mentioned two o'clock in the afternoon as the hour of our coming , and I sent the letter myself by the first coach in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 10176 len. 60]: At the appointed time , we stood at the door -- the door of that house where I had been , a few days since , so happy : where my youthful confidence and warmth of heart had been yielded up so freely : which was closed against me henceforth : which was now a waste , a ruin .
Parsing [sent. 10177 len. 4]: No Littimer appeared .
Parsing [sent. 10178 len. 29]: The pleasanter face which had replaced his , on the occasion of my last visit , answered to our summons , and went before us to the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 10179 len. 6]: Mrs. Steerforth was sitting there .
Parsing [sent. 10180 len. 21]: Rosa Dartle glided , as we went in , from another part of the room and stood behind her chair .
Parsing [sent. 10181 len. 21]: I saw , directly , in his mother 's face , that she knew from himself what he had done .
Parsing [sent. 10182 len. 36]: It was very pale ; and bore the traces of deeper emotion than my letter alone , weakened by the doubts her fondness would have raised upon it , would have been likely to create .
Parsing [sent. 10183 len. 31]: I thought her more like him than ever I had thought her ; and I felt , rather than saw , that the resemblance was not lost on my companion .
Parsing [sent. 10184 len. 25]: She sat upright in her arm-chair , with a stately , immovable , passionless air , that it seemed as if nothing could disturb .
Parsing [sent. 10185 len. 22]: She looked very steadfastly at Mr. Peggotty when he stood before her ; and he looked quite as steadfastly at her .
Parsing [sent. 10186 len. 10]: Rosa Dartle 's keen glance comprehended all of us .
Parsing [sent. 10187 len. 9]: For some moments not a word was spoken .
Parsing [sent. 10188 len. 9]: She motioned to Mr. Peggotty to be seated .
Parsing [sent. 10189 len. 27]: He said , in a low voice , ' I should n't feel it nat ` ral , ma'am , to sit down in this house .
Parsing [sent. 10190 len. 6]: I 'd sooner stand . '
Parsing [sent. 10191 len. 27]: And this was succeeded by another silence , which she broke thus : ' I know , with deep regret , what has brought you here .
Parsing [sent. 10192 len. 7]: What do you want of me ?
Parsing [sent. 10193 len. 9]: What do you ask me to do ? '
Parsing [sent. 10194 len. 31]: He put his hat under his arm , and feeling in his breast for Emily 's letter , took it out , unfolded it , and gave it to her .
Parsing [sent. 10195 len. 8]: ` Please to read that , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 10196 len. 8]: That 's my niece 's hand ! '
Parsing [sent. 10197 len. 33]: She read it , in the same stately and impassive way , -- untouched by its contents , as far as I could see , -- and returned it to him . '
Parsing [sent. 10198 len. 24]: `` Unless he brings me back a lady , '' ' said Mr. Peggotty , tracing out that part with his finger . '
Parsing [sent. 10199 len. 15]: I come to know , ma'am , whether he will keep his wured ? '
Parsing [sent. 10200 len. 7]: ` No , ' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 10201 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 10202 len. 4]: said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 10203 len. 5]: ` It is impossible .
Parsing [sent. 10204 len. 5]: He would disgrace himself .
Parsing [sent. 10205 len. 14]: You can not fail to know that she is far below him . '
Parsing [sent. 10206 len. 6]: ` Raise her up ! '
Parsing [sent. 10207 len. 4]: said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 10208 len. 8]: ` She is uneducated and ignorant . '
Parsing [sent. 10209 len. 16]: ` Maybe she 's not ; maybe she is , ' said Mr. Peggotty . '
Parsing [sent. 10210 len. 15]: I think not , ma'am ; but I 'm no judge of them things .
Parsing [sent. 10211 len. 5]: Teach her better ! '
Parsing [sent. 10212 len. 34]: ` Since you oblige me to speak more plainly , which I am very unwilling to do , her humble connexions would render such a thing impossible , if nothing else did . '
Parsing [sent. 10213 len. 15]: ` Hark to this , ma'am , ' he returned , slowly and quietly .
Parsing [sent. 10214 len. 11]: ` You know what it is to love your child .
Parsing [sent. 10215 len. 4]: So do I .
Parsing [sent. 10216 len. 16]: If she was a hundred times my child , I could n't love her more .
Parsing [sent. 10217 len. 12]: You doe n't know what it is to lose your child .
Parsing [sent. 10218 len. 3]: I do .
Parsing [sent. 10219 len. 24]: All the heaps of riches in the wureld would be nowt to me -LRB- if they was mine -RRB- to buy her back !
Parsing [sent. 10220 len. 17]: But , save her from this disgrace , and she shall never be disgraced by us .
Parsing [sent. 10221 len. 43]: Not one of us that she 's growed up among , not one of us that 's lived along with her and had her for their all in all , these many year , will ever look upon her pritty face again .
Parsing [sent. 10222 len. 71]: We 'll be content to let her be ; we 'll be content to think of her , far off , as if she was underneath another sun and sky ; we 'll be content to trust her to her husband , -- to her little children , p ` raps , -- and bide the time when all of us shall be alike in quality afore our God ! '
Parsing [sent. 10223 len. 15]: The rugged eloquence with which he spoke , was not devoid of all effect .
Parsing [sent. 10224 len. 27]: She still preserved her proud manner , but there was a touch of softness in her voice , as she answered : ' I justify nothing .
Parsing [sent. 10225 len. 5]: I make no counter-accusations .
Parsing [sent. 10226 len. 11]: But I am sorry to repeat , it is impossible .
Parsing [sent. 10227 len. 16]: Such a marriage would irretrievably blight my son 's career , and ruin his prospects .
Parsing [sent. 10228 len. 16]: Nothing is more certain than that it never can take place , and never will .
Parsing [sent. 10229 len. 54]: If there is any other compensation -- ' ' I am looking at the likeness of the face , ' interrupted Mr. Peggotty , with a steady but a kindling eye , ` that has looked at me , in my home , at my fireside , in my boat -- wheer not ?
Parsing [sent. 10230 len. 22]: -- smiling and friendly , when it was so treacherous , that I go half wild when I think of it .
Parsing [sent. 10231 len. 34]: If the likeness of that face do n't turn to burning fire , at the thought of offering money to me for my child 's blight and ruin , it 's as bad .
Parsing [sent. 10232 len. 17]: I doe n't know , being a lady 's , but what it 's worse . '
Parsing [sent. 10233 len. 8]: She changed now , in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 10234 len. 43]: An angry flush overspread her features ; and she said , in an intolerant manner , grasping the arm-chair tightly with her hands : ` What compensation can you make to ME for opening such a pit between me and my son ?
Parsing [sent. 10235 len. 7]: What is your love to mine ?
Parsing [sent. 10236 len. 8]: What is your separation to ours ? '
Parsing [sent. 10237 len. 22]: Miss Dartle softly touched her , and bent down her head to whisper , but she would not hear a word .
Parsing [sent. 10238 len. 9]: ` No , Rosa , not a word !
Parsing [sent. 10239 len. 9]: Let the man listen to what I say !
Parsing [sent. 10240 len. 60]: My son , who has been the object of my life , to whom its every thought has been devoted , whom I have gratified from a child in every wish , from whom I have had no separate existence since his birth , -- to take up in a moment with a miserable girl , and avoid me !
Parsing [sent. 10241 len. 18]: To repay my confidence with systematic deception , for her sake , and quit me for her !
Parsing [sent. 10242 len. 42]: To set this wretched fancy , against his mother 's claims upon his duty , love , respect , gratitude -- claims that every day and hour of his life should have strengthened into ties that nothing could be proof against !
Parsing [sent. 10243 len. 6]: Is this no injury ? '
Parsing [sent. 10244 len. 12]: Again Rosa Dartle tried to soothe her ; again ineffectually . '
Parsing [sent. 10245 len. 9]: I say , Rosa , not a word !
Parsing [sent. 10246 len. 21]: If he can stake his all upon the lightest object , I can stake my all upon a greater purpose .
Parsing [sent. 10247 len. 18]: Let him go where he will , with the means that my love has secured to him !
Parsing [sent. 10248 len. 10]: Does he think to reduce me by long absence ?
Parsing [sent. 10249 len. 10]: He knows his mother very little if he does .
Parsing [sent. 10250 len. 14]: Let him put away his whim now , and he is welcome back .
Parsing [sent. 10251 len. 53]: Let him not put her away now , and he never shall come near me , living or dying , while I can raise my hand to make a sign against it , unless , being rid of her for ever , he comes humbly to me and begs for my forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 10252 len. 5]: This is my right .
Parsing [sent. 10253 len. 8]: This is the acknowledgement I WILL HAVE .
Parsing [sent. 10254 len. 10]: This is the separation that there is between us !
Parsing [sent. 10255 len. 28]: And is this , ' she added , looking at her visitor with the proud intolerant air with which she had begun , ` no injury ? '
Parsing [sent. 10256 len. 25]: While I heard and saw the mother as she said these words , I seemed to hear and see the son , defying them .
Parsing [sent. 10257 len. 20]: All that I had ever seen in him of an unyielding , wilful spirit , I saw in her .
Parsing [sent. 10258 len. 35]: All the understanding that I had now of his misdirected energy , became an understanding of her character too , and a perception that it was , in its strongest springs , the same .
Parsing [sent. 10259 len. 38]: She now observed to me , aloud , resuming her former restraint , that it was useless to hear more , or to say more , and that she begged to put an end to the interview .
Parsing [sent. 10260 len. 21]: She rose with an air of dignity to leave the room , when Mr. Peggotty signified that it was needless .
Parsing [sent. 10261 len. 32]: ` Doe n't fear me being any hindrance to you , I have no more to say , ma'am , ' he remarked , as he moved towards the door . '
Parsing [sent. 10262 len. 14]: I come beer with no hope , and I take away no hope .
Parsing [sent. 10263 len. 28]: I have done what I thowt should be done , but I never looked fur any good to come of my stan ` ning where I do .
Parsing [sent. 10264 len. 25]: This has been too evil a house fur me and mine , fur me to be in my right senses and expect it . '
Parsing [sent. 10265 len. 24]: With this , we departed ; leaving her standing by her elbow-chair , a picture of a noble presence and a handsome face .
Parsing [sent. 10266 len. 27]: We had , on our way out , to cross a paved hall , with glass sides and roof , over which a vine was trained .
Parsing [sent. 10267 len. 27]: Its leaves and shoots were green then , and the day being sunny , a pair of glass doors leading to the garden were thrown open .
Parsing [sent. 10268 len. 42]: Rosa Dartle , entering this way with a noiseless step , when we were close to them , addressed herself to me : ` You do well , ' she said , ` indeed , to bring this fellow here ! '
Parsing [sent. 10269 len. 30]: Such a concentration of rage and scorn as darkened her face , and flashed in her jet-black eyes , I could not have thought compressible even into that face .
Parsing [sent. 10270 len. 21]: The scar made by the hammer was , as usual in this excited state of her features , strongly marked .
Parsing [sent. 10271 len. 28]: When the throbbing I had seen before , came into it as I looked at her , she absolutely lifted up her hand , and struck it .
Parsing [sent. 10272 len. 21]: ` This is a fellow , ' she said , ` to champion and bring here , is he not ?
Parsing [sent. 10273 len. 7]: You are a true man ! '
Parsing [sent. 10274 len. 21]: ` Miss Dartle , ' I returned , ` you are surely not so unjust as to condemn ME ! '
Parsing [sent. 10275 len. 13]: ` Why do you bring division between these two mad creatures ? '
Parsing [sent. 10276 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 10277 len. 18]: ` Do n't you know that they are both mad with their own self-will and pride ? '
Parsing [sent. 10278 len. 7]: ` Is it my doing ? '
Parsing [sent. 10279 len. 3]: I returned .
Parsing [sent. 10280 len. 7]: ` Is it your doing ! '
Parsing [sent. 10281 len. 3]: she retorted .
Parsing [sent. 10282 len. 10]: ` Why do you bring this man here ? '
Parsing [sent. 10283 len. 14]: ` He is a deeply-injured man , Miss Dartle , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 10284 len. 9]: ` You may not know it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10285 len. 45]: I know that James Steerforth , ' she said , with her hand on her bosom , as if to prevent the storm that was raging there , from being loud , ` has a false , corrupt heart , and is a traitor .
Parsing [sent. 10286 len. 17]: But what need I know or care about this fellow , and his common niece ? '
Parsing [sent. 10287 len. 14]: ` Miss Dartle , ' I returned , ` you deepen the injury .
Parsing [sent. 10288 len. 5]: It is sufficient already .
Parsing [sent. 10289 len. 18]: I will only say , at parting , that you do him a great wrong . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10290 len. 10]: I do him no wrong , ' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 10291 len. 9]: ` They are a depraved , worthless set .
Parsing [sent. 10292 len. 7]: I would have her whipped ! '
Parsing [sent. 10293 len. 16]: Mr. Peggotty passed on , without a word , and went out at the door .
Parsing [sent. 10294 len. 8]: ` Oh , shame , Miss Dartle !
Parsing [sent. 10295 len. 3]: shame ! '
Parsing [sent. 10296 len. 4]: I said indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 10297 len. 14]: ` How can you bear to trample on his undeserved affliction ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 10298 len. 12]: I would trample on them all , ' she answered . '
Parsing [sent. 10299 len. 8]: I would have his house pulled down .
Parsing [sent. 10300 len. 22]: I would have her branded on the face , dressed in rags , and cast out in the streets to starve .
Parsing [sent. 10301 len. 18]: If I had the power to sit in judgement on her , I would see it done .
Parsing [sent. 10302 len. 4]: See it done ?
Parsing [sent. 10303 len. 5]: I would do it !
Parsing [sent. 10304 len. 4]: I detest her .
Parsing [sent. 10305 len. 19]: If I ever could reproach her with her infamous condition , I would go anywhere to do so .
Parsing [sent. 10306 len. 12]: If I could hunt her to her grave , I would .
Parsing [sent. 10307 len. 36]: If there was any word of comfort that would be a solace to her in her dying hour , and only I possessed it , I would n't part with it for Life itself . '
Parsing [sent. 10308 len. 50]: The mere vehemence of her words can convey , I am sensible , but a weak impression of the passion by which she was possessed , and which made itself articulate in her whole figure , though her voice , instead of being raised , was lower than usual .
Parsing [sent. 10309 len. 27]: No description I could give of her would do justice to my recollection of her , or to her entire deliverance of herself to her anger .
Parsing [sent. 10310 len. 21]: I have seen passion in many forms , but I have never seen it in such a form as that .
Parsing [sent. 10311 len. 16]: When I joined Mr. Peggotty , he was walking slowly and thoughtfully down the hill .
Parsing [sent. 10312 len. 42]: He told me , as soon as I came up with him , that having now discharged his mind of what he had purposed doing in London , he meant ` to set out on his travels ' , that night .
Parsing [sent. 10313 len. 9]: I asked him where he meant to go ?
Parsing [sent. 10314 len. 18]: He only answered , ` I 'm a going , sir , to seek my niece . '
Parsing [sent. 10315 len. 30]: We went back to the little lodging over the chandler 's shop , and there I found an opportunity of repeating to Peggotty what he had said to me .
Parsing [sent. 10316 len. 18]: She informed me , in return , that he had said the same to her that morning .
Parsing [sent. 10317 len. 26]: She knew no more than I did , where he was going , but she thought he had some project shaped out in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 10318 len. 82]: I did not like to leave him , under such circumstances , and we all three dined together off a beefsteak pie -- which was one of the many good things for which Peggotty was famous -- and which was curiously flavoured on this occasion , I recollect well , by a miscellaneous taste of tea , coffee , butter , bacon , cheese , new loaves , firewood , candles , and walnut ketchup , continually ascending from the shop .
Parsing [sent. 10319 len. 41]: After dinner we sat for an hour or so near the window , without talking much ; and then Mr. Peggotty got up , and brought his oilskin bag and his stout stick , and laid them on the table .
Parsing [sent. 10320 len. 36]: He accepted , from his sister 's stock of ready money , a small sum on account of his legacy ; barely enough , I should have thought , to keep him for a month .
Parsing [sent. 10321 len. 34]: He promised to communicate with me , when anything befell him ; and he slung his bag about him , took his hat and stick , and bade us both ` Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 10322 len. 28]: ` All good attend you , dear old woman , ' he said , embracing Peggotty , ` and you too , Mas ' r Davy ! '
Parsing [sent. 10323 len. 5]: shaking hands with me .
Parsing [sent. 10324 len. 12]: ` I 'm a-going to seek her , fur and wide .
Parsing [sent. 10325 len. 20]: If she should come home while I 'm away -- but ah , that ai n't like to be !
Parsing [sent. 10326 len. 29]: -- or if I should bring her back , my meaning is , that she and me shall live and die where no one ca n't reproach her .
Parsing [sent. 10327 len. 36]: If any hurt should come to me , remember that the last words I left for her was , `` My unchanged love is with my darling child , and I forgive her ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 10328 len. 23]: He said this solemnly , bare-headed ; then , putting on his hat , he went down the stairs , and away .
Parsing [sent. 10329 len. 6]: We followed to the door .
Parsing [sent. 10330 len. 46]: It was a warm , dusty evening , just the time when , in the great main thoroughfare out of which that by-way turned , there was a temporary lull in the eternal tread of feet upon the pavement , and a strong red sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 10331 len. 25]: He turned , alone , at the corner of our shady street , into a glow of light , in which we lost him .
Parsing [sent. 10332 len. 70]: Rarely did that hour of the evening come , rarely did I wake at night , rarely did I look up at the moon , or stars , or watch the falling rain , or hear the wind , but I thought of his solitary figure toiling on , poor pilgrim , and recalled the words : ` I 'm a going to seek her , fur and wide .
Parsing [sent. 10333 len. 36]: If any hurt should come to me , remember that the last words I left for her was , `` My unchanged love is with my darling child , and I forgive her ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 10334 len. 18]: Chapter 33 Blissful All this time , I had gone on loving Dora , harder than ever .
Parsing [sent. 10335 len. 25]: Her idea was my refuge in disappointment and distress , and made some amends to me , even for the loss of my friend .
Parsing [sent. 10336 len. 22]: The more I pitied myself , or pitied others , the more I sought for consolation in the image of Dora .
Parsing [sent. 10337 len. 27]: The greater the accumulation of deceit and trouble in the world , the brighter and the purer shone the star of Dora high above the world .
Parsing [sent. 10338 len. 56]: I do n't think I had any definite idea where Dora came from , or in what degree she was related to a higher order of beings ; but I am quite sure I should have scouted the notion of her being simply human , like any other young lady , with indignation and contempt .
Parsing [sent. 10339 len. 13]: If I may so express it , I was steeped in Dora .
Parsing [sent. 10340 len. 21]: I was not merely over head and ears in love with her , but I was saturated through and through .
Parsing [sent. 10341 len. 39]: Enough love might have been wrung out of me , metaphorically speaking , to drown anybody in ; and yet there would have remained enough within me , and all over me , to pervade my entire existence .
Parsing [sent. 10342 len. 57]: The first thing I did , on my own account , when I came back , was to take a night-walk to Norwood , and , like the subject of a venerable riddle of my childhood , to go ` round and round the house , without ever touching the house ' , thinking about Dora .
Parsing [sent. 10343 len. 12]: I believe the theme of this incomprehensible conundrum was the moon .
Parsing [sent. 10344 len. 86]: No matter what it was , I , the moon-struck slave of Dora , perambulated round and round the house and garden for two hours , looking through crevices in the palings , getting my chin by dint of violent exertion above the rusty nails on the top , blowing kisses at the lights in the windows , and romantically calling on the night , at intervals , to shield my Dora -- I do n't exactly know what from , I suppose from fire .
Parsing [sent. 10345 len. 12]: Perhaps from mice , to which she had a great objection .
Parsing [sent. 10346 len. 63]: My love was so much in my mind and it was so natural to me to confide in Peggotty , when I found her again by my side of an evening with the old set of industrial implements , busily making the tour of my wardrobe , that I imparted to her , in a sufficiently roundabout way , my great secret .
Parsing [sent. 10347 len. 20]: Peggotty was strongly interested , but I could not get her into my view of the case at all .
Parsing [sent. 10348 len. 26]: She was audaciously prejudiced in my favour , and quite unable to understand why I should have any misgivings , or be low-spirited about it .
Parsing [sent. 10349 len. 21]: ` The young lady might think herself well off , ' she observed , ` to have such a beau .
Parsing [sent. 10350 len. 22]: And as to her Pa , ' she said , ` what did the gentleman expect , for gracious sake ! '
Parsing [sent. 10351 len. 75]: I observed , however , that Mr. Spenlow 's proctorial gown and stiff cravat took Peggotty down a little , and inspired her with a greater reverence for the man who was gradually becoming more and more etherealized in my eyes every day , and about whom a reflected radiance seemed to me to beam when he sat erect in Court among his papers , like a little lighthouse in a sea of stationery .
Parsing [sent. 10352 len. 107]: And by the by , it used to be uncommonly strange to me to consider , I remember , as I sat in Court too , how those dim old judges and doctors would n't have cared for Dora , if they had known her ; how they would n't have gone out of their senses with rapture , if marriage with Dora had been proposed to them ; how Dora might have sung , and played upon that glorified guitar , until she led me to the verge of madness , yet not have tempted one of those slow-goers an inch out of his road !
Parsing [sent. 10353 len. 8]: I despised them , to a man .
Parsing [sent. 10354 len. 19]: Frozen-out old gardeners in the flower-beds of the heart , I took a personal offence against them all .
Parsing [sent. 10355 len. 11]: The Bench was nothing to me but an insensible blunderer .
Parsing [sent. 10356 len. 18]: The Bar had no more tenderness or poetry in it , than the bar of a public-house .
Parsing [sent. 10357 len. 48]: Taking the management of Peggotty 's affairs into my own hands , with no little pride , I proved the will , and came to a settlement with the Legacy Duty-office , and took her to the Bank , and soon got everything into an orderly train .
Parsing [sent. 10358 len. 72]: We varied the legal character of these proceedings by going to see some perspiring Wax-work , in Fleet Street -LRB- melted , I should hope , these twenty years -RRB- ; and by visiting Miss Linwood 's Exhibition , which I remember as a Mausoleum of needlework , favourable to self-examination and repentance ; and by inspecting the Tower of London ; and going to the top of St. Paul 's .
Parsing [sent. 10359 len. 66]: All these wonders afforded Peggotty as much pleasure as she was able to enjoy , under existing circumstances : except , I think , St. Paul 's , which , from her long attachment to her work-box , became a rival of the picture on the lid , and was , in some particulars , vanquished , she considered , by that work of art .
Parsing [sent. 10360 len. 47]: Peggotty 's business , which was what we used to call ` common-form business ' in the Commons -LRB- and very light and lucrative the common-form business was -RRB- , being settled , I took her down to the office one morning to pay her bill .
Parsing [sent. 10361 len. 53]: Mr. Spenlow had stepped out , old Tiffey said , to get a gentleman sworn for a marriage licence ; but as I knew he would be back directly , our place lying close to the Surrogate 's , and to the Vicar-General 's office too , I told Peggotty to wait .
Parsing [sent. 10362 len. 39]: We were a little like undertakers , in the Commons , as regarded Probate transactions ; generally making it a rule to look more or less cut up , when we had to deal with clients in mourning .
Parsing [sent. 10363 len. 18]: In a similar feeling of delicacy , we were always blithe and light-hearted with the licence clients .
Parsing [sent. 10364 len. 31]: Therefore I hinted to Peggotty that she would find Mr. Spenlow much recovered from the shock of Mr. Barkis 's decease ; and indeed he came in like a bridegroom .
Parsing [sent. 10365 len. 22]: But neither Peggotty nor I had eyes for him , when we saw , in company with him , Mr. Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 10366 len. 6]: He was very little changed .
Parsing [sent. 10367 len. 28]: His hair looked as thick , and was certainly as black , as ever ; and his glance was as little to be trusted as of old .
Parsing [sent. 10368 len. 6]: ` Ah , Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 10369 len. 4]: said Mr. Spenlow .
Parsing [sent. 10370 len. 10]: ` You know this gentleman , I believe ? '
Parsing [sent. 10371 len. 14]: I made my gentleman a distant bow , and Peggotty barely recognized him .
Parsing [sent. 10372 len. 28]: He was , at first , somewhat disconcerted to meet us two together ; but quickly decided what to do , and came up to me . '
Parsing [sent. 10373 len. 15]: I hope , ' he said , ` that you are doing well ? '
Parsing [sent. 10374 len. 22]: ` It can hardly be interesting to you , ' said I. ` Yes , if you wish to know . '
Parsing [sent. 10375 len. 13]: We looked at each other , and he addressed himself to Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 10376 len. 9]: ` And you , ' said he . '
Parsing [sent. 10377 len. 13]: I am sorry to observe that you have lost your husband . '
Parsing [sent. 10378 len. 28]: ` It 's not the first loss I have had in my life , Mr. Murdstone , ' replied Peggotty , trembling from head to foot . '
Parsing [sent. 10379 len. 23]: I am glad to hope that there is nobody to blame for this one , -- nobody to answer for it . '
Parsing [sent. 10380 len. 4]: ` Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 10381 len. 10]: said he ; ` that 's a comfortable reflection .
Parsing [sent. 10382 len. 8]: You have done your duty ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10383 len. 20]: I have not worn anybody 's life away , ' said Peggotty , ' I am thankful to think !
Parsing [sent. 10384 len. 20]: No , Mr. Murdstone , I have not worrited and frightened any sweet creetur to an early grave ! '
Parsing [sent. 10385 len. 64]: He eyed her gloomily -- remorsefully I thought -- for an instant ; and said , turning his head towards me , but looking at my feet instead of my face : ` We are not likely to encounter soon again ; -- a source of satisfaction to us both , no doubt , for such meetings as this can never be agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 10386 len. 29]: I do not expect that you , who always rebelled against my just authority , exerted for your benefit and reformation , should owe me any good-will now .
Parsing [sent. 10387 len. 17]: There is an antipathy between us -- ' ` An old one , I believe ? '
Parsing [sent. 10388 len. 6]: said I , interrupting him .
Parsing [sent. 10389 len. 19]: He smiled , and shot as evil a glance at me as could come from his dark eyes .
Parsing [sent. 10390 len. 12]: ` It rankled in your baby breast , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 10391 len. 10]: ` It embittered the life of your poor mother .
Parsing [sent. 10392 len. 4]: You are right .
Parsing [sent. 10393 len. 17]: I hope you may do better , yet ; I hope you may correct yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 10394 len. 65]: Here he ended the dialogue , which had been carried on in a low voice , in a corner of the outer office , by passing into Mr. Spenlow 's room , and saying aloud , in his smoothest manner : ` Gentlemen of Mr. Spenlow 's profession are accustomed to family differences , and know how complicated and difficult they always are ! '
Parsing [sent. 10395 len. 47]: With that , he paid the money for his licence ; and , receiving it neatly folded from Mr. Spenlow , together with a shake of the hand , and a polite wish for his happiness and the lady 's , went out of the office .
Parsing [sent. 10396 len. 39]: I might have had more difficulty in constraining myself to be silent under his words , if I had had less difficulty in impressing upon Peggotty -LRB- who was only angry on my account , good creature ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 10397 len. 20]: that we were not in a place for recrimination , and that I besought her to hold her peace .
Parsing [sent. 10398 len. 46]: She was so unusually roused , that I was glad to compound for an affectionate hug , elicited by this revival in her mind of our old injuries , and to make the best I could of it , before Mr. Spenlow and the clerks .
Parsing [sent. 10399 len. 50]: Mr. Spenlow did not appear to know what the connexion between Mr. Murdstone and myself was ; which I was glad of , for I could not bear to acknowledge him , even in my own breast , remembering what I did of the history of my poor mother .
Parsing [sent. 10400 len. 66]: Mr. Spenlow seemed to think , if he thought anything about the matter , that my aunt was the leader of the state party in our family , and that there was a rebel party commanded by somebody else -- so I gathered at least from what he said , while we were waiting for Mr. Tiffey to make out Peggotty 's bill of costs .
Parsing [sent. 10401 len. 25]: ` Miss Trotwood , ' he remarked , ` is very firm , no doubt , and not likely to give way to opposition .
Parsing [sent. 10402 len. 23]: I have an admiration for her character , and I may congratulate you , Copperfield , on being on the right side .
Parsing [sent. 10403 len. 43]: Differences between relations are much to be deplored - but they are extremely general -- and the great thing is , to be on the right side ' : meaning , I take it , on the side of the moneyed interest .
Parsing [sent. 10404 len. 11]: ` Rather a good marriage this , I believe ? '
Parsing [sent. 10405 len. 4]: said Mr. Spenlow .
Parsing [sent. 10406 len. 9]: I explained that I knew nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 10407 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 10408 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 10409 len. 38]: ` Speaking from the few words Mr. Murdstone dropped -- as a man frequently does on these occasions -- and from what Miss Murdstone let fall , I should say it was rather a good marriage . '
Parsing [sent. 10410 len. 12]: ` Do you mean that there is money , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 10411 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 10412 len. 15]: ` Yes , ' said Mr. Spenlow , ' I understand there 's money .
Parsing [sent. 10413 len. 8]: Beauty too , I am told . '
Parsing [sent. 10414 len. 3]: ` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 10415 len. 7]: Is his new wife young ? '
Parsing [sent. 10416 len. 10]: ` Just of age , ' said Mr. Spenlow .
Parsing [sent. 10417 len. 16]: ` So lately , that I should think they had been waiting for that . '
Parsing [sent. 10418 len. 6]: ` Lord deliver her ! '
Parsing [sent. 10419 len. 3]: said Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 10420 len. 21]: So very emphatically and unexpectedly , that we were all three discomposed ; until Tiffey came in with the bill .
Parsing [sent. 10421 len. 18]: Old Tiffey soon appeared , however , and handed it to Mr. Spenlow , to look over .
Parsing [sent. 10422 len. 43]: Mr. Spenlow , settling his chin in his cravat and rubbing it softly , went over the items with a deprecatory air -- as if it were all Jorkins 's doing -- and handed it back to Tiffey with a bland sigh .
Parsing [sent. 10423 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 10424 len. 5]: ` That 's right .
Parsing [sent. 10425 len. 3]: Quite right .
Parsing [sent. 10426 len. 45]: I should have been extremely happy , Copperfield , to have limited these charges to the actual expenditure out of pocket , but it is an irksome incident in my professional life , that I am not at liberty to consult my own wishes .
Parsing [sent. 10427 len. 9]: I have a partner -- Mr. Jorkins . '
Parsing [sent. 10428 len. 36]: As he said this with a gentle melancholy , which was the next thing to making no charge at all , I expressed my acknowledgements on Peggotty 's behalf , and paid Tiffey in banknotes .
Parsing [sent. 10429 len. 56]: Peggotty then retired to her lodging , and Mr. Spenlow and I went into Court , where we had a divorce-suit coming on , under an ingenious little statute -LRB- repealed now , I believe , but in virtue of which I have seen several marriages annulled -RRB- , of which the merits were these .
Parsing [sent. 10430 len. 36]: The husband , whose name was Thomas Benjamin , had taken out his marriage licence as Thomas only ; suppressing the Benjamin , in case he should not find himself as comfortable as he expected .
Parsing [sent. 10431 len. 56]: NOT finding himself as comfortable as he expected , or being a little fatigued with his wife , poor fellow , he now came forward , by a friend , after being married a year or two , and declared that his name was Thomas Benjamin , and therefore he was not married at all .
Parsing [sent. 10432 len. 10]: Which the Court confirmed , to his great satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 10433 len. 33]: I must say that I had my doubts about the strict justice of this , and was not even frightened out of them by the bushel of wheat which reconciles all anomalies .
Parsing [sent. 10434 len. 9]: But Mr. Spenlow argued the matter with me .
Parsing [sent. 10435 len. 30]: He said , Look at the world , there was good and evil in that ; look at the ecclesiastical law , there was good and evil in THAT .
Parsing [sent. 10436 len. 8]: It was all part of a system .
Parsing [sent. 10437 len. 3]: Very good .
Parsing [sent. 10438 len. 4]: There you were !
Parsing [sent. 10439 len. 52]: I had not the hardihood to suggest to Dora 's father that possibly we might even improve the world a little , if we got up early in the morning , and took off our coats to the work ; but I confessed that I thought we might improve the Commons .
Parsing [sent. 10440 len. 45]: Mr. Spenlow replied that he would particularly advise me to dismiss that idea from my mind , as not being worthy of my gentlemanly character ; but that he would be glad to hear from me of what improvement I thought the Commons susceptible ?
Parsing [sent. 10441 len. 51]: Taking that part of the Commons which happened to be nearest to us - for our man was unmarried by this time , and we were out of Court , and strolling past the Prerogative Office -- I submitted that I thought the Prerogative Office rather a queerly managed institution .
Parsing [sent. 10442 len. 7]: Mr. Spenlow inquired in what respect ?
Parsing [sent. 10443 len. 150]: I replied , with all due deference to his experience -LRB- but with more deference , I am afraid , to his being Dora 's father -RRB- , that perhaps it was a little nonsensical that the Registry of that Court , containing the original wills of all persons leaving effects within the immense province of Canterbury , for three whole centuries , should be an accidental building , never designed for the purpose , leased by the registrars for their Own private emolument , unsafe , not even ascertained to be fire-proof , choked with the important documents it held , and positively , from the roof to the basement , a mercenary speculation of the registrars , who took great fees from the public , and crammed the public 's wills away anyhow and anywhere , having no other object than to get rid of them cheaply .
Parsing [sent. 10444 len. 85]: That , perhaps , it was a little unreasonable that these registrars in the receipt of profits amounting to eight or nine thousand pounds a year -LRB- to say nothing of the profits of the deputy registrars , and clerks of seats -RRB- , should not be obliged to spend a little of that money , in finding a reasonably safe place for the important documents which all classes of people were compelled to hand over to them , whether they would or no .
Parsing [sent. 10445 len. 52]: That , perhaps , it was a little unjust , that all the great offices in this great office should be magnificent sinecures , while the unfortunate working-clerks in the cold dark room upstairs were the worst rewarded , and the least considered men , doing important services , in London .
Parsing [sent. 10446 len. 102]: That perhaps it was a little indecent that the principal registrar of all , whose duty it was to find the public , constantly resorting to this place , all needful accommodation , should be an enormous sinecurist in virtue of that post -LRB- and might be , besides , a clergyman , a pluralist , the holder of a staff in a cathedral , and what not -RRB- , -- while the public was put to the inconvenience of which we had a specimen every afternoon when the office was busy , and which we knew to be quite monstrous .
Parsing [sent. 10447 len. 65]: That , perhaps , in short , this Prerogative Office of the diocese of Canterbury was altogether such a pestilent job , and such a pernicious absurdity , that but for its being squeezed away in a corner of St. Paul 's Churchyard , which few people knew , it must have been turned completely inside out , and upside down , long ago .
Parsing [sent. 10448 len. 26]: Mr. Spenlow smiled as I became modestly warm on the subject , and then argued this question with me as he had argued the other .
Parsing [sent. 10449 len. 9]: He said , what was it after all ?
Parsing [sent. 10450 len. 7]: It was a question of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 10451 len. 34]: If the public felt that their wills were in safe keeping , and took it for granted that the office was not to be made better , who was the worse for it ?
Parsing [sent. 10452 len. 2]: Nobody .
Parsing [sent. 10453 len. 7]: Who was the better for it ?
Parsing [sent. 10454 len. 4]: All the Sinecurists .
Parsing [sent. 10455 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 10456 len. 5]: Then the good predominated .
Parsing [sent. 10457 len. 26]: It might not be a perfect system ; nothing was perfect ; but what he objected to , was , the insertion of the wedge .
Parsing [sent. 10458 len. 11]: Under the Prerogative Office , the country had been glorious .
Parsing [sent. 10459 len. 17]: Insert the wedge into the Prerogative Office , and the country would cease to be glorious .
Parsing [sent. 10460 len. 29]: He considered it the principle of a gentleman to take things as he found them ; and he had no doubt the Prerogative Office would last our time .
Parsing [sent. 10461 len. 15]: I deferred to his opinion , though I had great doubts of it myself .
Parsing [sent. 10462 len. 76]: I find he was right , however ; for it has not only lasted to the present moment , but has done so in the teeth of a great parliamentary report made -LRB- not too willingly -RRB- eighteen years ago , when all these objections of mine were set forth in detail , and when the existing stowage for wills was described as equal to the accumulation of only two years and a half more .
Parsing [sent. 10463 len. 34]: What they have done with them since ; whether they have lost many , or whether they sell any , now and then , to the butter shops ; I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 10464 len. 20]: I am glad mine is not there , and I hope it may not go there , yet awhile .
Parsing [sent. 10465 len. 22]: I have set all this down , in my present blissful chapter , because here it comes into its natural place .
Parsing [sent. 10466 len. 25]: Mr. Spenlow and I falling into this conversation , prolonged it and our saunter to and fro , until we diverged into general topics .
Parsing [sent. 10467 len. 42]: And so it came about , in the end , that Mr. Spenlow told me this day week was Dora 's birthday , and he would be glad if I would come down and join a little picnic on the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 10468 len. 30]: I went out of my senses immediately ; became a mere driveller next day , on receipt of a little lace-edged sheet of note-paper , ` Favoured by papa .
Parsing [sent. 10469 len. 15]: To remind ' ; and passed the intervening period in a state of dotage .
Parsing [sent. 10470 len. 17]: I think I committed every possible absurdity in the way of preparation for this blessed event .
Parsing [sent. 10471 len. 11]: I turn hot when I remember the cravat I bought .
Parsing [sent. 10472 len. 13]: My boots might be placed in any collection of instruments of torture .
Parsing [sent. 10473 len. 31]: I provided , and sent down by the Norwood coach the night before , a delicate little hamper , amounting in itself , I thought , almost to a declaration .
Parsing [sent. 10474 len. 16]: There were crackers in it with the tenderest mottoes that could be got for money .
Parsing [sent. 10475 len. 19]: At six in the morning , I was in Covent Garden Market , buying a bouquet for Dora .
Parsing [sent. 10476 len. 35]: At ten I was on horseback -LRB- I hired a gallant grey , for the occasion -RRB- , with the bouquet in my hat , to keep it fresh , trotting down to Norwood .
Parsing [sent. 10477 len. 55]: I suppose that when I saw Dora in the garden and pretended not to see her , and rode past the house pretending to be anxiously looking for it , I committed two small fooleries which other young gentlemen in my circumstances might have committed -- because they came so very natural to me .
Parsing [sent. 10478 len. 3]: But oh !
Parsing [sent. 10479 len. 60]: when I DID find the house , and DID dismount at the garden-gate , and drag those stony-hearted boots across the lawn to Dora sitting on a garden-seat under a lilac tree , what a spectacle she was , upon that beautiful morning , among the butterflies , in a white chip bonnet and a dress of celestial blue !
Parsing [sent. 10480 len. 20]: There was a young lady with her -- comparatively stricken in years -- almost twenty , I should say .
Parsing [sent. 10481 len. 6]: Her name was Miss Mills .
Parsing [sent. 10482 len. 6]: and Dora called her Julia .
Parsing [sent. 10483 len. 8]: She was the bosom friend of Dora .
Parsing [sent. 10484 len. 4]: Happy Miss Mills !
Parsing [sent. 10485 len. 12]: Jip was there , and Jip WOULD bark at me again .
Parsing [sent. 10486 len. 13]: When I presented my bouquet , he gnashed his teeth with jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 10487 len. 4]: Well he might .
Parsing [sent. 10488 len. 16]: If he had the least idea how I adored his mistress , well he might !
Parsing [sent. 10489 len. 9]: ` Oh , thank you , Mr. Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 10490 len. 5]: What dear flowers ! '
Parsing [sent. 10491 len. 3]: said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 10492 len. 34]: I had had an intention of saying -LRB- and had been studying the best form of words for three miles -RRB- that I thought them beautiful before I saw them so near HER .
Parsing [sent. 10493 len. 7]: But I could n't manage it .
Parsing [sent. 10494 len. 5]: She was too bewildering .
Parsing [sent. 10495 len. 28]: To see her lay the flowers against her little dimpled chin , was to lose all presence of mind and power of language in a feeble ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 10496 len. 20]: I wonder I did n't say , ` Kill me , if you have a heart , Miss Mills .
Parsing [sent. 10497 len. 6]: Let me die here ! '
Parsing [sent. 10498 len. 10]: Then Dora held my flowers to Jip to smell .
Parsing [sent. 10499 len. 10]: Then Jip growled , and would n't smell them .
Parsing [sent. 10500 len. 17]: Then Dora laughed , and held them a little closer to Jip , to make him .
Parsing [sent. 10501 len. 20]: Then Jip laid hold of a bit of geranium with his teeth , and worried imaginary cats in it .
Parsing [sent. 10502 len. 18]: Then Dora beat him , and pouted , and said , ` My poor beautiful flowers ! '
Parsing [sent. 10503 len. 15]: as compassionately , I thought , as if Jip had laid hold of me .
Parsing [sent. 10504 len. 5]: I wished he had !
Parsing [sent. 10505 len. 26]: ` You 'll be so glad to hear , Mr. Copperfield , ' said Dora , ` that that cross Miss Murdstone is not here .
Parsing [sent. 10506 len. 18]: She has gone to her brother 's marriage , and will be away at least three weeks .
Parsing [sent. 10507 len. 6]: Is n't that delightful ? '
Parsing [sent. 10508 len. 24]: I said I was sure it must be delightful to her , and all that was delightful to her was delightful to me .
Parsing [sent. 10509 len. 16]: Miss Mills , with an air of superior wisdom and benevolence , smiled upon us .
Parsing [sent. 10510 len. 15]: ` She is the most disagreeable thing I ever saw , ' said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 10511 len. 15]: ` You ca n't believe how ill-tempered and shocking she is , Julia . '
Parsing [sent. 10512 len. 10]: ` Yes , I can , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 10513 len. 3]: said Julia .
Parsing [sent. 10514 len. 19]: ` YOU can , perhaps , love , ' returned Dora , with her hand on julia 's .
Parsing [sent. 10515 len. 14]: ` Forgive my not excepting you , my dear , at first . '
Parsing [sent. 10516 len. 42]: I learnt , from this , that Miss Mills had had her trials in the course of a chequered existence ; and that to these , perhaps , I might refer that wise benignity of manner which I had already noticed .
Parsing [sent. 10517 len. 58]: i found , in the course of the day , that this was the case : Miss Mills having been unhappy in a misplaced affection , and being understood to have retired from the world on her awful stock of experience , but still to take a calm interest in the unblighted hopes and loves of youth .
Parsing [sent. 10518 len. 28]: But now Mr. Spenlow came out of the house , and Dora went to him , saying , ` Look , papa , what beautiful flowers ! '
Parsing [sent. 10519 len. 27]: And Miss Mills smiled thoughtfully , as who should say , ` Ye Mayflies , enjoy your brief existence in the bright morning of life ! '
Parsing [sent. 10520 len. 16]: And we all walked from the lawn towards the carriage , which was getting ready .
Parsing [sent. 10521 len. 9]: I shall never have such a ride again .
Parsing [sent. 10522 len. 7]: I have never had such another .
Parsing [sent. 10523 len. 50]: There were only those three , their hamper , my hamper , and the guitar-case , in the phaeton ; and , of course , the phaeton was open ; and I rode behind it , and Dora sat with her back to the horses , looking towards me .
Parsing [sent. 10524 len. 33]: She kept the bouquet close to her on the cushion , and would n't allow Jip to sit on that side of her at all , for fear he should crush it .
Parsing [sent. 10525 len. 15]: She often carried it in her hand , often refreshed herself with its fragrance .
Parsing [sent. 10526 len. 29]: Our eyes at those times often met ; and my great astonishment is that I did n't go over the head of my gallant grey into the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 10527 len. 7]: There was dust , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 10528 len. 11]: There was a good deal of dust , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 10529 len. 22]: I have a faint impression that Mr. Spenlow remonstrated with me for riding in it ; but I knew of none .
Parsing [sent. 10530 len. 18]: I was sensible of a mist of love and beauty about Dora , but of nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 10531 len. 15]: He stood up sometimes , and asked me what I thought of the prospect .
Parsing [sent. 10532 len. 21]: I said it was delightful , and I dare say it was ; but it was all Dora to me .
Parsing [sent. 10533 len. 11]: The sun shone Dora , and the birds sang Dora .
Parsing [sent. 10534 len. 21]: The south wind blew Dora , and the wild flowers in the hedges were all Doras , to a bud .
Parsing [sent. 10535 len. 9]: My comfort is , Miss Mills understood me .
Parsing [sent. 10536 len. 10]: Miss Mills alone could enter into my feelings thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 10537 len. 22]: I do n't know how long we were going , and to this hour I know as little where we went .
Parsing [sent. 10538 len. 6]: Perhaps it was near Guildford .
Parsing [sent. 10539 len. 24]: Perhaps some Arabian-night magician , opened up the place for the day , and shut it up for ever when we came away .
Parsing [sent. 10540 len. 15]: It was a green spot , on a hill , carpeted with soft turf .
Parsing [sent. 10541 len. 22]: There were shady trees , and heather , and , as far as the eye could see , a rich landscape .
Parsing [sent. 10542 len. 27]: It was a trying thing to find people here , waiting for us ; and my jealousy , even of the ladies , knew no bounds .
Parsing [sent. 10543 len. 41]: But all of my own sex -- especially one impostor , three or four years my elder , with a red whisker , on which he established an amount of presumption not to be endured -- were my mortal foes .
Parsing [sent. 10544 len. 14]: We all unpacked our baskets , and employed ourselves in getting dinner ready .
Parsing [sent. 10545 len. 23]: Red Whisker pretended he could make a salad -LRB- which I do n't believe -RRB- , and obtruded himself on public notice .
Parsing [sent. 10546 len. 18]: Some of the young ladies washed the lettuces for him , and sliced them under his directions .
Parsing [sent. 10547 len. 5]: Dora was among these .
Parsing [sent. 10548 len. 18]: I felt that fate had pitted me against this man , and one of us must fall .
Parsing [sent. 10549 len. 14]: Red Whisker made his salad -LRB- I wondered how they could eat it .
Parsing [sent. 10550 len. 10]: Nothing should have induced ME to touch it ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 10551 len. 27]: and voted himself into the charge of the wine-cellar , which he constructed , being an ingenious beast , in the hollow trunk of a tree .
Parsing [sent. 10552 len. 27]: By and by , I saw him , with the majority of a lobster on his plate , eating his dinner at the feet of Dora !
Parsing [sent. 10553 len. 22]: I have but an indistinct idea of what happened for some time after this baleful object presented itself to my view .
Parsing [sent. 10554 len. 14]: I was very merry , I know ; but it was hollow merriment .
Parsing [sent. 10555 len. 20]: I attached myself to a young creature in pink , with little eyes , and flirted with her desperately .
Parsing [sent. 10556 len. 29]: She received my attentions with favour ; but whether on my account solely , or because she had any designs on Red Whisker , I ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 10557 len. 6]: Dora 's health was drunk .
Parsing [sent. 10558 len. 22]: When I drank it , I affected to interrupt my conversation for that purpose , and to resume it immediately afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 10559 len. 18]: I caught Dora 's eye as I bowed to her , and I thought it looked appealing .
Parsing [sent. 10560 len. 17]: But it looked at me over the head of Red Whisker , and I was adamant .
Parsing [sent. 10561 len. 24]: The young creature in pink had a mother in green ; and I rather think the latter separated us from motives of policy .
Parsing [sent. 10562 len. 40]: Howbeit , there was a general breaking up of the party , while the remnants of the dinner were being put away ; and I strolled off by myself among the trees , in a raging and remorseful state .
Parsing [sent. 10563 len. 35]: I was debating whether I should pretend that I was not well , and fly -- I do n't know where -- upon my gallant grey , when Dora and Miss Mills met me .
Parsing [sent. 10564 len. 15]: ` Mr. Copperfield , ' said Miss Mills , ` you are dull . '
Parsing [sent. 10565 len. 5]: I begged her pardon .
Parsing [sent. 10566 len. 4]: Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 10567 len. 15]: ` And Dora , ' said Miss Mills , ` YOU are dull . '
Parsing [sent. 10568 len. 4]: Oh dear no !
Parsing [sent. 10569 len. 5]: Not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 10570 len. 17]: ` Mr. Copperfield and Dora , ' said Miss Mills , with an almost venerable air .
Parsing [sent. 10571 len. 5]: ` Enough of this .
Parsing [sent. 10572 len. 26]: Do not allow a trivial misunderstanding to wither the blossoms of spring , which , once put forth and blighted , can not be renewed .
Parsing [sent. 10573 len. 21]: I speak , ' said Miss Mills , ` from experience of the past -- the remote , irrevocable past .
Parsing [sent. 10574 len. 32]: The gushing fountains which sparkle in the sun , must not be stopped in mere caprice ; the oasis in the desert of Sahara must not be plucked up idly . '
Parsing [sent. 10575 len. 33]: I hardly knew what I did , I was burning all over to that extraordinary extent ; but I took Dora 's little hand and kissed it - and she let me !
Parsing [sent. 10576 len. 25]: I kissed Miss Mills 's hand ; and we all seemed , to my thinking , to go straight up to the seventh heaven .
Parsing [sent. 10577 len. 7]: We did not come down again .
Parsing [sent. 10578 len. 8]: We stayed up there all the evening .
Parsing [sent. 10579 len. 57]: At first we strayed to and fro among the trees : I with Dora 's shy arm drawn through mine : and Heaven knows , folly as it all was , it would have been a happy fate to have been struck immortal with those foolish feelings , and have stayed among the trees for ever !
Parsing [sent. 10580 len. 22]: But , much too soon , we heard the others laughing and talking , and calling ` where 's Dora ? '
Parsing [sent. 10581 len. 12]: So we went back , and they wanted Dora to sing .
Parsing [sent. 10582 len. 25]: Red Whisker would have got the guitar-case out of the carriage , but Dora told him nobody knew where it was , but I .
Parsing [sent. 10583 len. 82]: So Red Whisker was done for in a moment ; and I got it , and I unlocked it , and I took the guitar out , and I sat by her , and I held her handkerchief and gloves , and I drank in every note of her dear voice , and she sang to ME who loved her , and all the others might applaud as much as they liked , but they had nothing to do with it !
Parsing [sent. 10584 len. 6]: I was intoxicated with joy .
Parsing [sent. 10585 len. 33]: I was afraid it was too happy to be real , and that I should wake in Buckingham Street presently , and hear Mrs. Crupp clinking the teacups in getting breakfast ready .
Parsing [sent. 10586 len. 58]: But Dora sang , and others sang , and Miss Mills sang -- about the slumbering echoes in the caverns of Memory ; as if she were a hundred years old -- and the evening came on ; and we had tea , with the kettle boiling gipsy-fashion ; and I was still as happy as ever .
Parsing [sent. 10587 len. 48]: I was happier than ever when the party broke up , and the other people , defeated Red Whisker and all , went their several ways , and we went ours through the still evening and the dying light , with sweet scents rising up around us .
Parsing [sent. 10588 len. 42]: Mr. Spenlow being a little drowsy after the champagne -- honour to the soil that grew the grape , to the grape that made the wine , to the sun that ripened it , and to the merchant who adulterated it !
Parsing [sent. 10589 len. 22]: -- and being fast asleep in a corner of the carriage , I rode by the side and talked to Dora .
Parsing [sent. 10590 len. 21]: She admired my horse and patted him -- oh , what a dear little hand it looked upon a horse !
Parsing [sent. 10591 len. 51]: -- and her shawl would not keep right , and now and then I drew it round her with my arm ; and I even fancied that Jip began to see how it was , and to understand that he must make up his mind to be friends with me .
Parsing [sent. 10592 len. 57]: That sagacious Miss Mills , too ; that amiable , though quite used up , recluse ; that little patriarch of something less than twenty , who had done with the world , and must n't on any account have the slumbering echoes in the caverns of Memory awakened ; what a kind thing she did !
Parsing [sent. 10593 len. 27]: ` Mr. Copperfield , ' said Miss Mills , ` come to this side of the carriage a moment -- if you can spare a moment .
Parsing [sent. 10594 len. 8]: I want to speak to you . '
Parsing [sent. 10595 len. 24]: Behold me , on my gallant grey , bending at the side of Miss Mills , with my hand upon the carriage door !
Parsing [sent. 10596 len. 9]: ` Dora is coming to stay with me .
Parsing [sent. 10597 len. 11]: She is coming home with me the day after tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 10598 len. 19]: If you would like to call , I am sure papa would be happy to see you . '
Parsing [sent. 10599 len. 29]: What could I do but invoke a silent blessing on Miss Mills 's head , and store Miss Mills 's address in the securest corner of my memory !
Parsing [sent. 10600 len. 35]: What could I do but tell Miss Mills , with grateful looks and fervent words , how much I appreciated her good offices , and what an inestimable value I set upon her friendship !
Parsing [sent. 10601 len. 16]: Then Miss Mills benignantly dismissed me , saying , ` Go back to Dora ! '
Parsing [sent. 10602 len. 85]: and I went ; and Dora leaned out of the carriage to talk to me , and we talked all the rest of the way ; and I rode my gallant grey so close to the wheel that I grazed his near fore leg against it , and ` took the bark off ' , as his owner told me , ` to the tune of three pun ' sivin ' -- which I paid , and thought extremely cheap for so much joy .
Parsing [sent. 10603 len. 31]: What time Miss Mills sat looking at the moon , murmuring verses - and recalling , I suppose , the ancient days when she and earth had anything in common .
Parsing [sent. 10604 len. 43]: Norwood was many miles too near , and we reached it many hours too soon ; but Mr. Spenlow came to himself a little short of it , and said , ` You must come in , Copperfield , and rest ! '
Parsing [sent. 10605 len. 10]: and I consenting , we had sandwiches and wine-and-water .
Parsing [sent. 10606 len. 44]: In the light room , Dora blushing looked so lovely , that I could not tear myself away , but sat there staring , in a dream , until the snoring of Mr. Spenlow inspired me with sufficient consciousness to take my leave .
Parsing [sent. 10607 len. 59]: So we parted ; I riding all the way to London with the farewell touch of Dora 's hand still light on mine , recalling every incident and word ten thousand times ; lying down in my own bed at last , as enraptured a young noodle as ever was carried out of his five wits by love .
Parsing [sent. 10608 len. 21]: When I awoke next morning , I was resolute to declare my passion to Dora , and know my fate .
Parsing [sent. 10609 len. 8]: Happiness or misery was now the question .
Parsing [sent. 10610 len. 23]: There was no other question that I knew of in the world , and only Dora could give the answer to it .
Parsing [sent. 10611 len. 32]: I passed three days in a luxury of wretchedness , torturing myself by putting every conceivable variety of discouraging construction on all that ever had taken place between Dora and me .
Parsing [sent. 10612 len. 24]: At last , arrayed for the purpose at a vast expense , I went to Miss Mills 's , fraught with a declaration .
Parsing [sent. 10613 len. 51]: How many times I went up and down the street , and round the square - painfully aware of being a much better answer to the old riddle than the original one -- before I could persuade myself to go up the steps and knock , is no matter now .
Parsing [sent. 10614 len. 44]: Even when , at last , I had knocked , and was waiting at the door , I had some flurried thought of asking if that were Mr. Blackboy 's -LRB- in imitation of poor Barkis -RRB- , begging pardon , and retreating .
Parsing [sent. 10615 len. 6]: But I kept my ground .
Parsing [sent. 10616 len. 7]: Mr. Mills was not at home .
Parsing [sent. 10617 len. 8]: I did not expect he would be .
Parsing [sent. 10618 len. 4]: Nobody wanted HIM .
Parsing [sent. 10619 len. 6]: Miss Mills was at home .
Parsing [sent. 10620 len. 5]: Miss Mills would do .
Parsing [sent. 10621 len. 15]: I was shown into a room upstairs , where Miss Mills and Dora were .
Parsing [sent. 10622 len. 4]: Jip was there .
Parsing [sent. 10623 len. 29]: Miss Mills was copying music -LRB- I recollect , it was a new song , called ` Affection 's Dirge ' -RRB- , and Dora was painting flowers .
Parsing [sent. 10624 len. 19]: What were my feelings , when I recognized my own flowers ; the identical Covent Garden Market purchase !
Parsing [sent. 10625 len. 43]: I can not say that they were very like , or that they particularly resembled any flowers that have ever come under my observation ; but I knew from the paper round them which was accurately copied , what the composition was .
Parsing [sent. 10626 len. 29]: Miss Mills was very glad to see me , and very sorry her papa was not at home : though I thought we all bore that with fortitude .
Parsing [sent. 10627 len. 31]: Miss Mills was conversational for a few minutes , and then , laying down her pen upon ` Affection 's Dirge ' , got up , and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 10628 len. 13]: I began to think I would put it off till tomorrow . '
Parsing [sent. 10629 len. 26]: I hope your poor horse was not tired , when he got home at night , ' said Dora , lifting up her beautiful eyes .
Parsing [sent. 10630 len. 10]: ` It was a long way for him . '
Parsing [sent. 10631 len. 10]: I began to think I would do it today .
Parsing [sent. 10632 len. 26]: ` It was a long way for him , ' said I , ` for he had nothing to uphold him on the journey . '
Parsing [sent. 10633 len. 10]: ` Was n't he fed , poor thing ? '
Parsing [sent. 10634 len. 3]: asked Dora .
Parsing [sent. 10635 len. 12]: I began to think I would put it off till tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 10636 len. 15]: ` Ye-yes , ' I said , ` he was well taken care of .
Parsing [sent. 10637 len. 18]: I mean he had not the unutterable happiness that I had in being so near you . '
Parsing [sent. 10638 len. 59]: Dora bent her head over her drawing and said , after a little while - I had sat , in the interval , in a burning fever , and with my legs in a very rigid state -- ` You did n't seem to be sensible of that happiness yourself , at one time of the day . '
Parsing [sent. 10639 len. 19]: I saw now that I was in for it , and it must be done on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 10640 len. 36]: ` You did n't care for that happiness in the least , ' said Dora , slightly raising her eyebrows , and shaking her head , ` when you were sitting by Miss Kitt . '
Parsing [sent. 10641 len. 20]: Kitt , I should observe , was the name of the creature in pink , with the little eyes .
Parsing [sent. 10642 len. 26]: ` Though certainly I do n't know why you should , ' said Dora , or why you should call it a happiness at all .
Parsing [sent. 10643 len. 11]: But of course you do n't mean what you say .
Parsing [sent. 10644 len. 17]: And I am sure no one doubts your being at liberty to do whatever you like .
Parsing [sent. 10645 len. 10]: Jip , you naughty boy , come here ! '
Parsing [sent. 10646 len. 9]: I do n't know how I did it .
Parsing [sent. 10647 len. 7]: I did it in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 10648 len. 4]: I intercepted Jip .
Parsing [sent. 10649 len. 7]: I had Dora in my arms .
Parsing [sent. 10650 len. 6]: I was full of eloquence .
Parsing [sent. 10651 len. 7]: I never stopped for a word .
Parsing [sent. 10652 len. 8]: I told her how I loved her .
Parsing [sent. 10653 len. 9]: I told her I should die without her .
Parsing [sent. 10654 len. 10]: I told her that I idolized and worshipped her .
Parsing [sent. 10655 len. 7]: Jip barked madly all the time .
Parsing [sent. 10656 len. 19]: When Dora hung her head and cried , and trembled , my eloquence increased so much the more .
Parsing [sent. 10657 len. 23]: If she would like me to die for her , she had but to say the word , and I was ready .
Parsing [sent. 10658 len. 15]: Life without Dora 's love was not a thing to have on any terms .
Parsing [sent. 10659 len. 11]: I could n't bear it , and I would n't .
Parsing [sent. 10660 len. 17]: I had loved her every minute , day and night , since I first saw her .
Parsing [sent. 10661 len. 9]: I loved her at that minute to distraction .
Parsing [sent. 10662 len. 12]: I should always love her , every minute , to distraction .
Parsing [sent. 10663 len. 33]: Lovers had loved before , and lovers would love again ; but no lover had loved , might , could , would , or should ever love , as I loved Dora .
Parsing [sent. 10664 len. 10]: The more I raved , the more Jip barked .
Parsing [sent. 10665 len. 15]: Each of us , in his own way , got more mad every moment .
Parsing [sent. 10666 len. 4]: Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 10667 len. 28]: Dora and I were sitting on the sofa by and by , quiet enough , and Jip was lying in her lap , winking peacefully at me .
Parsing [sent. 10668 len. 6]: It was off my mind .
Parsing [sent. 10669 len. 9]: I was in a state of perfect rapture .
Parsing [sent. 10670 len. 6]: Dora and I were engaged .
Parsing [sent. 10671 len. 14]: I suppose we had some notion that this was to end in marriage .
Parsing [sent. 10672 len. 22]: We must have had some , because Dora stipulated that we were never to be married without her papa 's consent .
Parsing [sent. 10673 len. 30]: But , in our youthful ecstasy , I do n't think that we really looked before us or behind us ; or had any aspiration beyond the ignorant present .
Parsing [sent. 10674 len. 31]: We were to keep our secret from Mr. Spenlow ; but I am sure the idea never entered my head , then , that there was anything dishonourable in that .
Parsing [sent. 10675 len. 43]: Miss Mills was more than usually pensive when Dora , going to find her , brought her back ; -- I apprehend , because there was a tendency in what had passed to awaken the slumbering echoes in the caverns of Memory .
Parsing [sent. 10676 len. 30]: But she gave us her blessing , and the assurance of her lasting friendship , and spoke to us , generally , as became a Voice from the Cloister .
Parsing [sent. 10677 len. 7]: What an idle time it was !
Parsing [sent. 10678 len. 11]: What an insubstantial , happy , foolish time it was !
Parsing [sent. 10679 len. 98]: When I measured Dora 's finger for a ring that was to be made of Forget-me-nots , and when the jeweller , to whom I took the measure , found me out , and laughed over his order-book , and charged me anything he liked for the pretty little toy , with its blue stones - so associated in my remembrance with Dora 's hand , that yesterday , when I saw such another , by chance , on the finger of my own daughter , there was a momentary stirring in my heart , like pain !
Parsing [sent. 10680 len. 61]: When I walked about , exalted with my secret , and full of my own interest , and felt the dignity of loving Dora , and of being beloved , so much , that if I had walked the air , I could not have been more above the people not so situated , who were creeping on the earth !
Parsing [sent. 10681 len. 48]: When we had those meetings in the garden of the square , and sat within the dingy summer-house , so happy , that I love the London sparrows to this hour , for nothing else , and see the plumage of the tropics in their smoky feathers !
Parsing [sent. 10682 len. 53]: When we had our first great quarrel -LRB- within a week of our betrothal -RRB- , and when Dora sent me back the ring , enclosed in a despairing cocked-hat note , wherein she used the terrible expression that ` our love had begun in folly , and ended in madness ! '
Parsing [sent. 10683 len. 17]: which dreadful words occasioned me to tear my hair , and cry that all was over !
Parsing [sent. 10684 len. 41]: When , under cover of the night , I flew to Miss Mills , whom I saw by stealth in a back kitchen where there was a mangle , and implored Miss Mills to interpose between us and avert insanity .
Parsing [sent. 10685 len. 36]: When Miss Mills undertook the office and returned with Dora , exhorting us , from the pulpit of her own bitter youth , to mutual concession , and the avoidance of the Desert of Sahara !
Parsing [sent. 10686 len. 55]: When we cried , and made it up , and were so blest again , that the back kitchen , mangle and all , changed to Love 's own temple , where we arranged a plan of correspondence through Miss Mills , always to comprehend at least one letter on each side every day !
Parsing [sent. 10687 len. 5]: What an idle time !
Parsing [sent. 10688 len. 9]: What an insubstantial , happy , foolish time !
Parsing [sent. 10689 len. 35]: Of all the times of mine that Time has in his grip , there is none that in one retrospect I can smile at half so much , and think of half so tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 10690 len. 19]: Chapter 34 My Aunt Astonishes Me I wrote to Agnes as soon as Dora and I were engaged .
Parsing [sent. 10691 len. 27]: I wrote her a long letter , in which I tried to make her comprehend how blest I was , and what a darling Dora was .
Parsing [sent. 10692 len. 35]: I entreated Agnes not to regard this as a thoughtless passion which could ever yield to any other , or had the least resemblance to the boyish fancies that we used to joke about .
Parsing [sent. 10693 len. 23]: I assured her that its profundity was quite unfathomable , and expressed my belief that nothing like it had ever been known .
Parsing [sent. 10694 len. 69]: Somehow , as I wrote to Agnes on a fine evening by my open window , and the remembrance of her clear calm eyes and gentle face came stealing over me , it shed such a peaceful influence upon the hurry and agitation in which I had been living lately , and of which my very happiness partook in some degree , that it soothed me into tears .
Parsing [sent. 10695 len. 36]: I remember that I sat resting my head upon my hand , when the letter was half done , cherishing a general fancy as if Agnes were one of the elements of my natural home .
Parsing [sent. 10696 len. 27]: As if , in the retirement of the house made almost sacred to me by her presence , Dora and I must be happier than anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 10697 len. 33]: As if , in love , joy , sorrow , hope , or disappointment ; in all emotions ; my heart turned naturally there , and found its refuge and best friend .
Parsing [sent. 10698 len. 6]: Of Steerforth I said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 10699 len. 37]: I only told her there had been sad grief at Yarmouth , on account of Emily 's flight ; and that on me it made a double wound , by reason of the circumstances attending it .
Parsing [sent. 10700 len. 25]: I knew how quick she always was to divine the truth , and that she would never be the first to breathe his name .
Parsing [sent. 10701 len. 13]: To this letter , I received an answer by return of post .
Parsing [sent. 10702 len. 14]: As I read it , I seemed to hear Agnes speaking to me .
Parsing [sent. 10703 len. 10]: It was like her cordial voice in my ears .
Parsing [sent. 10704 len. 6]: What can I say more !
Parsing [sent. 10705 len. 16]: While I had been away from home lately , Traddles had called twice or thrice .
Parsing [sent. 10706 len. 51]: Finding Peggotty within , and being informed by Peggotty -LRB- who always volunteered that information to whomsoever would receive it -RRB- , that she was my old nurse , he had established a good-humoured acquaintance with her , and had stayed to have a little chat with her about me .
Parsing [sent. 10707 len. 35]: So Peggotty said ; but I am afraid the chat was all on her own side , and of immoderate length , as she was very difficult indeed to stop , God bless her !
Parsing [sent. 10708 len. 8]: when she had me for her theme .
Parsing [sent. 10709 len. 48]: This reminds me , not only that I expected Traddles on a certain afternoon of his own appointing , which was now come , but that Mrs. Crupp had resigned everything appertaining to her office -LRB- the salary excepted -RRB- until Peggotty should cease to present herself .
Parsing [sent. 10710 len. 49]: Mrs. Crupp , after holding divers conversations respecting Peggotty , in a very high-pitched voice , on the staircase -- with some invisible Familiar it would appear , for corporeally speaking she was quite alone at those times -- addressed a letter to me , developing her views .
Parsing [sent. 10711 len. 63]: Beginning it with that statement of universal application , which fitted every occurrence of her life , namely , that she was a mother herself , she went on to inform me that she had once seen very different days , but that at all periods of her existence she had had a constitutional objection to spies , intruders , and informers .
Parsing [sent. 10712 len. 47]: She named no names , she said ; let them the cap fitted , wear it ; but spies , intruders , and informers , especially in widders ' weeds -LRB- this clause was underlined -RRB- , she had ever accustomed herself to look down upon .
Parsing [sent. 10713 len. 27]: If a gentleman was the victim of spies , intruders , and informers -LRB- but still naming no names -RRB- , that was his own pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 10714 len. 13]: He had a right to please himself ; so let him do .
Parsing [sent. 10715 len. 26]: All that she , Mrs. Crupp , stipulated for , was , that she should not be ` brought in contract ' with such persons .
Parsing [sent. 10716 len. 75]: Therefore she begged to be excused from any further attendance on the top set , until things were as they formerly was , and as they could be wished to be ; and further mentioned that her little book would be found upon the breakfast-table every Saturday morning , when she requested an immediate settlement of the same , with the benevolent view of saving trouble ` and an ill-conwenience ' to all parties .
Parsing [sent. 10717 len. 28]: After this , Mrs. Crupp confined herself to making pitfalls on the stairs , principally with pitchers , and endeavouring to delude Peggotty into breaking her legs .
Parsing [sent. 10718 len. 29]: I found it rather harassing to live in this state of siege , but was too much afraid of Mrs. Crupp to see any way out of it .
Parsing [sent. 10719 len. 29]: ` My dear Copperfield , ' cried Traddles , punctually appearing at my door , in spite of all these obstacles , ` how do you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 10720 len. 30]: ` My dear Traddles , ' said I , ' I am delighted to see you at last , and very sorry I have not been at home before .
Parsing [sent. 10721 len. 25]: But I have been so much engaged -- ' ` Yes , yes , I know , ' said Traddles , ` of course .
Parsing [sent. 10722 len. 9]: Yours lives in London , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 10723 len. 7]: ` What did you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 10724 len. 31]: ` She -- excuse me -- Miss D. , you know , ' said Traddles , colouring in his great delicacy , ` lives in London , I believe ? '
Parsing [sent. 10725 len. 4]: ` Oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 10726 len. 4]: Near London . '
Parsing [sent. 10727 len. 26]: ` Mine , perhaps you recollect , ' said Traddles , with a serious look , ` lives down in Devonshire -- one of ten .
Parsing [sent. 10728 len. 17]: Consequently , I am not so much engaged as you -- in that sense . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10729 len. 18]: I wonder you can bear , ' I returned , ` to see her so seldom . '
Parsing [sent. 10730 len. 4]: ` Hah ! '
Parsing [sent. 10731 len. 5]: said Traddles , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 10732 len. 7]: ` It does seem a wonder .
Parsing [sent. 10733 len. 17]: I suppose it is , Copperfield , because there is no help for it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10734 len. 17]: I suppose so , ' I replied with a smile , and not without a blush .
Parsing [sent. 10735 len. 14]: ` And because you have so much constancy and patience , Traddles . '
Parsing [sent. 10736 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 10737 len. 18]: said Traddles , considering about it , ` do I strike you in that way , Copperfield ?
Parsing [sent. 10738 len. 9]: Really I did n't know that I had .
Parsing [sent. 10739 len. 25]: But she is such an extraordinarily dear girl herself , that it 's possible she may have imparted something of those virtues to me .
Parsing [sent. 10740 len. 14]: Now you mention it , Copperfield , I should n't wonder at all .
Parsing [sent. 10741 len. 18]: I assure you she is always forgetting herself , and taking care of the other nine . '
Parsing [sent. 10742 len. 7]: ` Is she the eldest ? '
Parsing [sent. 10743 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 10744 len. 10]: ` Oh dear , no , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 10745 len. 8]: ` The eldest is a Beauty . '
Parsing [sent. 10746 len. 52]: He saw , I suppose , that I could not help smiling at the simplicity of this reply ; and added , with a smile upon his own ingenuous face : ` Not , of course , but that my Sophy -- pretty name , Copperfield , I always think ? '
Parsing [sent. 10747 len. 5]: ` Very pretty ! '
Parsing [sent. 10748 len. 40]: said I. ` Not , of course , but that Sophy is beautiful too in my eyes , and would be one of the dearest girls that ever was , in anybody 's eyes -LRB- I should think -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 10749 len. 43]: But when I say the eldest is a Beauty , I mean she really is a -- ' he seemed to be describing clouds about himself , with both hands : ` Splendid , you know , ' said Traddles , energetically .
Parsing [sent. 10750 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 10751 len. 20]: said I. ` Oh , I assure you , ' said Traddles , ` something very uncommon , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 10752 len. 39]: Then , you know , being formed for society and admiration , and not being able to enjoy much of it in consequence of their limited means , she naturally gets a little irritable and exacting , sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 10753 len. 8]: Sophy puts her in good humour ! '
Parsing [sent. 10754 len. 7]: ` Is Sophy the youngest ? '
Parsing [sent. 10755 len. 3]: I hazarded .
Parsing [sent. 10756 len. 7]: ` Oh dear , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 10757 len. 7]: said Traddles , stroking his chin .
Parsing [sent. 10758 len. 10]: ` The two youngest are only nine and ten .
Parsing [sent. 10759 len. 5]: Sophy educates 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 10760 len. 8]: ` The second daughter , perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 10761 len. 3]: I hazarded .
Parsing [sent. 10762 len. 7]: ` No , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 10763 len. 6]: ` Sarah 's the second .
Parsing [sent. 10764 len. 12]: Sarah has something the matter with her spine , poor girl .
Parsing [sent. 10765 len. 26]: The malady will wear out by and by , the doctors say , but in the meantime she has to lie down for a twelvemonth .
Parsing [sent. 10766 len. 4]: Sophy nurses her .
Parsing [sent. 10767 len. 6]: Sophy 's the fourth . '
Parsing [sent. 10768 len. 7]: ` Is the mother living ? '
Parsing [sent. 10769 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 10770 len. 13]: ` Oh yes , ' said Traddles , ` she is alive .
Parsing [sent. 10771 len. 34]: She is a very superior woman indeed , but the damp country is not adapted to her constitution , and -- in fact , she has lost the use of her limbs . '
Parsing [sent. 10772 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 10773 len. 11]: said I. ` Very sad , is it not ? '
Parsing [sent. 10774 len. 3]: returned Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 10775 len. 23]: ` But in a merely domestic view it is not so bad as it might be , because Sophy takes her place .
Parsing [sent. 10776 len. 20]: She is quite as much a mother to her mother , as she is to the other nine . '
Parsing [sent. 10777 len. 50]: I felt the greatest admiration for the virtues of this young lady ; and , honestly with the view of doing my best to prevent the good-nature of Traddles from being imposed upon , to the detriment of their joint prospects in life , inquired how Mr. Micawber was ?
Parsing [sent. 10778 len. 16]: ` He is quite well , Copperfield , thank you , ' said Traddles . '
Parsing [sent. 10779 len. 10]: I am not living with him at present . '
Parsing [sent. 10780 len. 4]: ` No ? '
Parsing [sent. 10781 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 10782 len. 45]: You see the truth is , ' said Traddles , in a whisper , ` he had changed his name to Mortimer , in consequence of his temporary embarrassments ; and he do n't come out till after dark -- and then in spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 10783 len. 12]: There was an execution put into our house , for rent .
Parsing [sent. 10784 len. 26]: Mrs. Micawber was in such a dreadful state that I really could n't resist giving my name to that second bill we spoke of here .
Parsing [sent. 10785 len. 29]: You may imagine how delightful it was to my feelings , Copperfield , to see the matter settled with it , and Mrs. Micawber recover her spirits . '
Parsing [sent. 10786 len. 4]: ` Hum ! '
Parsing [sent. 10787 len. 29]: said I. ` Not that her happiness was of long duration , ' pursued Traddles , ` for , unfortunately , within a week another execution came in .
Parsing [sent. 10788 len. 6]: It broke up the establishment .
Parsing [sent. 10789 len. 20]: I have been living in a furnished apartment since then , and the Mortimers have been very private indeed .
Parsing [sent. 10790 len. 36]: I hope you wo n't think it selfish , Copperfield , if I mention that the broker carried off my little round table with the marble top , and Sophy 's flower-pot and stand ? '
Parsing [sent. 10791 len. 7]: ` What a hard thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 10792 len. 4]: I exclaimed indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 10793 len. 23]: ` It was a -- it was a pull , ' said Traddles , with his usual wince at that expression . '
Parsing [sent. 10794 len. 14]: I do n't mention it reproachfully , however , but with a motive .
Parsing [sent. 10795 len. 60]: The fact is , Copperfield , I was unable to repurchase them at the time of their seizure ; in the first place , because the broker , having an idea that I wanted them , ran the price up to an extravagant extent ; and , in the second place , because I -- had n't any money .
Parsing [sent. 10796 len. 53]: Now , I have kept my eye since , upon the broker 's shop , ' said Traddles , with a great enjoyment of his mystery , ` which is up at the top of Tottenham Court Road , and , at last , today I find them put out for sale .
Parsing [sent. 10797 len. 28]: I have only noticed them from over the way , because if the broker saw me , bless you , he 'd ask any price for them !
Parsing [sent. 10798 len. 68]: What has occurred to me , having now the money , is , that perhaps you would n't object to ask that good nurse of yours to come with me to the shop -- I can show it her from round the corner of the next street -- and make the best bargain for them , as if they were for herself , that she can ! '
Parsing [sent. 10799 len. 30]: The delight with which Traddles propounded this plan to me , and the sense he had of its uncommon artfulness , are among the freshest things in my remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 10800 len. 30]: I told him that my old nurse would be delighted to assist him , and that we would all three take the field together , but on one condition .
Parsing [sent. 10801 len. 28]: That condition was , that he should make a solemn resolution to grant no more loans of his name , or anything else , to Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 10802 len. 39]: ` My dear Copperfield , ' said Traddles , ' I have already done so , because I begin to feel that I have not only been inconsiderate , but that I have been positively unjust to Sophy .
Parsing [sent. 10803 len. 28]: My word being passed to myself , there is no longer any apprehension ; but I pledge it to you , too , with the greatest readiness .
Parsing [sent. 10804 len. 9]: That first unlucky obligation , I have paid .
Parsing [sent. 10805 len. 19]: I have no doubt Mr. Micawber would have paid it if he could , but he could not .
Parsing [sent. 10806 len. 18]: One thing I ought to mention , which I like very much in Mr. Micawber , Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 10807 len. 13]: It refers to the second obligation , which is not yet due .
Parsing [sent. 10808 len. 18]: He do n't tell me that it is provided for , but he says it WILL BE .
Parsing [sent. 10809 len. 15]: Now , I think there is something very fair and honest about that ! '
Parsing [sent. 10810 len. 15]: I was unwilling to damp my good friend 's confidence , and therefore assented .
Parsing [sent. 10811 len. 69]: After a little further conversation , we went round to the chandler 's shop , to enlist Peggotty ; Traddles declining to pass the evening with me , both because he endured the liveliest apprehensions that his property would be bought by somebody else before he could re-purchase it , and because it was the evening he always devoted to writing to the dearest girl in the world .
Parsing [sent. 10812 len. 54]: I never shall forget him peeping round the corner of the street in Tottenham Court Road , while Peggotty was bargaining for the precious articles ; or his agitation when she came slowly towards us after vainly offering a price , and was hailed by the relenting broker , and went back again .
Parsing [sent. 10813 len. 25]: The end of the negotiation was , that she bought the property on tolerably easy terms , and Traddles was transported with pleasure . '
Parsing [sent. 10814 len. 29]: I am very much obliged to you , indeed , ' said Traddles , on hearing it was to be sent to where he lived , that night .
Parsing [sent. 10815 len. 21]: ` If I might ask one other favour , I hope you would not think it absurd , Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 10816 len. 7]: I said beforehand , certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 10817 len. 42]: ` Then if you WOULD be good enough , ' said Traddles to Peggotty , ` to get the flower-pot now , I think I should like -LRB- it being Sophy 's , Copperfield -RRB- to carry it home myself ! '
Parsing [sent. 10818 len. 46]: Peggotty was glad to get it for him , and he overwhelmed her with thanks , and went his way up Tottenham Court Road , carrying the flower-pot affectionately in his arms , with one of the most delighted expressions of countenance I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 10819 len. 8]: We then turned back towards my chambers .
Parsing [sent. 10820 len. 45]: As the shops had charms for Peggotty which I never knew them possess in the same degree for anybody else , I sauntered easily along , amused by her staring in at the windows , and waiting for her as often as she chose .
Parsing [sent. 10821 len. 12]: We were thus a good while in getting to the Adelphi .
Parsing [sent. 10822 len. 28]: On our way upstairs , I called her attention to the sudden disappearance of Mrs. Crupp 's pitfalls , and also to the prints of recent footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 10823 len. 30]: We were both very much surprised , coming higher up , to find my outer door standing open -LRB- which I had shut -RRB- and to hear voices inside .
Parsing [sent. 10824 len. 20]: We looked at one another , without knowing what to make of this , and went into the sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 10825 len. 21]: What was my amazement to find , of all people upon earth , my aunt there , and Mr. Dick !
Parsing [sent. 10826 len. 32]: My aunt sitting on a quantity of luggage , with her two birds before her , and her cat on her knee , like a female Robinson Crusoe , drinking tea .
Parsing [sent. 10827 len. 27]: Mr. Dick leaning thoughtfully on a great kite , such as we had often been out together to fly , with more luggage piled about him !
Parsing [sent. 10828 len. 6]: ` My dear aunt ! '
Parsing [sent. 10829 len. 11]: cried I. ` Why , what an unexpected pleasure ! '
Parsing [sent. 10830 len. 54]: We cordially embraced ; and Mr. Dick and I cordially shook hands ; and Mrs. Crupp , who was busy making tea , and could not be too attentive , cordially said she had knowed well as Mr. Copperfull would have his heart in his mouth , when he see his dear relations .
Parsing [sent. 10831 len. 4]: ` Holloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 10832 len. 13]: said my aunt to Peggotty , who quailed before her awful presence .
Parsing [sent. 10833 len. 6]: ` How are YOU ? '
Parsing [sent. 10834 len. 9]: ` You remember my aunt , Peggotty ? '
Parsing [sent. 10835 len. 29]: said I. ` For the love of goodness , child , ' exclaimed my aunt , ` do n't call the woman by that South Sea Island name !
Parsing [sent. 10836 len. 30]: If she married and got rid of it , which was the best thing she could do , why do n't you give her the benefit of the change ?
Parsing [sent. 10837 len. 10]: What 's your name now , -- P ? '
Parsing [sent. 10838 len. 12]: said my aunt , as a compromise for the obnoxious appellation .
Parsing [sent. 10839 len. 13]: ` Barkis , ma'am , ' said Peggotty , with a curtsey .
Parsing [sent. 10840 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 10841 len. 9]: That 's human , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 10842 len. 11]: ` It sounds less as if you wanted a missionary .
Parsing [sent. 10843 len. 6]: How d'ye do , Barkis ?
Parsing [sent. 10844 len. 7]: I hope you 're well ? '
Parsing [sent. 10845 len. 29]: Encouraged by these gracious words , and by my aunt 's extending her hand , Barkis came forward , and took the hand , and curtseyed her acknowledgements .
Parsing [sent. 10846 len. 16]: ` We are older than we were , I see , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 10847 len. 13]: ` We have only met each other once before , you know .
Parsing [sent. 10848 len. 9]: A nice business we made of it then !
Parsing [sent. 10849 len. 9]: Trot , my dear , another cup . '
Parsing [sent. 10850 len. 34]: I handed it dutifully to my aunt , who was in her usual inflexible state of figure ; and ventured a remonstrance with her on the subject of her sitting on a box .
Parsing [sent. 10851 len. 26]: ` Let me draw the sofa here , or the easy-chair , aunt , ' said I. ` Why should you be so uncomfortable ? '
Parsing [sent. 10852 len. 21]: ` Thank you , Trot , ' replied my aunt , ' I prefer to sit upon my property . '
Parsing [sent. 10853 len. 24]: Here my aunt looked hard at Mrs. Crupp , and observed , ` We need n't trouble you to wait , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 10854 len. 18]: ` Shall I put a little more tea in the pot afore I go , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 10855 len. 4]: said Mrs. Crupp .
Parsing [sent. 10856 len. 14]: ` No , I thank you , ma'am , ' replied my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 10857 len. 14]: ` Would you let me fetch another pat of butter , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 10858 len. 4]: said Mrs. Crupp .
Parsing [sent. 10859 len. 12]: ` Or would you be persuaded to try a new-laid hegg ?
Parsing [sent. 10860 len. 7]: or should I brile a rasher ?
Parsing [sent. 10861 len. 16]: Ai n't there nothing I could do for your dear aunt , Mr. Copperfull ? '
Parsing [sent. 10862 len. 11]: ` Nothing , ma'am , ' returned my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 10863 len. 11]: I shall do very well , I thank you . '
Parsing [sent. 10864 len. 65]: Mrs. Crupp , who had been incessantly smiling to express sweet temper , and incessantly holding her head on one side , to express a general feebleness of constitution , and incessantly rubbing her hands , to express a desire to be of service to all deserving objects , gradually smiled herself , one-sided herself , and rubbed herself , out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 10865 len. 4]: ` Dick ! '
Parsing [sent. 10866 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 10867 len. 13]: ` You know what I told you about time-servers and wealth-worshippers ? '
Parsing [sent. 10868 len. 24]: Mr. Dick -- with rather a scared look , as if he had forgotten it -- returned a hasty answer in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 10869 len. 13]: ` Mrs. Crupp is one of them , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 10870 len. 31]: ` Barkis , I 'll trouble you to look after the tea , and let me have another cup , for I do n't fancy that woman 's pouring-out ! '
Parsing [sent. 10871 len. 35]: I knew my aunt sufficiently well to know that she had something of importance on her mind , and that there was far more matter in this arrival than a stranger might have supposed .
Parsing [sent. 10872 len. 41]: I noticed how her eye lighted on me , when she thought my attention otherwise occupied ; and what a curious process of hesitation appeared to be going on within her , while she preserved her outward stiffness and composure .
Parsing [sent. 10873 len. 28]: I began to reflect whether I had done anything to offend her ; and my conscience whispered me that I had not yet told her about Dora .
Parsing [sent. 10874 len. 11]: Could it by any means be that , I wondered !
Parsing [sent. 10875 len. 40]: As I knew she would only speak in her own good time , I sat down near her , and spoke to the birds , and played with the cat , and was as easy as I could be .
Parsing [sent. 10876 len. 51]: But I was very far from being really easy ; and I should still have been so , even if Mr. Dick , leaning over the great kite behind my aunt , had not taken every secret opportunity of shaking his head darkly at me , and pointing at her .
Parsing [sent. 10877 len. 37]: ` Trot , ' said my aunt at last , when she had finished her tea , and carefully smoothed down her dress , and wiped her lips -- ` you need n't go , Barkis !
Parsing [sent. 10878 len. 14]: -- Trot , have you got to be firm and self-reliant ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10879 len. 7]: I hope so , aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 10880 len. 7]: ` What do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 10881 len. 5]: inquired Miss Betsey . '
Parsing [sent. 10882 len. 7]: I think so , aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 10883 len. 34]: ` Then why , my love , ' said my aunt , looking earnestly at me , ` why do you think I prefer to sit upon this property of mine tonight ? '
Parsing [sent. 10884 len. 9]: I shook my head , unable to guess .
Parsing [sent. 10885 len. 15]: ` Because , ' said my aunt , ` it 's all I have .
Parsing [sent. 10886 len. 9]: Because I 'm ruined , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 10887 len. 27]: If the house , and every one of us , had tumbled out into the river together , I could hardly have received a greater shock .
Parsing [sent. 10888 len. 19]: ` Dick knows it , ' said my aunt , laying her hand calmly on my shoulder . '
Parsing [sent. 10889 len. 8]: I am ruined , my dear Trot !
Parsing [sent. 10890 len. 24]: All I have in the world is in this room , except the cottage ; and that I have left Janet to let .
Parsing [sent. 10891 len. 13]: Barkis , I want to get a bed for this gentleman tonight .
Parsing [sent. 10892 len. 14]: To save expense , perhaps you can make up something here for myself .
Parsing [sent. 10893 len. 4]: Anything will do .
Parsing [sent. 10894 len. 6]: It 's only for tonight .
Parsing [sent. 10895 len. 11]: We 'll talk about this , more , tomorrow . '
Parsing [sent. 10896 len. 39]: I was roused from my amazement , and concern for her -- I am sure , for her -- by her falling on my neck , for a moment , and crying that she only grieved for me .
Parsing [sent. 10897 len. 36]: In another moment she suppressed this emotion ; and said with an aspect more triumphant than dejected : ` We must meet reverses boldly , and not suffer them to frighten us , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 10898 len. 9]: We must learn to act the play out .
Parsing [sent. 10899 len. 9]: We must live misfortune down , Trot ! '
Parsing [sent. 10900 len. 56]: Chapter 35 Depression As soon as I could recover my presence of mind , which quite deserted me in the first overpowering shock of my aunt 's intelligence , I proposed to Mr. Dick to come round to the chandler 's shop , and take possession of the bed which Mr. Peggotty had lately vacated .
Parsing [sent. 10901 len. 60]: The chandler 's shop being in Hungerford Market , and Hungerford Market being a very different place in those days , there was a low wooden colonnade before the door -LRB- not very unlike that before the house where the little man and woman used to live , in the old weather-glass -RRB- , which pleased Mr. Dick mightily .
Parsing [sent. 10902 len. 58]: The glory of lodging over this structure would have compensated him , I dare say , for many inconveniences ; but , as there were really few to bear , beyond the compound of flavours I have already mentioned , and perhaps the want of a little more elbow-room , he was perfectly charmed with his accommodation .
Parsing [sent. 10903 len. 55]: Mrs. Crupp had indignantly assured him that there was n't room to swing a cat there ; but , as Mr. Dick justly observed to me , sitting down on the foot of the bed , nursing his leg , ` You know , Trotwood , I do n't want to swing a cat .
Parsing [sent. 10904 len. 7]: I never do swing a cat .
Parsing [sent. 10905 len. 10]: Therefore , what does that signify to ME ! '
Parsing [sent. 10906 len. 25]: I tried to ascertain whether Mr. Dick had any understanding of the causes of this sudden and great change in my aunt 's affairs .
Parsing [sent. 10907 len. 12]: As I might have expected , he had none at all .
Parsing [sent. 10908 len. 41]: The only account he could give of it was , that my aunt had said to him , the day before yesterday , ` Now , Dick , are you really and truly the philosopher I take you for ? '
Parsing [sent. 10909 len. 12]: That then he had said , Yes , he hoped so .
Parsing [sent. 10910 len. 15]: That then my aunt had said , ` Dick , I am ruined . '
Parsing [sent. 10911 len. 12]: That then he had said , ` Oh , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 10912 len. 15]: That then my aunt had praised him highly , which he was glad of .
Parsing [sent. 10913 len. 20]: And that then they had come to me , and had had bottled porter and sandwiches on the road .
Parsing [sent. 10914 len. 106]: Mr. Dick was so very complacent , sitting on the foot of the bed , nursing his leg , and telling me this , with his eyes wide open and a surprised smile , that I am sorry to say I was provoked into explaining to him that ruin meant distress , want , and starvation ; but I was soon bitterly reproved for this harshness , by seeing his face turn pale , and tears course down his lengthened cheeks , while he fixed upon me a look of such unutterable woe , that it might have softened a far harder heart than mine .
Parsing [sent. 10915 len. 62]: I took infinitely greater pains to cheer him up again than I had taken to depress him ; and I soon understood -LRB- as I ought to have known at first -RRB- that he had been so confident , merely because of his faith in the wisest and most wonderful of women , and his unbounded reliance on my intellectual resources .
Parsing [sent. 10916 len. 19]: The latter , I believe , he considered a match for any kind of disaster not absolutely mortal .
Parsing [sent. 10917 len. 9]: ` What can we do , Trotwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 10918 len. 4]: said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 10919 len. 50]: ` There 's the Memorial - ' ` To be sure there is , ' said I. ` But all we can do just now , Mr. Dick , is to keep a cheerful countenance , and not let my aunt see that we are thinking about it . '
Parsing [sent. 10920 len. 44]: He assented to this in the most earnest manner ; and implored me , if I should see him wandering an inch out of the right course , to recall him by some of those superior methods which were always at my command .
Parsing [sent. 10921 len. 22]: But I regret to state that the fright I had given him proved too much for his best attempts at concealment .
Parsing [sent. 10922 len. 32]: All the evening his eyes wandered to my aunt 's face , with an expression of the most dismal apprehension , as if he saw her growing thin on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 10923 len. 39]: He was conscious of this , and put a constraint upon his head ; but his keeping that immovable , and sitting rolling his eyes like a piece of machinery , did not mend the matter at all .
Parsing [sent. 10924 len. 81]: I saw him look at the loaf at supper -LRB- which happened to be a small one -RRB- , as if nothing else stood between us and famine ; and when my aunt insisted on his making his customary repast , I detected him in the act of pocketing fragments of his bread and cheese ; I have no doubt for the purpose of reviving us with those savings , when we should have reached an advanced stage of attenuation .
Parsing [sent. 10925 len. 32]: My aunt , on the other hand , was in a composed frame of mind , which was a lesson to all of us -- to me , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 10926 len. 33]: She was extremely gracious to Peggotty , except when I inadvertently called her by that name ; and , strange as I knew she felt in London , appeared quite at home .
Parsing [sent. 10927 len. 22]: She was to have my bed , and I was to lie in the sitting-room , to keep guard over her .
Parsing [sent. 10928 len. 30]: She made a great point of being so near the river , in case of a conflagration ; and I suppose really did find some satisfaction in that circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 10929 len. 27]: ` Trot , my dear , ' said my aunt , when she saw me making preparations for compounding her usual night-draught , ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 10930 len. 6]: ` Nothing , aunt ? '
Parsing [sent. 10931 len. 7]: ` Not wine , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 10932 len. 3]: Ale . '
Parsing [sent. 10933 len. 9]: ` But there is wine here , aunt .
Parsing [sent. 10934 len. 10]: And you always have it made of wine . '
Parsing [sent. 10935 len. 14]: ` Keep that , in case of sickness , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 10936 len. 10]: ` We must n't use it carelessly , Trot .
Parsing [sent. 10937 len. 4]: Ale for me .
Parsing [sent. 10938 len. 5]: Half a pint . '
Parsing [sent. 10939 len. 10]: I thought Mr. Dick would have fallen , insensible .
Parsing [sent. 10940 len. 14]: My aunt being resolute , I went out and got the ale myself .
Parsing [sent. 10941 len. 22]: As it was growing late , Peggotty and Mr. Dick took that opportunity of repairing to the chandler 's shop together .
Parsing [sent. 10942 len. 30]: I parted from him , poor fellow , at the corner of the street , with his great kite at his back , a very monument of human misery .
Parsing [sent. 10943 len. 23]: My aunt was walking up and down the room when I returned , crimping the borders of her nightcap with her fingers .
Parsing [sent. 10944 len. 14]: I warmed the ale and made the toast on the usual infallible principles .
Parsing [sent. 10945 len. 30]: When it was ready for her , she was ready for it , with her nightcap on , and the skirt of her gown turned back on her knees .
Parsing [sent. 10946 len. 26]: ` My dear , ' said my aunt , after taking a spoonful of it ; ` it 's a great deal better than wine .
Parsing [sent. 10947 len. 6]: Not half so bilious . '
Parsing [sent. 10948 len. 17]: I suppose I looked doubtful , for she added : ` Tut , tut , child .
Parsing [sent. 10949 len. 16]: If nothing worse than Ale happens to us , we are well off . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10950 len. 28]: I should think so myself , aunt , I am sure , ' said I. ` Well , then , why DO N'T you think so ? '
Parsing [sent. 10951 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 10952 len. 14]: ` Because you and I are very different people , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 10953 len. 8]: ` Stuff and nonsense , Trot ! '
Parsing [sent. 10954 len. 4]: replied my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 10955 len. 37]: My aunt went on with a quiet enjoyment , in which there was very little affectation , if any ; drinking the warm ale with a tea-spoon , and soaking her strips of toast in it .
Parsing [sent. 10956 len. 32]: ` Trot , ' said she , ' I do n't care for strange faces in general , but I rather like that Barkis of yours , do you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 10957 len. 15]: ` It 's better than a hundred pounds to hear you say so ! '
Parsing [sent. 10958 len. 36]: said I. ` It 's a most extraordinary world , ' observed my aunt , rubbing her nose ; ` how that woman ever got into it with that name , is unaccountable to me .
Parsing [sent. 10959 len. 23]: It would be much more easy to be born a Jackson , or something of that sort , one would think . '
Parsing [sent. 10960 len. 39]: ` Perhaps she thinks so , too ; it 's not her fault , ' said I. ' I suppose not , ' returned my aunt , rather grudging the admission ; ` but it 's very aggravating .
Parsing [sent. 10961 len. 7]: However , she 's Barkis now .
Parsing [sent. 10962 len. 5]: That 's some comfort .
Parsing [sent. 10963 len. 10]: Barkis is uncommonly fond of you , Trot . '
Parsing [sent. 10964 len. 26]: ` There is nothing she would leave undone to prove it , ' said I. ` Nothing , I believe , ' returned my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 10965 len. 28]: ` Here , the poor fool has been begging and praying about handing over some of her money -- because she has got too much of it .
Parsing [sent. 10966 len. 4]: A simpleton ! '
Parsing [sent. 10967 len. 15]: My aunt 's tears of pleasure were positively trickling down into the warm ale .
Parsing [sent. 10968 len. 18]: ` She 's the most ridiculous creature that ever was born , ' said my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 10969 len. 32]: I knew , from the first moment when I saw her with that poor dear blessed baby of a mother of yours , that she was the most ridiculous of mortals .
Parsing [sent. 10970 len. 9]: But there are good points in Barkis ! '
Parsing [sent. 10971 len. 16]: Affecting to laugh , she got an opportunity of putting her hand to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 10972 len. 15]: Having availed herself of it , she resumed her toast and her discourse together .
Parsing [sent. 10973 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 10974 len. 5]: Mercy upon us ! '
Parsing [sent. 10975 len. 5]: sighed my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 10976 len. 8]: I know all about it , Trot !
Parsing [sent. 10977 len. 14]: Barkis and myself had quite a gossip while you were out with Dick .
Parsing [sent. 10978 len. 6]: I know all about it .
Parsing [sent. 10979 len. 17]: I do n't know where these wretched girls expect to go to , for my part .
Parsing [sent. 10980 len. 33]: I wonder they do n't knock out their brains against -- against mantelpieces , ' said my aunt ; an idea which was probably suggested to her by her contemplation of mine .
Parsing [sent. 10981 len. 5]: ` Poor Emily ! '
Parsing [sent. 10982 len. 18]: said I. ` Oh , do n't talk to me about poor , ' returned my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 10983 len. 15]: ` She should have thought of that , before she caused so much misery !
Parsing [sent. 10984 len. 7]: Give me a kiss , Trot .
Parsing [sent. 10985 len. 9]: I am sorry for your early experience . '
Parsing [sent. 10986 len. 26]: As I bent forward , she put her tumbler on my knee to detain me , and said : ` Oh , Trot , Trot !
Parsing [sent. 10987 len. 8]: And so you fancy yourself in love !
Parsing [sent. 10988 len. 4]: Do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10989 len. 6]: ` Fancy , aunt ! '
Parsing [sent. 10990 len. 11]: I exclaimed , as red as I could be . '
Parsing [sent. 10991 len. 9]: I adore her with my whole soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 10992 len. 6]: ` Dora , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 10993 len. 4]: returned my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 10994 len. 17]: ` And you mean to say the little thing is very fascinating , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 10995 len. 22]: ` My dear aunt , ' I replied , ` no one can form the least idea what she is ! '
Parsing [sent. 10996 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 10997 len. 5]: And not silly ? '
Parsing [sent. 10998 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 10999 len. 6]: ` Silly , aunt ! '
Parsing [sent. 11000 len. 23]: I seriously believe it had never once entered my head for a single moment , to consider whether she was or not .
Parsing [sent. 11001 len. 24]: I resented the idea , of course ; but I was in a manner struck by it , as a new one altogether .
Parsing [sent. 11002 len. 5]: ` Not light-headed ? '
Parsing [sent. 11003 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 11004 len. 6]: ` Light-headed , aunt ! '
Parsing [sent. 11005 len. 22]: I could only repeat this daring speculation with the same kind of feeling with which I had repeated the preceding question .
Parsing [sent. 11006 len. 6]: ` Well , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 11007 len. 5]: said my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 11008 len. 4]: I only ask .
Parsing [sent. 11009 len. 6]: I do n't depreciate her .
Parsing [sent. 11010 len. 4]: Poor little couple !
Parsing [sent. 11011 len. 35]: And so you think you were formed for one another , and are to go through a party-supper-table kind of life , like two pretty pieces of confectionery , do you , Trot ? '
Parsing [sent. 11012 len. 26]: She asked me this so kindly , and with such a gentle air , half playful and half sorrowful , that I was quite touched .
Parsing [sent. 11013 len. 33]: ` We are young and inexperienced , aunt , I know , ' I replied ; ` and I dare say we say and think a good deal that is rather foolish .
Parsing [sent. 11014 len. 11]: But we love one another truly , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 11015 len. 50]: If I thought Dora could ever love anybody else , or cease to love me ; or that I could ever love anybody else , or cease to love her ; I do n't know what I should do - go out of my mind , I think ! '
Parsing [sent. 11016 len. 6]: ` Ah , Trot ! '
Parsing [sent. 11017 len. 20]: said my aunt , shaking her head , and smiling gravely ; ` blind , blind , blind ! '
Parsing [sent. 11018 len. 39]: ` Someone that I know , Trot , ' my aunt pursued , after a pause , ` though of a very pliant disposition , has an earnestness of affection in him that reminds me of poor Baby .
Parsing [sent. 11019 len. 18]: Earnestness is what that Somebody must look for , to sustain him and improve him , Trot .
Parsing [sent. 11020 len. 8]: Deep , downright , faithful earnestness . '
Parsing [sent. 11021 len. 13]: ` If you only knew the earnestness of Dora , aunt ! '
Parsing [sent. 11022 len. 3]: I cried .
Parsing [sent. 11023 len. 6]: ` Oh , Trot ! '
Parsing [sent. 11024 len. 10]: she said again ; ` blind , blind ! '
Parsing [sent. 11025 len. 21]: and without knowing why , I felt a vague unhappy loss or want of something overshadow me like a cloud .
Parsing [sent. 11026 len. 51]: ` However , ' said my aunt , ' I do n't want to put two young creatures out of conceit with themselves , or to make them unhappy ; so , though it is a girl and boy attachment , and girl and boy attachments very often -- mind !
Parsing [sent. 11027 len. 6]: I do n't say always !
Parsing [sent. 11028 len. 24]: -- come to nothing , still we 'll be serious about it , and hope for a prosperous issue one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 11029 len. 12]: There 's time enough for it to come to anything ! '
Parsing [sent. 11030 len. 34]: This was not upon the whole very comforting to a rapturous lover ; but I was glad to have my aunt in my confidence , and I was mindful of her being fatigued .
Parsing [sent. 11031 len. 36]: So I thanked her ardently for this mark of her affection , and for all her other kindnesses towards me ; and after a tender good night , she took her nightcap into my bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 11032 len. 10]: How miserable I was , when I lay down !
Parsing [sent. 11033 len. 139]: How I thought and thought about my being poor , in Mr. Spenlow 's eyes ; about my not being what I thought I was , when I proposed to Dora ; about the chivalrous necessity of telling Dora what my worldly condition was , and releasing her from her engagement if she thought fit ; about how I should contrive to live , during the long term of my articles , when I was earning nothing ; about doing something to assist my aunt , and seeing no way of doing anything ; about coming down to have no money in my pocket , and to wear a shabby coat , and to be able to carry Dora no little presents , and to ride no gallant greys , and to show myself in no agreeable light !
Parsing [sent. 11034 len. 45]: Sordid and selfish as I knew it was , and as I tortured myself by knowing that it was , to let my mind run on my own distress so much , I was so devoted to Dora that I could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 11035 len. 46]: I knew that it was base in me not to think more of my aunt , and less of myself ; but , so far , selfishness was inseparable from Dora , and I could not put Dora on one side for any mortal creature .
Parsing [sent. 11036 len. 9]: How exceedingly miserable I was , that night !
Parsing [sent. 11037 len. 29]: As to sleep , I had dreams of poverty in all sorts of shapes , but I seemed to dream without the previous ceremony of going to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 11038 len. 130]: Now I was ragged , wanting to sell Dora matches , six bundles for a halfpenny ; now I was at the office in a nightgown and boots , remonstrated with by Mr. Spenlow on appearing before the clients in that airy attire ; now I was hungrily picking up the crumbs that fell from old Tiffey 's daily biscuit , regularly eaten when St. Paul 's struck one ; now I was hopelessly endeavouring to get a licence to marry Dora , having nothing but one of Uriah Heep 's gloves to offer in exchange , which the whole Commons rejected ; and still , more or less conscious of my own room , I was always tossing about like a distressed ship in a sea of bed-clothes .
Parsing [sent. 11039 len. 17]: My aunt was restless , too , for I frequently heard her walking to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 11040 len. 51]: Two or , three times in the course of the night , attired in a long flannel wrapper in which she looked seven feet high , she appeared , like a disturbed ghost , in my room , and came to the side of the sofa on which I lay .
Parsing [sent. 11041 len. 51]: On the first occasion I started up in alarm , to learn that she inferred from a particular light in the sky , that Westminster Abbey was on fire ; and to be consulted in reference to the probability of its igniting Buckingham Street , in case the wind changed .
Parsing [sent. 11042 len. 23]: Lying still , after that , I found that she sat down near me , whispering to herself ` Poor boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 11043 len. 29]: And then it made me twenty times more wretched , to know how unselfishly mindful she was of me , and how selfishly mindful I was of myself .
Parsing [sent. 11044 len. 20]: It was difficult to believe that a night so long to me , could be short to anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 11045 len. 52]: This consideration set me thinking and thinking of an imaginary party where people were dancing the hours away , until that became a dream too , and I heard the music incessantly playing one tune , and saw Dora incessantly dancing one dance , without taking the least notice of me .
Parsing [sent. 11046 len. 55]: The man who had been playing the harp all night , was trying in vain to cover it with an ordinary-sized nightcap , when I awoke ; or I should rather say , when I left off trying to go to sleep , and saw the sun shining in through the window at last .
Parsing [sent. 11047 len. 38]: There was an old Roman bath in those days at the bottom of one of the streets out of the Strand -- it may be there still -- in which I have had many a cold plunge .
Parsing [sent. 11048 len. 33]: Dressing myself as quietly as I could , and leaving Peggotty to look after my aunt , I tumbled head foremost into it , and then went for a walk to Hampstead .
Parsing [sent. 11049 len. 53]: I had a hope that this brisk treatment might freshen my wits a little ; and I think it did them good , for I soon came to the conclusion that the first step I ought to take was , to try if my articles could be cancelled and the premium recovered .
Parsing [sent. 11050 len. 52]: I got some breakfast on the Heath , and walked back to Doctors ' Commons , along the watered roads and through a pleasant smell of summer flowers , growing in gardens and carried into town on hucksters ' heads , intent on this first effort to meet our altered circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 11051 len. 37]: I arrived at the office so soon , after all , that I had half an hour 's loitering about the Commons , before old Tiffey , who was always first , appeared with his key .
Parsing [sent. 11052 len. 34]: Then I sat down in my shady corner , looking up at the sunlight on the opposite chimney-pots , and thinking about Dora ; until Mr. Spenlow came in , crisp and curly .
Parsing [sent. 11053 len. 8]: ` How are you , Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 11054 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 11055 len. 5]: ` Fine morning ! '
Parsing [sent. 11056 len. 24]: ` Beautiful morning , sir , ' said I. ` Could I say a word to you before you go into Court ? '
Parsing [sent. 11057 len. 9]: ` By all means , ' said he .
Parsing [sent. 11058 len. 7]: ` Come into my room . '
Parsing [sent. 11059 len. 33]: I followed him into his room , and he began putting on his gown , and touching himself up before a little glass he had , hanging inside a closet door . '
Parsing [sent. 11060 len. 23]: I am sorry to say , ' said I , ` that I have some rather disheartening intelligence from my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 11061 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 11062 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 11063 len. 4]: ` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 11064 len. 7]: Not paralysis , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 11065 len. 15]: ` It has no reference to her health , sir , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 11066 len. 9]: ` She has met with some large losses .
Parsing [sent. 11067 len. 12]: In fact , she has very little left , indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 11068 len. 8]: ` You as-tound me , Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 11069 len. 4]: cried Mr. Spenlow .
Parsing [sent. 11070 len. 5]: I shook my head .
Parsing [sent. 11071 len. 73]: ` Indeed , sir , ' said I , ` her affairs are so changed , that I wished to ask you whether it would be possible -- at a sacrifice on our part of some portion of the premium , of course , ' I put in this , on the spur of the moment , warned by the blank expression of his face -- ` to cancel my articles ? '
Parsing [sent. 11072 len. 12]: What it cost me to make this proposal , nobody knows .
Parsing [sent. 11073 len. 17]: It was like asking , as a favour , to be sentenced to transportation from Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11074 len. 8]: ` To cancel your articles , Copperfield ?
Parsing [sent. 11075 len. 3]: Cancel ? '
Parsing [sent. 11076 len. 30]: I explained with tolerable firmness , that I really did not know where my means of subsistence were to come from , unless I could earn them for myself .
Parsing [sent. 11077 len. 53]: I had no fear for the future , I said -- and I laid great emphasis on that , as if to imply that I should still be decidedly eligible for a son-in-law one of these days -- but , for the present , I was thrown upon my own resources . '
Parsing [sent. 11078 len. 15]: I am extremely sorry to hear this , Copperfield , ' said Mr. Spenlow .
Parsing [sent. 11079 len. 4]: ` Extremely sorry .
Parsing [sent. 11080 len. 12]: It is not usual to cancel articles for any such reason .
Parsing [sent. 11081 len. 9]: It is not a professional course of proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 11082 len. 9]: It is not a convenient precedent at all .
Parsing [sent. 11083 len. 4]: Far from it .
Parsing [sent. 11084 len. 22]: At the same time -- ' ` You are very good , sir , ' I murmured , anticipating a concession .
Parsing [sent. 11085 len. 5]: ` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 11086 len. 10]: Do n't mention it , ' said Mr. Spenlow .
Parsing [sent. 11087 len. 49]: ` At the same time , I was going to say , if it had been my lot to have my hands unfettered -- if I had not a partner -- Mr. Jorkins -- ' My hopes were dashed in a moment , but I made another effort .
Parsing [sent. 11088 len. 30]: ` Do you think , sir , ' said I , ` if I were to mention it to Mr. Jorkins -- ' Mr. Spenlow shook his head discouragingly .
Parsing [sent. 11089 len. 26]: ` Heaven forbid , Copperfield , ' he replied , ` that I should do any man an injustice : still less , Mr. jorkins .
Parsing [sent. 11090 len. 8]: But I know my partner , Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 11091 len. 16]: Mr. jorkins is not a man to respond to a proposition of this peculiar nature .
Parsing [sent. 11092 len. 12]: Mr. jorkins is very difficult to move from the beaten track .
Parsing [sent. 11093 len. 7]: You know what he is ! '
Parsing [sent. 11094 len. 111]: I am sure I knew nothing about him , except that he had originally been alone in the business , and now lived by himself in a house near Montagu Square , which was fearfully in want of painting ; that he came very late of a day , and went away very early ; that he never appeared to be consulted about anything ; and that he had a dingy little black-hole of his own upstairs , where no business was ever done , and where there was a yellow old cartridge-paper pad upon his desk , unsoiled by ink , and reported to be twenty years of age .
Parsing [sent. 11095 len. 14]: ` Would you object to my mentioning it to him , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11096 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 11097 len. 10]: ` By no means , ' said Mr. Spenlow .
Parsing [sent. 11098 len. 12]: ` But I have some experience of Mr. jorkins , Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 11099 len. 19]: I wish it were otherwise , for I should be happy to meet your views in any respect .
Parsing [sent. 11100 len. 24]: I can not have the objection to your mentioning it to Mr. jorkins , Copperfield , if you think it worth while . '
Parsing [sent. 11101 len. 45]: Availing myself of this permission , which was given with a warm shake of the hand , I sat thinking about Dora , and looking at the sunlight stealing from the chimney-pots down the wall of the opposite house , until Mr. jorkins came .
Parsing [sent. 11102 len. 23]: I then went up to Mr. jorkins 's room , and evidently astonished Mr. jorkins very much by making my appearance there .
Parsing [sent. 11103 len. 12]: ` Come in , Mr. Copperfield , ' said Mr. jorkins .
Parsing [sent. 11104 len. 5]: ` Come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 11105 len. 26]: I went in , and sat down ; and stated my case to Mr. jorkins pretty much as I had stated it to Mr. Spenlow .
Parsing [sent. 11106 len. 60]: Mr. Jorkins was not by any means the awful creature one might have expected , but a large , mild , smooth-faced man of sixty , who took so much snuff that there was a tradition in the Commons that he lived principally on that stimulant , having little room in his system for any other article of diet .
Parsing [sent. 11107 len. 13]: ` You have mentioned this to Mr. Spenlow , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 11108 len. 17]: said Mr. jorkins ; when he had heard me , very restlessly , to an end .
Parsing [sent. 11109 len. 15]: I answered Yes , and told him that Mr. Spenlow had introduced his name .
Parsing [sent. 11110 len. 8]: ` He said I should object ? '
Parsing [sent. 11111 len. 4]: asked Mr. jorkins .
Parsing [sent. 11112 len. 14]: I was obliged to admit that Mr. Spenlow had considered it probable . '
Parsing [sent. 11113 len. 23]: I am sorry to say , Mr. Copperfield , I ca n't advance your object , ' said Mr. jorkins , nervously .
Parsing [sent. 11114 len. 25]: ` The fact is -- but I have an appointment at the Bank , if you 'll have the goodness to excuse me . '
Parsing [sent. 11115 len. 38]: With that he rose in a great hurry , and was going out of the room , when I made bold to say that I feared , then , there was no way of arranging the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 11116 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 11117 len. 13]: said Mr. jorkins , stopping at the door to shake his head .
Parsing [sent. 11118 len. 5]: ` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 11119 len. 17]: I object , you know , ' which he said very rapidly , and went out .
Parsing [sent. 11120 len. 44]: ` You must be aware , Mr. Copperfield , ' he added , looking restlessly in at the door again , ` if Mr. Spenlow objects -- ' ` Personally , he does not object , sir , ' said I. ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11121 len. 3]: Personally ! '
Parsing [sent. 11122 len. 10]: repeated Mr. Jorkins , in an impatient manner . '
Parsing [sent. 11123 len. 11]: I assure you there 's an objection , Mr. Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 11124 len. 2]: Hopeless !
Parsing [sent. 11125 len. 12]: What you wish to be done , ca n't be done .
Parsing [sent. 11126 len. 13]: I -- I really have got an appointment at the Bank . '
Parsing [sent. 11127 len. 28]: With that he fairly ran away ; and to the best of my knowledge , it was three days before he showed himself in the Commons again .
Parsing [sent. 11128 len. 50]: Being very anxious to leave no stone unturned , I waited until Mr. Spenlow came in , and then described what had passed ; giving him to understand that I was not hopeless of his being able to soften the adamantine jorkins , if he would undertake the task .
Parsing [sent. 11129 len. 30]: ` Copperfield , ' returned Mr. Spenlow , with a gracious smile , ` you have not known my partner , Mr. jorkins , as long as I have .
Parsing [sent. 11130 len. 17]: Nothing is farther from my thoughts than to attribute any degree of artifice to Mr. jorkins .
Parsing [sent. 11131 len. 15]: But Mr. jorkins has a way of stating his objections which often deceives people .
Parsing [sent. 11132 len. 5]: No , Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 11133 len. 4]: shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 11134 len. 13]: ` Mr. jorkins is not to be moved , believe me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11135 len. 53]: I was completely bewildered between Mr. Spenlow and Mr. jorkins , as to which of them really was the objecting partner ; but I saw with sufficient clearness that there was obduracy somewhere in the firm , and that the recovery of my aunt 's thousand pounds was out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 11136 len. 43]: In a state of despondency , which I remember with anything but satisfaction , for I know it still had too much reference to myself -LRB- though always in connexion with Dora -RRB- , I left the office , and went homeward .
Parsing [sent. 11137 len. 51]: I was trying to familiarize my mind with the worst , and to present to myself the arrangements we should have to make for the future in their sternest aspect , when a hackney-chariot coming after me , and stopping at my very feet , occasioned me to look up .
Parsing [sent. 11138 len. 66]: A fair hand was stretched forth to me from the window ; and the face I had never seen without a feeling of serenity and happiness , from the moment when it first turned back on the old oak staircase with the great broad balustrade , and when I associated its softened beauty with the stained-glass window in the church , was smiling on me .
Parsing [sent. 11139 len. 4]: ` Agnes ! '
Parsing [sent. 11140 len. 4]: I joyfully exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 11141 len. 22]: ` Oh , my dear Agnes , of all people in the world , what a pleasure to see you ! '
Parsing [sent. 11142 len. 7]: ` Is it , indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 11143 len. 9]: she said , in her cordial voice . '
Parsing [sent. 11144 len. 10]: I want to talk to you so much ! '
Parsing [sent. 11145 len. 18]: said I. ` It 's such a lightening of my heart , only to look at you !
Parsing [sent. 11146 len. 22]: If I had had a conjuror 's cap , there is no one I should have wished for but you ! '
Parsing [sent. 11147 len. 4]: ` What ? '
Parsing [sent. 11148 len. 3]: returned Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 11149 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 11150 len. 12]: perhaps Dora first , ' I admitted , with a blush .
Parsing [sent. 11151 len. 15]: ` Certainly , Dora first , I hope , ' said Agnes , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 11152 len. 6]: ` But you next ! '
Parsing [sent. 11153 len. 9]: said I. ` Where are you going ? '
Parsing [sent. 11154 len. 11]: She was going to my rooms to see my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 11155 len. 37]: The day being very fine , she was glad to come out of the chariot , which smelt -LRB- I had my head in it all this time -RRB- like a stable put under a cucumber-frame .
Parsing [sent. 11156 len. 17]: I dismissed the coachman , and she took my arm , and we walked on together .
Parsing [sent. 11157 len. 9]: She was like Hope embodied , to me .
Parsing [sent. 11158 len. 15]: How different I felt in one short minute , having Agnes at my side !
Parsing [sent. 11159 len. 30]: My aunt had written her one of the odd , abrupt notes -- very little longer than a Bank note -- to which her epistolary efforts were usually limited .
Parsing [sent. 11160 len. 40]: She had stated therein that she had fallen into adversity , and was leaving Dover for good , but had quite made up her mind to it , and was so well that nobody need be uncomfortable about her .
Parsing [sent. 11161 len. 43]: Agnes had come to London to see my aunt , between whom and herself there had been a mutual liking these many years : indeed , it dated from the time of my taking up my residence in Mr. Wickfield 's house .
Parsing [sent. 11162 len. 8]: She was not alone , she said .
Parsing [sent. 11163 len. 10]: Her papa was with her -- and Uriah Heep .
Parsing [sent. 11164 len. 15]: ` And now they are partners , ' said I. ` Confound him ! '
Parsing [sent. 11165 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' said Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 11166 len. 19]: ` They have some business here ; and I took advantage of their coming , to come too .
Parsing [sent. 11167 len. 39]: You must not think my visit all friendly and disinterested , Trotwood , for -- I am afraid I may be cruelly prejudiced -- I do not like to let papa go away alone , with him . '
Parsing [sent. 11168 len. 15]: ` Does he exercise the same influence over Mr. Wickfield still , Agnes ? '
Parsing [sent. 11169 len. 5]: Agnes shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 11170 len. 24]: ` There is such a change at home , ' said she , ` that you would scarcely know the dear old house .
Parsing [sent. 11171 len. 7]: They live with us now . '
Parsing [sent. 11172 len. 4]: ` They ? '
Parsing [sent. 11173 len. 9]: said I. ` Mr. Heep and his mother .
Parsing [sent. 11174 len. 18]: He sleeps in your old room , ' said Agnes , looking up into my face . '
Parsing [sent. 11175 len. 23]: I wish I had the ordering of his dreams , ' said I. ` He would n't sleep there long . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11176 len. 20]: I keep my own little room , ' said Agnes , ` where I used to learn my lessons .
Parsing [sent. 11177 len. 5]: How the time goes !
Parsing [sent. 11178 len. 3]: You remember ?
Parsing [sent. 11179 len. 11]: The little panelled room that opens from the drawing-room ? '
Parsing [sent. 11180 len. 5]: ` Remember , Agnes ?
Parsing [sent. 11181 len. 29]: When I saw you , for the first time , coming out at the door , with your quaint little basket of keys hanging at your side ? '
Parsing [sent. 11182 len. 14]: ` It is just the same , ' said Agnes , smiling . '
Parsing [sent. 11183 len. 10]: I am glad you think of it so pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 11184 len. 6]: We were very happy . '
Parsing [sent. 11185 len. 30]: ` We were , indeed , ' said I. ' I keep that room to myself still ; but I can not always desert Mrs. Heep , you know .
Parsing [sent. 11186 len. 26]: And so , ' said Agnes , quietly , ' I feel obliged to bear her company , when I might prefer to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 11187 len. 11]: But I have no other reason to complain of her .
Parsing [sent. 11188 len. 22]: If she tires me , sometimes , by her praises of her son , it is only natural in a mother .
Parsing [sent. 11189 len. 10]: He is a very good son to her . '
Parsing [sent. 11190 len. 21]: I looked at Agnes when she said these words , without detecting in her any consciousness of Uriah 's design .
Parsing [sent. 11191 len. 23]: Her mild but earnest eyes met mine with their own beautiful frankness , and there was no change in her gentle face .
Parsing [sent. 11192 len. 62]: ` The chief evil of their presence in the house , ' said Agnes , ` is that I can not be as near papa as I could wish -- Uriah Heep being so much between us -- and can not watch over him , if that is not too bold a thing to say , as closely as I would .
Parsing [sent. 11193 len. 25]: But if any fraud or treachery is practising against him , I hope that simple love and truth will be strong in the end .
Parsing [sent. 11194 len. 22]: I hope that real love and truth are stronger in the end than any evil or misfortune in the world . '
Parsing [sent. 11195 len. 73]: A certain bright smile , which I never saw on any other face , died away , even while I thought how good it was , and how familiar it had once been to me ; and she asked me , with a quick change of expression -LRB- we were drawing very near my street -RRB- , if I knew how the reverse in my aunt 's circumstances had been brought about .
Parsing [sent. 11196 len. 27]: On my replying no , she had not told me yet , Agnes became thoughtful , and I fancied I felt her arm tremble in mine .
Parsing [sent. 11197 len. 13]: We found my aunt alone , in a state of some excitement .
Parsing [sent. 11198 len. 71]: A difference of opinion had arisen between herself and Mrs. Crupp , on an abstract question -LRB- the propriety of chambers being inhabited by the gentler sex -RRB- ; and my aunt , utterly indifferent to spasms on the part of Mrs. Crupp , had cut the dispute short , by informing that lady that she smelt of my brandy , and that she would trouble her to walk out .
Parsing [sent. 11199 len. 36]: Both of these expressions Mrs. Crupp considered actionable , and had expressed her intention of bringing before a ` British Judy ' -- meaning , it was supposed , the bulwark of our national liberties .
Parsing [sent. 11200 len. 53]: My aunt , however , having had time to cool , while Peggotty was out showing Mr. Dick the soldiers at the Horse Guards -- and being , besides , greatly pleased to see Agnes -- rather plumed herself on the affair than otherwise , and received us with unimpaired good humour .
Parsing [sent. 11201 len. 70]: When Agnes laid her bonnet on the table , and sat down beside her , I could not but think , looking on her mild eyes and her radiant forehead , how natural it seemed to have her there ; how trustfully , although she was so young and inexperienced , my aunt confided in her ; how strong she was , indeed , in simple love and truth .
Parsing [sent. 11202 len. 23]: We began to talk about my aunt 's losses , and I told them what I had tried to do that morning .
Parsing [sent. 11203 len. 17]: ` Which was injudicious , Trot , ' said my aunt , ` but well meant .
Parsing [sent. 11204 len. 27]: You are a generous boy -- I suppose I must say , young man , now -- and I am proud of you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 11205 len. 6]: So far , so good .
Parsing [sent. 11206 len. 25]: Now , Trot and Agnes , let us look the case of Betsey Trotwood in the face , and see how it stands . '
Parsing [sent. 11207 len. 15]: I observed Agnes turn pale , as she looked very attentively at my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 11208 len. 13]: My aunt , patting her cat , looked very attentively at Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 11209 len. 20]: ` Betsey Trotwood , ' said my aunt , who had always kept her money matters to herself . '
Parsing [sent. 11210 len. 21]: - I do n't mean your sister , Trot , my dear , but myself -- had a certain property .
Parsing [sent. 11211 len. 12]: It do n't matter how much ; enough to live on .
Parsing [sent. 11212 len. 14]: More ; for she had saved a little , and added to it .
Parsing [sent. 11213 len. 27]: Betsey funded her property for some time , and then , by the advice of her man of business , laid it out on landed security .
Parsing [sent. 11214 len. 17]: That did very well , and returned very good interest , till Betsey was paid off .
Parsing [sent. 11215 len. 12]: I am talking of Betsey as if she was a man-of-war .
Parsing [sent. 11216 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 11217 len. 14]: Then , Betsey had to look about her , for a new investment .
Parsing [sent. 11218 len. 56]: She thought she was wiser , now , than her man of business , who was not such a good man of business by this time , as he used to be -- I am alluding to your father , Agnes -- and she took it into her head to lay it out for herself .
Parsing [sent. 11219 len. 28]: So she took her pigs , ' said my aunt , ` to a foreign market ; and a very bad market it turned out to be .
Parsing [sent. 11220 len. 70]: First , she lost in the mining way , and then she lost in the diving way -- fishing up treasure , or some such Tom Tiddler nonsense , ' explained my aunt , rubbing her nose ; ` and then she lost in the mining way again , and , last of all , to set the thing entirely to rights , she lost in the banking way .
Parsing [sent. 11221 len. 87]: I do n't know what the Bank shares were worth for a little while , ' said my aunt ; ` cent per cent was the lowest of it , I believe ; but the Bank was at the other end of the world , and tumbled into space , for what I know ; anyhow , it fell to pieces , and never will and never can pay sixpence ; and Betsey 's sixpences were all there , and there 's an end of them .
Parsing [sent. 11222 len. 7]: Least said , soonest mended ! '
Parsing [sent. 11223 len. 25]: My aunt concluded this philosophical summary , by fixing her eyes with a kind of triumph on Agnes , whose colour was gradually returning .
Parsing [sent. 11224 len. 12]: ` Dear Miss Trotwood , is that all the history ? '
Parsing [sent. 11225 len. 4]: said Agnes . '
Parsing [sent. 11226 len. 13]: I hope it 's enough , child , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 11227 len. 21]: ` If there had been more money to lose , it would n't have been all , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 11228 len. 21]: Betsey would have contrived to throw that after the rest , and make another chapter , I have little doubt .
Parsing [sent. 11229 len. 15]: But there was no more money , and there 's no more story . '
Parsing [sent. 11230 len. 9]: Agnes had listened at first with suspended breath .
Parsing [sent. 11231 len. 13]: Her colour still came and went , but she breathed more freely .
Parsing [sent. 11232 len. 6]: I thought I knew why .
Parsing [sent. 11233 len. 23]: I thought she had had some fear that her unhappy father might be in some way to blame for what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 11234 len. 11]: My aunt took her hand in hers , and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 11235 len. 6]: ` Is that all ? '
Parsing [sent. 11236 len. 4]: repeated my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 11237 len. 20]: ` Why , yes , that 's all , except , `` And she lived happy ever afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 11238 len. 14]: Perhaps I may add that of Betsey yet , one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 11239 len. 10]: Now , Agnes , you have a wise head .
Parsing [sent. 11240 len. 36]: So have you , Trot , in some things , though I ca n't compliment you always ' ; and here my aunt shook her own at me , with an energy peculiar to herself .
Parsing [sent. 11241 len. 7]: ` What 's to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 11242 len. 19]: Here 's the cottage , taking one time with another , will produce say seventy pounds a year .
Parsing [sent. 11243 len. 11]: I think we may safely put it down at that .
Parsing [sent. 11244 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 11245 len. 48]: -- That 's all we 've got , ' said my aunt ; with whom it was an idiosyncrasy , as it is with some horses , to stop very short when she appeared to be in a fair way of going on for a long while .
Parsing [sent. 11246 len. 17]: ` Then , ' said my aunt , after a rest , ` there 's Dick .
Parsing [sent. 11247 len. 18]: He 's good for a hundred a-year , but of course that must be expended on himself .
Parsing [sent. 11248 len. 31]: I would sooner send him away , though I know I am the only person who appreciates him , than have him , and not spend his money on himself .
Parsing [sent. 11249 len. 12]: How can Trot and I do best , upon our means ?
Parsing [sent. 11250 len. 9]: What do you say , Agnes ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11251 len. 17]: I say , aunt , ' I interposed , ` that I must do something ! '
Parsing [sent. 11252 len. 11]: ` Go for a soldier , do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 11253 len. 12]: returned my aunt , alarmed ; ` or go to sea ?
Parsing [sent. 11254 len. 7]: I wo n't hear of it .
Parsing [sent. 11255 len. 7]: You are to be a proctor .
Parsing [sent. 11256 len. 22]: We 're not going to have any knockings on the head in THIS family , if you please , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 11257 len. 33]: I was about to explain that I was not desirous of introducing that mode of provision into the family , when Agnes inquired if my rooms were held for any long term ?
Parsing [sent. 11258 len. 15]: ` You come to the point , my dear , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 11259 len. 29]: ` They are not to be got rid of , for six months at least , unless they could be underlet , and that I do n't believe .
Parsing [sent. 11260 len. 6]: The last man died here .
Parsing [sent. 11261 len. 21]: Five people out of six would die -- of course -- of that woman in nankeen with the flannel petticoat .
Parsing [sent. 11262 len. 37]: I have a little ready money ; and I agree with you , the best thing we can do , is , to live the term out here , and get a bedroom hard by . '
Parsing [sent. 11263 len. 63]: I thought it my duty to hint at the discomfort my aunt would sustain , from living in a continual state of guerilla warfare with Mrs. Crupp ; but she disposed of that objection summarily by declaring that , on the first demonstration of hostilities , she was prepared to astonish Mrs. Crupp for the whole remainder of her natural life . '
Parsing [sent. 11264 len. 32]: I have been thinking , Trotwood , ' said Agnes , diffidently , ` that if you had time -- ' ' I have a good deal of time , Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 11265 len. 19]: I am always disengaged after four or five o'clock , and I have time early in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 11266 len. 49]: In one way and another , ' said I , conscious of reddening a little as I thought of the hours and hours I had devoted to fagging about town , and to and fro upon the Norwood Road , ' I have abundance of time . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11267 len. 43]: I know you would not mind , ' said Agnes , coming to me , and speaking in a low voice , so full of sweet and hopeful consideration that I hear it now , ` the duties of a secretary . '
Parsing [sent. 11268 len. 8]: ` Mind , my dear Agnes ? '
Parsing [sent. 11269 len. 41]: ` Because , ' continued Agnes , ` Doctor Strong has acted on his intention of retiring , and has come to live in London ; and he asked papa , I know , if he could recommend him one .
Parsing [sent. 11270 len. 20]: Do n't you think he would rather have his favourite old pupil near him , than anybody else ? '
Parsing [sent. 11271 len. 5]: ` Dear Agnes ! '
Parsing [sent. 11272 len. 10]: said I. ` What should I do without you !
Parsing [sent. 11273 len. 7]: You are always my good angel .
Parsing [sent. 11274 len. 5]: I told you so .
Parsing [sent. 11275 len. 11]: I never think of you in any other light . '
Parsing [sent. 11276 len. 59]: Agnes answered with her pleasant laugh , that one good Angel -LRB- meaning Dora -RRB- was enough ; and went on to remind me that the Doctor had been used to occupy himself in his study , early in the morning , and in the evening -- and that probably my leisure would suit his requirements very well .
Parsing [sent. 11277 len. 65]: I was scarcely more delighted with the prospect of earning my own bread , than with the hope of earning it under my old master ; in short , acting on the advice of Agnes , I sat down and wrote a letter to the Doctor , stating my object , and appointing to call on him next day at ten in the forenoon .
Parsing [sent. 11278 len. 31]: This I addressed to Highgate -- for in that place , so memorable to me , he lived -- and went and posted , myself , without losing a minute .
Parsing [sent. 11279 len. 17]: Wherever Agnes was , some agreeable token of her noiseless presence seemed inseparable from the place .
Parsing [sent. 11280 len. 68]: When I came back , I found my aunt 's birds hanging , just as they had hung so long in the parlour window of the cottage ; and my easy-chair imitating my aunt 's much easier chair in its position at the open window ; and even the round green fan , which my aunt had brought away with her , screwed on to the window-sill .
Parsing [sent. 11281 len. 70]: I knew who had done all this , by its seeming to have quietly done itself ; and I should have known in a moment who had arranged my neglected books in the old order of my school days , even if I had supposed Agnes to be miles away , instead of seeing her busy with them , and smiling at the disorder into which they had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 11282 len. 54]: My aunt was quite gracious on the subject of the Thames -LRB- it really did look very well with the sun upon it , though not like the sea before the cottage -RRB- , but she could not relent towards the London smoke , which , she said , ` peppered everything ' .
Parsing [sent. 11283 len. 69]: A complete revolution , in which Peggotty bore a prominent part , was being effected in every corner of my rooms , in regard of this pepper ; and I was looking on , thinking how little even Peggotty seemed to do with a good deal of bustle , and how much Agnes did without any bustle at all , when a knock came at the door . '
Parsing [sent. 11284 len. 15]: I think , ' said Agnes , turning pale , ` it 's papa .
Parsing [sent. 11285 len. 9]: He promised me that he would come . '
Parsing [sent. 11286 len. 17]: I opened the door , and admitted , not only Mr. Wickfield , but Uriah Heep .
Parsing [sent. 11287 len. 10]: I had not seen Mr. Wickfield for some time .
Parsing [sent. 11288 len. 24]: I was prepared for a great change in him , after what I had heard from Agnes , but his appearance shocked me .
Parsing [sent. 11289 len. 66]: It was not that he looked many years older , though still dressed with the old scrupulous cleanliness ; or that there was an unwholesome ruddiness upon his face ; or that his eyes were full and bloodshot ; or that there was a nervous trembling in his hand , the cause of which I knew , and had for some years seen at work .
Parsing [sent. 11290 len. 61]: It was not that he had lost his good looks , or his old bearing of a gentleman -- for that he had not -- but the thing that struck me most , was , that with the evidences of his native superiority still upon him , he should submit himself to that crawling impersonation of meanness , Uriah Heep .
Parsing [sent. 11291 len. 35]: The reversal of the two natures , in their relative positions , Uriah 's of power and Mr. Wickfield 's of dependence , was a sight more painful to me than I can express .
Parsing [sent. 11292 len. 23]: If I had seen an Ape taking command of a Man , I should hardly have thought it a more degrading spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 11293 len. 11]: He appeared to be only too conscious of it himself .
Parsing [sent. 11294 len. 21]: When he came in , he stood still ; and with his head bowed , as if he felt it .
Parsing [sent. 11295 len. 17]: This was only for a moment ; for Agnes softly said to him , ` Papa !
Parsing [sent. 11296 len. 19]: Here is Miss Trotwood -- and Trotwood , whom you have not seen for a long while ! '
Parsing [sent. 11297 len. 21]: and then he approached , and constrainedly gave my aunt his hand , and shook hands more cordially with me .
Parsing [sent. 11298 len. 22]: In the moment 's pause I speak of , I saw Uriah 's countenance form itself into a most ill-favoured smile .
Parsing [sent. 11299 len. 14]: Agnes saw it too , I think , for she shrank from him .
Parsing [sent. 11300 len. 26]: What my aunt saw , or did not see , I defy the science of physiognomy to have made out , without her own consent .
Parsing [sent. 11301 len. 15]: I believe there never was anybody with such an imperturbable countenance when she chose .
Parsing [sent. 11302 len. 31]: Her face might have been a dead-wall on the occasion in question , for any light it threw upon her thoughts ; until she broke silence with her usual abruptness .
Parsing [sent. 11303 len. 6]: ` Well , Wickfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 11304 len. 16]: said my aunt ; and he looked up at her for the first time . '
Parsing [sent. 11305 len. 36]: I have been telling your daughter how well I have been disposing of my money for myself , because I could n't trust it to you , as you were growing rusty in business matters .
Parsing [sent. 11306 len. 17]: We have been taking counsel together , and getting on very well , all things considered .
Parsing [sent. 11307 len. 12]: Agnes is worth the whole firm , in my opinion . '
Parsing [sent. 11308 len. 41]: ` If I may umbly make the remark , ' said Uriah Heep , with a writhe , ' I fully agree with Miss Betsey Trotwood , and should be only too appy if Miss Agnes was a partner . '
Parsing [sent. 11309 len. 27]: ` You 're a partner yourself , you know , ' returned my aunt , ` and that 's about enough for you , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 11310 len. 9]: How do you find yourself , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11311 len. 43]: In acknowledgement of this question , addressed to him with extraordinary curtness , Mr. Heep , uncomfortably clutching the blue bag he carried , replied that he was pretty well , he thanked my aunt , and hoped she was the same .
Parsing [sent. 11312 len. 18]: ` And you , Master -- I should say , Mister Copperfield , ' pursued Uriah . '
Parsing [sent. 11313 len. 7]: I hope I see you well !
Parsing [sent. 11314 len. 16]: I am rejoiced to see you , Mister Copperfield , even under present circumstances . '
Parsing [sent. 11315 len. 13]: I believed that ; for he seemed to relish them very much .
Parsing [sent. 11316 len. 59]: ` Present circumstances is not what your friends would wish for you , Mister Copperfield , but it is n't money makes the man : it 's -- I am really unequal with my umble powers to express what it is , ' said Uriah , with a fawning jerk , ` but it is n't money ! '
Parsing [sent. 11317 len. 42]: Here he shook hands with me : not in the common way , but standing at a good distance from me , and lifting my hand up and down like a pump handle , that he was a little afraid of .
Parsing [sent. 11318 len. 21]: ` And how do you think we are looking , Master Copperfield , -- I should say , Mister ? '
Parsing [sent. 11319 len. 3]: fawned Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 11320 len. 11]: ` Do n't you find Mr. Wickfield blooming , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 11321 len. 47]: Years do n't tell much in our firm , Master Copperfield , except in raising up the umble , namely , mother and self -- and in developing , ' he added , as an afterthought , ` the beautiful , namely , Miss Agnes . '
Parsing [sent. 11322 len. 31]: He jerked himself about , after this compliment , in such an intolerable manner , that my aunt , who had sat looking straight at him , lost all patience .
Parsing [sent. 11323 len. 7]: ` Deuce take the man ! '
Parsing [sent. 11324 len. 12]: said my aunt , sternly , ` what 's he about ?
Parsing [sent. 11325 len. 9]: Do n't be galvanic , sir ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 11326 len. 21]: I ask your pardon , Miss Trotwood , ' returned Uriah ; ` I 'm aware you 're nervous . '
Parsing [sent. 11327 len. 9]: ` Go along with you , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 11328 len. 8]: said my aunt , anything but appeased .
Parsing [sent. 11329 len. 8]: ` Do n't presume to say so !
Parsing [sent. 11330 len. 7]: I am nothing of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 11331 len. 13]: If you 're an eel , sir , conduct yourself like one .
Parsing [sent. 11332 len. 12]: If you 're a man , control your limbs , sir !
Parsing [sent. 11333 len. 4]: Good God ! '
Parsing [sent. 11334 len. 24]: said my aunt , with great indignation , ' I am not going to be serpentined and corkscrewed out of my senses ! '
Parsing [sent. 11335 len. 51]: Mr. Heep was rather abashed , as most people might have been , by this explosion ; which derived great additional force from the indignant manner in which my aunt afterwards moved in her chair , and shook her head as if she were making snaps or bounces at him .
Parsing [sent. 11336 len. 80]: But he said to me aside in a meek voice : ' I am well aware , Master Copperfield , that Miss Trotwood , though an excellent lady , has a quick temper -LRB- indeed I think I had the pleasure of knowing her , when I was a numble clerk , before you did , Master Copperfield -RRB- , and it 's only natural , I am sure , that it should be made quicker by present circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 11337 len. 11]: The wonder is , that it is n't much worse !
Parsing [sent. 11338 len. 34]: I only called to say that if there was anything we could do , in present circumstances , mother or self , or Wickfield and Heep , -- we should be really glad .
Parsing [sent. 11339 len. 7]: I may go so far ? '
Parsing [sent. 11340 len. 11]: said Uriah , with a sickly smile at his partner .
Parsing [sent. 11341 len. 24]: ` Uriah Heep , ' said Mr. Wickfield , in a monotonous forced way , ` is active in the business , Trotwood .
Parsing [sent. 11342 len. 9]: What he says , I quite concur in .
Parsing [sent. 11343 len. 10]: You know I had an old interest in you .
Parsing [sent. 11344 len. 13]: Apart from that , what Uriah says I quite concur in ! '
Parsing [sent. 11345 len. 39]: ` Oh , what a reward it is , ' said Uriah , drawing up one leg , at the risk of bringing down upon himself another visitation from my aunt , ` to be so trusted in !
Parsing [sent. 11346 len. 22]: But I hope I am able to do something to relieve him from the fatigues of business , Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 11347 len. 21]: ` Uriah Heep is a great relief to me , ' said Mr. Wickfield , in the same dull voice .
Parsing [sent. 11348 len. 18]: ` It 's a load off my mind , Trotwood , to have such a partner . '
Parsing [sent. 11349 len. 32]: The red fox made him say all this , I knew , to exhibit him to me in the light he had indicated on the night when he poisoned my rest .
Parsing [sent. 11350 len. 18]: I saw the same ill-favoured smile upon his face again , and saw how he watched me .
Parsing [sent. 11351 len. 9]: ` You are not going , papa ? '
Parsing [sent. 11352 len. 5]: said Agnes , anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 11353 len. 12]: ` Will you not walk back with Trotwood and me ? '
Parsing [sent. 11354 len. 22]: He would have looked to Uriah , I believe , before replying , if that worthy had not anticipated him . '
Parsing [sent. 11355 len. 26]: I am bespoke myself , ' said Uriah , ` on business ; otherwise I should have been appy to have kept with my friends .
Parsing [sent. 11356 len. 10]: But I leave my partner to represent the firm .
Parsing [sent. 11357 len. 6]: Miss Agnes , ever yours !
Parsing [sent. 11358 len. 19]: I wish you good-day , Master Copperfield , and leave my umble respects for Miss Betsey Trotwood . '
Parsing [sent. 11359 len. 20]: With those words , he retired , kissing his great hand , and leering at us like a mask .
Parsing [sent. 11360 len. 17]: We sat there , talking about our pleasant old Canterbury days , an hour or two .
Parsing [sent. 11361 len. 30]: Mr. Wickfield , left to Agnes , soon became more like his former self ; though there was a settled depression upon him , which he never shook off .
Parsing [sent. 11362 len. 32]: For all that , he brightened ; and had an evident pleasure in hearing us recall the little incidents of our old life , many of which he remembered very well .
Parsing [sent. 11363 len. 27]: He said it was like those times , to be alone with Agnes and me again ; and he wished to Heaven they had never changed .
Parsing [sent. 11364 len. 32]: I am sure there was an influence in the placid face of Agnes , and in the very touch of her hand upon his arm , that did wonders for him .
Parsing [sent. 11365 len. 40]: My aunt -LRB- who was busy nearly all this while with Peggotty , in the inner room -RRB- would not accompany us to the place where they were staying , but insisted on my going ; and I went .
Parsing [sent. 11366 len. 4]: We dined together .
Parsing [sent. 11367 len. 18]: After dinner , Agnes sat beside him , as of old , and poured out his wine .
Parsing [sent. 11368 len. 30]: He took what she gave him , and no more -- like a child -- and we all three sat together at a window as the evening gathered in .
Parsing [sent. 11369 len. 49]: When it was almost dark , he lay down on a sofa , Agnes pillowing his head and bending over him a little while ; and when she came back to the window , it was not so dark but I could see tears glittering in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 11370 len. 47]: I pray Heaven that I never may forget the dear girl in her love and truth , at that time of my life ; for if I should , I must be drawing near the end , and then I would desire to remember her best !
Parsing [sent. 11371 len. 74]: She filled my heart with such good resolutions , strengthened my weakness so , by her example , so directed -- I know not how , she was too modest and gentle to advise me in many words -- the wandering ardour and unsettled purpose within me , that all the little good I have done , and all the harm I have forborne , I solemnly believe I may refer to her .
Parsing [sent. 11372 len. 53]: And how she spoke to me of Dora , sitting at the window in the dark ; listened to my praises of her ; praised again ; and round the little fairy-figure shed some glimpses of her own pure light , that made it yet more precious and more innocent to me !
Parsing [sent. 11373 len. 21]: Oh , Agnes , sister of my boyhood , if I had known then , what I knew long afterwards !
Parsing [sent. 11374 len. 51]: -- There was a beggar in the street , when I went down ; and as I turned my head towards the window , thinking of her calm seraphic eyes , he made me start by muttering , as if he were an echo of the morning : ` Blind !
Parsing [sent. 11375 len. 2]: Blind !
Parsing [sent. 11376 len. 3]: Blind ! '
Parsing [sent. 11377 len. 22]: Chapter 36 Enthusiasm I began the next day with another dive into the Roman bath , and then started for Highgate .
Parsing [sent. 11378 len. 6]: I was not dispirited now .
Parsing [sent. 11379 len. 17]: I was not afraid of the shabby coat , and had no yearnings after gallant greys .
Parsing [sent. 11380 len. 12]: My whole manner of thinking of our late misfortune was changed .
Parsing [sent. 11381 len. 30]: What I had to do , was , to show my aunt that her past goodness to me had not been thrown away on an insensible , ungrateful object .
Parsing [sent. 11382 len. 31]: What I had to do , was , to turn the painful discipline of my younger days to account , by going to work with a resolute and steady heart .
Parsing [sent. 11383 len. 40]: What I had to do , was , to take my woodman 's axe in my hand , and clear my own way through the forest of difficulty , by cutting down the trees until I came to Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11384 len. 18]: And I went on at a mighty rate , as if it could be done by walking .
Parsing [sent. 11385 len. 42]: When I found myself on the familiar Highgate road , pursuing such a different errand from that old one of pleasure , with which it was associated , it seemed as if a complete change had come on my whole life .
Parsing [sent. 11386 len. 7]: But that did not discourage me .
Parsing [sent. 11387 len. 12]: With the new life , came new purpose , new intention .
Parsing [sent. 11388 len. 9]: Great was the labour ; priceless the reward .
Parsing [sent. 11389 len. 11]: Dora was the reward , and Dora must be won .
Parsing [sent. 11390 len. 21]: I got into such a transport , that I felt quite sorry my coat was not a little shabby already .
Parsing [sent. 11391 len. 22]: I wanted to be cutting at those trees in the forest of difficulty , under circumstances that should prove my strength .
Parsing [sent. 11392 len. 47]: I had a good mind to ask an old man , in wire spectacles , who was breaking stones upon the road , to lend me his hammer for a little while , and let me begin to beat a path to Dora out of granite .
Parsing [sent. 11393 len. 31]: I stimulated myself into such a heat , and got so out of breath , that I felt as if I had been earning I do n't know how much .
Parsing [sent. 11394 len. 31]: In this state , I went into a cottage that I saw was to let , and examined it narrowly , -- for I felt it necessary to be practical .
Parsing [sent. 11395 len. 39]: It would do for me and Dora admirably : with a little front garden for Jip to run about in , and bark at the tradespeople through the railings , and a capital room upstairs for my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 11396 len. 56]: I came out again , hotter and faster than ever , and dashed up to Highgate , at such a rate that I was there an hour too early ; and , though I had not been , should have been obliged to stroll about to cool myself , before I was at all presentable .
Parsing [sent. 11397 len. 22]: My first care , after putting myself under this necessary course of preparation , was to find the Doctor 's house .
Parsing [sent. 11398 len. 24]: It was not in that part of Highgate where Mrs. Steerforth lived , but quite on the opposite side of the little town .
Parsing [sent. 11399 len. 37]: When I had made this discovery , I went back , in an attraction I could not resist , to a lane by Mrs. Steerforth 's , and looked over the corner of the garden wall .
Parsing [sent. 11400 len. 7]: His room was shut up close .
Parsing [sent. 11401 len. 35]: The conservatory doors were standing open , and Rosa Dartle was walking , bareheaded , with a quick , impetuous step , up and down a gravel walk on one side of the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 11402 len. 32]: She gave me the idea of some fierce thing , that was dragging the length of its chain to and fro upon a beaten track , and wearing its heart out .
Parsing [sent. 11403 len. 35]: I came softly away from my place of observation , and avoiding that part of the neighbourhood , and wishing I had not gone near it , strolled about until it was ten o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 11404 len. 27]: The church with the slender spire , that stands on the top of the hill now , was not there then to tell me the time .
Parsing [sent. 11405 len. 35]: An old red-brick mansion , used as a school , was in its place ; and a fine old house it must have been to go to school at , as I recollect it .
Parsing [sent. 11406 len. 71]: When I approached the Doctor 's cottage -- a pretty old place , on which he seemed to have expended some money , if I might judge from the embellishments and repairs that had the look of being just completed -- I saw him walking in the garden at the side , gaiters and all , as if he had never left off walking since the days of my pupilage .
Parsing [sent. 11407 len. 57]: He had his old companions about him , too ; for there were plenty of high trees in the neighbourhood , and two or three rooks were on the grass , looking after him , as if they had been written to about him by the Canterbury rooks , and were observing him closely in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 11408 len. 36]: Knowing the utter hopelessness of attracting his attention from that distance , I made bold to open the gate , and walk after him , so as to meet him when he should turn round .
Parsing [sent. 11409 len. 44]: When he did , and came towards me , he looked at me thoughtfully for a few moments , evidently without thinking about me at all ; and then his benevolent face expressed extraordinary pleasure , and he took me by both hands .
Parsing [sent. 11410 len. 18]: ` Why , my dear Copperfield , ' said the Doctor , ` you are a man !
Parsing [sent. 11411 len. 5]: How do you do ?
Parsing [sent. 11412 len. 7]: I am delighted to see you .
Parsing [sent. 11413 len. 11]: My dear Copperfield , how very much you have improved !
Parsing [sent. 11414 len. 10]: You are quite -- yes -- dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11415 len. 11]: I hoped he was well , and Mrs. Strong too .
Parsing [sent. 11416 len. 7]: ` Oh dear , yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 11417 len. 19]: said the Doctor ; ` Annie 's quite well , and she 'll be delighted to see you .
Parsing [sent. 11418 len. 6]: You were always her favourite .
Parsing [sent. 11419 len. 14]: She said so , last night , when I showed her your letter .
Parsing [sent. 11420 len. 17]: And -- yes , to be sure - you recollect Mr. Jack Maldon , Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 11421 len. 6]: ` Perfectly , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 11422 len. 9]: ` Of course , ' said the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 11423 len. 5]: ` To be sure .
Parsing [sent. 11424 len. 8]: He 's pretty well , too . '
Parsing [sent. 11425 len. 9]: ` Has he come home , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11426 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 11427 len. 5]: ` From India ? '
Parsing [sent. 11428 len. 4]: said the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 11429 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 11430 len. 12]: Mr. Jack Maldon could n't bear the climate , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 11431 len. 11]: Mrs. Markleham -- you have not forgotten Mrs. Markleham ? '
Parsing [sent. 11432 len. 5]: Forgotten the Old Soldier !
Parsing [sent. 11433 len. 6]: And in that short time !
Parsing [sent. 11434 len. 46]: ` Mrs. Markleham , ' said the Doctor , ` was quite vexed about him , poor thing ; so we have got him at home again ; and we have bought him a little Patent place , which agrees with him much better . '
Parsing [sent. 11435 len. 32]: I knew enough of Mr. Jack Maldon to suspect from this account that it was a place where there was not much to do , and which was pretty well paid .
Parsing [sent. 11436 len. 41]: The Doctor , walking up and down with his hand on my shoulder , and his kind face turned encouragingly to mine , went on : ` Now , my dear Copperfield , in reference to this proposal of yours .
Parsing [sent. 11437 len. 23]: It 's very gratifying and agreeable to me , I am sure ; but do n't you think you could do better ?
Parsing [sent. 11438 len. 13]: You achieved distinction , you know , when you were with us .
Parsing [sent. 11439 len. 8]: You are qualified for many good things .
Parsing [sent. 11440 len. 39]: You have laid a foundation that any edifice may be raised upon ; and is it not a pity that you should devote the spring-time of your life to such a poor pursuit as I can offer ? '
Parsing [sent. 11441 len. 34]: I became very glowing again , and , expressing myself in a rhapsodical style , I am afraid , urged my request strongly ; reminding the Doctor that I had already a profession .
Parsing [sent. 11442 len. 15]: ` Well , well , ' said the Doctor , ` that 's true .
Parsing [sent. 11443 len. 19]: Certainly , your having a profession , and being actually engaged in studying it , makes a difference .
Parsing [sent. 11444 len. 15]: But , my good young friend , what 's seventy pounds a year ? '
Parsing [sent. 11445 len. 17]: ` It doubles our income , Doctor Strong , ' said I. ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11446 len. 4]: replied the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 11447 len. 6]: ` To think of that !
Parsing [sent. 11448 len. 33]: Not that I mean to say it 's rigidly limited to seventy pounds a-year , because I have always contemplated making any young friend I might thus employ , a present too .
Parsing [sent. 11449 len. 21]: Undoubtedly , ' said the Doctor , still walking me up and down with his hand on my shoulder . '
Parsing [sent. 11450 len. 11]: I have always taken an annual present into account . '
Parsing [sent. 11451 len. 43]: ` My dear tutor , ' said I -LRB- now , really , without any nonsense -RRB- , ` to whom I owe more obligations already than I ever can acknowledge -- ' ` No , no , ' interposed the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 11452 len. 5]: ` Pardon me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11453 len. 43]: ` If you will take such time as I have , and that is my mornings and evenings , and can think it worth seventy pounds a year , you will do me such a service as I can not express . '
Parsing [sent. 11454 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11455 len. 6]: said the Doctor , innocently .
Parsing [sent. 11456 len. 12]: ` To think that so little should go for so much !
Parsing [sent. 11457 len. 4]: Dear , dear !
Parsing [sent. 11458 len. 10]: And when you can do better , you will ?
Parsing [sent. 11459 len. 7]: On your word , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 11460 len. 21]: said the Doctor , -- which he had always made a very grave appeal to the honour of us boys .
Parsing [sent. 11461 len. 8]: ` On my word , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 11462 len. 10]: I returned , answering in our old school manner .
Parsing [sent. 11463 len. 32]: ` Then be it so , ' said the Doctor , clapping me on the shoulder , and still keeping his hand there , as we still walked up and down .
Parsing [sent. 11464 len. 37]: ` And I shall be twenty times happier , sir , ' said I , with a little - I hope innocent -- flattery , ` if my employment is to be on the Dictionary . '
Parsing [sent. 11465 len. 47]: The Doctor stopped , smilingly clapped me on the shoulder again , and exclaimed , with a triumph most delightful to behold , as if I had penetrated to the profoundest depths of mortal sagacity , ` My dear young friend , you have hit it .
Parsing [sent. 11466 len. 6]: It IS the Dictionary ! '
Parsing [sent. 11467 len. 7]: How could it be anything else !
Parsing [sent. 11468 len. 11]: His pockets were as full of it as his head .
Parsing [sent. 11469 len. 10]: It was sticking out of him in all directions .
Parsing [sent. 11470 len. 53]: He told me that since his retirement from scholastic life , he had been advancing with it wonderfully ; and that nothing could suit him better than the proposed arrangements for morning and evening work , as it was his custom to walk about in the daytime with his considering cap on .
Parsing [sent. 11471 len. 47]: His papers were in a little confusion , in consequence of Mr. Jack Maldon having lately proffered his occasional services as an amanuensis , and not being accustomed to that occupation ; but we should soon put right what was amiss , and go on swimmingly .
Parsing [sent. 11472 len. 65]: Afterwards , when we were fairly at our work , I found Mr. Jack Maldon 's efforts more troublesome to me than I had expected , as he had not confined himself to making numerous mistakes , but had sketched so many soldiers , and ladies ' heads , over the Doctor 's manuscript , that I often became involved in labyrinths of obscurity .
Parsing [sent. 11473 len. 30]: The Doctor was quite happy in the prospect of our going to work together on that wonderful performance , and we settled to begin next morning at seven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 11474 len. 27]: We were to work two hours every morning , and two or three hours every night , except on Saturdays , when I was to rest .
Parsing [sent. 11475 len. 20]: On Sundays , of course , I was to rest also , and I considered these very easy terms .
Parsing [sent. 11476 len. 54]: Our plans being thus arranged to our mutual satisfaction , the Doctor took me into the house to present me to Mrs. Strong , whom we found in the Doctor 's new study , dusting his books , -- a freedom which he never permitted anybody else to take with those sacred favourites .
Parsing [sent. 11477 len. 17]: They had postponed their breakfast on my account , and we sat down to table together .
Parsing [sent. 11478 len. 27]: We had not been seated long , when I saw an approaching arrival in Mrs. Strong 's face , before I heard any sound of it .
Parsing [sent. 11479 len. 55]: A gentleman on horseback came to the gate , and leading his horse into the little court , with the bridle over his arm , as if he were quite at home , tied him to a ring in the empty coach-house wall , and came into the breakfast parlour , whip in hand .
Parsing [sent. 11480 len. 21]: It was Mr. Jack Maldon ; and Mr. Jack Maldon was not at all improved by India , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 11481 len. 37]: I was in a state of ferocious virtue , however , as to young men who were not cutting down trees in the forest of difficulty ; and my impression must be received with due allowance .
Parsing [sent. 11482 len. 5]: ` Mr. Jack ! '
Parsing [sent. 11483 len. 4]: said the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 11484 len. 4]: ` Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 11485 len. 32]: Mr. Jack Maldon shook hands with me ; but not very warmly , I believed ; and with an air of languid patronage , at which I secretly took great umbrage .
Parsing [sent. 11486 len. 20]: But his languor altogether was quite a wonderful sight ; except when he addressed himself to his cousin Annie .
Parsing [sent. 11487 len. 11]: ` Have you breakfasted this morning , Mr. Jack ? '
Parsing [sent. 11488 len. 5]: said the Doctor . '
Parsing [sent. 11489 len. 22]: I hardly ever take breakfast , sir , ' he replied , with his head thrown back in an easy-chair . '
Parsing [sent. 11490 len. 7]: I find it bores me . '
Parsing [sent. 11491 len. 8]: ` Is there any news today ? '
Parsing [sent. 11492 len. 4]: inquired the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 11493 len. 12]: ` Nothing at all , sir , ' replied Mr. Maldon .
Parsing [sent. 11494 len. 28]: ` There 's an account about the people being hungry and discontented down in the North , but they are always being hungry and discontented somewhere . '
Parsing [sent. 11495 len. 38]: The Doctor looked grave , and said , as though he wished to change the subject , ` Then there 's no news at all ; and no news , they say , is good news . '
Parsing [sent. 11496 len. 21]: ` There 's a long statement in the papers , sir , about a murder , ' observed Mr. Maldon .
Parsing [sent. 11497 len. 16]: ` But somebody is always being murdered , and I did n't read it . '
Parsing [sent. 11498 len. 38]: A display of indifference to all the actions and passions of mankind was not supposed to be such a distinguished quality at that time , I think , as I have observed it to be considered since .
Parsing [sent. 11499 len. 8]: I have known it very fashionable indeed .
Parsing [sent. 11500 len. 27]: I have seen it displayed with such success , that I have encountered some fine ladies and gentlemen who might as well have been born caterpillars .
Parsing [sent. 11501 len. 39]: Perhaps it impressed me the more then , because it was new to me , but it certainly did not tend to exalt my opinion of , or to strengthen my confidence in , Mr. Jack Maldon . '
Parsing [sent. 11502 len. 25]: I came out to inquire whether Annie would like to go to the opera tonight , ' said Mr. Maldon , turning to her .
Parsing [sent. 11503 len. 28]: ` It 's the last good night there will be , this season ; and there 's a singer there , whom she really ought to hear .
Parsing [sent. 11504 len. 5]: She is perfectly exquisite .
Parsing [sent. 11505 len. 14]: Besides which , she is so charmingly ugly , ' relapsing into languor .
Parsing [sent. 11506 len. 28]: The Doctor , ever pleased with what was likely to please his young wife , turned to her and said : ` You must go , Annie .
Parsing [sent. 11507 len. 6]: You must go . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11508 len. 13]: I would rather not , ' she said to the Doctor . '
Parsing [sent. 11509 len. 7]: I prefer to remain at home .
Parsing [sent. 11510 len. 9]: I would much rather remain at home . '
Parsing [sent. 11511 len. 62]: Without looking at her cousin , she then addressed me , and asked me about Agnes , and whether she should see her , and whether she was not likely to come that day ; and was so much disturbed , that I wondered how even the Doctor , buttering his toast , could be blind to what was so obvious .
Parsing [sent. 11512 len. 5]: But he saw nothing .
Parsing [sent. 11513 len. 33]: He told her , good-naturedly , that she was young and ought to be amused and entertained , and must not allow herself to be made dull by a dull old fellow .
Parsing [sent. 11514 len. 32]: Moreover , he said , he wanted to hear her sing all the new singer 's songs to him ; and how could she do that well , unless she went ?
Parsing [sent. 11515 len. 22]: So the Doctor persisted in making the engagement for her , and Mr. Jack Maldon was to come back to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 11516 len. 27]: This concluded , he went to his Patent place , I suppose ; but at all events went away on his horse , looking very idle .
Parsing [sent. 11517 len. 14]: I was curious to find out next morning , whether she had been .
Parsing [sent. 11518 len. 56]: She had not , but had sent into London to put her cousin off ; and had gone out in the afternoon to see Agnes , and had prevailed upon the Doctor to go with her ; and they had walked home by the fields , the Doctor told me , the evening being delightful .
Parsing [sent. 11519 len. 28]: I wondered then , whether she would have gone if Agnes had not been in town , and whether Agnes had some good influence over her too !
Parsing [sent. 11520 len. 23]: She did not look very happy , I thought ; but it was a good face , or a very false one .
Parsing [sent. 11521 len. 35]: I often glanced at it , for she sat in the window all the time we were at work ; and made our breakfast , which we took by snatches as we were employed .
Parsing [sent. 11522 len. 29]: When I left , at nine o'clock , she was kneeling on the ground at the Doctor 's feet , putting on his shoes and gaiters for him .
Parsing [sent. 11523 len. 49]: There was a softened shade upon her face , thrown from some green leaves overhanging the open window of the low room ; and I thought all the way to Doctors ' Commons , of the night when I had seen it looking at him as he read .
Parsing [sent. 11524 len. 22]: I was pretty busy now ; up at five in the morning , and home at nine or ten at night .
Parsing [sent. 11525 len. 38]: But I had infinite satisfaction in being so closely engaged , and never walked slowly on any account , and felt enthusiastically that the more I tired myself , the more I was doing to deserve Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11526 len. 64]: I had not revealed myself in my altered character to Dora yet , because she was coming to see Miss Mills in a few days , and I deferred all I had to tell her until then ; merely informing her in my letters -LRB- all our communications were secretly forwarded through Miss Mills -RRB- , that I had much to tell her .
Parsing [sent. 11527 len. 43]: In the meantime , I put myself on a short allowance of bear 's grease , wholly abandoned scented soap and lavender water , and sold off three waistcoats at a prodigious sacrifice , as being too luxurious for my stern career .
Parsing [sent. 11528 len. 37]: Not satisfied with all these proceedings , but burning with impatience to do something more , I went to see Traddles , now lodging up behind the parapet of a house in Castle Street , Holborn .
Parsing [sent. 11529 len. 27]: Mr. Dick , who had been with me to Highgate twice already , and had resumed his companionship with the Doctor , I took with me .
Parsing [sent. 11530 len. 51]: I took Mr. Dick with me , because , acutely sensitive to my aunt 's reverses , and sincerely believing that no galley-slave or convict worked as I did , he had begun to fret and worry himself out of spirits and appetite , as having nothing useful to do .
Parsing [sent. 11531 len. 37]: In this condition , he felt more incapable of finishing the Memorial than ever ; and the harder he worked at it , the oftener that unlucky head of King Charles the First got into it .
Parsing [sent. 11532 len. 59]: Seriously apprehending that his malady would increase , unless we put some innocent deception upon him and caused him to believe that he was useful , or unless we could put him in the way of being really useful -LRB- which would be better -RRB- , I made up my mind to try if Traddles could help us .
Parsing [sent. 11533 len. 32]: Before we went , I wrote Traddles a full statement of all that had happened , and Traddles wrote me back a capital answer , expressive of his sympathy and friendship .
Parsing [sent. 11534 len. 33]: We found him hard at work with his inkstand and papers , refreshed by the sight of the flower-pot stand and the little round table in a corner of the small apartment .
Parsing [sent. 11535 len. 15]: He received us cordially , and made friends with Mr. Dick in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 11536 len. 22]: Mr. Dick professed an absolute certainty of having seen him before , and we both said , ` Very likely . '
Parsing [sent. 11537 len. 34]: The first subject on which I had to consult Traddles was this , -- I had heard that many men distinguished in various pursuits had begun life by reporting the debates in Parliament .
Parsing [sent. 11538 len. 41]: Traddles having mentioned newspapers to me , as one of his hopes , I had put the two things together , and told Traddles in my letter that I wished to know how I could qualify myself for this pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 11539 len. 82]: Traddles now informed me , as the result of his inquiries , that the mere mechanical acquisition necessary , except in rare cases , for thorough excellence in it , that is to say , a perfect and entire command of the mystery of short-hand writing and reading , was about equal in difficulty to the mastery of six languages ; and that it might perhaps be attained , by dint of perseverance , in the course of a few years .
Parsing [sent. 11540 len. 46]: Traddles reasonably supposed that this would settle the business ; but I , only feeling that here indeed were a few tall trees to be hewn down , immediately resolved to work my way on to Dora through this thicket , axe in hand . '
Parsing [sent. 11541 len. 13]: I am very much obliged to you , my dear Traddles ! '
Parsing [sent. 11542 len. 9]: said I. ` I 'll begin tomorrow . '
Parsing [sent. 11543 len. 21]: Traddles looked astonished , as he well might ; but he had no notion as yet of my rapturous condition .
Parsing [sent. 11544 len. 64]: ` I 'll buy a book , ' said I , ` with a good scheme of this art in it ; I 'll work at it at the Commons , where I have n't half enough to do ; I 'll take down the speeches in our court for practice -- Traddles , my dear fellow , I 'll master it ! '
Parsing [sent. 11545 len. 27]: ` Dear me , ' said Traddles , opening his eyes , ' I had no idea you were such a determined character , Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 11546 len. 18]: I do n't know how he should have had , for it was new enough to me .
Parsing [sent. 11547 len. 13]: I passed that off , and brought Mr. Dick on the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 11548 len. 33]: ` You see , ' said Mr. Dick , wistfully , ` if I could exert myself , Mr. Traddles -- if I could beat a drum - or blow anything ! '
Parsing [sent. 11549 len. 3]: Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 11550 len. 18]: I have little doubt he would have preferred such an employment in his heart to all others .
Parsing [sent. 11551 len. 25]: Traddles , who would not have smiled for the world , replied composedly : ` But you are a very good penman , sir .
Parsing [sent. 11552 len. 8]: You told me so , Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 11553 len. 4]: ` Excellent ! '
Parsing [sent. 11554 len. 7]: said I. And indeed he was .
Parsing [sent. 11555 len. 6]: He wrote with extraordinary neatness .
Parsing [sent. 11556 len. 26]: ` Do n't you think , ' said Traddles , ` you could copy writings , sir , if I got them for you ? '
Parsing [sent. 11557 len. 7]: Mr. Dick looked doubtfully at me .
Parsing [sent. 11558 len. 6]: ` Eh , Trotwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 11559 len. 5]: I shook my head .
Parsing [sent. 11560 len. 8]: Mr. Dick shook his , and sighed .
Parsing [sent. 11561 len. 12]: ` Tell him about the Memorial , ' said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 11562 len. 40]: I explained to Traddles that there was a difficulty in keeping King Charles the First out of Mr. Dick 's manuscripts ; Mr. Dick in the meanwhile looking very deferentially and seriously at Traddles , and sucking his thumb .
Parsing [sent. 11563 len. 28]: ` But these writings , you know , that I speak of , are already drawn up and finished , ' said Traddles after a little consideration .
Parsing [sent. 11564 len. 10]: ` Mr. Dick has nothing to do with them .
Parsing [sent. 11565 len. 9]: Would n't that make a difference , Copperfield ?
Parsing [sent. 11566 len. 13]: At all events , would n't it be well to try ? '
Parsing [sent. 11567 len. 6]: This gave us new hope .
Parsing [sent. 11568 len. 39]: Traddles and I laying our heads together apart , while Mr. Dick anxiously watched us from his chair , we concocted a scheme in virtue of which we got him to work next day , with triumphant success .
Parsing [sent. 11569 len. 55]: On a table by the window in Buckingham Street , we set out the work Traddles procured for him -- which was to make , I forget how many copies of a legal document about some right of way -- and on another table we spread the last unfinished original of the great Memorial .
Parsing [sent. 11570 len. 50]: Our instructions to Mr. Dick were that he should copy exactly what he had before him , without the least departure from the original ; and that when he felt it necessary to make the slightest allusion to King Charles the First , he should fly to the Memorial .
Parsing [sent. 11571 len. 17]: We exhorted him to be resolute in this , and left my aunt to observe him .
Parsing [sent. 11572 len. 73]: My aunt reported to us , afterwards , that , at first , he was like a man playing the kettle-drums , and constantly divided his attentions between the two ; but that , finding this confuse and fatigue him , and having his copy there , plainly before his eyes , he soon sat at it in an orderly business-like manner , and postponed the Memorial to a more convenient time .
Parsing [sent. 11573 len. 103]: In a word , although we took great care that he should have no more to do than was good for him , and although he did not begin with the beginning of a week , he earned by the following Saturday night ten shillings and nine-pence ; and never , while I live , shall I forget his going about to all the shops in the neighbourhood to change this treasure into sixpences , or his bringing them to my aunt arranged in the form of a heart upon a waiter , with tears of joy and pride in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 11574 len. 60]: He was like one under the propitious influence of a charm , from the moment of his being usefully employed ; and if there were a happy man in the world , that Saturday night , it was the grateful creature who thought my aunt the most wonderful woman in existence , and me the most wonderful young man .
Parsing [sent. 11575 len. 20]: ` No starving now , Trotwood , ' said Mr. Dick , shaking hands with me in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 11576 len. 10]: ` I 'll provide for her , Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 11577 len. 17]: and he flourished his ten fingers in the air , as if they were ten banks .
Parsing [sent. 11578 len. 47]: I hardly know which was the better pleased , Traddles or I. ` It really , ' said Traddles , suddenly , taking a letter out of his pocket , and giving it to me , ` put Mr. Micawber quite out of my head ! '
Parsing [sent. 11579 len. 36]: The letter -LRB- Mr. Micawber never missed any possible opportunity of writing a letter -RRB- was addressed to me , ` By the kindness of T. Traddles , Esquire , of the Inner Temple . '
Parsing [sent. 11580 len. 27]: It ran thus : -- ` My DEAR COPPERFIELD , ` You may possibly not be unprepared to receive the intimation that something has turned up .
Parsing [sent. 11581 len. 21]: I may have mentioned to you on a former occasion that I was in expectation of such an event . '
Parsing [sent. 11582 len. 45]: I am about to establish myself in one of the provincial towns of our favoured island -LRB- where the society may be described as a happy admixture of the agricultural and the clerical -RRB- , in immediate connexion with one of the learned professions .
Parsing [sent. 11583 len. 9]: Mrs. Micawber and our offspring will accompany me .
Parsing [sent. 11584 len. 43]: Our ashes , at a future period , will probably be found commingled in the cemetery attached to a venerable pile , for which the spot to which I refer has acquired a reputation , shall I say from China to Peru ?
Parsing [sent. 11585 len. 62]: ` In bidding adieu to the modern Babylon , where we have undergone many vicissitudes , I trust not ignobly , Mrs. Micawber and myself can not disguise from our minds that we part , it may be for years and it may be for ever , with an individual linked by strong associations to the altar of our domestic life .
Parsing [sent. 11586 len. 58]: If , on the eve of such a departure , you will accompany our mutual friend , Mr. Thomas Traddles , to our present abode , and there reciprocate the wishes natural to the occasion , you will confer a Boon ` On ` One ` Who ` Is ` Ever yours , ` WILKINS MICAWBER . '
Parsing [sent. 11587 len. 27]: I was glad to find that Mr. Micawber had got rid of his dust and ashes , and that something really had turned up at last .
Parsing [sent. 11588 len. 54]: Learning from Traddles that the invitation referred to the evening then wearing away , I expressed my readiness to do honour to it ; and we went off together to the lodging which Mr. Micawber occupied as Mr. Mortimer , and which was situated near the top of the Gray 's Inn Road .
Parsing [sent. 11589 len. 61]: The resources of this lodging were so limited , that we found the twins , now some eight or nine years old , reposing in a turn-up bedstead in the family sitting-room , where Mr. Micawber had prepared , in a wash-hand-stand jug , what he called ' a Brew ' of the agreeable beverage for which he was famous .
Parsing [sent. 11590 len. 48]: I had the pleasure , on this occasion , of renewing the acquaintance of Master Micawber , whom I found a promising boy of about twelve or thirteen , very subject to that restlessness of limb which is not an unfrequent phenomenon in youths of his age .
Parsing [sent. 11591 len. 34]: I also became once more known to his sister , Miss Micawber , in whom , as Mr. Micawber told us , ` her mother renewed her youth , like the Phoenix ' .
Parsing [sent. 11592 len. 35]: ` My dear Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` yourself and Mr. Traddles find us on the brink of migration , and will excuse any little discomforts incidental to that position . '
Parsing [sent. 11593 len. 31]: Glancing round as I made a suitable reply , I observed that the family effects were already packed , and that the amount of luggage was by no means overwhelming .
Parsing [sent. 11594 len. 9]: I congratulated Mrs. Micawber on the approaching change .
Parsing [sent. 11595 len. 26]: ` My dear Mr. Copperfield , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` of your friendly interest in all our affairs , I am well assured .
Parsing [sent. 11596 len. 28]: My family may consider it banishment , if they please ; but I am a wife and mother , and I never will desert Mr. Micawber . '
Parsing [sent. 11597 len. 13]: Traddles , appealed to by Mrs. Micawber 's eye , feelingly acquiesced .
Parsing [sent. 11598 len. 52]: ` That , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` that , at least , is my view , my dear Mr. Copperfield and Mr. Traddles , of the obligation which I took upon myself when I repeated the irrevocable words , `` I , Emma , take thee , Wilkins . ''
Parsing [sent. 11599 len. 30]: I read the service over with a flat-candle on the previous night , and the conclusion I derived from it was , that I never could desert Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 11600 len. 28]: And , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` though it is possible I may be mistaken in my view of the ceremony , I never will ! '
Parsing [sent. 11601 len. 31]: ` My dear , ' said Mr. Micawber , a little impatiently , ' I am not conscious that you are expected to do anything of the sort . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11602 len. 68]: I am aware , my dear Mr. Copperfield , ' pursued Mrs. Micawber , ` that I am now about to cast my lot among strangers ; and I am also aware that the various members of my family , to whom Mr. Micawber has written in the most gentlemanly terms , announcing that fact , have not taken the least notice of Mr. Micawber 's communication .
Parsing [sent. 11603 len. 38]: Indeed I may be superstitious , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` but it appears to me that Mr. Micawber is destined never to receive any answers whatever to the great majority of the communications he writes .
Parsing [sent. 11604 len. 52]: I may augur , from the silence of my family , that they object to the resolution I have taken ; but I should not allow myself to be swerved from the path of duty , Mr. Copperfield , even by my papa and mama , were they still living . '
Parsing [sent. 11605 len. 13]: I expressed my opinion that this was going in the right direction .
Parsing [sent. 11606 len. 54]: ` It may be a sacrifice , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` to immure one 's - self in a Cathedral town ; but surely , Mr. Copperfield , if it is a sacrifice in me , it is much more a sacrifice in a man of Mr. Micawber 's abilities . '
Parsing [sent. 11607 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11608 len. 9]: You are going to a Cathedral town ? '
Parsing [sent. 11609 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 11610 len. 22]: Mr. Micawber , who had been helping us all , out of the wash-hand-stand jug , replied : ` To Canterbury .
Parsing [sent. 11611 len. 46]: In fact , my dear Copperfield , I have entered into arrangements , by virtue of which I stand pledged and contracted to our friend Heep , to assist and serve him in the capacity of -- and to be -- his confidential clerk . '
Parsing [sent. 11612 len. 13]: I stared at Mr. Micawber , who greatly enjoyed my surprise . '
Parsing [sent. 11613 len. 42]: I am bound to state to you , ' he said , with an official air , ` that the business habits , and the prudent suggestions , of Mrs. Micawber , have in a great measure conduced to this result .
Parsing [sent. 11614 len. 38]: The gauntlet , to which Mrs. Micawber referred upon a former occasion , being thrown down in the form of an advertisement , was taken up by my friend Heep , and led to a mutual recognition .
Parsing [sent. 11615 len. 28]: Of my friend Heep , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` who is a man of remarkable shrewdness , I desire to speak with all possible respect .
Parsing [sent. 11616 len. 55]: My friend Heep has not fixed the positive remuneration at too high a figure , but he has made a great deal , in the way of extrication from the pressure of pecuniary difficulties , contingent on the value of my services ; and on the value of those services I pin my faith .
Parsing [sent. 11617 len. 36]: Such address and intelligence as I chance to possess , ' said Mr. Micawber , boastfully disparaging himself , with the old genteel air , ` will be devoted to my friend Heep 's service .
Parsing [sent. 11618 len. 38]: I have already some acquaintance with the law -- as a defendant on civil process -- and I shall immediately apply myself to the Commentaries of one of the most eminent and remarkable of our English jurists .
Parsing [sent. 11619 len. 16]: I believe it is unnecessary to add that I allude to Mr. justice Blackstone . '
Parsing [sent. 11620 len. 115]: These observations , and indeed the greater part of the observations made that evening , were interrupted by Mrs. Micawber 's discovering that Master Micawber was sitting on his boots , or holding his head on with both arms as if he felt it loose , or accidentally kicking Traddles under the table , or shuffling his feet over one another , or producing them at distances from himself apparently outrageous to nature , or lying sideways with his hair among the wine-glasses , or developing his restlessness of limb in some other form incompatible with the general interests of society ; and by Master Micawber 's receiving those discoveries in a resentful spirit .
Parsing [sent. 11621 len. 34]: I sat all the while , amazed by Mr. Micawber 's disclosure , and wondering what it meant ; until Mrs. Micawber resumed the thread of the discourse , and claimed my attention .
Parsing [sent. 11622 len. 59]: ` What I particularly request Mr. Micawber to be careful of , is , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` that he does not , my dear Mr. Copperfield , in applying himself to this subordinate branch of the law , place it out of his power to rise , ultimately , to the top of the tree .
Parsing [sent. 11623 len. 30]: I am convinced that Mr. Micawber , giving his mind to a profession so adapted to his fertile resources , and his flow of language , must distinguish himself .
Parsing [sent. 11624 len. 28]: Now , for example , Mr. Traddles , ' said Mrs. Micawber , assuming a profound air , ' a judge , or even say a Chancellor .
Parsing [sent. 11625 len. 24]: Does an individual place himself beyond the pale of those preferments by entering on such an office as Mr. Micawber has accepted ? '
Parsing [sent. 11626 len. 33]: ` My dear , ' observed Mr. Micawber -- but glancing inquisitively at Traddles , too ; ` we have time enough before us , for the consideration of those questions . '
Parsing [sent. 11627 len. 10]: ` Micawber , ' she returned , ` no !
Parsing [sent. 11628 len. 15]: Your mistake in life is , that you do not look forward far enough .
Parsing [sent. 11629 len. 37]: You are bound , in justice to your family , if not to yourself , to take in at a comprehensive glance the extremest point in the horizon to which your abilities may lead you . '
Parsing [sent. 11630 len. 29]: Mr. Micawber coughed , and drank his punch with an air of exceeding satisfaction -- still glancing at Traddles , as if he desired to have his opinion .
Parsing [sent. 11631 len. 25]: ` Why , the plain state of the case , Mrs. Micawber , ' said Traddles , mildly breaking the truth to her . '
Parsing [sent. 11632 len. 46]: I mean the real prosaic fact , you know -- ' ` Just so , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` my dear Mr. Traddles , I wish to be as prosaic and literal as possible on a subject of so much importance . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11633 len. 34]: - Is , ' said Traddles , ` that this branch of the law , even if Mr. Micawber were a regular solicitor -- ' ` Exactly so , ' returned Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 11634 len. 22]: -LRB- ` Wilkins , you are squinting , and will not be able to get your eyes back . ' -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 11635 len. 14]: - Has nothing , ' pursued Traddles , ` to do with that .
Parsing [sent. 11636 len. 35]: Only a barrister is eligible for such preferments ; and Mr. Micawber could not be a barrister , without being entered at an inn of court as a student , for five years . '
Parsing [sent. 11637 len. 7]: ` Do I follow you ? '
Parsing [sent. 11638 len. 12]: said Mrs. Micawber , with her most affable air of business .
Parsing [sent. 11639 len. 31]: ` Do I understand , my dear Mr. Traddles , that , at the expiration of that period , Mr. Micawber would be eligible as a Judge or Chancellor ? '
Parsing [sent. 11640 len. 18]: ` He would be ELIGIBLE , ' returned Traddles , with a strong emphasis on that word .
Parsing [sent. 11641 len. 9]: ` Thank you , ' said Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 11642 len. 6]: ` That is quite sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 11643 len. 25]: If such is the case , and Mr. Micawber forfeits no privilege by entering on these duties , my anxiety is set at rest .
Parsing [sent. 11644 len. 69]: I speak , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` as a female , necessarily ; but I have always been of opinion that Mr. Micawber possesses what I have heard my papa call , when I lived at home , the judicial mind ; and I hope Mr. Micawber is now entering on a field where that mind will develop itself , and take a commanding station . '
Parsing [sent. 11645 len. 20]: I quite believe that Mr. Micawber saw himself , in his judicial mind 's eye , on the woolsack .
Parsing [sent. 11646 len. 29]: He passed his hand complacently over his bald head , and said with ostentatious resignation : ` My dear , we will not anticipate the decrees of fortune .
Parsing [sent. 11647 len. 29]: If I am reserved to wear a wig , I am at least prepared , externally , ' in allusion to his baldness , ` for that distinction .
Parsing [sent. 11648 len. 27]: I do not , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` regret my hair , and I may have been deprived of it for a specific purpose .
Parsing [sent. 11649 len. 5]: I can not say .
Parsing [sent. 11650 len. 37]: It is my intention , my dear Copperfield , to educate my son for the Church ; I will not deny that I should be happy , on his account , to attain to eminence . '
Parsing [sent. 11651 len. 6]: ` For the Church ? '
Parsing [sent. 11652 len. 13]: said I , still pondering , between whiles , on Uriah Heep .
Parsing [sent. 11653 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' said Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 11654 len. 14]: ` He has a remarkable head-voice , and will commence as a chorister .
Parsing [sent. 11655 len. 32]: Our residence at Canterbury , and our local connexion , will , no doubt , enable him to take advantage of any vacancy that may arise in the Cathedral corps . '
Parsing [sent. 11656 len. 53]: On looking at Master Micawber again , I saw that he had a certain expression of face , as if his voice were behind his eyebrows ; where it presently appeared to be , on his singing us -LRB- as an alternative between that and bed -RRB- ` The Wood-Pecker tapping ' .
Parsing [sent. 11657 len. 42]: After many compliments on this performance , we fell into some general conversation ; and as I was too full of my desperate intentions to keep my altered circumstances to myself , I made them known to Mr. and Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 11658 len. 31]: I can not express how extremely delighted they both were , by the idea of my aunt 's being in difficulties ; and how comfortable and friendly it made them .
Parsing [sent. 11659 len. 43]: When we were nearly come to the last round of the punch , I addressed myself to Traddles , and reminded him that we must not separate , without wishing our friends health , happiness , and success in their new career .
Parsing [sent. 11660 len. 36]: I begged Mr. Micawber to fill us bumpers , and proposed the toast in due form : shaking hands with him across the table , and kissing Mrs. Micawber , to commemorate that eventful occasion .
Parsing [sent. 11661 len. 23]: Traddles imitated me in the first particular , but did not consider himself a sufficiently old friend to venture on the second .
Parsing [sent. 11662 len. 86]: ` My dear Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber , rising with one of his thumbs in each of his waistcoat pockets , ` the companion of my youth : if I may be allowed the expression -- and my esteemed friend Traddles : if I may be permitted to call him so -- will allow me , on the part of Mrs. Micawber , myself , and our offspring , to thank them in the warmest and most uncompromising terms for their good wishes .
Parsing [sent. 11663 len. 53]: It may be expected that on the eve of a migration which will consign us to a perfectly new existence , ' Mr. Micawber spoke as if they were going five hundred thousand miles , ' I should offer a few valedictory remarks to two such friends as I see before me .
Parsing [sent. 11664 len. 15]: But all that I have to say in this way , I have said .
Parsing [sent. 11665 len. 42]: Whatever station in society I may attain , through the medium of the learned profession of which I am about to become an unworthy member , I shall endeavour not to disgrace , and Mrs. Micawber will be safe to adorn .
Parsing [sent. 11666 len. 64]: Under the temporary pressure of pecuniary liabilities , contracted with a view to their immediate liquidation , but remaining unliquidated through a combination of circumstances , I have been under the necessity of assuming a garb from which my natural instincts recoil -- I allude to spectacles -- and possessing myself of a cognomen , to which I can establish no legitimate pretensions .
Parsing [sent. 11667 len. 34]: All I have to say on that score is , that the cloud has passed from the dreary scene , and the God of Day is once more high upon the mountain tops .
Parsing [sent. 11668 len. 31]: On Monday next , on the arrival of the four o'clock afternoon coach at Canterbury , my foot will be on my native heath -- my name , Micawber ! '
Parsing [sent. 11669 len. 22]: Mr. Micawber resumed his seat on the close of these remarks , and drank two glasses of punch in grave succession .
Parsing [sent. 11670 len. 32]: He then said with much solemnity : ` One thing more I have to do , before this separation is complete , and that is to perform an act of justice .
Parsing [sent. 11671 len. 34]: My friend Mr. Thomas Traddles has , on two several occasions , `` put his name '' , if I may use a common expression , to bills of exchange for my accommodation .
Parsing [sent. 11672 len. 21]: On the first occasion Mr. Thomas Traddles was left -- let me say , in short , in the lurch .
Parsing [sent. 11673 len. 10]: The fulfilment of the second has not yet arrived .
Parsing [sent. 11674 len. 49]: The amount of the first obligation , ' here Mr. Micawber carefully referred to papers , ` was , I believe , twenty-three , four , nine and a half , of the second , according to my entry of that transaction , eighteen , six , two .
Parsing [sent. 11675 len. 26]: These sums , united , make a total , if my calculation is correct , amounting to forty-one , ten , eleven and a half .
Parsing [sent. 11676 len. 15]: My friend Copperfield will perhaps do me the favour to check that total ? '
Parsing [sent. 11677 len. 8]: I did so and found it correct .
Parsing [sent. 11678 len. 40]: ` To leave this metropolis , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` and my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles , without acquitting myself of the pecuniary part of this obligation , would weigh upon my mind to an insupportable extent .
Parsing [sent. 11679 len. 30]: I have , therefore , prepared for my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles , and I now hold in my hand , a document , which accomplishes the desired object .
Parsing [sent. 11680 len. 48]: I beg to hand to my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles my I.O.U. for forty-one , ten , eleven and a half , and I am happy to recover my moral dignity , and to know that I can once more walk erect before my fellow man ! '
Parsing [sent. 11681 len. 33]: With this introduction -LRB- which greatly affected him -RRB- , Mr. Micawber placed his I.O.U. in the hands of Traddles , and said he wished him well in every relation of life .
Parsing [sent. 11682 len. 38]: I am persuaded , not only that this was quite the same to Mr. Micawber as paying the money , but that Traddles himself hardly knew the difference until he had had time to think about it .
Parsing [sent. 11683 len. 32]: Mr. Micawber walked so erect before his fellow man , on the strength of this virtuous action , that his chest looked half as broad again when he lighted us downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 11684 len. 74]: We parted with great heartiness on both sides ; and when I had seen Traddles to his own door , and was going home alone , I thought , among the other odd and contradictory things I mused upon , that , slippery as Mr. Micawber was , I was probably indebted to some compassionate recollection he retained of me as his boy-lodger , for never having been asked by him for money .
Parsing [sent. 11685 len. 37]: I certainly should not have had the moral courage to refuse it ; and I have no doubt he knew that -LRB- to his credit be it written -RRB- , quite as well as I did .
Parsing [sent. 11686 len. 35]: Chapter 37 A Little Cold Water My new life had lasted for more than a week , and I was stronger than ever in those tremendous practical resolutions that I felt the crisis required .
Parsing [sent. 11687 len. 19]: I continued to walk extremely fast , and to have a general idea that I was getting on .
Parsing [sent. 11688 len. 30]: I made it a rule to take as much out of myself as I possibly could , in my way of doing everything to which I applied my energies .
Parsing [sent. 11689 len. 8]: I made a perfect victim of myself .
Parsing [sent. 11690 len. 29]: I even entertained some idea of putting myself on a vegetable diet , vaguely conceiving that , in becoming a graminivorous animal , I should sacrifice to Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11691 len. 23]: As yet , little Dora was quite unconscious of my desperate firmness , otherwise than as my letters darkly shadowed it forth .
Parsing [sent. 11692 len. 54]: But another Saturday came , and on that Saturday evening she was to be at Miss Mills 's ; and when Mr. Mills had gone to his whist-club -LRB- telegraphed to me in the street , by a bird-cage in the drawing-room middle window -RRB- , I was to go there to tea .
Parsing [sent. 11693 len. 26]: By this time , we were quite settled down in Buckingham Street , where Mr. Dick continued his copying in a state of absolute felicity .
Parsing [sent. 11694 len. 50]: My aunt had obtained a signal victory over Mrs. Crupp , by paying her off , throwing the first pitcher she planted on the stairs out of window , and protecting in person , up and down the staircase , a supernumerary whom she engaged from the outer world .
Parsing [sent. 11695 len. 30]: These vigorous measures struck such terror to the breast of Mrs. Crupp , that she subsided into her own kitchen , under the impression that my aunt was mad .
Parsing [sent. 11696 len. 79]: My aunt being supremely indifferent to Mrs. Crupp 's opinion and everybody else 's , and rather favouring than discouraging the idea , Mrs. Crupp , of late the bold , became within a few days so faint-hearted , that rather than encounter my aunt upon the staircase , she would endeavour to hide her portly form behind doors -- leaving visible , however , a wide margin of flannel petticoat -- or would shrink into dark corners .
Parsing [sent. 11697 len. 46]: This gave my aunt such unspeakable satisfaction , that I believe she took a delight in prowling up and down , with her bonnet insanely perched on the top of her head , at times when Mrs. Crupp was likely to be in the way .
Parsing [sent. 11698 len. 29]: My aunt , being uncommonly neat and ingenious , made so many little improvements in our domestic arrangements , that I seemed to be richer instead of poorer .
Parsing [sent. 11699 len. 38]: Among the rest , she converted the pantry into a dressing-room for me ; and purchased and embellished a bedstead for my occupation , which looked as like a bookcase in the daytime as a bedstead could .
Parsing [sent. 11700 len. 30]: I was the object of her constant solicitude ; and my poor mother herself could not have loved me better , or studied more how to make me happy .
Parsing [sent. 11701 len. 52]: Peggotty had considered herself highly privileged in being allowed to participate in these labours ; and , although she still retained something of her old sentiment of awe in reference to my aunt , had received so many marks of encouragement and confidence , that they were the best friends possible .
Parsing [sent. 11702 len. 50]: But the time had now come -LRB- I am speaking of the Saturday when I was to take tea at Miss Mills 's -RRB- when it was necessary for her to return home , and enter on the discharge of the duties she had undertaken in behalf of Ham .
Parsing [sent. 11703 len. 18]: ` So good-bye , Barkis , ' said my aunt , ` and take care of yourself !
Parsing [sent. 11704 len. 15]: I am sure I never thought I could be sorry to lose you ! '
Parsing [sent. 11705 len. 12]: I took Peggotty to the coach office and saw her off .
Parsing [sent. 11706 len. 17]: She cried at parting , and confided her brother to my friendship as Ham had done .
Parsing [sent. 11707 len. 15]: We had heard nothing of him since he went away , that sunny afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 11708 len. 93]: ` And now , my own dear Davy , ' said Peggotty , ` if , while you 're a prentice , you should want any money to spend ; or if , when you 're out of your time , my dear , you should want any to set you up -LRB- and you must do one or other , or both , my darling -RRB- ; who has such a good right to ask leave to lend it you , as my sweet girl 's own old stupid me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11709 len. 30]: I was not so savagely independent as to say anything in reply , but that if ever I borrowed money of anyone , I would borrow it of her .
Parsing [sent. 11710 len. 24]: Next to accepting a large sum on the spot , I believe this gave Peggotty more comfort than anything I could have done .
Parsing [sent. 11711 len. 7]: ` And , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 11712 len. 24]: whispered Peggotty , ` tell the pretty little angel that I should so have liked to see her , only for a minute !
Parsing [sent. 11713 len. 29]: And tell her that before she marries my boy , I 'll come and make your house so beautiful for you , if you 'll let me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11714 len. 23]: I declared that nobody else should touch it ; and this gave Peggotty such delight that she went away in good spirits .
Parsing [sent. 11715 len. 36]: I fatigued myself as much as I possibly could in the Commons all day , by a variety of devices , and at the appointed time in the evening repaired to Mr. Mills 's street .
Parsing [sent. 11716 len. 30]: Mr. Mills , who was a terrible fellow to fall asleep after dinner , had not yet gone out , and there was no bird-cage in the middle window .
Parsing [sent. 11717 len. 20]: He kept me waiting so long , that I fervently hoped the Club would fine him for being late .
Parsing [sent. 11718 len. 66]: At last he came out ; and then I saw my own Dora hang up the bird-cage , and peep into the balcony to look for me , and run in again when she saw I was there , while Jip remained behind , to bark injuriously at an immense butcher 's dog in the street , who could have taken him like a pill .
Parsing [sent. 11719 len. 46]: Dora came to the drawing-room door to meet me ; and Jip came scrambling out , tumbling over his own growls , under the impression that I was a Bandit ; and we all three went in , as happy and loving as could be .
Parsing [sent. 11720 len. 45]: I soon carried desolation into the bosom of our joys - not that I meant to do it , but that I was so full of the subject - by asking Dora , without the smallest preparation , if she could love a beggar ?
Parsing [sent. 11721 len. 8]: My pretty , little , startled Dora !
Parsing [sent. 11722 len. 52]: Her only association with the word was a yellow face and a nightcap , or a pair of crutches , or a wooden leg , or a dog with a decanter-stand in his mouth , or something of that kind ; and she stared at me with the most delightful wonder .
Parsing [sent. 11723 len. 11]: ` How can you ask me anything so foolish ? '
Parsing [sent. 11724 len. 3]: pouted Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11725 len. 6]: ` Love a beggar ! '
Parsing [sent. 11726 len. 8]: ` Dora , my own dearest ! '
Parsing [sent. 11727 len. 9]: said I. ' I am a beggar ! '
Parsing [sent. 11728 len. 28]: ` How can you be such a silly thing , ' replied Dora , slapping my hand , ` as to sit there , telling such stories ?
Parsing [sent. 11729 len. 8]: I 'll make Jip bite you ! '
Parsing [sent. 11730 len. 42]: Her childish way was the most delicious way in the world to me , but it was necessary to be explicit , and I solemnly repeated : ` Dora , my own life , I am your ruined David ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 11731 len. 10]: I declare I 'll make Jip bite you ! '
Parsing [sent. 11732 len. 15]: said Dora , shaking her curls , ` if you are so ridiculous . '
Parsing [sent. 11733 len. 36]: But I looked so serious , that Dora left off shaking her curls , and laid her trembling little hand upon my shoulder , and first looked scared and anxious , then began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 11734 len. 4]: That was dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 11735 len. 37]: I fell upon my knees before the sofa , caressing her , and imploring her not to rend my heart ; but , for some time , poor little Dora did nothing but exclaim Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 11736 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 11737 len. 8]: And oh , she was so frightened !
Parsing [sent. 11738 len. 6]: And where was Julia Mills !
Parsing [sent. 11739 len. 15]: And oh , take her to Julia Mills , and go away , please !
Parsing [sent. 11740 len. 7]: until I was almost beside myself .
Parsing [sent. 11741 len. 47]: At last , after an agony of supplication and protestation , I got Dora to look at me , with a horrified expression of face , which I gradually soothed until it was only loving , and her soft , pretty cheek was lying against mine .
Parsing [sent. 11742 len. 168]: Then I told her , with my arms clasped round her , how I loved her , so dearly , and so dearly ; how I felt it right to offer to release her from her engagement , because now I was poor ; how I never could bear it , or recover it , if I lost her ; how I had no fears of poverty , if she had none , my arm being nerved and my heart inspired by her ; how I was already working with a courage such as none but lovers knew ; how I had begun to be practical , and look into the future ; how a crust well earned was sweeter far than a feast inherited ; and much more to the same purpose , which I delivered in a burst of passionate eloquence quite surprising to myself , though I had been thinking about it , day and night , ever since my aunt had astonished me .
Parsing [sent. 11743 len. 11]: ` Is your heart mine still , dear Dora ? '
Parsing [sent. 11744 len. 17]: said I , rapturously , for I knew by her clinging to me that it was .
Parsing [sent. 11745 len. 6]: ` Oh , yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 11746 len. 3]: cried Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11747 len. 10]: ` Oh , yes , it 's all yours .
Parsing [sent. 11748 len. 8]: Oh , do n't be dreadful ! '
Parsing [sent. 11749 len. 3]: I dreadful !
Parsing [sent. 11750 len. 3]: To Dora !
Parsing [sent. 11751 len. 13]: ` Do n't talk about being poor , and working hard ! '
Parsing [sent. 11752 len. 8]: said Dora , nestling closer to me .
Parsing [sent. 11753 len. 10]: ` Oh , do n't , do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 11754 len. 33]: ` My dearest love , ' said I , ` the crust well-earned -- ' ` Oh , yes ; but I do n't want to hear any more about crusts ! '
Parsing [sent. 11755 len. 3]: said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11756 len. 18]: ` And Jip must have a mutton-chop every day at twelve , or he 'll die . '
Parsing [sent. 11757 len. 10]: I was charmed with her childish , winning way .
Parsing [sent. 11758 len. 16]: I fondly explained to Dora that Jip should have his mutton-chop with his accustomed regularity .
Parsing [sent. 11759 len. 35]: I drew a picture of our frugal home , made independent by my labour -- sketching in the little house I had seen at Highgate , and my aunt in her room upstairs . '
Parsing [sent. 11760 len. 9]: I am not dreadful now , Dora ? '
Parsing [sent. 11761 len. 5]: said I , tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 11762 len. 8]: ` Oh , no , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 11763 len. 3]: cried Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11764 len. 16]: ` But I hope your aunt will keep in her own room a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 11765 len. 12]: And I hope she 's not a scolding old thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 11766 len. 19]: If it were possible for me to love Dora more than ever , I am sure I did .
Parsing [sent. 11767 len. 9]: But I felt she was a little impracticable .
Parsing [sent. 11768 len. 17]: It damped my new-born ardour , to find that ardour so difficult of communication to her .
Parsing [sent. 11769 len. 5]: I made another trial .
Parsing [sent. 11770 len. 32]: When she was quite herself again , and was curling Jip 's ears , as he lay upon her lap , I became grave , and said : ` My own !
Parsing [sent. 11771 len. 6]: May I mention something ? '
Parsing [sent. 11772 len. 10]: ` Oh , please do n't be practical ! '
Parsing [sent. 11773 len. 5]: said Dora , coaxingly .
Parsing [sent. 11774 len. 8]: ` Because it frightens me so ! '
Parsing [sent. 11775 len. 4]: ` Sweetheart ! '
Parsing [sent. 11776 len. 14]: I returned ; ` there is nothing to alarm you in all this .
Parsing [sent. 11777 len. 10]: I want you to think of it quite differently .
Parsing [sent. 11778 len. 15]: I want to make it nerve you , and inspire you , Dora ! '
Parsing [sent. 11779 len. 10]: ` Oh , but that 's so shocking ! '
Parsing [sent. 11780 len. 3]: cried Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11781 len. 6]: ` My love , no .
Parsing [sent. 11782 len. 15]: Perseverance and strength of character will enable us to bear much worse things . '
Parsing [sent. 11783 len. 19]: ` But I have n't got any strength at all , ' said Dora , shaking her curls .
Parsing [sent. 11784 len. 6]: ` Have I , Jip ?
Parsing [sent. 11785 len. 11]: Oh , do kiss Jip , and be agreeable ! '
Parsing [sent. 11786 len. 52]: It was impossible to resist kissing Jip , when she held him up to me for that purpose , putting her own bright , rosy little mouth into kissing form , as she directed the operation , which she insisted should be performed symmetrically , on the centre of his nose .
Parsing [sent. 11787 len. 31]: I did as she bade me -- rewarding myself afterwards for my obedience - and she charmed me out of my graver character for I do n't know how long .
Parsing [sent. 11788 len. 9]: ` But , Dora , my beloved ! '
Parsing [sent. 11789 len. 17]: said I , at last resuming it ; ' I was going to mention something . '
Parsing [sent. 11790 len. 37]: The judge of the Prerogative Court might have fallen in love with her , to see her fold her little hands and hold them up , begging and praying me not to be dreadful any more .
Parsing [sent. 11791 len. 13]: ` Indeed I am not going to be , my darling ! '
Parsing [sent. 11792 len. 4]: I assured her .
Parsing [sent. 11793 len. 25]: ` But , Dora , my love , if you will sometimes think , -- not despondingly , you know ; far from that !
Parsing [sent. 11794 len. 30]: -- but if you will sometimes think -- just to encourage yourself -- that you are engaged to a poor man -- ' ` Do n't , do n't !
Parsing [sent. 11795 len. 5]: Pray do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 11796 len. 3]: cried Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11797 len. 8]: ` It 's so very dreadful ! '
Parsing [sent. 11798 len. 9]: ` My soul , not at all ! '
Parsing [sent. 11799 len. 5]: said I , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 11800 len. 55]: ` If you will sometimes think of that , and look about now and then at your papa 's housekeeping , and endeavour to acquire a little habit -- of accounts , for instance -- ' Poor little Dora received this suggestion with something that was half a sob and half a scream . '
Parsing [sent. 11801 len. 15]: - It would be so useful to us afterwards , ' I went on .
Parsing [sent. 11802 len. 32]: ` And if you would promise me to read a little -- a little Cookery Book that I would send you , it would be so excellent for both of us .
Parsing [sent. 11803 len. 34]: For our path in life , my Dora , ' said I , warming with the subject , ` is stony and rugged now , and it rests with us to smooth it .
Parsing [sent. 11804 len. 7]: We must fight our way onward .
Parsing [sent. 11805 len. 5]: We must be brave .
Parsing [sent. 11806 len. 17]: There are obstacles to be met , and we must meet , and crush them ! '
Parsing [sent. 11807 len. 28]: I was going on at a great rate , with a clenched hand , and a most enthusiastic countenance ; but it was quite unnecessary to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 11808 len. 5]: I had said enough .
Parsing [sent. 11809 len. 6]: I had done it again .
Parsing [sent. 11810 len. 7]: Oh , she was so frightened !
Parsing [sent. 11811 len. 7]: Oh , where was Julia Mills !
Parsing [sent. 11812 len. 14]: Oh , take her to Julia Mills , and go away , please !
Parsing [sent. 11813 len. 17]: So that , in short , I was quite distracted , and raved about the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 11814 len. 10]: I thought I had killed her , this time .
Parsing [sent. 11815 len. 7]: I sprinkled water on her face .
Parsing [sent. 11816 len. 7]: I went down on my knees .
Parsing [sent. 11817 len. 6]: I plucked at my hair .
Parsing [sent. 11818 len. 12]: I denounced myself as a remorseless brute and a ruthless beast .
Parsing [sent. 11819 len. 5]: I implored her forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 11820 len. 7]: I besought her to look up .
Parsing [sent. 11821 len. 30]: I ravaged Miss Mills 's work-box for a smelling-bottle , and in my agony of mind applied an ivory needle-case instead , and dropped all the needles over Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11822 len. 14]: I shook my fists at Jip , who was as frantic as myself .
Parsing [sent. 11823 len. 29]: I did every wild extravagance that could be done , and was a long way beyond the end of my wits when Miss Mills came into the room .
Parsing [sent. 11824 len. 7]: ` Who has done this ? '
Parsing [sent. 11825 len. 8]: exclaimed Miss Mills , succouring her friend .
Parsing [sent. 11826 len. 9]: I replied , ` I , Miss Mills !
Parsing [sent. 11827 len. 5]: I have done it !
Parsing [sent. 11828 len. 5]: Behold the destroyer ! '
Parsing [sent. 11829 len. 20]: - or words to that effect -- and hid my face from the light , in the sofa cushion .
Parsing [sent. 11830 len. 94]: At first Miss Mills thought it was a quarrel , and that we were verging on the Desert of Sahara ; but she soon found out how matters stood , for my dear affectionate little Dora , embracing her , began exclaiming that I was ' a poor labourer ' ; and then cried for me , and embraced me , and asked me would I let her give me all her money to keep , and then fell on Miss Mills 's neck , sobbing as if her tender heart were broken .
Parsing [sent. 11831 len. 13]: Miss Mills must have been born to be a blessing to us .
Parsing [sent. 11832 len. 68]: She ascertained from me in a few words what it was all about , comforted Dora , and gradually convinced her that I was not a labourer -- from my manner of stating the case I believe Dora concluded that I was a navigator , and went balancing myself up and down a plank all day with a wheelbarrow -- and so brought us together in peace .
Parsing [sent. 11833 len. 25]: When we were quite composed , and Dora had gone up-stairs to put some rose-water to her eyes , Miss Mills rang for tea .
Parsing [sent. 11834 len. 31]: In the ensuing interval , I told Miss Mills that she was evermore my friend , and that my heart must cease to vibrate ere I could forget her sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 11835 len. 20]: I then expounded to Miss Mills what I had endeavoured , so very unsuccessfully , to expound to Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11836 len. 31]: Miss Mills replied , on general principles , that the Cottage of content was better than the Palace of cold splendour , and that where love was , all was .
Parsing [sent. 11837 len. 33]: I said to Miss Mills that this was very true , and who should know it better than I , who loved Dora with a love that never mortal had experienced yet ?
Parsing [sent. 11838 len. 39]: But on Miss Mills observing , with despondency , that it were well indeed for some hearts if this were so , I explained that I begged leave to restrict the observation to mortals of the masculine gender .
Parsing [sent. 11839 len. 44]: I then put it to Miss Mills , to say whether she considered that there was or was not any practical merit in the suggestion I had been anxious to make , concerning the accounts , the housekeeping , and the Cookery Book ?
Parsing [sent. 11840 len. 21]: Miss Mills , after some consideration , thus replied : ` Mr. Copperfield , I will be plain with you .
Parsing [sent. 11841 len. 31]: Mental suffering and trial supply , in some natures , the place of years , and I will be as plain with you as if I were a Lady Abbess .
Parsing [sent. 11842 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 11843 len. 9]: The suggestion is not appropriate to our Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11844 len. 10]: Our dearest Dora is a favourite child of nature .
Parsing [sent. 11845 len. 13]: She is a thing of light , and airiness , and joy .
Parsing [sent. 11846 len. 27]: I am free to confess that if it could be done , it might be well , but -- ' And Miss Mills shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 11847 len. 48]: I was encouraged by this closing admission on the part of Miss Mills to ask her , whether , for Dora 's sake , if she had any opportunity of luring her attention to such preparations for an earnest life , she would avail herself of it ?
Parsing [sent. 11848 len. 49]: Miss Mills replied in the affirmative so readily , that I further asked her if she would take charge of the Cookery Book ; and , if she ever could insinuate it upon Dora 's acceptance , without frightening her , undertake to do me that crowning service .
Parsing [sent. 11849 len. 13]: Miss Mills accepted this trust , too ; but was not sanguine .
Parsing [sent. 11850 len. 26]: And Dora returned , looking such a lovely little creature , that I really doubted whether she ought to be troubled with anything so ordinary .
Parsing [sent. 11851 len. 77]: And she loved me so much , and was so captivating -LRB- particularly when she made Jip stand on his hind legs for toast , and when she pretended to hold that nose of his against the hot teapot for punishment because he would n't -RRB- , that I felt like a sort of Monster who had got into a Fairy 's bower , when I thought of having frightened her , and made her cry .
Parsing [sent. 11852 len. 46]: After tea we had the guitar ; and Dora sang those same dear old French songs about the impossibility of ever on any account leaving off dancing , La ra la , La ra la , until I felt a much greater Monster than before .
Parsing [sent. 11853 len. 54]: We had only one check to our pleasure , and that happened a little while before I took my leave , when , Miss Mills chancing to make some allusion to tomorrow morning , I unluckily let out that , being obliged to exert myself now , I got up at five o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 11854 len. 36]: Whether Dora had any idea that I was a Private Watchman , I am unable to say ; but it made a great impression on her , and she neither played nor sang any more .
Parsing [sent. 11855 len. 50]: It was still on her mind when I bade her adieu ; and she said to me , in her pretty coaxing way -- as if I were a doll , I used to think : ` Now do n't get up at five o'clock , you naughty boy .
Parsing [sent. 11856 len. 6]: It 's so nonsensical ! '
Parsing [sent. 11857 len. 16]: ` My love , ' said I , ' I have work to do . '
Parsing [sent. 11858 len. 8]: ` But do n't do it ! '
Parsing [sent. 11859 len. 3]: returned Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11860 len. 6]: ` Why should you ? '
Parsing [sent. 11861 len. 25]: It was impossible to say to that sweet little surprised face , otherwise than lightly and playfully , that we must work to live .
Parsing [sent. 11862 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11863 len. 4]: How ridiculous ! '
Parsing [sent. 11864 len. 3]: cried Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11865 len. 10]: ` How shall we live without , Dora ? '
Parsing [sent. 11866 len. 5]: said I. ` How ?
Parsing [sent. 11867 len. 4]: Any how ! '
Parsing [sent. 11868 len. 3]: said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11869 len. 44]: She seemed to think she had quite settled the question , and gave me such a triumphant little kiss , direct from her innocent heart , that I would hardly have put her out of conceit with her answer , for a fortune .
Parsing [sent. 11870 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 11871 len. 19]: I loved her , and I went on loving her , most absorbingly , entirely , and completely .
Parsing [sent. 11872 len. 75]: But going on , too , working pretty hard , and busily keeping red-hot all the irons I now had in the fire , I would sit sometimes of a night , opposite my aunt , thinking how I had frightened Dora that time , and how I could best make my way with a guitar-case through the forest of difficulty , until I used to fancy that my head was turning quite grey .
Parsing [sent. 11873 len. 23]: Chapter 38 A Dissolution of Partnership I did not allow my resolution , with respect to the Parliamentary Debates , to cool .
Parsing [sent. 11874 len. 33]: It was one of the irons I began to heat immediately , and one of the irons I kept hot , and hammered at , with a perseverance I may honestly admire .
Parsing [sent. 11875 len. 44]: I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography -LRB- which cost me ten and sixpence -RRB- ; and plunged into a sea of perplexity that brought me , in a few weeks , to the confines of distraction .
Parsing [sent. 11876 len. 76]: The changes that were rung upon dots , which in such a position meant such a thing , and in such another position something else , entirely different ; the wonderful vagaries that were played by circles ; the unaccountable consequences that resulted from marks like flies ' legs ; the tremendous effects of a curve in a wrong place ; not only troubled my waking hours , but reappeared before me in my sleep .
Parsing [sent. 11877 len. 78]: When I had groped my way , blindly , through these difficulties , and had mastered the alphabet , which was an Egyptian Temple in itself , there then appeared a procession of new horrors , called arbitrary characters ; the most despotic characters I have ever known ; who insisted , for instance , that a thing like the beginning of a cobweb , meant expectation , and that a pen-and-ink sky-rocket , stood for disadvantageous .
Parsing [sent. 11878 len. 55]: When I had fixed these wretches in my mind , I found that they had driven everything else out of it ; then , beginning again , I forgot them ; while I was picking them up , I dropped the other fragments of the system ; in short , it was almost heart-breaking .
Parsing [sent. 11879 len. 22]: It might have been quite heart-breaking , but for Dora , who was the stay and anchor of my tempest-driven bark .
Parsing [sent. 11880 len. 56]: Every scratch in the scheme was a gnarled oak in the forest of difficulty , and I went on cutting them down , one after another , with such vigour , that in three or four months I was in a condition to make an experiment on one of our crack speakers in the Commons .
Parsing [sent. 11881 len. 33]: Shall I ever forget how the crack speaker walked off from me before I began , and left my imbecile pencil staggering about the paper as if it were in a fit !
Parsing [sent. 11882 len. 10]: This would not do , it was quite clear .
Parsing [sent. 11883 len. 14]: I was flying too high , and should never get on , so .
Parsing [sent. 11884 len. 31]: I resorted to Traddles for advice ; who suggested that he should dictate speeches to me , at a pace , and with occasional stoppages , adapted to my weakness .
Parsing [sent. 11885 len. 46]: Very grateful for this friendly aid , I accepted the proposal ; and night after night , almost every night , for a long time , we had a sort of Private Parliament in Buckingham Street , after I came home from the Doctor 's .
Parsing [sent. 11886 len. 11]: I should like to see such a Parliament anywhere else !
Parsing [sent. 11887 len. 43]: My aunt and Mr. Dick represented the Government or the Opposition -LRB- as the case might be -RRB- , and Traddles , with the assistance of Enfield 's Speakers , or a volume of parliamentary orations , thundered astonishing invectives against them .
Parsing [sent. 11888 len. 105]: Standing by the table , with his finger in the page to keep the place , and his right arm flourishing above his head , Traddles , as Mr. Pitt , Mr. Fox , Mr. Sheridan , Mr. Burke , Lord Castlereagh , Viscount Sidmouth , or Mr. Canning , would work himself into the most violent heats , and deliver the most withering denunciations of the profligacy and corruption of my aunt and Mr. Dick ; while I used to sit , at a little distance , with my notebook on my knee , fagging after him with all my might and main .
Parsing [sent. 11889 len. 16]: The inconsistency and recklessness of Traddles were not to be exceeded by any real politician .
Parsing [sent. 11890 len. 27]: He was for any description of policy , in the compass of a week ; and nailed all sorts of colours to every denomination of mast .
Parsing [sent. 11891 len. 27]: My aunt , looking very like an immovable Chancellor of the Exchequer , would occasionally throw in an interruption or two , as ` Hear ! '
Parsing [sent. 11892 len. 5]: or ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 11893 len. 5]: or ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 11894 len. 30]: when the text seemed to require it : which was always a signal to Mr. Dick -LRB- a perfect country gentleman -RRB- to follow lustily with the same cry .
Parsing [sent. 11895 len. 34]: But Mr. Dick got taxed with such things in the course of his Parliamentary career , and was made responsible for such awful consequences , that he became uncomfortable in his mind sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 11896 len. 31]: I believe he actually began to be afraid he really had been doing something , tending to the annihilation of the British constitution , and the ruin of the country .
Parsing [sent. 11897 len. 21]: Often and often we pursued these debates until the clock pointed to midnight , and the candles were burning down .
Parsing [sent. 11898 len. 42]: The result of so much good practice was , that by and by I began to keep pace with Traddles pretty well , and should have been quite triumphant if I had had the least idea what my notes were about .
Parsing [sent. 11899 len. 46]: But , as to reading them after I had got them , I might as well have copied the Chinese inscriptions of an immense collection of tea-chests , or the golden characters on all the great red and green bottles in the chemists ' shops !
Parsing [sent. 11900 len. 16]: There was nothing for it , but to turn back and begin all over again .
Parsing [sent. 11901 len. 66]: It was very hard , but I turned back , though with a heavy heart , and began laboriously and methodically to plod over the same tedious ground at a snail 's pace ; stopping to examine minutely every speck in the way , on all sides , and making the most desperate efforts to know these elusive characters by sight wherever I met them .
Parsing [sent. 11902 len. 30]: I was always punctual at the office ; at the Doctor 's too : and I really did work , as the common expression is , like a cart-horse .
Parsing [sent. 11903 len. 28]: One day , when I went to the Commons as usual , I found Mr. Spenlow in the doorway looking extremely grave , and talking to himself .
Parsing [sent. 11904 len. 55]: As he was in the habit of complaining of pains in his head -- he had naturally a short throat , and I do seriously believe he over-starched himself -- I was at first alarmed by the idea that he was not quite right in that direction ; but he soon relieved my uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 11905 len. 61]: Instead of returning my ` Good morning ' with his usual affability , he looked at me in a distant , ceremonious manner , and coldly requested me to accompany him to a certain coffee-house , which , in those days , had a door opening into the Commons , just within the little archway in St. Paul 's Churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 11906 len. 28]: I complied , in a very uncomfortable state , and with a warm shooting all over me , as if my apprehensions were breaking out into buds .
Parsing [sent. 11907 len. 51]: When I allowed him to go on a little before , on account of the narrowness of the way , I observed that he carried his head with a lofty air that was particularly unpromising ; and my mind misgave me that he had found out about my darling Dora .
Parsing [sent. 11908 len. 85]: If I had not guessed this , on the way to the coffee-house , I could hardly have failed to know what was the matter when I followed him into an upstairs room , and found Miss Murdstone there , supported by a background of sideboard , on which were several inverted tumblers sustaining lemons , and two of those extraordinary boxes , all corners and flutings , for sticking knives and forks in , which , happily for mankind , are now obsolete .
Parsing [sent. 11909 len. 13]: Miss Murdstone gave me her chilly finger-nails , and sat severely rigid .
Parsing [sent. 11910 len. 23]: Mr. Spenlow shut the door , motioned me to a chair , and stood on the hearth-rug in front of the fireplace .
Parsing [sent. 11911 len. 25]: ` Have the goodness to show Mr. Copperfield , ' said Mr. Spenlow , what you have in your reticule , Miss Murdstone . '
Parsing [sent. 11912 len. 20]: I believe it was the old identical steel-clasped reticule of my childhood , that shut up like a bite .
Parsing [sent. 11913 len. 41]: Compressing her lips , in sympathy with the snap , Miss Murdstone opened it -- opening her mouth a little at the same time -- and produced my last letter to Dora , teeming with expressions of devoted affection . '
Parsing [sent. 11914 len. 11]: I believe that is your writing , Mr. Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 11915 len. 4]: said Mr. Spenlow .
Parsing [sent. 11916 len. 26]: I was very hot , and the voice I heard was very unlike mine , when I said , ` It is , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 11917 len. 47]: ` If I am not mistaken , ' said Mr. Spenlow , as Miss Murdstone brought a parcel of letters out of her reticule , tied round with the dearest bit of blue ribbon , ` those are also from your pen , Mr. Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 11918 len. 58]: I took them from her with a most desolate sensation ; and , glancing at such phrases at the top , as ` My ever dearest and own Dora , ' ` My best beloved angel , ' ` My blessed one for ever , ' and the like , blushed deeply , and inclined my head .
Parsing [sent. 11919 len. 7]: ` No , thank you ! '
Parsing [sent. 11920 len. 16]: said Mr. Spenlow , coldly , as I mechanically offered them back to him . '
Parsing [sent. 11921 len. 8]: I will not deprive you of them .
Parsing [sent. 11922 len. 11]: Miss Murdstone , be so good as to proceed ! '
Parsing [sent. 11923 len. 24]: That gentle creature , after a moment 's thoughtful survey of the carpet , delivered herself with much dry unction as follows . '
Parsing [sent. 11924 len. 22]: I must confess to having entertained my suspicions of Miss Spenlow , in reference to David Copperfield , for some time .
Parsing [sent. 11925 len. 24]: I observed Miss Spenlow and David Copperfield , when they first met ; and the impression made upon me then was not agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 11926 len. 31]: The depravity of the human heart is such -- ' ` You will oblige me , ma'am , ' interrupted Mr. Spenlow , ` by confining yourself to facts . '
Parsing [sent. 11927 len. 44]: Miss Murdstone cast down her eyes , shook her head as if protesting against this unseemly interruption , and with frowning dignity resumed : ` Since I am to confine myself to facts , I will state them as dryly as I can .
Parsing [sent. 11928 len. 11]: Perhaps that will be considered an acceptable course of proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 11929 len. 27]: I have already said , sir , that I have had my suspicions of Miss Spenlow , in reference to David Copperfield , for some time .
Parsing [sent. 11930 len. 16]: I have frequently endeavoured to find decisive corroboration of those suspicions , but without effect .
Parsing [sent. 11931 len. 40]: I have therefore forborne to mention them to Miss Spenlow 's father ' ; looking severely at him - ` knowing how little disposition there usually is in such cases , to acknowledge the conscientious discharge of duty . '
Parsing [sent. 11932 len. 28]: Mr. Spenlow seemed quite cowed by the gentlemanly sternness of Miss Murdstone 's manner , and deprecated her severity with a conciliatory little wave of his hand .
Parsing [sent. 11933 len. 62]: ` On my return to Norwood , after the period of absence occasioned by my brother 's marriage , ' pursued Miss Murdstone in a disdainful voice , ` and on the return of Miss Spenlow from her visit to her friend Miss Mills , I imagined that the manner of Miss Spenlow gave me greater occasion for suspicion than before .
Parsing [sent. 11934 len. 8]: Therefore I watched Miss Spenlow closely . '
Parsing [sent. 11935 len. 14]: Dear , tender little Dora , so unconscious of this Dragon 's eye !
Parsing [sent. 11936 len. 17]: ` Still , ' resumed Miss Murdstone , ' I found no proof until last night .
Parsing [sent. 11937 len. 47]: It appeared to me that Miss Spenlow received too many letters from her friend Miss Mills ; but Miss Mills being her friend with her father 's full concurrence , ' another telling blow at Mr. Spenlow , ` it was not for me to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 11938 len. 37]: If I may not be permitted to allude to the natural depravity of the human heart , at least I may -- I must -- be permitted , so far to refer to misplaced confidence . '
Parsing [sent. 11939 len. 7]: Mr. Spenlow apologetically murmured his assent .
Parsing [sent. 11940 len. 30]: ` Last evening after tea , ' pursued Miss Murdstone , ' I observed the little dog starting , rolling , and growling about the drawing-room , worrying something .
Parsing [sent. 11941 len. 19]: I said to Miss Spenlow , `` Dora , what is that the dog has in his mouth ?
Parsing [sent. 11942 len. 5]: It 's paper . ''
Parsing [sent. 11943 len. 21]: Miss Spenlow immediately put her hand to her frock , gave a sudden cry , and ran to the dog .
Parsing [sent. 11944 len. 19]: I interposed , and said , `` Dora , my love , you must permit me . '' '
Parsing [sent. 11945 len. 15]: Oh Jip , miserable Spaniel , this wretchedness , then , was your work !
Parsing [sent. 11946 len. 34]: ` Miss Spenlow endeavoured , ' said Miss Murdstone , ` to bribe me with kisses , work-boxes , and small articles of jewellery -- that , of course , I pass over .
Parsing [sent. 11947 len. 22]: The little dog retreated under the sofa on my approaching him , and was with great difficulty dislodged by the fire-irons .
Parsing [sent. 11948 len. 56]: Even when dislodged , he still kept the letter in his mouth ; and on my endeavouring to take it from him , at the imminent risk of being bitten , he kept it between his teeth so pertinaciously as to suffer himself to be held suspended in the air by means of the document .
Parsing [sent. 11949 len. 8]: At length I obtained possession of it .
Parsing [sent. 11950 len. 34]: After perusing it , I taxed Miss Spenlow with having many such letters in her possession ; and ultimately obtained from her the packet which is now in David Copperfield 's hand . '
Parsing [sent. 11951 len. 29]: Here she ceased ; and snapping her reticule again , and shutting her mouth , looked as if she might be broken , but could never be bent .
Parsing [sent. 11952 len. 17]: ` You have heard Miss Murdstone , ' said Mr. Spenlow , turning to me . '
Parsing [sent. 11953 len. 18]: I beg to ask , Mr. Copperfield , if you have anything to say in reply ? '
Parsing [sent. 11954 len. 89]: The picture I had before me , of the beautiful little treasure of my heart , sobbing and crying all night -- of her being alone , frightened , and wretched , then -- of her having so piteously begged and prayed that stony-hearted woman to forgive her -- of her having vainly offered her those kisses , work-boxes , and trinkets -- of her being in such grievous distress , and all for me -- very much impaired the little dignity I had been able to muster .
Parsing [sent. 11955 len. 24]: I am afraid I was in a tremulous state for a minute or so , though I did my best to disguise it .
Parsing [sent. 11956 len. 23]: ` There is nothing I can say , sir , ' I returned , ` except that all the blame is mine .
Parsing [sent. 11957 len. 19]: Dora -- ' ` Miss Spenlow , if you please , ' said her father , majestically . '
Parsing [sent. 11958 len. 32]: - was induced and persuaded by me , ' I went on , swallowing that colder designation , ` to consent to this concealment , and I bitterly regret it . '
Parsing [sent. 11959 len. 48]: ` You are very much to blame , sir , ' said Mr. Spenlow , walking to and fro upon the hearth-rug , and emphasizing what he said with his whole body instead of his head , on account of the stiffness of his cravat and spine .
Parsing [sent. 11960 len. 13]: ` You have done a stealthy and unbecoming action , Mr. Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 11961 len. 31]: When I take a gentleman to my house , no matter whether he is nineteen , twenty-nine , or ninety , I take him there in a spirit of confidence .
Parsing [sent. 11962 len. 17]: If he abuses my confidence , he commits a dishonourable action , Mr. Copperfield . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11963 len. 14]: I feel it , sir , I assure you , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 11964 len. 9]: ` But I never thought so , before .
Parsing [sent. 11965 len. 16]: Sincerely , honestly , indeed , Mr. Spenlow , I never thought so , before .
Parsing [sent. 11966 len. 12]: I love Miss Spenlow to that extent -- ' ` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 11967 len. 3]: nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 11968 len. 6]: said Mr. Spenlow , reddening .
Parsing [sent. 11969 len. 19]: ` Pray do n't tell me to my face that you love my daughter , Mr. Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 11970 len. 14]: ` Could I defend my conduct if I did not , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11971 len. 7]: I returned , with all humility .
Parsing [sent. 11972 len. 13]: ` Can you defend your conduct if you do , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11973 len. 10]: said Mr. Spenlow , stopping short upon the hearth-rug .
Parsing [sent. 11974 len. 16]: ` Have you considered your years , and my daughter 's years , Mr. Copperfield ?
Parsing [sent. 11975 len. 19]: Have you considered what it is to undermine the confidence that should subsist between my daughter and myself ?
Parsing [sent. 11976 len. 30]: Have you considered my daughter 's station in life , the projects I may contemplate for her advancement , the testamentary intentions I may have with reference to her ?
Parsing [sent. 11977 len. 9]: Have you considered anything , Mr. Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 11978 len. 39]: ` Very little , sir , I am afraid ; ' I answered , speaking to him as respectfully and sorrowfully as I felt ; ` but pray believe me , I have considered my own worldly position .
Parsing [sent. 11979 len. 68]: When I explained it to you , we were already engaged -- ' ' I BEG , ' said Mr. Spenlow , more like Punch than I had ever seen him , as he energetically struck one hand upon the other -- I could not help noticing that even in my despair ; ` that YOU Will NOT talk to me of engagements , Mr. Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 11980 len. 12]: The otherwise immovable Miss Murdstone laughed contemptuously in one short syllable .
Parsing [sent. 11981 len. 51]: ` When I explained my altered position to you , sir , ' I began again , substituting a new form of expression for what was so unpalatable to him , ` this concealment , into which I am so unhappy as to have led Miss Spenlow , had begun .
Parsing [sent. 11982 len. 25]: Since I have been in that altered position , I have strained every nerve , I have exerted every energy , to improve it .
Parsing [sent. 11983 len. 10]: I am sure I shall improve it in time .
Parsing [sent. 11984 len. 11]: Will you grant me time -- any length of time ?
Parsing [sent. 11985 len. 40]: We are both so young , sir , -- ' ` You are right , ' interrupted Mr. Spenlow , nodding his head a great many times , and frowning very much , ` you are both very young .
Parsing [sent. 11986 len. 5]: It 's all nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 11987 len. 9]: Let there be an end of the nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 11988 len. 12]: Take away those letters , and throw them in the fire .
Parsing [sent. 11989 len. 42]: Give me Miss Spenlow 's letters to throw in the fire ; and although our future intercourse must , you are aware , be restricted to the Commons here , we will agree to make no further mention of the past .
Parsing [sent. 11990 len. 19]: Come , Mr. Copperfield , you do n't want sense ; and this is the sensible course . '
Parsing [sent. 11991 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 11992 len. 9]: I could n't think of agreeing to it .
Parsing [sent. 11993 len. 14]: I was very sorry , but there was a higher consideration than sense .
Parsing [sent. 11994 len. 19]: Love was above all earthly considerations , and I loved Dora to idolatry , and Dora loved me .
Parsing [sent. 11995 len. 29]: I did n't exactly say so ; I softened it down as much as I could ; but I implied it , and I was resolute upon it .
Parsing [sent. 11996 len. 17]: I do n't think I made myself very ridiculous , but I know I was resolute .
Parsing [sent. 11997 len. 23]: ` Very well , Mr. Copperfield , ' said Mr. Spenlow , ' I must try my influence with my daughter . '
Parsing [sent. 11998 len. 42]: Miss Murdstone , by an expressive sound , a long drawn respiration , which was neither a sigh nor a moan , but was like both , gave it as her opinion that he should have done this at first . '
Parsing [sent. 11999 len. 21]: I must try , ' said Mr. Spenlow , confirmed by this support , ` my influence with my daughter .
Parsing [sent. 12000 len. 12]: Do you decline to take those letters , Mr. Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 12001 len. 9]: For I had laid them on the table .
Parsing [sent. 12002 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 12003 len. 23]: I told him I hoped he would not think it wrong , but I could n't possibly take them from Miss Murdstone .
Parsing [sent. 12004 len. 6]: ` Nor from me ? '
Parsing [sent. 12005 len. 4]: said Mr. Spenlow .
Parsing [sent. 12006 len. 13]: No , I replied with the profoundest respect ; nor from him .
Parsing [sent. 12007 len. 5]: ` Very well ! '
Parsing [sent. 12008 len. 4]: said Mr. Spenlow .
Parsing [sent. 12009 len. 13]: A silence succeeding , I was undecided whether to go or stay .
Parsing [sent. 12010 len. 99]: At length I was moving quietly towards the door , with the intention of saying that perhaps I should consult his feelings best by withdrawing : when he said , with his hands in his coat pockets , into which it was as much as he could do to get them ; and with what I should call , upon the whole , a decidedly pious air : ` You are probably aware , Mr. Copperfield , that I am not altogether destitute of worldly possessions , and that my daughter is my nearest and dearest relative ? '
Parsing [sent. 12011 len. 40]: I hurriedly made him a reply to the effect , that I hoped the error into which I had been betrayed by the desperate nature of my love , did not induce him to think me mercenary too ? '
Parsing [sent. 12012 len. 16]: I do n't allude to the matter in that light , ' said Mr. Spenlow .
Parsing [sent. 12013 len. 38]: ` It would be better for yourself , and all of us , if you WERE mercenary , Mr. Copperfield -- I mean , if you were more discreet and less influenced by all this youthful nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 12014 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 12015 len. 24]: I merely say , with quite another view , you are probably aware I have some property to bequeath to my child ? '
Parsing [sent. 12016 len. 5]: I certainly supposed so .
Parsing [sent. 12017 len. 73]: ` And you can hardly think , ' said Mr. Spenlow , ` having experience of what we see , in the Commons here , every day , of the various unaccountable and negligent proceedings of men , in respect of their testamentary arrangements -- of all subjects , the one on which perhaps the strangest revelations of human inconsistency are to be met with -- but that mine are made ? '
Parsing [sent. 12018 len. 8]: I inclined my head in acquiescence . '
Parsing [sent. 12019 len. 54]: I should not allow , ' said Mr. Spenlow , with an evident increase of pious sentiment , and slowly shaking his head as he poised himself upon his toes and heels alternately , ` my suitable provision for my child to be influenced by a piece of youthful folly like the present .
Parsing [sent. 12020 len. 5]: It is mere folly .
Parsing [sent. 12021 len. 3]: Mere nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 12022 len. 13]: In a little while , it will weigh lighter than any feather .
Parsing [sent. 12023 len. 47]: But I might -- I might -- if this silly business were not completely relinquished altogether , be induced in some anxious moment to guard her from , and surround her with protections against , the consequences of any foolish step in the way of marriage .
Parsing [sent. 12024 len. 54]: Now , Mr. Copperfield , I hope that you will not render it necessary for me to open , even for a quarter of an hour , that closed page in the book of life , and unsettle , even for a quarter of an hour , grave affairs long since composed . '
Parsing [sent. 12025 len. 20]: There was a serenity , a tranquillity , a calm sunset air about him , which quite affected me .
Parsing [sent. 12026 len. 35]: He was so peaceful and resigned -- clearly had his affairs in such perfect train , and so systematically wound up -- that he was a man to feel touched in the contemplation of .
Parsing [sent. 12027 len. 22]: I really think I saw tears rise to his eyes , from the depth of his own feeling of all this .
Parsing [sent. 12028 len. 6]: But what could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 12029 len. 10]: I could not deny Dora and my own heart .
Parsing [sent. 12030 len. 48]: When he told me I had better take a week to consider of what he had said , how could I say I would n't take a week , yet how could I fail to know that no amount of weeks could influence such love as mine ?
Parsing [sent. 12031 len. 32]: ` In the meantime , confer with Miss Trotwood , or with any person with any knowledge of life , ' said Mr. Spenlow , adjusting his cravat with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 12032 len. 9]: ` Take a week , Mr. Copperfield . '
Parsing [sent. 12033 len. 29]: I submitted ; and , with a countenance as expressive as I was able to make it of dejected and despairing constancy , came out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 12034 len. 102]: Miss Murdstone 's heavy eyebrows followed me to the door -- I say her eyebrows rather than her eyes , because they were much more important in her face -- and she looked so exactly as she used to look , at about that hour of the morning , in our parlour at Blunderstone , that I could have fancied I had been breaking down in my lessons again , and that the dead weight on my mind was that horrible old spelling-book , with oval woodcuts , shaped , to my youthful fancy , like the glasses out of spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 12035 len. 81]: When I got to the office , and , shutting out old Tiffey and the rest of them with my hands , sat at my desk , in my own particular nook , thinking of this earthquake that had taken place so unexpectedly , and in the bitterness of my spirit cursing Jip , I fell into such a state of torment about Dora , that I wonder I did not take up my hat and rush insanely to Norwood .
Parsing [sent. 12036 len. 53]: The idea of their frightening her , and making her cry , and of my not being there to comfort her , was so excruciating , that it impelled me to write a wild letter to Mr. Spenlow , beseeching him not to visit upon her the consequences of my awful destiny .
Parsing [sent. 12037 len. 87]: I implored him to spare her gentle nature -- not to crush a fragile flower -- and addressed him generally , to the best of my remembrance , as if , instead of being her father , he had been an Ogre , or the Dragon of Wantley .3 This letter I sealed and laid upon his desk before he returned ; and when he came in , I saw him , through the half-opened door of his room , take it up and read it .
Parsing [sent. 12038 len. 40]: He said nothing about it all the morning ; but before he went away in the afternoon he called me in , and told me that I need not make myself at all uneasy about his daughter 's happiness .
Parsing [sent. 12039 len. 24]: He had assured her , he said , that it was all nonsense ; and he had nothing more to say to her .
Parsing [sent. 12040 len. 25]: He believed he was an indulgent father -LRB- as indeed he was -RRB- , and I might spare myself any solicitude on her account .
Parsing [sent. 12041 len. 44]: ` You may make it necessary , if you are foolish or obstinate , Mr. Copperfield , ' he observed , ` for me to send my daughter abroad again , for a term ; but I have a better opinion of you .
Parsing [sent. 12042 len. 14]: I hope you will be wiser than that , in a few days .
Parsing [sent. 12043 len. 40]: As to Miss Murdstone , ' for I had alluded to her in the letter , ' I respect that lady 's vigilance , and feel obliged to her ; but she has strict charge to avoid the subject .
Parsing [sent. 12044 len. 15]: All I desire , Mr. Copperfield , is , that it should be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 12045 len. 16]: All you have got to do , Mr. Copperfield , is to forget it . '
Parsing [sent. 12046 len. 2]: All !
Parsing [sent. 12047 len. 15]: In the note I wrote to Miss Mills , I bitterly quoted this sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 12048 len. 18]: All I had to do , I said , with gloomy sarcasm , was to forget Dora .
Parsing [sent. 12049 len. 9]: That was all , and what was that !
Parsing [sent. 12050 len. 11]: I entreated Miss Mills to see me , that evening .
Parsing [sent. 12051 len. 28]: If it could not be done with Mr. Mills 's sanction and concurrence , I besought a clandestine interview in the back kitchen where the Mangle was .
Parsing [sent. 12052 len. 25]: I informed her that my reason was tottering on its throne , and only she , Miss Mills , could prevent its being deposed .
Parsing [sent. 12053 len. 39]: I signed myself , hers distractedly ; and I could n't help feeling , while I read this composition over , before sending it by a porter , that it was something in the style of Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 12054 len. 6]: However , I sent it .
Parsing [sent. 12055 len. 38]: At night I repaired to Miss Mills 's street , and walked up and down , until I was stealthily fetched in by Miss Mills 's maid , and taken the area way to the back kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 12056 len. 42]: I have since seen reason to believe that there was nothing on earth to prevent my going in at the front door , and being shown up into the drawing-room , except Miss Mills 's love of the romantic and mysterious .
Parsing [sent. 12057 len. 11]: In the back kitchen , I raved as became me .
Parsing [sent. 12058 len. 23]: I went there , I suppose , to make a fool of myself , and I am quite sure I did it .
Parsing [sent. 12059 len. 20]: Miss Mills had received a hasty note from Dora , telling her that all was discovered , and saying .
Parsing [sent. 12060 len. 14]: ` Oh pray come to me , Julia , do , do ! '
Parsing [sent. 12061 len. 31]: But Miss Mills , mistrusting the acceptability of her presence to the higher powers , had not yet gone ; and we were all benighted in the Desert of Sahara .
Parsing [sent. 12062 len. 16]: Miss Mills had a wonderful flow of words , and liked to pour them out .
Parsing [sent. 12063 len. 24]: I could not help feeling , though she mingled her tears with mine , that she had a dreadful luxury in our afflictions .
Parsing [sent. 12064 len. 16]: She petted them , as I may say , and made the most of them .
Parsing [sent. 12065 len. 24]: A deep gulf , she observed , had opened between Dora and me , and Love could only span it with its rainbow .
Parsing [sent. 12066 len. 20]: Love must suffer in this stern world ; it ever had been so , it ever would be so .
Parsing [sent. 12067 len. 7]: No matter , Miss Mills remarked .
Parsing [sent. 12068 len. 15]: Hearts confined by cobwebs would burst at last , and then Love was avenged .
Parsing [sent. 12069 len. 14]: This was small consolation , but Miss Mills would n't encourage fallacious hopes .
Parsing [sent. 12070 len. 30]: She made me much more wretched than I was before , and I felt -LRB- and told her with the deepest gratitude -RRB- that she was indeed a friend .
Parsing [sent. 12071 len. 35]: We resolved that she should go to Dora the first thing in the morning , and find some means of assuring her , either by looks or words , of my devotion and misery .
Parsing [sent. 12072 len. 16]: We parted , overwhelmed with grief ; and I think Miss Mills enjoyed herself completely .
Parsing [sent. 12073 len. 27]: I confided all to my aunt when I got home ; and in spite of all she could say to me , went to bed despairing .
Parsing [sent. 12074 len. 10]: I got up despairing , and went out despairing .
Parsing [sent. 12075 len. 13]: It was Saturday morning , and I went straight to the Commons .
Parsing [sent. 12076 len. 35]: I was surprised , when I came within sight of our office-door , to see the ticket-porters standing outside talking together , and some half-dozen stragglers gazing at the windows which were shut up .
Parsing [sent. 12077 len. 20]: I quickened my pace , and , passing among them , wondering at their looks , went hurriedly in .
Parsing [sent. 12078 len. 11]: The clerks were there , but nobody was doing anything .
Parsing [sent. 12079 len. 30]: Old Tiffey , for the first time in his life I should think , was sitting on somebody else 's stool , and had not hung up his hat .
Parsing [sent. 12080 len. 18]: ` This is a dreadful calamity , Mr. Copperfield , ' said he , as I entered .
Parsing [sent. 12081 len. 5]: ` What is ? '
Parsing [sent. 12082 len. 3]: I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 12083 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 12084 len. 7]: ` Do n't you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 12085 len. 14]: cried Tiffey , and all the rest of them , coming round me .
Parsing [sent. 12086 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 12087 len. 9]: said I , looking from face to face .
Parsing [sent. 12088 len. 8]: ` Mr. Spenlow , ' said Tiffey .
Parsing [sent. 12089 len. 6]: ` What about him ! '
Parsing [sent. 12090 len. 4]: ` Dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 12091 len. 22]: I thought it was the office reeling , and not I , as one of the clerks caught hold of me .
Parsing [sent. 12092 len. 18]: They sat me down in a chair , untied my neck-cloth , and brought me some water .
Parsing [sent. 12093 len. 10]: I have no idea whether this took any time .
Parsing [sent. 12094 len. 4]: ` Dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 12095 len. 46]: said I. ` He dined in town yesterday , and drove down in the phaeton by himself , ' said Tiffey , ` having sent his own groom home by the coach , as he sometimes did , you know -- ' ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 12096 len. 8]: ` The phaeton went home without him .
Parsing [sent. 12097 len. 7]: The horses stopped at the stable-gate .
Parsing [sent. 12098 len. 8]: The man went out with a lantern .
Parsing [sent. 12099 len. 6]: Nobody in the carriage . '
Parsing [sent. 12100 len. 7]: ` Had they run away ? '
Parsing [sent. 12101 len. 35]: ` They were not hot , ' said Tiffey , putting on his glasses ; ` no hotter , I understand , than they would have been , going down at the usual pace .
Parsing [sent. 12102 len. 14]: The reins were broken , but they had been dragging on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 12103 len. 17]: The house was roused up directly , and three of them went out along the road .
Parsing [sent. 12104 len. 8]: They found him a mile off . '
Parsing [sent. 12105 len. 15]: ` More than a mile off , Mr. Tiffey , ' interposed a junior .
Parsing [sent. 12106 len. 4]: ` Was it ?
Parsing [sent. 12107 len. 40]: I believe you are right , ' said Tiffey , -- ` more than a mile off -- not far from the church -- lying partly on the roadside , and partly on the path , upon his face .
Parsing [sent. 12108 len. 45]: Whether he fell out in a fit , or got out , feeling ill before the fit came on -- or even whether he was quite dead then , though there is no doubt he was quite insensible -- no one appears to know .
Parsing [sent. 12109 len. 9]: If he breathed , certainly he never spoke .
Parsing [sent. 12110 len. 16]: Medical assistance was got as soon as possible , but it was quite useless . '
Parsing [sent. 12111 len. 17]: I can not describe the state of mind into which I was thrown by this intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 12112 len. 132]: The shock of such an event happening so suddenly , and happening to one with whom I had been in any respect at variance -- the appalling vacancy in the room he had occupied so lately , where his chair and table seemed to wait for him , and his handwriting of yesterday was like a ghost -- the in - definable impossibility of separating him from the place , and feeling , when the door opened , as if he might come in -- the lazy hush and rest there was in the office , and the insatiable relish with which our people talked about it , and other people came in and out all day , and gorged themselves with the subject -- this is easily intelligible to anyone .
Parsing [sent. 12113 len. 27]: What I can not describe is , how , in the innermost recesses of my own heart , I had a lurking jealousy even of Death .
Parsing [sent. 12114 len. 18]: How I felt as if its might would push me from my ground in Dora 's thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 12115 len. 19]: How I was , in a grudging way I have no words for , envious of her grief .
Parsing [sent. 12116 len. 19]: How it made me restless to think of her weeping to others , or being consoled by others .
Parsing [sent. 12117 len. 34]: How I had a grasping , avaricious wish to shut out everybody from her but myself , and to be all in all to her , at that unseasonable time of all times .
Parsing [sent. 12118 len. 67]: In the trouble of this state of mind -- not exclusively my own , I hope , but known to others -- I went down to Norwood that night ; and finding from one of the servants , when I made my inquiries at the door , that Miss Mills was there , got my aunt to direct a letter to her , which I wrote .
Parsing [sent. 12119 len. 19]: I deplored the untimely death of Mr. Spenlow , most sincerely , and shed tears in doing so .
Parsing [sent. 12120 len. 48]: I entreated her to tell Dora , if Dora were in a state to hear it , that he had spoken to me with the utmost kindness and consideration ; and had coupled nothing but tenderness , not a single or reproachful word , with her name .
Parsing [sent. 12121 len. 30]: I know I did this selfishly , to have my name brought before her ; but I tried to believe it was an act of justice to his memory .
Parsing [sent. 12122 len. 6]: Perhaps I did believe it .
Parsing [sent. 12123 len. 23]: My aunt received a few lines next day in reply ; addressed , outside , to her ; within , to me .
Parsing [sent. 12124 len. 37]: Dora was overcome by grief ; and when her friend had asked her should she send her love to me , had only cried , as she was always crying , ` Oh , dear papa !
Parsing [sent. 12125 len. 6]: oh , poor papa ! '
Parsing [sent. 12126 len. 15]: But she had not said No , and that I made the most of .
Parsing [sent. 12127 len. 21]: Mr. jorkins , who had been at Norwood since the occurrence , came to the office a few days afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 12128 len. 24]: He and Tiffey were closeted together for some few moments , and then Tiffey looked out at the door and beckoned me in .
Parsing [sent. 12129 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 12130 len. 4]: said Mr. jorkins .
Parsing [sent. 12131 len. 43]: ` Mr. Tiffey and myself , Mr. Copperfield , are about to examine the desks , the drawers , and other such repositories of the deceased , with the view of sealing up his private papers , and searching for a Will .
Parsing [sent. 12132 len. 9]: There is no trace of any , elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 12133 len. 16]: It may be as well for you to assist us , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 12134 len. 37]: I had been in agony to obtain some knowledge of the circumstances in which my Dora would be placed -- as , in whose guardianship , and so forth -- and this was something towards it .
Parsing [sent. 12135 len. 23]: We began the search at once ; Mr. jorkins unlocking the drawers and desks , and we all taking out the papers .
Parsing [sent. 12136 len. 22]: The office-papers we placed on one side , and the private papers -LRB- which were not numerous -RRB- on the other .
Parsing [sent. 12137 len. 39]: We were very grave ; and when we came to a stray seal , or pencil-case , or ring , or any little article of that kind which we associated personally with him , we spoke very low .
Parsing [sent. 12138 len. 54]: We had sealed up several packets ; and were still going on dustily and quietly , when Mr. jorkins said to us , applying exactly the same words to his late partner as his late partner had applied to him : ` Mr. Spenlow was very difficult to move from the beaten track .
Parsing [sent. 12139 len. 6]: You know what he was !
Parsing [sent. 12140 len. 12]: I am disposed to think he had made no will . '
Parsing [sent. 12141 len. 9]: ` Oh , I know he had ! '
Parsing [sent. 12142 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 12143 len. 8]: They both stopped and looked at me .
Parsing [sent. 12144 len. 33]: ` On the very day when I last saw him , ' said I , ` he told me that he had , and that his affairs were long since settled . '
Parsing [sent. 12145 len. 12]: Mr. jorkins and old Tiffey shook their heads with one accord .
Parsing [sent. 12146 len. 9]: ` That looks unpromising , ' said Tiffey .
Parsing [sent. 12147 len. 9]: ` Very unpromising , ' said Mr. jorkins .
Parsing [sent. 12148 len. 11]: ` Surely you do n't doubt -- ' I began .
Parsing [sent. 12149 len. 7]: ` My good Mr. Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 12150 len. 59]: said Tiffey , laying his hand upon my arm , and shutting up both his eyes as he shook his head : ` if you had been in the Commons as long as I have , you would know that there is no subject on which men are so inconsistent , and so little to be trusted . '
Parsing [sent. 12151 len. 14]: ` Why , bless my soul , he made that very remark ! '
Parsing [sent. 12152 len. 5]: I replied persistently . '
Parsing [sent. 12153 len. 11]: I should call that almost final , ' observed Tiffey .
Parsing [sent. 12154 len. 9]: ` My opinion is - no will . '
Parsing [sent. 12155 len. 18]: It appeared a wonderful thing to me , but it turned out that there was no will .
Parsing [sent. 12156 len. 39]: He had never so much as thought of making one , so far as his papers afforded any evidence ; for there was no kind of hint , sketch , or memorandum , of any testamentary intention whatever .
Parsing [sent. 12157 len. 20]: What was scarcely less astonishing to me , was , that his affairs were in a most disordered state .
Parsing [sent. 12158 len. 28]: It was extremely difficult , I heard , to make out what he owed , or what he had paid , or of what he died possessed .
Parsing [sent. 12159 len. 19]: It was considered likely that for years he could have had no clear opinion on these subjects himself .
Parsing [sent. 12160 len. 71]: By little and little it came out , that , in the competition on all points of appearance and gentility then running high in the Commons , he had spent more than his professional income , which was not a very large one , and had reduced his private means , if they ever had been great -LRB- which was exceedingly doubtful -RRB- , to a very low ebb indeed .
Parsing [sent. 12161 len. 67]: There was a sale of the furniture and lease , at Norwood ; and Tiffey told me , little thinking how interested I was in the story , that , paying all the just debts of the deceased , and deducting his share of outstanding bad and doubtful debts due to the firm , he would n't give a thousand pounds for all the assets remaining .
Parsing [sent. 12162 len. 10]: This was at the expiration of about six weeks .
Parsing [sent. 12163 len. 49]: I had suffered tortures all the time ; and thought I really must have laid violent hands upon myself , when Miss Mills still reported to me , that my broken-hearted little Dora would say nothing , when I was mentioned , but ` Oh , poor papa !
Parsing [sent. 12164 len. 6]: Oh , dear papa ! '
Parsing [sent. 12165 len. 40]: Also , that she had no other relations than two aunts , maiden sisters of Mr. Spenlow , who lived at Putney , and who had not held any other than chance communication with their brother for many years .
Parsing [sent. 12166 len. 67]: Not that they had ever quarrelled -LRB- Miss Mills informed me -RRB- ; but that having been , on the occasion of Dora 's christening , invited to tea , when they considered themselves privileged to be invited to dinner , they had expressed their opinion in writing , that it was ` better for the happiness of all parties ' that they should stay away .
Parsing [sent. 12167 len. 15]: Since which they had gone their road , and their brother had gone his .
Parsing [sent. 12168 len. 19]: These two ladies now emerged from their retirement , and proposed to take Dora to live at Putney .
Parsing [sent. 12169 len. 18]: Dora , clinging to them both , and weeping , exclaimed , ' O yes , aunts !
Parsing [sent. 12170 len. 12]: Please take Julia Mills and me and Jip to Putney ! '
Parsing [sent. 12171 len. 10]: So they went , very soon after the funeral .
Parsing [sent. 12172 len. 34]: How I found time to haunt Putney , I am sure I do n't know ; but I contrived , by some means or other , to prowl about the neighbourhood pretty often .
Parsing [sent. 12173 len. 50]: Miss Mills , for the more exact discharge of the duties of friendship , kept a journal ; and she used to meet me sometimes , on the Common , and read it , or -LRB- if she had not time to do that -RRB- lend it to me .

Parsing [sent. 12241 len. 9]: -- embraces J. and sobs herself to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 12242 len. 14]: -LRB- Must not D. C. confine himself to the broad pinions of Time ?
Parsing [sent. 12243 len. 17]: J. M. -RRB- ' Miss Mills and her journal were my sole consolation at this period .
Parsing [sent. 12244 len. 43]: To see her , who had seen Dora but a little while before -- to trace the initial letter of Dora 's name through her sympathetic pages -- to be made more and more miserable by her -- were my only comforts .
Parsing [sent. 12245 len. 74]: I felt as if I had been living in a palace of cards , which had tumbled down , leaving only Miss Mills and me among the ruins ; I felt as if some grim enchanter had drawn a magic circle round the innocent goddess of my heart , which nothing indeed but those same strong pinions , capable of carrying so many people over so much , would enable me to enter !
Parsing [sent. 12246 len. 69]: Chapter 39 Wickfield and Heep My aunt , beginning , I imagine , to be made seriously uncomfortable by my prolonged dejection , made a pretence of being anxious that I should go to Dover , to see that all was working well at the cottage , which was let ; and to conclude an agreement , with the same tenant , for a longer term of occupation .
Parsing [sent. 12247 len. 17]: Janet was drafted into the service of Mrs. Strong , where I saw her every day .
Parsing [sent. 12248 len. 41]: She had been undecided , on leaving Dover , whether or no to give the finishing touch to that renunciation of mankind in which she had been educated , by marrying a pilot ; but she decided against that venture .
Parsing [sent. 12249 len. 21]: Not so much for the sake of principle , I believe , as because she happened not to like him .
Parsing [sent. 12250 len. 35]: Although it required an effort to leave Miss Mills , I fell rather willingly into my aunt 's pretence , as a means of enabling me to pass a few tranquil hours with Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 12251 len. 48]: I consulted the good Doctor relative to an absence of three days ; and the Doctor wishing me to take that relaxation , -- he wished me to take more ; but my energy could not bear that , -- I made up my mind to go .
Parsing [sent. 12252 len. 20]: As to the Commons , I had no great occasion to be particular about my duties in that quarter .
Parsing [sent. 12253 len. 29]: To say the truth , we were getting in no very good odour among the tip-top proctors , and were rapidly sliding down to but a doubtful position .
Parsing [sent. 12254 len. 66]: The business had been indifferent under Mr. jorkins , before Mr. Spenlow 's time ; and although it had been quickened by the infusion of new blood , and by the display which Mr. Spenlow made , still it was not established on a sufficiently strong basis to bear , without being shaken , such a blow as the sudden loss of its active manager .
Parsing [sent. 12255 len. 6]: It fell off very much .
Parsing [sent. 12256 len. 32]: Mr. jorkins , notwithstanding his reputation in the firm , was an easy-going , incapable sort of man , whose reputation out of doors was not calculated to back it up .
Parsing [sent. 12257 len. 33]: I was turned over to him now , and when I saw him take his snuff and let the business go , I regretted my aunt 's thousand pounds more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 12258 len. 9]: But this was not the worst of it .
Parsing [sent. 12259 len. 56]: There were a number of hangers-on and outsiders about the Commons , who , without being proctors themselves , dabbled in common-form business , and got it done by real proctors , who lent their names in consideration of a share in the spoil ; -- and there were a good many of these too .
Parsing [sent. 12260 len. 33]: As our house now wanted business on any terms , we joined this noble band ; and threw out lures to the hangers-on and outsiders , to bring their business to us .
Parsing [sent. 12261 len. 28]: Marriage licences and small probates were what we all looked for , and what paid us best ; and the competition for these ran very high indeed .
Parsing [sent. 12262 len. 82]: Kidnappers and inveiglers were planted in all the avenues of entrance to the Commons , with instructions to do their utmost to cut off all persons in mourning , and all gentlemen with anything bashful in their appearance , and entice them to the offices in which their respective employers were interested ; which instructions were so well observed , that I myself , before I was known by sight , was twice hustled into the premises of our principal opponent .
Parsing [sent. 12263 len. 59]: The conflicting interests of these touting gentlemen being of a nature to irritate their feelings , personal collisions took place ; and the Commons was even scandalized by our principal inveigler -LRB- who had formerly been in the wine trade , and afterwards in the sworn brokery line -RRB- walking about for some days with a black eye .
Parsing [sent. 12264 len. 60]: Any one of these scouts used to think nothing of politely assisting an old lady in black out of a vehicle , killing any proctor whom she inquired for , representing his employer as the lawful successor and representative of that proctor , and bearing the old lady off -LRB- sometimes greatly affected -RRB- to his employer 's office .
Parsing [sent. 12265 len. 10]: Many captives were brought to me in this way .
Parsing [sent. 12266 len. 47]: As to marriage licences , the competition rose to such a pitch , that a shy gentleman in want of one , had nothing to do but submit himself to the first inveigler , or be fought for , and become the prey of the strongest .
Parsing [sent. 12267 len. 46]: One of our clerks , who was an outsider , used , in the height of this contest , to sit with his hat on , that he might be ready to rush out and swear before a surrogate any victim who was brought in .
Parsing [sent. 12268 len. 13]: The system of inveigling continues , I believe , to this day .
Parsing [sent. 12269 len. 56]: The last time I was in the Commons , a civil able-bodied person in a white apron pounced out upon me from a doorway , and whispering the word ` Marriage-licence ' in my ear , was with great difficulty prevented from taking me up in his arms and lifting me into a proctor 's .
Parsing [sent. 12270 len. 10]: From this digression , let me proceed to Dover .
Parsing [sent. 12271 len. 35]: I found everything in a satisfactory state at the cottage ; and was enabled to gratify my aunt exceedingly by reporting that the tenant inherited her feud , and waged incessant war against donkeys .
Parsing [sent. 12272 len. 27]: Having settled the little business I had to transact there , and slept there one night , I walked on to Canterbury early in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 12273 len. 26]: It was now winter again ; and the fresh , cold windy day , and the sweeping downland , brightened up my hopes a little .
Parsing [sent. 12274 len. 24]: Coming into Canterbury , I loitered through the old streets with a sober pleasure that calmed my spirits , and eased my heart .
Parsing [sent. 12275 len. 20]: There were the old signs , the old names over the shops , the old people serving in them .
Parsing [sent. 12276 len. 33]: It appeared so long , since I had been a schoolboy there , that I wondered the place was so little changed , until I reflected how little I was changed myself .
Parsing [sent. 12277 len. 26]: Strange to say , that quiet influence which was inseparable in my mind from Agnes , seemed to pervade even the city where she dwelt .
Parsing [sent. 12278 len. 107]: The venerable cathedral towers , and the old jackdaws and rooks whose airy voices made them more retired than perfect silence would have done ; the battered gateways , one stuck full with statues , long thrown down , and crumbled away , like the reverential pilgrims who had gazed upon them ; the still nooks , where the ivied growth of centuries crept over gabled ends and ruined walls ; the ancient houses , the pastoral landscape of field , orchard , and garden ; everywhere -- on everything - I felt the same serener air , the same calm , thoughtful , softening spirit .
Parsing [sent. 12279 len. 40]: Arrived at Mr. Wickfield 's house , I found , in the little lower room on the ground floor , where Uriah Heep had been of old accustomed to sit , Mr. Micawber plying his pen with great assiduity .
Parsing [sent. 12280 len. 22]: He was dressed in a legal-looking suit of black , and loomed , burly and large , in that small office .
Parsing [sent. 12281 len. 15]: Mr. Micawber was extremely glad to see me , but a little confused too .
Parsing [sent. 12282 len. 17]: He would have conducted me immediately into the presence of Uriah , but I declined . '
Parsing [sent. 12283 len. 22]: I know the house of old , you recollect , ' said I , ` and will find my way upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 12284 len. 11]: How do you like the law , Mr. Micawber ? '
Parsing [sent. 12285 len. 9]: ` My dear Copperfield , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 12286 len. 25]: ` To a man possessed of the higher imaginative powers , the objection to legal studies is the amount of detail which they involve .
Parsing [sent. 12287 len. 35]: Even in our professional correspondence , ' said Mr. Micawber , glancing at some letters he was writing , ` the mind is not at liberty to soar to any exalted form of expression .
Parsing [sent. 12288 len. 8]: Still , it is a great pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 12289 len. 5]: A great pursuit ! '
Parsing [sent. 12290 len. 36]: He then told me that he had become the tenant of Uriah Heep 's old house ; and that Mrs. Micawber would be delighted to receive me , once more , under her own roof .
Parsing [sent. 12291 len. 35]: ` It is humble , ' said Mr. Micawber , ' - to quote a favourite expression of my friend Heep ; but it may prove the stepping-stone to more ambitious domiciliary accommodation . '
Parsing [sent. 12292 len. 23]: I asked him whether he had reason , so far , to be satisfied with his friend Heep 's treatment of him ?
Parsing [sent. 12293 len. 49]: He got up to ascertain if the door were close shut , before he replied , in a lower voice : ` My dear Copperfield , a man who labours under the pressure of pecuniary embarrassments , is , with the generality of people , at a disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 12294 len. 25]: That disadvantage is not diminished , when that pressure necessitates the drawing of stipendiary emoluments , before those emoluments are strictly due and payable .
Parsing [sent. 12295 len. 44]: All I can say is , that my friend Heep has responded to appeals to which I need not more particularly refer , in a manner calculated to redound equally to the honour of his head , and of his heart . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12296 len. 19]: I should not have supposed him to be very free with his money either , ' I observed .
Parsing [sent. 12297 len. 5]: ` Pardon me ! '
Parsing [sent. 12298 len. 24]: said Mr. Micawber , with an air of constraint , ' I speak of my friend Heep as I have experience . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12299 len. 13]: I am glad your experience is so favourable , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 12300 len. 20]: ` You are very obliging , my dear Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber ; and hummed a tune .
Parsing [sent. 12301 len. 10]: ` Do you see much of Mr. Wickfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 12302 len. 8]: I asked , to change the subject .
Parsing [sent. 12303 len. 11]: ` Not much , ' said Mr. Micawber , slightingly .
Parsing [sent. 12304 len. 29]: ` Mr. Wickfield is , I dare say , a man of very excellent intentions ; but he is -- in short , he is obsolete . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12305 len. 20]: I am afraid his partner seeks to make him so , ' said I. ` My dear Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 12306 len. 20]: returned Mr. Micawber , after some uneasy evolutions on his stool , ` allow me to offer a remark !
Parsing [sent. 12307 len. 10]: I am here , in a capacity of confidence .
Parsing [sent. 12308 len. 10]: I am here , in a position of trust .
Parsing [sent. 12309 len. 49]: The discussion of some topics , even with Mrs. Micawber herself -LRB- so long the partner of my various vicissitudes , and a woman of a remarkable lucidity of intellect -RRB- , is , I am led to consider , incompatible with the functions now devolving on me .
Parsing [sent. 12310 len. 22]: I would therefore take the liberty of suggesting that in our friendly intercourse -- which I trust will never be disturbed !
Parsing [sent. 12311 len. 6]: -- we draw a line .
Parsing [sent. 12312 len. 65]: On one side of this line , ' said Mr. Micawber , representing it on the desk with the office ruler , ` is the whole range of the human intellect , with a trifling exception ; on the other , IS that exception ; that is to say , the affairs of Messrs Wickfield and Heep , with all belonging and appertaining thereunto .
Parsing [sent. 12313 len. 23]: I trust I give no offence to the companion of my youth , in submitting this proposition to his cooler judgement ? '
Parsing [sent. 12314 len. 35]: Though I saw an uneasy change in Mr. Micawber , which sat tightly on him , as if his new duties were a misfit , I felt I had no right to be offended .
Parsing [sent. 12315 len. 18]: My telling him so , appeared to relieve him ; and he shook hands with me . '
Parsing [sent. 12316 len. 21]: I am charmed , Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` let me assure you , with Miss Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 12317 len. 18]: She is a very superior young lady , of very remarkable attractions , graces , and virtues .
Parsing [sent. 12318 len. 28]: Upon my honour , ' said Mr. Micawber , indefinitely kissing his hand and bowing with his genteelest air , ' I do Homage to Miss Wickfield !
Parsing [sent. 12319 len. 4]: Hem ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 12320 len. 65]: I am glad of that , at least , ' said I. ` If you had not assured us , my dear Copperfield , on the occasion of that agreeable afternoon we had the happiness of passing with you , that D. was your favourite letter , ' said Mr. Micawber , ' I should unquestionably have supposed that A. had been so . '
Parsing [sent. 12321 len. 71]: We have all some experience of a feeling , that comes over us occasionally , of what we are saying and doing having been said and done before , in a remote time -- of our having been surrounded , dim ages ago , by the same faces , objects , and circumstances -- of our knowing perfectly what will be said next , as if we suddenly remembered it !
Parsing [sent. 12322 len. 19]: I never had this mysterious impression more strongly in my life , than before he uttered those words .
Parsing [sent. 12323 len. 23]: I took my leave of Mr. Micawber , for the time , charging him with my best remembrances to all at home .
Parsing [sent. 12324 len. 72]: As I left him , resuming his stool and his pen , and rolling his head in his stock , to get it into easier writing order , I clearly perceived that there was something interposed between him and me , since he had come into his new functions , which prevented our getting at each other as we used to do , and quite altered the character of our intercourse .
Parsing [sent. 12325 len. 20]: There was no one in the quaint old drawing-room , though it presented tokens of Mrs. Heep 's whereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 12326 len. 28]: I looked into the room still belonging to Agnes , and saw her sitting by the fire , at a pretty old-fashioned desk she had , writing .
Parsing [sent. 12327 len. 9]: My darkening the light made her look up .
Parsing [sent. 12328 len. 26]: What a pleasure to be the cause of that bright change in her attentive face , and the object of that sweet regard and welcome !
Parsing [sent. 12329 len. 6]: ` Ah , Agnes ! '
Parsing [sent. 12330 len. 24]: said I , when we were sitting together , side by side ; ' I have missed you so much , lately ! '
Parsing [sent. 12331 len. 4]: ` Indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 12332 len. 3]: she replied .
Parsing [sent. 12333 len. 3]: ` Again !
Parsing [sent. 12334 len. 5]: And so soon ? '
Parsing [sent. 12335 len. 6]: I shook my head . '
Parsing [sent. 12336 len. 24]: I do n't know how it is , Agnes ; I seem to want some faculty of mind that I ought to have .
Parsing [sent. 12337 len. 42]: You were so much in the habit of thinking for me , in the happy old days here , and I came so naturally to you for counsel and support , that I really think I have missed acquiring it . '
Parsing [sent. 12338 len. 7]: ` And what is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 12339 len. 6]: said Agnes , cheerfully . '
Parsing [sent. 12340 len. 14]: I do n't know what to call it , ' I replied . '
Parsing [sent. 12341 len. 10]: I think I am earnest and persevering ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12342 len. 10]: I am sure of it , ' said Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 12343 len. 7]: ` And patient , Agnes ? '
Parsing [sent. 12344 len. 8]: I inquired , with a little hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 12345 len. 9]: ` Yes , ' returned Agnes , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 12346 len. 5]: ` Pretty well . '
Parsing [sent. 12347 len. 48]: ` And yet , ' said I , ' I get so miserable and worried , and am so unsteady and irresolute in my power of assuring myself , that I know I must want -- shall I call it -- reliance , of some kind ? '
Parsing [sent. 12348 len. 13]: ` Call it so , if you will , ' said Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 12349 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 12350 len. 3]: I returned .
Parsing [sent. 12351 len. 4]: ` See here !
Parsing [sent. 12352 len. 21]: You come to London , I rely on you , and I have an object and a course at once .
Parsing [sent. 12353 len. 21]: I am driven out of it , I come here , and in a moment I feel an altered person .
Parsing [sent. 12354 len. 38]: The circumstances that distressed me are not changed , since I came into this room ; but an influence comes over me in that short interval that alters me , oh , how much for the better !
Parsing [sent. 12355 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 12356 len. 8]: What is your secret , Agnes ? '
Parsing [sent. 12357 len. 11]: Her head was bent down , looking at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 12358 len. 33]: ` It 's the old story , ' said I. ` Do n't laugh , when I say it was always the same in little things as it is in greater ones .
Parsing [sent. 12359 len. 34]: My old troubles were nonsense , and now they are serious ; but whenever I have gone away from my adopted sister -- ' Agnes looked up -- with such a Heavenly face !
Parsing [sent. 12360 len. 11]: -- and gave me her hand , which I kissed .
Parsing [sent. 12361 len. 34]: ` Whenever I have not had you , Agnes , to advise and approve in the beginning , I have seemed to go wild , and to get into all sorts of difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 12362 len. 25]: When I have come to you , at last -LRB- as I have always done -RRB- , I have come to peace and happiness .
Parsing [sent. 12363 len. 21]: I come home , now , like a tired traveller , and find such a blessed sense of rest ! '
Parsing [sent. 12364 len. 33]: I felt so deeply what I said , it affected me so sincerely , that my voice failed , and I covered my face with my hand , and broke into tears .
Parsing [sent. 12365 len. 5]: I write the truth .
Parsing [sent. 12366 len. 55]: Whatever contradictions and inconsistencies there were within me , as there are within so many of us ; whatever might have been so different , and so much better ; whatever I had done , in which I had perversely wandered away from the voice of my own heart ; I knew nothing of .
Parsing [sent. 12367 len. 23]: I only knew that I was fervently in earnest , when I felt the rest and peace of having Agnes near me .
Parsing [sent. 12368 len. 62]: In her placid sisterly manner ; with her beaming eyes ; with her tender voice ; and with that sweet composure , which had long ago made the house that held her quite a sacred place to me ; she soon won me from this weakness , and led me on to tell all that had happened since our last meeting .
Parsing [sent. 12369 len. 26]: ` And there is not another word to tell , Agnes , ' said I , when I had made an end of my confidence .
Parsing [sent. 12370 len. 10]: ` Now , my reliance is on you . '
Parsing [sent. 12371 len. 20]: ` But it must not be on me , Trotwood , ' returned Agnes , with a pleasant smile .
Parsing [sent. 12372 len. 9]: ` It must be on someone else . '
Parsing [sent. 12373 len. 5]: ` On Dora ? '
Parsing [sent. 12374 len. 6]: said I. ` Assuredly . '
Parsing [sent. 12375 len. 67]: ` Why , I have not mentioned , Agnes , ' said I , a little embarrassed , ` that Dora is rather difficult to -- I would not , for the world , say , to rely upon , because she is the soul of purity and truth -- but rather difficult to -- I hardly know how to express it , really , Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 12376 len. 13]: She is a timid little thing , and easily disturbed and frightened .
Parsing [sent. 12377 len. 38]: Some time ago , before her father 's death , when I thought it right to mention to her -- but I 'll tell you , if you will bear with me , how it was . '
Parsing [sent. 12378 len. 26]: Accordingly , I told Agnes about my declaration of poverty , about the cookery-book , the housekeeping accounts , and all the rest of it .
Parsing [sent. 12379 len. 6]: ` Oh , Trotwood ! '
Parsing [sent. 12380 len. 7]: she remonstrated , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 12381 len. 7]: ` Just your old headlong way !
Parsing [sent. 12382 len. 29]: You might have been in earnest in striving to get on in the world , without being so very sudden with a timid , loving , inexperienced girl .
Parsing [sent. 12383 len. 4]: Poor Dora ! '
Parsing [sent. 12384 len. 20]: I never heard such sweet forbearing kindness expressed in a voice , as she expressed in making this reply .
Parsing [sent. 12385 len. 34]: It was as if I had seen her admiringly and tenderly embracing Dora , and tacitly reproving me , by her considerate protection , for my hot haste in fluttering that little heart .
Parsing [sent. 12386 len. 37]: It was as if I had seen Dora , in all her fascinating artlessness , caressing Agnes , and thanking her , and coaxingly appealing against me , and loving me with all her childish innocence .
Parsing [sent. 12387 len. 12]: I felt so grateful to Agnes , and admired her so !
Parsing [sent. 12388 len. 22]: I saw those two together , in a bright perspective , such well-associated friends , each adorning the other so much !
Parsing [sent. 12389 len. 11]: ` What ought I to do then , Agnes ? '
Parsing [sent. 12390 len. 12]: I inquired , after looking at the fire a little while .
Parsing [sent. 12391 len. 11]: ` What would it be right to do ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12392 len. 24]: I think , ' said Agnes , ` that the honourable course to take , would be to write to those two ladies .
Parsing [sent. 12393 len. 14]: Do n't you think that any secret course is an unworthy one ? '
Parsing [sent. 12394 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 12395 len. 53]: If YOU think so , ' said I. ' I am poorly qualified to judge of such matters , ' replied Agnes , with a modest hesitation , ` but I certainly feel -- in short , I feel that your being secret and clandestine , is not being like yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 12396 len. 49]: ` Like myself , in the too high opinion you have of me , Agnes , I am afraid , ' said I. ` Like yourself , in the candour of your nature , ' she returned ; ` and therefore I would write to those two ladies .
Parsing [sent. 12397 len. 32]: I would relate , as plainly and as openly as possible , all that has taken place ; and I would ask their permission to visit sometimes , at their house .
Parsing [sent. 12398 len. 36]: Considering that you are young , and striving for a place in life , I think it would be well to say that you would readily abide by any conditions they might impose upon you .
Parsing [sent. 12399 len. 30]: I would entreat them not to dismiss your request , without a reference to Dora ; and to discuss it with her when they should think the time suitable .
Parsing [sent. 12400 len. 19]: I would not be too vehement , ' said Agnes , gently , ` or propose too much .
Parsing [sent. 12401 len. 14]: I would trust to my fidelity and perseverance -- and to Dora . '
Parsing [sent. 12402 len. 35]: ` But if they were to frighten Dora again , Agnes , by speaking to her , ' said I. ` And if Dora were to cry , and say nothing about me ! '
Parsing [sent. 12403 len. 6]: ` Is that likely ? '
Parsing [sent. 12404 len. 12]: inquired Agnes , with the same sweet consideration in her face .
Parsing [sent. 12405 len. 22]: ` God bless her , she is as easily scared as a bird , ' said I. ` It might be !
Parsing [sent. 12406 len. 30]: Or if the two Miss Spenlows -LRB- elderly ladies of that sort are odd characters sometimes -RRB- should not be likely persons to address in that way ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 12407 len. 24]: I do n't think , Trotwood , ' returned Agnes , raising her soft eyes to mine , ' I would consider that .
Parsing [sent. 12408 len. 27]: Perhaps it would be better only to consider whether it is right to do this ; and , if it is , to do it . '
Parsing [sent. 12409 len. 10]: I had no longer any doubt on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 12410 len. 45]: With a lightened heart , though with a profound sense of the weighty importance of my task , I devoted the whole afternoon to the composition of the draft of this letter ; for which great purpose , Agnes relinquished her desk to me .
Parsing [sent. 12411 len. 13]: But first I went downstairs to see Mr. Wickfield and Uriah Heep .
Parsing [sent. 12412 len. 33]: I found Uriah in possession of a new , plaster-smelling office , built out in the garden ; looking extraordinarily mean , in the midst of a quantity of books and papers .
Parsing [sent. 12413 len. 31]: He received me in his usual fawning way , and pretended not to have heard of my arrival from Mr. Micawber ; a pretence I took the liberty of disbelieving .
Parsing [sent. 12414 len. 62]: He accompanied me into Mr. Wickfield 's room , which was the shadow of its former self -- having been divested of a variety of conveniences , for the accommodation of the new partner -- and stood before the fire , warming his back , and shaving his chin with his bony hand , while Mr. Wickfield and I exchanged greetings .
Parsing [sent. 12415 len. 15]: ` You stay with us , Trotwood , while you remain in Canterbury ? '
Parsing [sent. 12416 len. 14]: said Mr. Wickfield , not without a glance at Uriah for his approval .
Parsing [sent. 12417 len. 8]: ` Is there room for me ? '
Parsing [sent. 12418 len. 46]: said I. ' I am sure , Master Copperfield -- I should say Mister , but the other comes so natural , ' said Uriah , -- ' I would turn out of your old room with pleasure , if it would be agreeable . '
Parsing [sent. 12419 len. 10]: ` No , no , ' said Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 12420 len. 7]: ` Why should you be inconvenienced ?
Parsing [sent. 12421 len. 5]: There 's another room .
Parsing [sent. 12422 len. 6]: There 's another room . '
Parsing [sent. 12423 len. 23]: ` Oh , but you know , ' returned Uriah , with a grin , ' I should really be delighted ! '
Parsing [sent. 12424 len. 47]: To cut the matter short , I said I would have the other room or none at all ; so it was settled that I should have the other room ; and , taking my leave of the firm until dinner , I went upstairs again .
Parsing [sent. 12425 len. 11]: I had hoped to have no other companion than Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 12426 len. 45]: But Mrs. Heep had asked permission to bring herself and her knitting near the fire , in that room ; on pretence of its having an aspect more favourable for her rheumatics , as the wind then was , than the drawing-room or dining-parlour .
Parsing [sent. 12427 len. 38]: Though I could almost have consigned her to the mercies of the wind on the topmost pinnacle of the Cathedral , without remorse , I made a virtue of necessity , and gave her a friendly salutation .
Parsing [sent. 12428 len. 32]: ` I 'm umbly thankful to you , sir , ' said Mrs. Heep , in acknowledgement of my inquiries concerning her health , ` but I 'm only pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 12429 len. 8]: I have n't much to boast of .
Parsing [sent. 12430 len. 20]: If I could see my Uriah well settled in life , I could n't expect much more I think .
Parsing [sent. 12431 len. 11]: How do you think my Ury looking , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12432 len. 20]: I thought him looking as villainous as ever , and I replied that I saw no change in him .
Parsing [sent. 12433 len. 12]: ` Oh , do n't you think he 's changed ? '
Parsing [sent. 12434 len. 4]: said Mrs. Heep .
Parsing [sent. 12435 len. 12]: ` There I must umbly beg leave to differ from you .
Parsing [sent. 12436 len. 10]: Do n't you see a thinness in him ? '
Parsing [sent. 12437 len. 10]: ` Not more than usual , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 12438 len. 7]: ` Do n't you though ! '
Parsing [sent. 12439 len. 4]: said Mrs. Heep .
Parsing [sent. 12440 len. 16]: ` But you do n't take notice of him with a mother 's eye ! '
Parsing [sent. 12441 len. 40]: His mother 's eye was an evil eye to the rest of the world , I thought as it met mine , howsoever affectionate to him ; and I believe she and her son were devoted to one another .
Parsing [sent. 12442 len. 10]: It passed me , and went on to Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 12443 len. 17]: ` Do n't YOU see a wasting and a wearing in him , Miss Wickfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 12444 len. 4]: inquired Mrs. Heep .
Parsing [sent. 12445 len. 17]: ` No , ' said Agnes , quietly pursuing the work on which she was engaged .
Parsing [sent. 12446 len. 8]: ` You are too solicitous about him .
Parsing [sent. 12447 len. 6]: He is very well . '
Parsing [sent. 12448 len. 12]: Mrs. Heep , with a prodigious sniff , resumed her knitting .
Parsing [sent. 12449 len. 12]: She never left off , or left us for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 12450 len. 39]: I had arrived early in the day , and we had still three or four hours before dinner ; but she sat there , plying her knitting-needles as monotonously as an hour-glass might have poured out its sands .
Parsing [sent. 12451 len. 32]: She sat on one side of the fire ; I sat at the desk in front of it ; a little beyond me , on the other side , sat Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 12452 len. 69]: Whensoever , slowly pondering over my letter , I lifted up my eyes , and meeting the thoughtful face of Agnes , saw it clear , and beam encouragement upon me , with its own angelic expression , I was conscious presently of the evil eye passing me , and going on to her , and coming back to me again , and dropping furtively upon the knitting .
Parsing [sent. 12453 len. 68]: What the knitting was , I do n't know , not being learned in that art ; but it looked like a net ; and as she worked away with those Chinese chopsticks of knitting-needles , she showed in the firelight like an ill-looking enchantress , baulked as yet by the radiant goodness opposite , but getting ready for a cast of her net by and by .
Parsing [sent. 12454 len. 13]: At dinner she maintained her watch , with the same unwinking eyes .
Parsing [sent. 12455 len. 36]: After dinner , her son took his turn ; and when Mr. Wickfield , himself , and I were left alone together , leered at me , and writhed until I could hardly bear it .
Parsing [sent. 12456 len. 13]: In the drawing-room , there was the mother knitting and watching again .
Parsing [sent. 12457 len. 16]: All the time that Agnes sang and played , the mother sat at the piano .
Parsing [sent. 12458 len. 47]: Once she asked for a particular ballad , which she said her Ury -LRB- who was yawning in a great chair -RRB- doted on ; and at intervals she looked round at him , and reported to Agnes that he was in raptures with the music .
Parsing [sent. 12459 len. 20]: But she hardly ever spoke -- I question if she ever did -- without making some mention of him .
Parsing [sent. 12460 len. 14]: It was evident to me that this was the duty assigned to her .
Parsing [sent. 12461 len. 5]: This lasted until bedtime .
Parsing [sent. 12462 len. 48]: To have seen the mother and son , like two great bats hanging over the whole house , and darkening it with their ugly forms , made me so uncomfortable , that I would rather have remained downstairs , knitting and all , than gone to bed .
Parsing [sent. 12463 len. 6]: I hardly got any sleep .
Parsing [sent. 12464 len. 14]: Next day the knitting and watching began again , and lasted all day .
Parsing [sent. 12465 len. 14]: I had not an opportunity of speaking to Agnes , for ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 12466 len. 8]: I could barely show her my letter .
Parsing [sent. 12467 len. 30]: I proposed to her to walk out with me ; but Mrs. Heep repeatedly complaining that she was worse , Agnes charitably remained within , to bear her company .
Parsing [sent. 12468 len. 50]: Towards the twilight I went out by myself , musing on what I ought to do , and whether I was justified in withholding from Agnes , any longer , what Uriah Heep had told me in London ; for that began to trouble me again , very much .
Parsing [sent. 12469 len. 41]: I had not walked out far enough to be quite clear of the town , upon the Ramsgate road , where there was a good path , when I was hailed , through the dust , by somebody behind me .
Parsing [sent. 12470 len. 15]: The shambling figure , and the scanty great-coat , were not to be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 12471 len. 9]: I stopped , and Uriah Heep came up .
Parsing [sent. 12472 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 12473 len. 9]: said I. ` How fast you walk ! '
Parsing [sent. 12474 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 12475 len. 17]: ` My legs are pretty long , but you 've given 'em quite a job . '
Parsing [sent. 12476 len. 7]: ` Where are you going ? '
Parsing [sent. 12477 len. 28]: said I. ' I am going with you , Master Copperfield , if you 'll allow me the pleasure of a walk with an old acquaintance . '
Parsing [sent. 12478 len. 26]: Saying this , with a jerk of his body , which might have been either propitiatory or derisive , he fell into step beside me .
Parsing [sent. 12479 len. 4]: ` Uriah ! '
Parsing [sent. 12480 len. 13]: said I , as civilly as I could , after a silence .
Parsing [sent. 12481 len. 5]: ` Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 12482 len. 3]: said Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 12483 len. 32]: ` To tell you the truth -LRB- at which you will not be offended -RRB- , I came Out to walk alone , because I have had so much company . '
Parsing [sent. 12484 len. 19]: He looked at me sideways , and said with his hardest grin , ` You mean mother . '
Parsing [sent. 12485 len. 13]: ` Why yes , I do , ' said I. ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 12486 len. 13]: But you know we 're so very umble , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 12487 len. 31]: ` And having such a knowledge of our own umbleness , we must really take care that we 're not pushed to the wall by them as is n't umble .
Parsing [sent. 12488 len. 10]: All stratagems are fair in love , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 12489 len. 35]: Raising his great hands until they touched his chin , he rubbed them softly , and softly chuckled ; looking as like a malevolent baboon , I thought , as anything human could look .
Parsing [sent. 12490 len. 34]: ` You see , ' he said , still hugging himself in that unpleasant way , and shaking his head at me , ` you 're quite a dangerous rival , Master Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 12491 len. 8]: You always was , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 12492 len. 22]: ` Do you set a watch upon Miss Wickfield , and make her home no home , because of me ? '
Parsing [sent. 12493 len. 5]: said I. ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 12494 len. 3]: Master Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 12495 len. 10]: Those are very arsh words , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 12496 len. 29]: ` Put my meaning into any words you like , ' said I. ` You know what it is , Uriah , as well as I do . '
Parsing [sent. 12497 len. 4]: ` Oh no !
Parsing [sent. 12498 len. 11]: You must put it into words , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 12499 len. 5]: ` Oh , really !
Parsing [sent. 12500 len. 6]: I could n't myself . '
Parsing [sent. 12501 len. 40]: ` Do you suppose , ' said I , constraining myself to be very temperate and quiet with him , on account of Agnes , ` that I regard Miss Wickfield otherwise than as a very dear sister ? '
Parsing [sent. 12502 len. 22]: ` Well , Master Copperfield , ' he replied , ` you perceive I am not bound to answer that question .
Parsing [sent. 12503 len. 7]: You may not , you know .
Parsing [sent. 12504 len. 10]: But then , you see , you may ! '
Parsing [sent. 12505 len. 26]: Anything to equal the low cunning of his visage , and of his shadowless eyes without the ghost of an eyelash , I never saw .
Parsing [sent. 12506 len. 5]: ` Come then ! '
Parsing [sent. 12507 len. 16]: said I. ` For the sake of Miss Wickfield -- ' ` My Agnes ! '
Parsing [sent. 12508 len. 12]: he exclaimed , with a sickly , angular contortion of himself .
Parsing [sent. 12509 len. 15]: ` Would you be so good as call her Agnes , Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 12510 len. 13]: ` For the sake of Agnes Wickfield -- Heaven bless her ! '
Parsing [sent. 12511 len. 10]: ` Thank you for that blessing , Master Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 12512 len. 5]: ` he interposed . '
Parsing [sent. 12513 len. 25]: I will tell you what I should , under any other circumstances , as soon have thought of telling to -- Jack Ketch . '
Parsing [sent. 12514 len. 7]: ` To who , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12515 len. 16]: said Uriah , stretching out his neck , and shading his ear with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 12516 len. 9]: ` To the hangman , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 12517 len. 27]: ` The most unlikely person I could think of , ' -- though his own face had suggested the allusion quite as a natural sequence . '
Parsing [sent. 12518 len. 8]: I am engaged to another young lady .
Parsing [sent. 12519 len. 7]: I hope that contents you . '
Parsing [sent. 12520 len. 6]: ` Upon your soul ? '
Parsing [sent. 12521 len. 3]: said Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 12522 len. 27]: I was about indignantly to give my assertion the confirmation he required , when he caught hold of my hand , and gave it a squeeze .
Parsing [sent. 12523 len. 7]: ` Oh , Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 12524 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 12525 len. 47]: ` If you had only had the condescension to return my confidence when I poured out the fulness of my art , the night I put you so much out of the way by sleeping before your sitting-room fire , I never should have doubted you .
Parsing [sent. 12526 len. 19]: As it is , I 'm sure I 'll take off mother directly , and only too appy .
Parsing [sent. 12527 len. 14]: I know you 'll excuse the precautions of affection , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 12528 len. 17]: What a pity , Master Copperfield , that you did n't condescend to return my confidence !
Parsing [sent. 12529 len. 9]: I 'm sure I gave you every opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 12530 len. 16]: But you never have condescended to me , as much as I could have wished .
Parsing [sent. 12531 len. 15]: I know you have never liked me , as I have liked you ! '
Parsing [sent. 12532 len. 27]: All this time he was squeezing my hand with his damp fishy fingers , while I made every effort I decently could to get it away .
Parsing [sent. 12533 len. 6]: But I was quite unsuccessful .
Parsing [sent. 12534 len. 24]: He drew it under the sleeve of his mulberry-coloured great-coat , and I walked on , almost upon compulsion , arm-in-arm with him .
Parsing [sent. 12535 len. 6]: ` Shall we turn ? '
Parsing [sent. 12536 len. 28]: said Uriah , by and by wheeling me face about towards the town , on which the early moon was now shining , silvering the distant windows .
Parsing [sent. 12537 len. 50]: ` Before we leave the subject , you ought to understand , ' said I , breaking a pretty long silence , ` that I believe Agnes Wickfield to be as far above you , and as far removed from all your aspirations , as that moon herself ! '
Parsing [sent. 12538 len. 3]: ` Peaceful !
Parsing [sent. 12539 len. 5]: Ai n't she ! '
Parsing [sent. 12540 len. 3]: said Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 12541 len. 3]: ` Very !
Parsing [sent. 12542 len. 19]: Now confess , Master Copperfield , that you have n't liked me quite as I have liked you .
Parsing [sent. 12543 len. 17]: All along you 've thought me too umble now , I should n't wonder ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12544 len. 21]: I am not fond of professions of humility , ' I returned , ` or professions of anything else . '
Parsing [sent. 12545 len. 5]: ` There now ! '
Parsing [sent. 12546 len. 11]: said Uriah , looking flabby and lead-coloured in the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 12547 len. 7]: ` Did n't I know it !
Parsing [sent. 12548 len. 19]: But how little you think of the rightful umbleness of a person in my station , Master Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 12549 len. 32]: Father and me was both brought up at a foundation school for boys ; and mother , she was likewise brought up at a public , sort of charitable , establishment .
Parsing [sent. 12550 len. 22]: They taught us all a deal of umbleness - not much else that I know of , from morning to night .
Parsing [sent. 12551 len. 42]: We was to be umble to this person , and umble to that ; and to pull off our caps here , and to make bows there ; and always to know our place , and abase ourselves before our betters .
Parsing [sent. 12552 len. 9]: And we had such a lot of betters !
Parsing [sent. 12553 len. 8]: Father got the monitor-medal by being umble .
Parsing [sent. 12554 len. 12]: So did I. Father got made a sexton by being umble .
Parsing [sent. 12555 len. 25]: He had the character , among the gentlefolks , of being such a well-behaved man , that they were determined to bring him in .
Parsing [sent. 12556 len. 19]: `` Be umble , Uriah , '' says father to me , `` and you 'll get on .
Parsing [sent. 12557 len. 21]: It was what was always being dinned into you and me at school ; it 's what goes down best .
Parsing [sent. 12558 len. 14]: Be umble , '' says father , '' and you 'll do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12559 len. 9]: And really it ai n't done bad ! '
Parsing [sent. 12560 len. 28]: It was the first time it had ever occurred to me , that this detestable cant of false humility might have originated out of the Heep family .
Parsing [sent. 12561 len. 14]: I had seen the harvest , but had never thought of the seed .
Parsing [sent. 12562 len. 28]: ` When I was quite a young boy , ' said Uriah , ' I got to know what umbleness did , and I took to it .
Parsing [sent. 12563 len. 8]: I ate umble pie with an appetite .
Parsing [sent. 12564 len. 19]: I stopped at the umble point of my learning , and says I , `` Hold hard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12565 len. 12]: When you offered to teach me Latin , I knew better .
Parsing [sent. 12566 len. 18]: `` People like to be above you , '' says father , `` keep yourself down . ''
Parsing [sent. 12567 len. 21]: I am very umble to the present moment , Master Copperfield , but I 've got a little power ! '
Parsing [sent. 12568 len. 33]: And he said all this -- I knew , as I saw his face in the moonlight - that I might understand he was resolved to recompense himself by using his power .
Parsing [sent. 12569 len. 47]: I had never doubted his meanness , his craft and malice ; but I fully comprehended now , for the first time , what a base , unrelenting , and revengeful spirit , must have been engendered by this early , and this long , suppression .
Parsing [sent. 12570 len. 35]: His account of himself was so far attended with an agreeable result , that it led to his withdrawing his hand in order that he might have another hug of himself under the chin .
Parsing [sent. 12571 len. 29]: Once apart from him , I was determined to keep apart ; and we walked back , side by side , saying very little more by the way .
Parsing [sent. 12572 len. 36]: Whether his spirits were elevated by the communication I had made to him , or by his having indulged in this retrospect , I do n't know ; but they were raised by some influence .
Parsing [sent. 12573 len. 61]: He talked more at dinner than was usual with him ; asked his mother -LRB- off duty , from the moment of our re-entering the house -RRB- whether he was not growing too old for a bachelor ; and once looked at Agnes so , that I would have given all I had , for leave to knock him down .
Parsing [sent. 12574 len. 18]: When we three males were left alone after dinner , he got into a more adventurous state .
Parsing [sent. 12575 len. 35]: He had taken little or no wine ; and I presume it was the mere insolence of triumph that was upon him , flushed perhaps by the temptation my presence furnished to its exhibition .
Parsing [sent. 12576 len. 46]: I had observed yesterday , that he tried to entice Mr. Wickfield to drink ; and , interpreting the look which Agnes had given me as she went out , had limited myself to one glass , and then proposed that we should follow her .
Parsing [sent. 12577 len. 16]: I would have done so again today ; but Uriah was too quick for me .
Parsing [sent. 12578 len. 56]: ` We seldom see our present visitor , sir , ' he said , addressing Mr. Wickfield , sitting , such a contrast to him , at the end of the table , ` and I should propose to give him welcome in another glass or two of wine , if you have no objections .
Parsing [sent. 12579 len. 9]: Mr. Copperfield , your elth and appiness ! '
Parsing [sent. 12580 len. 37]: I was obliged to make a show of taking the hand he stretched across to me ; and then , with very different emotions , I took the hand of the broken gentleman , his partner .
Parsing [sent. 12581 len. 32]: ` Come , fellow-partner , ' said Uriah , ` if I may take the liberty , -- now , suppose you give us something or another appropriate to Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 12582 len. 80]: I pass over Mr. Wickfield 's proposing my aunt , his proposing Mr. Dick , his proposing Doctors ' Commons , his proposing Uriah , his drinking everything twice ; his consciousness of his own weakness , the ineffectual effort that he made against it ; the struggle between his shame in Uriah 's deportment , and his desire to conciliate him ; the manifest exultation with which Uriah twisted and turned , and held him up before me .
Parsing [sent. 12583 len. 17]: It made me sick at heart to see , and my hand recoils from writing it .
Parsing [sent. 12584 len. 6]: ` Come , fellow-partner ! '
Parsing [sent. 12585 len. 34]: said Uriah , at last , ` I 'll give you another one , and I umbly ask for bumpers , seeing I intend to make it the divinest of her sex . '
Parsing [sent. 12586 len. 10]: Her father had his empty glass in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 12587 len. 30]: I saw him set it down , look at the picture she was so like , put his hand to his forehead , and shrink back in his elbow-chair .
Parsing [sent. 12588 len. 25]: ` I 'm an umble individual to give you her elth , ' proceeded Uriah , ` but I admire -- adore her . '
Parsing [sent. 12589 len. 37]: No physical pain that her father 's grey head could have borne , I think , could have been more terrible to me , than the mental endurance I saw compressed now within both his hands .
Parsing [sent. 12590 len. 40]: ` Agnes , ' said Uriah , either not regarding him , or not knowing what the nature of his action was , ` Agnes Wickfield is , I am safe to say , the divinest of her sex .
Parsing [sent. 12591 len. 8]: May I speak out , among friends ?
Parsing [sent. 12592 len. 38]: To be her father is a proud distinction , but to be her usband -- ' Spare me from ever again hearing such a cry , as that with which her father rose up from the table !
Parsing [sent. 12593 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 12594 len. 9]: said Uriah , turning of a deadly colour .
Parsing [sent. 12595 len. 16]: ` You are not gone mad , after all , Mr. Wickfield , I hope ?
Parsing [sent. 12596 len. 26]: If I say I 've an ambition to make your Agnes my Agnes , I have as good a right to it as another man .
Parsing [sent. 12597 len. 13]: I have a better right to it than any other man ! '
Parsing [sent. 12598 len. 33]: I had my arms round Mr. Wickfield , imploring him by everything that I could think of , oftenest of all by his love for Agnes , to calm himself a little .
Parsing [sent. 12599 len. 61]: He was mad for the moment ; tearing out his hair , beating his head , trying to force me from him , and to force himself from me , not answering a word , not looking at or seeing anyone ; blindly striving for he knew not what , his face all staring and distorted -- a frightful spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 12600 len. 26]: I conjured him , incoherently , but in the most impassioned manner , not to abandon himself to this wildness , but to hear me .
Parsing [sent. 12601 len. 41]: I besought him to think of Agnes , to connect me with Agnes , to recollect how Agnes and I had grown up together , how I honoured her and loved her , how she was his pride and joy .
Parsing [sent. 12602 len. 32]: I tried to bring her idea before him in any form ; I even reproached him with not having firmness to spare her the knowledge of such a scene as this .
Parsing [sent. 12603 len. 39]: I may have effected something , or his wildness may have spent itself ; but by degrees he struggled less , and began to look at me -- strangely at first , then with recognition in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 12604 len. 11]: At length he said , ' I know , Trotwood !
Parsing [sent. 12605 len. 9]: My darling child and you -- I know !
Parsing [sent. 12606 len. 6]: But look at him ! '
Parsing [sent. 12607 len. 25]: He pointed to Uriah , pale and glowering in a corner , evidently very much out in his calculations , and taken by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 12608 len. 10]: ` Look at my torturer , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 12609 len. 23]: ` Before him I have step by step abandoned name and reputation , peace and quiet , house and home . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12610 len. 38]: I have kept your name and reputation for you , and your peace and quiet , and your house and home too , ' said Uriah , with a sulky , hurried , defeated air of compromise .
Parsing [sent. 12611 len. 9]: ` Do n't be foolish , Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 12612 len. 21]: If I have gone a little beyond what you were prepared for , I can go back , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 12613 len. 8]: There 's no harm done . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12614 len. 28]: I looked for single motives in everyone , ' said Mr. Wickfield , and I was satisfied I had bound him to me by motives of interest .
Parsing [sent. 12615 len. 14]: But see what he is -- oh , see what he is ! '
Parsing [sent. 12616 len. 25]: ` You had better stop him , Copperfield , if you can , ' cried Uriah , with his long forefinger pointing towards me .
Parsing [sent. 12617 len. 10]: ` He 'll say something presently -- mind you !
Parsing [sent. 12618 len. 20]: -- he 'll be sorry to have said afterwards , and you 'll be sorry to have heard ! '
Parsing [sent. 12619 len. 7]: ` I 'll say anything ! '
Parsing [sent. 12620 len. 9]: cried Mr. Wickfield , with a desperate air .
Parsing [sent. 12621 len. 19]: ` Why should I not be in all the world 's power if I am in yours ? '
Parsing [sent. 12622 len. 3]: ` Mind !
Parsing [sent. 12623 len. 5]: I tell you ! '
Parsing [sent. 12624 len. 8]: said Uriah , continuing to warn me .
Parsing [sent. 12625 len. 15]: ` If you do n't stop his mouth , you 're not his friend !
Parsing [sent. 12626 len. 15]: Why should n't you be in all the world 's power , Mr. Wickfield ?
Parsing [sent. 12627 len. 7]: Because you have got a daughter .
Parsing [sent. 12628 len. 12]: You and me know what we know , do n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 12629 len. 11]: Let sleeping dogs lie -- who wants to rouse 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 12630 len. 4]: I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 12631 len. 13]: Ca n't you see I am as umble as I can be ?
Parsing [sent. 12632 len. 15]: I tell you , if I 've gone too far , I 'm sorry .
Parsing [sent. 12633 len. 8]: What would you have , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12634 len. 7]: ` Oh , Trotwood , Trotwood !
Parsing [sent. 12635 len. 9]: ` exclaimed Mr. Wickfield , wringing his hands .
Parsing [sent. 12636 len. 18]: ` What I have come down to be , since I first saw you in this house !
Parsing [sent. 12637 len. 19]: I was on my downward way then , but the dreary , dreary road I have traversed since !
Parsing [sent. 12638 len. 6]: Weak indulgence has ruined me .
Parsing [sent. 12639 len. 9]: Indulgence in remembrance , and indulgence in forgetfulness .
Parsing [sent. 12640 len. 22]: My natural grief for my child 's mother turned to disease ; my natural love for my child turned to disease .
Parsing [sent. 12641 len. 7]: I have infected everything I touched .
Parsing [sent. 12642 len. 16]: I have brought misery on what I dearly love , I know -- you know !
Parsing [sent. 12643 len. 52]: I thought it possible that I could truly love one creature in the world , and not love the rest ; I thought it possible that I could truly mourn for one creature gone out of the world , and not have some part in the grief of all who mourned .
Parsing [sent. 12644 len. 10]: Thus the lessons of my life have been perverted !
Parsing [sent. 12645 len. 17]: I have preyed on my own morbid coward heart , and it has preyed on me .
Parsing [sent. 12646 len. 37]: Sordid in my grief , sordid in my love , sordid in my miserable escape from the darker side of both , oh see the ruin I am , and hate me , shun me ! '
Parsing [sent. 12647 len. 10]: He dropped into a chair , and weakly sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 12648 len. 12]: The excitement into which he had been roused was leaving him .
Parsing [sent. 12649 len. 8]: Uriah came out of his corner . '
Parsing [sent. 12650 len. 30]: I do n't know all I have done , in my fatuity , ' said Mr. Wickfield , putting out his hands , as if to deprecate my condemnation .
Parsing [sent. 12651 len. 23]: ` He knows best , ' meaning Uriah Heep , ` for he has always been at my elbow , whispering me .
Parsing [sent. 12652 len. 11]: You see the millstone that he is about my neck .
Parsing [sent. 12653 len. 14]: You find him in my house , you find him in my business .
Parsing [sent. 12654 len. 10]: You heard him , but a little time ago .
Parsing [sent. 12655 len. 9]: What need have I to say more ! '
Parsing [sent. 12656 len. 31]: ` You have n't need to say so much , nor half so much , nor anything at all , ' observed Uriah , half defiant , and half fawning .
Parsing [sent. 12657 len. 19]: ` You would n't have took it up so , if it had n't been for the wine .
Parsing [sent. 12658 len. 10]: You 'll think better of it tomorrow , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12659 len. 17]: If I have said too much , or more than I meant , what of it ?
Parsing [sent. 12660 len. 8]: I have n't stood by it ! '
Parsing [sent. 12661 len. 38]: The door opened , and Agnes , gliding in , without a vestige of colour in her face , put her arm round his neck , and steadily said , ` Papa , you are not well .
Parsing [sent. 12662 len. 5]: Come with me ! '
Parsing [sent. 12663 len. 23]: He laid his head upon her shoulder , as if he were oppressed with heavy shame , and went out with her .
Parsing [sent. 12664 len. 22]: Her eyes met mine for but an instant , yet I saw how much she knew of what had passed . '
Parsing [sent. 12665 len. 18]: I did n't expect he 'd cut up so rough , Master Copperfield , ' said Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 12666 len. 6]: ` But it 's nothing .
Parsing [sent. 12667 len. 8]: I 'll be friends with him tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 12668 len. 6]: It 's for his good .
Parsing [sent. 12669 len. 9]: I 'm umbly anxious for his good . '
Parsing [sent. 12670 len. 25]: I gave him no answer , and went upstairs into the quiet room where Agnes had so often sat beside me at my books .
Parsing [sent. 12671 len. 9]: Nobody came near me until late at night .
Parsing [sent. 12672 len. 11]: I took up a book , and tried to read .
Parsing [sent. 12673 len. 23]: I heard the clocks strike twelve , and was still reading , without knowing what I read , when Agnes touched me .
Parsing [sent. 12674 len. 12]: ` You will be going early in the morning , Trotwood !
Parsing [sent. 12675 len. 8]: Let us say good-bye , now ! '
Parsing [sent. 12676 len. 15]: She had been weeping , but her face then was so calm and beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 12677 len. 6]: ` Heaven bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 12678 len. 8]: she said , giving me her hand .
Parsing [sent. 12679 len. 5]: ` Dearest Agnes ! '
Parsing [sent. 12680 len. 24]: I returned , ' I see you ask me not to speak of tonight -- but is there nothing to be done ? '
Parsing [sent. 12681 len. 9]: ` There is God to trust in ! '
Parsing [sent. 12682 len. 3]: she replied .
Parsing [sent. 12683 len. 18]: ` Can I do nothing - I , who come to you with my poor sorrows ? '
Parsing [sent. 12684 len. 12]: ` And make mine so much lighter , ' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 12685 len. 7]: ` Dear Trotwood , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 12686 len. 58]: ` Dear Agnes , ' I said , ` it is presumptuous for me , who am so poor in all in which you are so rich -- goodness , resolution , all noble qualities -- to doubt or direct you ; but you know how much I love you , and how much I owe you .
Parsing [sent. 12687 len. 15]: You will never sacrifice yourself to a mistaken sense of duty , Agnes ? '
Parsing [sent. 12688 len. 25]: More agitated for a moment than I had ever seen her , she took her hands from me , and moved a step back .
Parsing [sent. 12689 len. 11]: ` Say you have no such thought , dear Agnes !
Parsing [sent. 12690 len. 5]: Much more than sister !
Parsing [sent. 12691 len. 20]: Think of the priceless gift of such a heart as yours , of such a love as yours ! '
Parsing [sent. 12692 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 12693 len. 28]: long , long afterwards , I saw that face rise up before me , with its momentary look , not wondering , not accusing , not regretting .
Parsing [sent. 12694 len. 56]: Oh , long , long afterwards , I saw that look subside , as it did now , into the lovely smile , with which she told me she had no fear for herself -- I need have none for her -- and parted from me by the name of Brother , and was gone !
Parsing [sent. 12695 len. 18]: It was dark in the morning , when I got upon the coach at the inn door .
Parsing [sent. 12696 len. 40]: The day was just breaking when we were about to start , and then , as I sat thinking of her , came struggling up the coach side , through the mingled day and night , Uriah 's head .
Parsing [sent. 12697 len. 4]: ` Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 12698 len. 41]: said he , in a croaking whisper , as he hung by the iron on the roof , ' I thought you 'd be glad to hear before you went off , that there are no squares broke between us .
Parsing [sent. 12699 len. 16]: I 've been into his room already , and we 've made it all smooth .
Parsing [sent. 12700 len. 28]: Why , though I 'm umble , I 'm useful to him , you know ; and he understands his interest when he is n't in liquor !
Parsing [sent. 12701 len. 14]: What an agreeable man he is , after all , Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 12702 len. 15]: I obliged myself to say that I was glad he had made his apology .
Parsing [sent. 12703 len. 8]: ` Oh , to be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 12704 len. 3]: said Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 12705 len. 15]: ` When a person 's umble , you know , what 's an apology ?
Parsing [sent. 12706 len. 3]: So easy !
Parsing [sent. 12707 len. 3]: I say !
Parsing [sent. 12708 len. 25]: I suppose , ' with a jerk , ` you have sometimes plucked a pear before it was ripe , Master Copperfield ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12709 len. 10]: I suppose I have , ' I replied . '
Parsing [sent. 12710 len. 17]: I did that last night , ' said Uriah ; ` but it 'll ripen yet !
Parsing [sent. 12711 len. 6]: It only wants attending to .
Parsing [sent. 12712 len. 5]: I can wait ! '
Parsing [sent. 12713 len. 15]: Profuse in his farewells , he got down again as the coachman got up .
Parsing [sent. 12714 len. 41]: For anything I know , he was eating something to keep the raw morning air out ; but he made motions with his mouth as if the pear were ripe already , and he were smacking his lips over it .
Parsing [sent. 12715 len. 28]: Chapter 40 The Wanderer We had a very serious conversation in Buckingham Street that night , about the domestic occurrences I have detailed in the last chapter .
Parsing [sent. 12716 len. 27]: My aunt was deeply interested in them , and walked up and down the room with her arms folded , for more than two hours afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 12717 len. 32]: Whenever she was particularly discomposed , she always performed one of these pedestrian feats ; and the amount of her discomposure might always be estimated by the duration of her walk .
Parsing [sent. 12718 len. 76]: On this occasion she was so much disturbed in mind as to find it necessary to open the bedroom door , and make a course for herself , comprising the full extent of the bedrooms from wall to wall ; and while Mr. Dick and I sat quietly by the fire , she kept passing in and out , along this measured track , at an unchanging pace , with the regularity of a clock-pendulum .
Parsing [sent. 12719 len. 31]: When my aunt and I were left to ourselves by Mr. Dick 's going out to bed , I sat down to write my letter to the two old ladies .
Parsing [sent. 12720 len. 22]: By that time she was tired of walking , and sat by the fire with her dress tucked up as usual .
Parsing [sent. 12721 len. 50]: But instead of sitting in her usual manner , holding her glass upon her knee , she suffered it to stand neglected on the chimney-piece ; and , resting her left elbow on her right arm , and her chin on her left hand , looked thoughtfully at me .
Parsing [sent. 12722 len. 18]: As often as I raised my eyes from what I was about , I met hers . '
Parsing [sent. 12723 len. 29]: I am in the lovingest of tempers , my dear , ' she would assure me with a nod , ` but I am fidgeted and sorry ! '
Parsing [sent. 12724 len. 34]: I had been too busy to observe , until after she was gone to bed , that she had left her night-mixture , as she always called it , untasted on the chimney-piece .
Parsing [sent. 12725 len. 55]: She came to her door , with even more than her usual affection of manner , when I knocked to acquaint her with this discovery ; but only said , ' I have not the heart to take it , Trot , tonight , ' and shook her head , and went in again .
Parsing [sent. 12726 len. 19]: She read my letter to the two old ladies , in the morning , and approved of it .
Parsing [sent. 12727 len. 24]: I posted it , and had nothing to do then , but wait , as patiently as I could , for the reply .
Parsing [sent. 12728 len. 32]: I was still in this state of expectation , and had been , for nearly a week ; when I left the Doctor 's one snowy night , to walk home .
Parsing [sent. 12729 len. 18]: It had been a bitter day , and a cutting north-east wind had blown for some time .
Parsing [sent. 12730 len. 17]: The wind had gone down with the light , and so the snow had come on .
Parsing [sent. 12731 len. 20]: It was a heavy , settled fall , I recollect , in great flakes ; and it lay thick .
Parsing [sent. 12732 len. 24]: The noise of wheels and tread of people were as hushed , as if the streets had been strewn that depth with feathers .
Parsing [sent. 12733 len. 25]: My shortest way home , -- and I naturally took the shortest way on such a night -- was through St. Martin 's Lane .
Parsing [sent. 12734 len. 39]: Now , the church which gives its name to the lane , stood in a less free situation at that time ; there being no open space before it , and the lane winding down to the Strand .
Parsing [sent. 12735 len. 21]: As I passed the steps of the portico , I encountered , at the corner , a woman 's face .
Parsing [sent. 12736 len. 14]: It looked in mine , passed across the narrow lane , and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 12737 len. 4]: I knew it .
Parsing [sent. 12738 len. 6]: I had seen it somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 12739 len. 7]: But I could not remember where .
Parsing [sent. 12740 len. 31]: I had some association with it , that struck upon my heart directly ; but I was thinking of anything else when it came upon me , and was confused .
Parsing [sent. 12741 len. 44]: On the steps of the church , there was the stooping figure of a man , who had put down some burden on the smooth snow , to adjust it ; my seeing the face , and my seeing him , were simultaneous .
Parsing [sent. 12742 len. 33]: I do n't think I had stopped in my surprise ; but , in any case , as I went on , he rose , turned , and came down towards me .
Parsing [sent. 12743 len. 9]: I stood face to face with Mr. Peggotty !
Parsing [sent. 12744 len. 6]: Then I remembered the woman .
Parsing [sent. 12745 len. 17]: It was Martha , to whom Emily had given the money that night in the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 12746 len. 32]: Martha Endell -- side by side with whom , he would not have seen his dear niece , Ham had told me , for all the treasures wrecked in the sea .
Parsing [sent. 12747 len. 5]: We shook hands heartily .
Parsing [sent. 12748 len. 11]: At first , neither of us could speak a word .
Parsing [sent. 12749 len. 7]: ` Mas ' r Davy ! '
Parsing [sent. 12750 len. 19]: he said , gripping me tight , ` it do my art good to see you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12751 len. 7]: Well met , well met ! '
Parsing [sent. 12752 len. 10]: ` Well met , my dear old friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 12753 len. 55]: said I. ' I had my thowts o ' coming to make inquiration for you , sir , tonight , ' he said , ` but knowing as your aunt was living along wi ' you -- fur I 've been down yonder -- Yarmouth way -- I was afeerd it was too late .
Parsing [sent. 12754 len. 16]: I should have come early in the morning , sir , afore going away . '
Parsing [sent. 12755 len. 4]: ` Again ? '
Parsing [sent. 12756 len. 23]: said I. ` Yes , sir , ' he replied , patiently shaking his head , ` I 'm away tomorrow . '
Parsing [sent. 12757 len. 8]: ` Where were you going now ? '
Parsing [sent. 12758 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 12759 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 12760 len. 22]: he replied , shaking the snow out of his long hair , ' I was a-going to turn in somewheers . '
Parsing [sent. 12761 len. 34]: In those days there was a side-entrance to the stable-yard of the Golden Cross , the inn so memorable to me in connexion with his misfortune , nearly opposite to where we stood .
Parsing [sent. 12762 len. 17]: I pointed out the gateway , put my arm through his , and we went across .
Parsing [sent. 12763 len. 34]: Two or three public-rooms opened out of the stable-yard ; and looking into one of them , and finding it empty , and a good fire burning , I took him in there .
Parsing [sent. 12764 len. 32]: When I saw him in the light , I observed , not only that his hair was long and ragged , but that his face was burnt dark by the sun .
Parsing [sent. 12765 len. 52]: He was greyer , the lines in his face and forehead were deeper , and he had every appearance of having toiled and wandered through all varieties of weather ; but he looked very strong , and like a man upheld by steadfastness of purpose , whom nothing could tire out .
Parsing [sent. 12766 len. 26]: He shook the snow from his hat and clothes , and brushed it away from his face , while I was inwardly making these remarks .
Parsing [sent. 12767 len. 36]: As he sat down opposite to me at a table , with his back to the door by which we had entered , he put out his rough hand again , and grasped mine warmly .
Parsing [sent. 12768 len. 29]: ` I 'll tell you , Mas ' r Davy , ' he said , -- ` wheer all I 've been , and what-all we 've heerd .
Parsing [sent. 12769 len. 18]: I 've been fur , and we 've heerd little ; but I 'll tell you ! '
Parsing [sent. 12770 len. 10]: I rang the bell for something hot to drink .
Parsing [sent. 12771 len. 26]: He would have nothing stronger than ale ; and while it was being brought , and being warmed at the fire , he sat thinking .
Parsing [sent. 12772 len. 18]: There was a fine , massive gravity in his face , I did not venture to disturb .
Parsing [sent. 12773 len. 58]: ` When she was a child , ' he said , lifting up his head soon after we were left alone , ` she used to talk to me a deal about the sea , and about them coasts where the sea got to be dark blue , and to lay a-shining and a-shining in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 12774 len. 19]: I thowt , odd times , as her father being drownded made her think on it so much .
Parsing [sent. 12775 len. 37]: I doe n't know , you see , but maybe she believed -- or hoped -- he had drifted out to them parts , where the flowers is always a-blowing , and the country bright . '
Parsing [sent. 12776 len. 15]: ` It is likely to have been a childish fancy , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 12777 len. 29]: ` When she was -- lost , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ' I know 'd in my mind , as he would take her to them countries .
Parsing [sent. 12778 len. 44]: I know 'd in my mind , as he 'd have told her wonders of 'em , and how she was to be a lady theer , and how he got her to listen to him fust , along o ' sech like .
Parsing [sent. 12779 len. 16]: When we see his mother , I know 'd quite well as I was right .
Parsing [sent. 12780 len. 21]: I went across-channel to France , and landed theer , as if I 'd fell down from the sky . '
Parsing [sent. 12781 len. 12]: I saw the door move , and the snow drift in .
Parsing [sent. 12782 len. 19]: I saw it move a little more , and a hand softly interpose to keep it open . '
Parsing [sent. 12783 len. 30]: I found out an English gen ` leman as was in authority , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` and told him I was a-going to seek my niece .
Parsing [sent. 12784 len. 43]: He got me them papers as I wanted fur to carry me through -- I doe n't rightly know how they 're called -- and he would have give me money , but that I was thankful to have no need on .
Parsing [sent. 12785 len. 14]: I thank him kind , for all he done , I 'm sure !
Parsing [sent. 12786 len. 44]: `` I 've wrote afore you , '' he says to me , `` and I shall speak to many as will come that way , and many will know you , fur distant from here , when you 're a-travelling alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 12787 len. 22]: I told him , best as I was able , what my gratitoode was , and went away through France . '
Parsing [sent. 12788 len. 8]: ` Alone , and on foot ? '
Parsing [sent. 12789 len. 26]: said I. ` Mostly a-foot , ' he rejoined ; ` sometimes in carts along with people going to market ; sometimes in empty coaches .
Parsing [sent. 12790 len. 21]: Many mile a day a-foot , and often with some poor soldier or another , travelling to see his friends .
Parsing [sent. 12791 len. 34]: I could n't talk to him , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` nor he to me ; but we was company for one another , too , along the dusty roads . '
Parsing [sent. 12792 len. 10]: I should have known that by his friendly tone .
Parsing [sent. 12793 len. 37]: ` When I come to any town , ' he pursued , ' I found the inn , and waited about the yard till someone turned up -LRB- someone mostly did -RRB- as know 'd English .
Parsing [sent. 12794 len. 44]: Then I told how that I was on my way to seek my niece , and they told me what manner of gentlefolks was in the house , and I waited to see any as seemed like her , going in or out .
Parsing [sent. 12795 len. 13]: When it war n't Em ` ly , I went on agen .
Parsing [sent. 12796 len. 28]: By little and little , when I come to a new village or that , among the poor people , I found they know 'd about me .
Parsing [sent. 12797 len. 75]: They would set me down at their cottage doors , and give me what-not fur to eat and drink , and show me where to sleep ; and many a woman , Mas ' r Davy , as has had a daughter of about Em ` ly 's age , I 've found a-waiting fur me , at Our Saviour 's Cross outside the village , fur to do me sim ` lar kindnesses .
Parsing [sent. 12798 len. 8]: Some has had daughters as was dead .
Parsing [sent. 12799 len. 13]: And God only knows how good them mothers was to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 12800 len. 7]: It was Martha at the door .
Parsing [sent. 12801 len. 9]: I saw her haggard , listening face distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 12802 len. 15]: My dread was lest he should turn his head , and see her too .
Parsing [sent. 12803 len. 56]: ` They would often put their children -- particular their little girls , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` upon my knee ; and many a time you might have seen me sitting at their doors , when night was coming in , a ` most as if they 'd been my Darling 's children .
Parsing [sent. 12804 len. 6]: Oh , my Darling ! '
Parsing [sent. 12805 len. 9]: Overpowered by sudden grief , he sobbed aloud .
Parsing [sent. 12806 len. 14]: I laid my trembling hand upon the hand he put before his face .
Parsing [sent. 12807 len. 17]: ` Thankee , sir , ' he said , ` doe n't take no notice . '
Parsing [sent. 12808 len. 24]: In a very little while he took his hand away and put it on his breast , and went on with his story .
Parsing [sent. 12809 len. 42]: ` They often walked with me , ' he said , ` in the morning , maybe a mile or two upon my road ; and when we parted , and I said , `` I 'm very thankful to you !
Parsing [sent. 12810 len. 5]: God bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12811 len. 10]: they always seemed to understand , and answered pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 12812 len. 8]: At last I come to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 12813 len. 23]: It war n't hard , you may suppose , for a seafaring man like me to work his way over to Italy .
Parsing [sent. 12814 len. 14]: When I got theer , I wandered on as I had done afore .
Parsing [sent. 12815 len. 39]: The people was just as good to me , and I should have gone from town to town , maybe the country through , but that I got news of her being seen among them Swiss mountains yonder .
Parsing [sent. 12816 len. 25]: One as know 'd his servant see 'em there , all three , and told me how they travelled , and where they was .
Parsing [sent. 12817 len. 15]: I made fur them mountains , Mas ' r Davy , day and night .
Parsing [sent. 12818 len. 19]: Ever so fur as I went , ever so fur the mountains seemed to shift away from me .
Parsing [sent. 12819 len. 12]: But I come up with 'em , and I crossed 'em .
Parsing [sent. 12820 len. 34]: When I got nigh the place as I had been told of , I began to think within my own self , `` What shall I do when I see her ? '' '
Parsing [sent. 12821 len. 32]: The listening face , insensible to the inclement night , still drooped at the door , and the hands begged me -- prayed me -- not to cast it forth . '
Parsing [sent. 12822 len. 10]: I never doubted her , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 12823 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 12824 len. 4]: Not a bit !
Parsing [sent. 12825 len. 66]: On ' y let her see my face -- on ' y let her beer my voice -- on ' y let my stanning still afore her bring to her thoughts the home she had fled away from , and the child she had been -- and if she had growed to be a royal lady , she 'd have fell down at my feet !
Parsing [sent. 12826 len. 6]: I know 'd it well !
Parsing [sent. 12827 len. 17]: Many a time in my sleep had I heerd her cry out , `` Uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12828 len. 9]: and seen her fall like death afore me .
Parsing [sent. 12829 len. 41]: Many a time in my sleep had I raised her up , and whispered to her , `` Em ` ly , my dear , I am come fur to bring forgiveness , and to take you home ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 12830 len. 14]: He stopped and shook his head , and went on with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 12831 len. 8]: ` He was nowt to me now .
Parsing [sent. 12832 len. 6]: Em ` ly was all .
Parsing [sent. 12833 len. 43]: I bought a country dress to put upon her ; and I know 'd that , once found , she would walk beside me over them stony roads , go where I would , and never , never , leave me more .
Parsing [sent. 12834 len. 53]: To put that dress upon her , and to cast off what she wore -- to take her on my arm again , and wander towards home -- to stop sometimes upon the road , and heal her bruised feet and her worse-bruised heart -- was all that I thowt of now .
Parsing [sent. 12835 len. 15]: I doe n't believe I should have done so much as look at him .
Parsing [sent. 12836 len. 16]: But , Mas ' r Davy , it war n't to be -- not yet !
Parsing [sent. 12837 len. 10]: I was too late , and they was gone .
Parsing [sent. 12838 len. 7]: Wheer , I could n't learn .
Parsing [sent. 12839 len. 8]: Some said beer , some said theer .
Parsing [sent. 12840 len. 23]: I travelled beer , and I travelled theer , but I found no Em ` ly , and I travelled home . '
Parsing [sent. 12841 len. 6]: ` How long ago ? '
Parsing [sent. 12842 len. 4]: I asked . '
Parsing [sent. 12843 len. 13]: A matter o ' fower days , ' said Mr. Peggotty . '
Parsing [sent. 12844 len. 16]: I sighted the old boat arter dark , and the light a-shining in the winder .
Parsing [sent. 12845 len. 32]: When I come nigh and looked in through the glass , I see the faithful creetur Missis Gummidge sittin ' by the fire , as we had fixed upon , alone .
Parsing [sent. 12846 len. 10]: I called out , `` Doe n't be afeerd !
Parsing [sent. 12847 len. 7]: It 's Dan ` l ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12848 len. 5]: and I went in .
Parsing [sent. 12849 len. 15]: I never could have thowt the old boat would have been so strange ! '
Parsing [sent. 12850 len. 36]: From some pocket in his breast , he took out , with a very careful hand a small paper bundle containing two or three letters or little packets , which he laid upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 12851 len. 25]: ` This fust one come , ' he said , selecting it from the rest , ` afore I had been gone a week .
Parsing [sent. 12852 len. 25]: A fifty pound Bank note , in a sheet of paper , directed to me , and put underneath the door in the night .
Parsing [sent. 12853 len. 17]: She tried to hide her writing , but she could n't hide it from Me ! '
Parsing [sent. 12854 len. 26]: He folded up the note again , with great patience and care , in exactly the same form , and laid it on one side .
Parsing [sent. 12855 len. 21]: ` This come to Missis Gummidge , ' he said , opening another , ` two or three months ago .
Parsing [sent. 12856 len. 33]: ` After looking at it for some moments , he gave it to me , and added in a low voice , ` Be so good as read it , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 12857 len. 26]: I read as follows : ` Oh what will you feel when you see this writing , and know it comes from my wicked hand !
Parsing [sent. 12858 len. 32]: But try , try -- not for my sake , but for uncle 's goodness , try to let your heart soften to me , only for a little little time !
Parsing [sent. 12859 len. 76]: Try , pray do , to relent towards a miserable girl , and write down on a bit of paper whether he is well , and what he said about me before you left off ever naming me among yourselves -- and whether , of a night , when it is my old time of coming home , you ever see him look as if he thought of one he used to love so dear .
Parsing [sent. 12860 len. 12]: Oh , my heart is breaking when I think about it !
Parsing [sent. 12861 len. 56]: I am kneeling down to you , begging and praying you not to be as hard with me as I deserve -- as I well , well , know I deserve -- but to be so gentle and so good , as to write down something of him , and to send it to me .
Parsing [sent. 12862 len. 57]: You need not call me Little , you need not call me by the name I have disgraced ; but oh , listen to my agony , and have mercy on me so far as to write me some word of uncle , never , never to be seen in this world by my eyes again !
Parsing [sent. 12863 len. 55]: ` Dear , if your heart is hard towards me -- justly hard , I know -- but , listen , if it is hard , dear , ask him I have wronged the most - him whose wife I was to have been -- before you quite decide against my poor poor prayer !
Parsing [sent. 12864 len. 90]: If he should be so compassionate as to say that you might write something for me to read -- I think he would , oh , I think he would , if you would only ask him , for he always was so brave and so forgiving -- tell him then -LRB- but not else -RRB- , that when I hear the wind blowing at night , I feel as if it was passing angrily from seeing him and uncle , and was going up to God against me .
Parsing [sent. 12865 len. 27]: Tell him that if I was to die tomorrow -LRB- and oh , if I was fit , I would be so glad to die ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 12866 len. 23]: I would bless him and uncle with my last words , and pray for his happy home with my last breath ! '
Parsing [sent. 12867 len. 9]: Some money was enclosed in this letter also .
Parsing [sent. 12868 len. 3]: Five pounds .
Parsing [sent. 12869 len. 17]: It was untouched like the previous sum , and he refolded it in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 12870 len. 64]: Detailed instructions were added relative to the address of a reply , which , although they betrayed the intervention of several hands , and made it difficult to arrive at any very probable conclusion in reference to her place of concealment , made it at least not unlikely that she had written from that spot where she was stated to have been seen .
Parsing [sent. 12871 len. 7]: ` What answer was sent ? '
Parsing [sent. 12872 len. 6]: I inquired of Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 12873 len. 31]: ` Missis Gummidge , ' he returned , ` not being a good scholar , sir , Ham kindly drawed it out , and she made a copy on it .
Parsing [sent. 12874 len. 18]: They told her I was gone to seek her , and what my parting words was . '
Parsing [sent. 12875 len. 10]: ` Is that another letter in your hand ? '
Parsing [sent. 12876 len. 20]: said I. ` It 's money , sir , ' said Mr. Peggotty , unfolding it a little way .
Parsing [sent. 12877 len. 7]: ` Ten pound , you see .
Parsing [sent. 12878 len. 15]: And wrote inside , `` From a true friend , '' like the fust .
Parsing [sent. 12879 len. 20]: But the fust was put underneath the door , and this come by the post , day afore yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 12880 len. 11]: I 'm a-going to seek her at the post-mark . '
Parsing [sent. 12881 len. 6]: He showed it to me .
Parsing [sent. 12882 len. 9]: It was a town on the Upper Rhine .
Parsing [sent. 12883 len. 34]: He had found out , at Yarmouth , some foreign dealers who knew that country , and they had drawn him a rude map on paper , which he could very well understand .
Parsing [sent. 12884 len. 28]: He laid it between us on the table ; and , with his chin resting on one hand , tracked his course upon it with the other .
Parsing [sent. 12885 len. 7]: I asked him how Ham was ?
Parsing [sent. 12886 len. 5]: He shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 12887 len. 16]: ` He works , ' he said , ` as bold as a man can .
Parsing [sent. 12888 len. 22]: His name 's as good , in all that part , as any man 's is , anywheres in the wureld .
Parsing [sent. 12889 len. 20]: Anyone 's hand is ready to help him , you understand , and his is ready to help them .
Parsing [sent. 12890 len. 9]: He 's never been heerd fur to complain .
Parsing [sent. 12891 len. 19]: But my sister 's belief is -LRB- ` twixt ourselves -RRB- as it has cut him deep . '
Parsing [sent. 12892 len. 10]: ` Poor fellow , I can believe it ! '
Parsing [sent. 12893 len. 30]: ` He ai n't no care , Mas ' r Davy , ' said Mr. Peggotty in a solemn whisper -- ` kinder no care no-how for his life .
Parsing [sent. 12894 len. 16]: When a man 's wanted for rough sarvice in rough weather , he 's theer .
Parsing [sent. 12895 len. 23]: When there 's hard duty to be done with danger in it , he steps for ` ard afore all his mates .
Parsing [sent. 12896 len. 10]: And yet he 's as gentle as any child .
Parsing [sent. 12897 len. 14]: There ai n't a child in Yarmouth that doe n't know him . '
Parsing [sent. 12898 len. 29]: He gathered up the letters thoughtfully , smoothing them with his hand ; put them into their little bundle ; and placed it tenderly in his breast again .
Parsing [sent. 12899 len. 8]: The face was gone from the door .
Parsing [sent. 12900 len. 14]: I still saw the snow drifting in ; but nothing else was there .
Parsing [sent. 12901 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 12902 len. 26]: he said , looking to his bag , ` having seen you tonight , Mas ' r Davy -LRB- and that doos me good ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 12903 len. 8]: , I shall away betimes tomorrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 12904 len. 44]: You have seen what I 've got heer ' ; putting his hand on where the little packet lay ; ` all that troubles me is , to think that any harm might come to me , afore that money was give back .
Parsing [sent. 12905 len. 47]: If I was to die , and it was lost , or stole , or elseways made away with , and it was never know 'd by him but what I 'd took it , I believe the t ` other wureld would n't hold me !
Parsing [sent. 12906 len. 8]: I believe I must come back ! '
Parsing [sent. 12907 len. 21]: He rose , and I rose too ; we grasped each other by the hand again , before going out .
Parsing [sent. 12908 len. 29]: ` I 'd go ten thousand mile , ' he said , ` I 'd go till I dropped dead , to lay that money down afore him .
Parsing [sent. 12909 len. 16]: If I do that , and find my Em ` ly , I 'm content .
Parsing [sent. 12910 len. 48]: If I doe n't find her , maybe she 'll come to hear , sometime , as her loving uncle only ended his search for her when he ended his life ; and if I know her , even that will turn her home at last ! '
Parsing [sent. 12911 len. 19]: As he went out into the rigorous night , I saw the lonely figure flit away before us .
Parsing [sent. 12912 len. 18]: I turned him hastily on some pretence , and held him in conversation until it was gone .
Parsing [sent. 12913 len. 27]: He spoke of a traveller 's house on the Dover Road , where he knew he could find a clean , plain lodging for the night .
Parsing [sent. 12914 len. 17]: I went with him over Westminster Bridge , and parted from him on the Surrey shore .
Parsing [sent. 12915 len. 25]: Everything seemed , to my imagination , to be hushed in reverence for him , as he resumed his solitary journey through the snow .
Parsing [sent. 12916 len. 23]: I returned to the inn yard , and , impressed by my remembrance of the face , looked awfully around for it .
Parsing [sent. 12917 len. 5]: It was not there .
Parsing [sent. 12918 len. 40]: The snow had covered our late footprints ; my new track was the only one to be seen ; and even that began to die away -LRB- it snowed so fast -RRB- as I looked back over my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 12919 len. 17]: Chapter 41 Dora 's Aunts At last , an answer came from the two old ladies .
Parsing [sent. 12920 len. 105]: They presented their compliments to Mr. Copperfield , and informed him that they had given his letter their best consideration , ` with a view to the happiness of both parties ' -- which I thought rather an alarming expression , not only because of the use they had made of it in relation to the family difference before-mentioned , but because I had -LRB- and have all my life -RRB- observed that conventional phrases are a sort of fireworks , easily let off , and liable to take a great variety of shapes and colours not at all suggested by their original form .
Parsing [sent. 12921 len. 73]: The Misses Spenlow added that they begged to forbear expressing , ` through the medium of correspondence ' , an opinion on the subject of Mr. Copperfield 's communication ; but that if Mr. Copperfield would do them the favour to call , upon a certain day -LRB- accompanied , if he thought proper , by a confidential friend -RRB- , they would be happy to hold some conversation on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 12922 len. 52]: To this favour , Mr. Copperfield immediately replied , with his respectful compliments , that he would have the honour of waiting on the Misses Spenlow , at the time appointed ; accompanied , in accordance with their kind permission , by his friend Mr. Thomas Traddles of the Inner Temple .
Parsing [sent. 12923 len. 24]: Having dispatched which missive , Mr. Copperfield fell into a condition of strong nervous agitation ; and so remained until the day arrived .
Parsing [sent. 12924 len. 25]: It was a great augmentation of my uneasiness to be bereaved , at this eventful crisis , of the inestimable services of Miss Mills .
Parsing [sent. 12925 len. 50]: But Mr. Mills , who was always doing something or other to annoy me - or I felt as if he were , which was the same thing -- had brought his conduct to a climax , by taking it into his head that he would go to India .
Parsing [sent. 12926 len. 12]: Why should he go to India , except to harass me ?
Parsing [sent. 12927 len. 76]: To be sure he had nothing to do with any other part of the world , and had a good deal to do with that part ; being entirely in the India trade , whatever that was -LRB- I had floating dreams myself concerning golden shawls and elephants ' teeth -RRB- ; having been at Calcutta in his youth ; and designing now to go out there again , in the capacity of resident partner .
Parsing [sent. 12928 len. 7]: But this was nothing to me .
Parsing [sent. 12929 len. 72]: However , it was so much to him that for India he was bound , and Julia with him ; and Julia went into the country to take leave of her relations ; and the house was put into a perfect suit of bills , announcing that it was to be let or sold , and that the furniture -LRB- Mangle and all -RRB- was to be taken at a valuation .
Parsing [sent. 12930 len. 24]: So , here was another earthquake of which I became the sport , before I had recovered from the shock of its predecessor !
Parsing [sent. 12931 len. 46]: I was in several minds how to dress myself on the important day ; being divided between my desire to appear to advantage , and my apprehensions of putting on anything that might impair my severely practical character in the eyes of the Misses Spenlow .
Parsing [sent. 12932 len. 39]: I endeavoured to hit a happy medium between these two extremes ; my aunt approved the result ; and Mr. Dick threw one of his shoes after Traddles and me , for luck , as we went downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 12933 len. 44]: Excellent fellow as I knew Traddles to be , and warmly attached to him as I was , I could not help wishing , on that delicate occasion , that he had never contracted the habit of brushing his hair so very upright .
Parsing [sent. 12934 len. 28]: It gave him a surprised look -- not to say a hearth-broomy kind of expression -- which , my apprehensions whispered , might be fatal to us .
Parsing [sent. 12935 len. 60]: I took the liberty of mentioning it to Traddles , as we were walking to Putney ; and saying that if he WOULD smooth it down a little -- ` My dear Copperfield , ' said Traddles , lifting off his hat , and rubbing his hair all kinds of ways , ` nothing would give me greater pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 12936 len. 6]: But it wo n't . '
Parsing [sent. 12937 len. 8]: ` Wo n't be smoothed down ? '
Parsing [sent. 12938 len. 9]: said I. ` No , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 12939 len. 6]: ` Nothing will induce it .
Parsing [sent. 12940 len. 29]: If I was to carry a half-hundred-weight upon it , all the way to Putney , it would be up again the moment the weight was taken off .
Parsing [sent. 12941 len. 12]: You have no idea what obstinate hair mine is , Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 12942 len. 8]: I am quite a fretful porcupine . '
Parsing [sent. 12943 len. 18]: I was a little disappointed , I must confess , but thoroughly charmed by his good-nature too .
Parsing [sent. 12944 len. 30]: I told him how I esteemed his good-nature ; and said that his hair must have taken all the obstinacy out of his character , for he had none .
Parsing [sent. 12945 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 12946 len. 6]: returned Traddles , laughing . '
Parsing [sent. 12947 len. 15]: I assure you , it 's quite an old story , my unfortunate hair .
Parsing [sent. 12948 len. 9]: My uncle 's wife could n't bear it .
Parsing [sent. 12949 len. 6]: She said it exasperated her .
Parsing [sent. 12950 len. 19]: It stood very much in my way , too , when I first fell in love with Sophy .
Parsing [sent. 12951 len. 4]: Very much ! '
Parsing [sent. 12952 len. 8]: ` Did she object to it ? '
Parsing [sent. 12953 len. 31]: ` SHE did n't , ' rejoined Traddles ; ` but her eldest sister -- the one that 's the Beauty -- quite made game of it , I understand .
Parsing [sent. 12954 len. 11]: In fact , all the sisters laugh at it . '
Parsing [sent. 12955 len. 4]: ` Agreeable ! '
Parsing [sent. 12956 len. 20]: said I. ` Yes , ' returned Traddles with perfect innocence , ` it 's a joke for us .
Parsing [sent. 12957 len. 29]: They pretend that Sophy has a lock of it in her desk , and is obliged to shut it in a clasped book , to keep it down .
Parsing [sent. 12958 len. 6]: We laugh about it . '
Parsing [sent. 12959 len. 22]: ` By the by , my dear Traddles , ' said I , ` your experience may suggest something to me .
Parsing [sent. 12960 len. 24]: When you became engaged to the young lady whom you have just mentioned , did you make a regular proposal to her family ?
Parsing [sent. 12961 len. 16]: Was there anything like -- what we are going through today , for instance ? '
Parsing [sent. 12962 len. 5]: I added , nervously .
Parsing [sent. 12963 len. 31]: ` Why , ' replied Traddles , on whose attentive face a thoughtful shade had stolen , ` it was rather a painful transaction , Copperfield , in my case .
Parsing [sent. 12964 len. 26]: You see , Sophy being of so much use in the family , none of them could endure the thought of her ever being married .
Parsing [sent. 12965 len. 24]: Indeed , they had quite settled among themselves that she never was to be married , and they called her the old maid .
Parsing [sent. 12966 len. 22]: Accordingly , when I mentioned it , with the greatest precaution , to Mrs. Crewler -- ' ` The mama ? '
Parsing [sent. 12967 len. 42]: said I. ` The mama , ' said Traddles -- ` Reverend Horace Crewler -- when I mentioned it with every possible precaution to Mrs. Crewler , the effect upon her was such that she gave a scream and became insensible .
Parsing [sent. 12968 len. 12]: I could n't approach the subject again , for months . '
Parsing [sent. 12969 len. 7]: ` You did at last ? '
Parsing [sent. 12970 len. 14]: said I. ` Well , the Reverend Horace did , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 12971 len. 51]: ` He is an excellent man , most exemplary in every way ; and he pointed out to her that she ought , as a Christian , to reconcile herself to the sacrifice -LRB- especially as it was so uncertain -RRB- , and to bear no uncharitable feeling towards me .
Parsing [sent. 12972 len. 24]: As to myself , Copperfield , I give you my word , I felt a perfect bird of prey towards the family . '
Parsing [sent. 12973 len. 13]: ` The sisters took your part , I hope , Traddles ? '
Parsing [sent. 12974 len. 14]: ` Why , I ca n't say they did , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 12975 len. 19]: ` When we had comparatively reconciled Mrs. Crewler to it , we had to break it to Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 12976 len. 19]: You recollect my mentioning Sarah , as the one that has something the matter with her spine ? '
Parsing [sent. 12977 len. 4]: ` Perfectly ! '
Parsing [sent. 12978 len. 44]: ` She clenched both her hands , ' said Traddles , looking at me in dismay ; ` shut her eyes ; turned lead-colour ; became perfectly stiff ; and took nothing for two days but toast-and-water , administered with a tea-spoon . '
Parsing [sent. 12979 len. 10]: ` What a very unpleasant girl , Traddles ! '
Parsing [sent. 12980 len. 3]: I remarked .
Parsing [sent. 12981 len. 11]: ` Oh , I beg your pardon , Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 12982 len. 3]: said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 12983 len. 17]: ` She is a very charming girl , but she has a great deal of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 12984 len. 7]: In fact , they all have .
Parsing [sent. 12985 len. 23]: Sophy told me afterwards , that the self-reproach she underwent while she was in attendance upon Sarah , no words could describe .
Parsing [sent. 12986 len. 22]: I know it must have been severe , by my own feelings , Copperfield ; which were like a criminal 's .
Parsing [sent. 12987 len. 29]: After Sarah was restored , we still had to break it to the other eight ; and it produced various effects upon them of a most pathetic nature .
Parsing [sent. 12988 len. 18]: The two little ones , whom Sophy educates , have only just left off de-testing me . '
Parsing [sent. 12989 len. 17]: ` At any rate , they are all reconciled to it now , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 12990 len. 25]: said I. ` Ye-yes , I should say they were , on the whole , resigned to it , ' said Traddles , doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 12991 len. 25]: ` The fact is , we avoid mentioning the subject ; and my unsettled prospects and indifferent circumstances are a great consolation to them .
Parsing [sent. 12992 len. 12]: There will be a deplorable scene , whenever we are married .
Parsing [sent. 12993 len. 13]: It will be much more like a funeral , than a wedding .
Parsing [sent. 12994 len. 12]: And they 'll all hate me for taking her away ! '
Parsing [sent. 12995 len. 60]: His honest face , as he looked at me with a serio-comic shake of his head , impresses me more in the remembrance than it did in the reality , for I was by this time in a state of such excessive trepidation and wandering of mind , as to be quite unable to fix my attention on anything .
Parsing [sent. 12996 len. 43]: On our approaching the house where the Misses Spenlow lived , I was at such a discount in respect of my personal looks and presence of mind , that Traddles proposed a gentle stimulant in the form of a glass of ale .
Parsing [sent. 12997 len. 24]: This having been administered at a neighbouring public-house , he conducted me , with tottering steps , to the Misses Spenlow 's door .
Parsing [sent. 12998 len. 50]: I had a vague sensation of being , as it were , on view , when the maid opened it ; and of wavering , somehow , across a hall with a weather-glass in it , into a quiet little drawing-room on the ground-floor , commanding a neat garden .
Parsing [sent. 12999 len. 48]: Also of sitting down here , on a sofa , and seeing Traddles 's hair start up , now his hat was removed , like one of those obtrusive little figures made of springs , that fly out of fictitious snuff-boxes when the lid is taken off .
Parsing [sent. 13000 len. 32]: Also of hearing an old-fashioned clock ticking away on the chimney-piece , and trying to make it keep time to the jerking of my heart , -- which it would n't .
Parsing [sent. 13001 len. 16]: Also of looking round the room for any sign of Dora , and seeing none .
Parsing [sent. 13002 len. 18]: Also of thinking that Jip once barked in the distance , and was instantly choked by somebody .
Parsing [sent. 13003 len. 43]: Ultimately I found myself backing Traddles into the fireplace , and bowing in great confusion to two dry little elderly ladies , dressed in black , and each looking wonderfully like a preparation in chip or tan of the late Mr. Spenlow .
Parsing [sent. 13004 len. 17]: ` Pray , ' said one of the two little ladies , ` be seated . '
Parsing [sent. 13005 len. 97]: When I had done tumbling over Traddles , and had sat upon something which was not a cat -- my first seat was -- I so far recovered my sight , as to perceive that Mr. Spenlow had evidently been the youngest of the family ; that there was a disparity of six or eight years between the two sisters ; and that the younger appeared to be the manager of the conference , inasmuch as she had my letter in her hand -- so familiar as it looked to me , and yet so odd !
Parsing [sent. 13006 len. 10]: -- and was referring to it through an eye-glass .
Parsing [sent. 13007 len. 52]: They were dressed alike , but this sister wore her dress with a more youthful air than the other ; and perhaps had a trifle more frill , or tucker , or brooch , or bracelet , or some little thing of that kind , which made her look more lively .
Parsing [sent. 13008 len. 17]: They were both upright in their carriage , formal , precise , composed , and quiet .
Parsing [sent. 13009 len. 26]: The sister who had not my letter , had her arms crossed on her breast , and resting on each other , like an Idol .
Parsing [sent. 13010 len. 22]: ` Mr. Copperfield , I believe , ' said the sister who had got my letter , addressing herself to Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 13011 len. 6]: This was a frightful beginning .
Parsing [sent. 13012 len. 44]: Traddles had to indicate that I was Mr. Copperfield , and I had to lay claim to myself , and they had to divest themselves of a preconceived opinion that Traddles was Mr. Copperfield , and altogether we were in a nice condition .
Parsing [sent. 13013 len. 19]: To improve it , we all distinctly heard Jip give two short barks , and receive another choke .
Parsing [sent. 13014 len. 5]: ` Mr. Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 13015 len. 7]: said the sister with the letter .
Parsing [sent. 13016 len. 21]: I did something -- bowed , I suppose -- and was all attention , when the other sister struck in .
Parsing [sent. 13017 len. 33]: ` My sister Lavinia , ' said she ` being conversant with matters of this nature , will state what we consider most calculated to promote the happiness of both parties . '
Parsing [sent. 13018 len. 42]: I discovered afterwards that Miss Lavinia was an authority in affairs of the heart , by reason of there having anciently existed a certain Mr. Pidger , who played short whist , and was supposed to have been enamoured of her .
Parsing [sent. 13019 len. 41]: My private opinion is , that this was entirely a gratuitous assumption , and that Pidger was altogether innocent of any such sentiments -- to which he had never given any sort of expression that I could ever hear of .
Parsing [sent. 13020 len. 54]: Both Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa had a superstition , however , that he would have declared his passion , if he had not been cut short in his youth -LRB- at about sixty -RRB- by over-drinking his constitution , and over-doing an attempt to set it right again by swilling Bath water .
Parsing [sent. 13021 len. 43]: They had a lurking suspicion even , that he died of secret love ; though I must say there was a picture of him in the house with a damask nose , which concealment did not appear to have ever preyed upon .
Parsing [sent. 13022 len. 20]: ` We will not , ' said Miss Lavinia , ` enter on the past history of this matter .
Parsing [sent. 13023 len. 11]: Our poor brother Francis 's death has cancelled that . '
Parsing [sent. 13024 len. 34]: ` We had not , ' said Miss Clarissa , ` been in the habit of frequent association with our brother Francis ; but there was no decided division or disunion between us .
Parsing [sent. 13025 len. 9]: Francis took his road ; we took ours .
Parsing [sent. 13026 len. 16]: We considered it conducive to the happiness of all parties that it should be so .
Parsing [sent. 13027 len. 6]: And it was so . '
Parsing [sent. 13028 len. 24]: Each of the sisters leaned a little forward to speak , shook her head after speaking , and became upright again when silent .
Parsing [sent. 13029 len. 7]: Miss Clarissa never moved her arms .
Parsing [sent. 13030 len. 22]: She sometimes played tunes upon them with her fingers -- minuets and marches I should think -- but never moved them .
Parsing [sent. 13031 len. 43]: ` Our niece 's position , or supposed position , is much changed by our brother Francis 's death , ' said Miss Lavinia ; ` and therefore we consider our brother 's opinions as regarded her position as being changed too .
Parsing [sent. 13032 len. 46]: We have no reason to doubt , Mr. Copperfield , that you are a young gentleman possessed of good qualities and honourable character ; or that you have an affection -- or are fully persuaded that you have an affection -- for our niece . '
Parsing [sent. 13033 len. 25]: I replied , as I usually did whenever I had a chance , that nobody had ever loved anybody else as I loved Dora .
Parsing [sent. 13034 len. 10]: Traddles came to my assistance with a confirmatory murmur .
Parsing [sent. 13035 len. 81]: Miss Lavinia was going on to make some rejoinder , when Miss Clarissa , who appeared to be incessantly beset by a desire to refer to her brother Francis , struck in again : ` If Dora 's mama , ' she said , ` when she married our brother Francis , had at once said that there was not room for the family at the dinner-table , it would have been better for the happiness of all parties . '
Parsing [sent. 13036 len. 9]: ` Sister Clarissa , ' said Miss Lavinia .
Parsing [sent. 13037 len. 10]: ` Perhaps we need n't mind that now . '
Parsing [sent. 13038 len. 16]: ` Sister Lavinia , ' said Miss Clarissa , ` it belongs to the subject .
Parsing [sent. 13039 len. 23]: With your branch of the subject , on which alone you are competent to speak , I should not think of interfering .
Parsing [sent. 13040 len. 14]: On this branch of the subject I have a voice and an opinion .
Parsing [sent. 13041 len. 32]: It would have been better for the happiness of all parties , if Dora 's mama , when she married our brother Francis , had mentioned plainly what her intentions were .
Parsing [sent. 13042 len. 11]: We should then have known what we had to expect .
Parsing [sent. 13043 len. 27]: We should have said `` Pray do not invite us , at any time '' ; and all possibility of misunderstanding would have been avoided . '
Parsing [sent. 13044 len. 21]: When Miss Clarissa had shaken her head , Miss Lavinia resumed : again referring to my letter through her eye-glass .
Parsing [sent. 13045 len. 20]: They both had little bright round twinkling eyes , by the way , which were like birds ' eyes .
Parsing [sent. 13046 len. 31]: They were not unlike birds , altogether ; having a sharp , brisk , sudden manner , and a little short , spruce way of adjusting themselves , like canaries .
Parsing [sent. 13047 len. 37]: Miss Lavinia , as I have said , resumed : ` You ask permission of my sister Clarissa and myself , Mr. Copperfield , to visit here , as the accepted suitor of our niece . '
Parsing [sent. 13048 len. 55]: ` If our brother Francis , ' said Miss Clarissa , breaking out again , if I may call anything so calm a breaking out , ` wished to surround himself with an atmosphere of Doctors ' Commons , and of Doctors ' Commons only , what right or desire had we to object ?
Parsing [sent. 13049 len. 6]: None , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 13050 len. 13]: We have ever been far from wishing to obtrude ourselves on anyone .
Parsing [sent. 13051 len. 6]: But why not say so ?
Parsing [sent. 13052 len. 11]: Let our brother Francis and his wife have their society .
Parsing [sent. 13053 len. 10]: Let my sister Lavinia and myself have our society .
Parsing [sent. 13054 len. 11]: We can find it for ourselves , I hope . '
Parsing [sent. 13055 len. 21]: As this appeared to be addressed to Traddles and me , both Traddles and I made some sort of reply .
Parsing [sent. 13056 len. 4]: Traddles was inaudible .
Parsing [sent. 13057 len. 16]: I think I observed , myself , that it was highly creditable to all concerned .
Parsing [sent. 13058 len. 11]: I do n't in the least know what I meant .
Parsing [sent. 13059 len. 25]: ` Sister Lavinia , ' said Miss Clarissa , having now relieved her mind , ` you can go on , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 13060 len. 44]: Miss Lavinia proceeded : ` Mr. Copperfield , my sister Clarissa and I have been very careful indeed in considering this letter ; and we have not considered it without finally showing it to our niece , and discussing it with our niece .
Parsing [sent. 13061 len. 14]: We have no doubt that you think you like her very much . '
Parsing [sent. 13062 len. 13]: ` Think , ma'am , ' I rapturously began , ` oh !
Parsing [sent. 13063 len. 31]: -- ' But Miss Clarissa giving me a look -LRB- just like a sharp canary -RRB- , as requesting that I would not interrupt the oracle , I begged pardon .
Parsing [sent. 13064 len. 43]: ` Affection , ' said Miss Lavinia , glancing at her sister for corroboration , which she gave in the form of a little nod to every clause , ` mature affection , homage , devotion , does not easily express itself .
Parsing [sent. 13065 len. 5]: Its voice is low .
Parsing [sent. 13066 len. 15]: It is modest and retiring , it lies in ambush , waits and waits .
Parsing [sent. 13067 len. 6]: Such is the mature fruit .
Parsing [sent. 13068 len. 16]: Sometimes a life glides away , and finds it still ripening in the shade . '
Parsing [sent. 13069 len. 45]: Of course I did not understand then that this was an allusion to her supposed experience of the stricken Pidger ; but I saw , from the gravity with which Miss Clarissa nodded her head , that great weight was attached to these words .
Parsing [sent. 13070 len. 37]: ` The light -- for I call them , in comparison with such sentiments , the light -- inclinations of very young people , ' pursued Miss Lavinia , ` are dust , compared to rocks .
Parsing [sent. 13071 len. 55]: It is owing to the difficulty of knowing whether they are likely to endure or have any real foundation , that my sister Clarissa and myself have been very undecided how to act , Mr. Copperfield , and Mr. -- ' ` Traddles , ' said my friend , finding himself looked at . '
Parsing [sent. 13072 len. 4]: I beg pardon .
Parsing [sent. 13073 len. 9]: Of the Inner Temple , I believe ? '
Parsing [sent. 13074 len. 10]: said Miss Clarissa , again glancing at my letter .
Parsing [sent. 13075 len. 15]: Traddles said ` Exactly so , ' and became pretty red in the face .
Parsing [sent. 13076 len. 70]: Now , although I had not received any express encouragement as yet , I fancied that I saw in the two little sisters , and particularly in Miss Lavinia , an intensified enjoyment of this new and fruitful subject of domestic interest , a settling down to make the most of it , a disposition to pet it , in which there was a good bright ray of hope .
Parsing [sent. 13077 len. 57]: I thought I perceived that Miss Lavinia would have uncommon satisfaction in superintending two young lovers , like Dora and me ; and that Miss Clarissa would have hardly less satisfaction in seeing her superintend us , and in chiming in with her own particular department of the subject whenever that impulse was strong upon her .
Parsing [sent. 13078 len. 60]: This gave me courage to protest most vehemently that I loved Dora better than I could tell , or anyone believe ; that all my friends knew how I loved her ; that my aunt , Agnes , Traddles , everyone who knew me , knew how I loved her , and how earnest my love had made me .
Parsing [sent. 13079 len. 11]: For the truth of this , I appealed to Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 13080 len. 44]: And Traddles , firing up as if he were plunging into a Parliamentary Debate , really did come out nobly : confirming me in good round terms , and in a plain sensible practical manner , that evidently made a favourable impression . '
Parsing [sent. 13081 len. 60]: I speak , if I may presume to say so , as one who has some little experience of such things , ' said Traddles , ` being myself engaged to a young lady -- one of ten , down in Devonshire -- and seeing no probability , at present , of our engagement coming to a termination . '
Parsing [sent. 13082 len. 44]: ` You may be able to confirm what I have said , Mr. Traddles , ' observed Miss Lavinia , evidently taking a new interest in him , ` of the affection that is modest and retiring ; that waits and waits ? '
Parsing [sent. 13083 len. 9]: ` Entirely , ma'am , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 13084 len. 13]: Miss Clarissa looked at Miss Lavinia , and shook her head gravely .
Parsing [sent. 13085 len. 14]: Miss Lavinia looked consciously at Miss Clarissa , and heaved a little sigh .
Parsing [sent. 13086 len. 15]: ` Sister Lavinia , ' said Miss Clarissa , ` take my smelling-bottle . '
Parsing [sent. 13087 len. 78]: Miss Lavinia revived herself with a few whiffs of aromatic vinegar - Traddles and I looking on with great solicitude the while ; and then went on to say , rather faintly : ` My sister and myself have been in great doubt , Mr. Traddles , what course we ought to take in reference to the likings , or imaginary likings , of such very young people as your friend Mr. Copperfield and our niece . '
Parsing [sent. 13088 len. 12]: ` Our brother Francis 's child , ' remarked Miss Clarissa .
Parsing [sent. 13089 len. 51]: ` If our brother Francis 's wife had found it convenient in her lifetime -LRB- though she had an unquestionable right to act as she thought best -RRB- to invite the family to her dinner-table , we might have known our brother Francis 's child better at the present moment .
Parsing [sent. 13090 len. 6]: Sister Lavinia , proceed . '
Parsing [sent. 13091 len. 33]: Miss Lavinia turned my letter , so as to bring the superscription towards herself , and referred through her eye-glass to some orderly-looking notes she had made on that part of it .
Parsing [sent. 13092 len. 28]: ` It seems to us , ' said she , ` prudent , Mr. Traddles , to bring these feelings to the test of our own observation .
Parsing [sent. 13093 len. 25]: At present we know nothing of them , and are not in a situation to judge how much reality there may be in them .
Parsing [sent. 13094 len. 23]: Therefore we are inclined so far to accede to Mr. Copperfield 's proposal , as to admit his visits here . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13095 len. 25]: I shall never , dear ladies , ' I exclaimed , relieved of an immense load of apprehension , ` forget your kindness ! '
Parsing [sent. 13096 len. 32]: ` But , ' pursued Miss Lavinia , -- ` but , we would prefer to regard those visits , Mr. Traddles , as made , at present , to us .
Parsing [sent. 13097 len. 40]: We must guard ourselves from recognizing any positive engagement between Mr. Copperfield and our niece , until we have had an opportunity -- ' ` Until YOU have had an opportunity , sister Lavinia , ' said Miss Clarissa .
Parsing [sent. 13098 len. 26]: ` Be it so , ' assented Miss Lavinia , with a sigh -- ` until I have had an opportunity of observing them . '
Parsing [sent. 13099 len. 29]: ` Copperfield , ' said Traddles , turning to me , ` you feel , I am sure , that nothing could be more reasonable or considerate . '
Parsing [sent. 13100 len. 4]: ` Nothing ! '
Parsing [sent. 13101 len. 11]: cried I. ' I am deeply sensible of it . '
Parsing [sent. 13102 len. 62]: ` In this position of affairs , ' said Miss Lavinia , again referring to her notes , ` and admitting his visits on this understanding only , we must require from Mr. Copperfield a distinct assurance , on his word of honour , that no communication of any kind shall take place between him and our niece without our knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 13103 len. 33]: That no project whatever shall be entertained with regard to our niece , without being first submitted to us -- ' ` To you , sister Lavinia , ' Miss Clarissa interposed .
Parsing [sent. 13104 len. 8]: ` Be it so , Clarissa ! '
Parsing [sent. 13105 len. 14]: assented Miss Lavinia resignedly -- ` to me -- and receiving our concurrence .
Parsing [sent. 13106 len. 19]: We must make this a most express and serious stipulation , not to be broken on any account .
Parsing [sent. 13107 len. 41]: We wished Mr. Copperfield to be accompanied by some confidential friend today , ' with an inclination of her head towards Traddles , who bowed , ` in order that there might be no doubt or misconception on this subject .
Parsing [sent. 13108 len. 32]: If Mr. Copperfield , or if you , Mr. Traddles , feel the least scruple , in giving this promise , I beg you to take time to consider it . '
Parsing [sent. 13109 len. 21]: I exclaimed , in a state of high ecstatic fervour , that not a moment 's consideration could be necessary .
Parsing [sent. 13110 len. 41]: I bound myself by the required promise , in a most impassioned manner ; called upon Traddles to witness it ; and denounced myself as the most atrocious of characters if I ever swerved from it in the least degree .
Parsing [sent. 13111 len. 4]: ` Stay ! '
Parsing [sent. 13112 len. 40]: said Miss Lavinia , holding up her hand ; ` we resolved , before we had the pleasure of receiving you two gentlemen , to leave you alone for a quarter of an hour , to consider this point .
Parsing [sent. 13113 len. 8]: You will allow us to retire . '
Parsing [sent. 13114 len. 14]: It was in vain for me to say that no consideration was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 13115 len. 9]: They persisted in withdrawing for the specified time .
Parsing [sent. 13116 len. 34]: Accordingly , these little birds hopped out with great dignity ; leaving me to receive the congratulations of Traddles , and to feel as if I were translated to regions of exquisite happiness .
Parsing [sent. 13117 len. 22]: Exactly at the expiration of the quarter of an hour , they reappeared with no less dignity than they had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 13118 len. 25]: They had gone rustling away as if their little dresses were made of autumn-leaves : and they came rustling back , in like manner .
Parsing [sent. 13119 len. 11]: I then bound myself once more to the prescribed conditions .
Parsing [sent. 13120 len. 17]: ` Sister Clarissa , ' said Miss Lavinia , ` the rest is with you . '
Parsing [sent. 13121 len. 19]: Miss Clarissa , unfolding her arms for the first time , took the notes and glanced at them .
Parsing [sent. 13122 len. 29]: ` We shall be happy , ' said Miss Clarissa , ` to see Mr. Copperfield to dinner , every Sunday , if it should suit his convenience .
Parsing [sent. 13123 len. 6]: Our hour is three . '
Parsing [sent. 13124 len. 3]: I bowed .
Parsing [sent. 13125 len. 25]: ` In the course of the week , ' said Miss Clarissa , ` we shall be happy to see Mr. Copperfield to tea .
Parsing [sent. 13126 len. 7]: Our hour is half-past six . '
Parsing [sent. 13127 len. 4]: I bowed again .
Parsing [sent. 13128 len. 22]: ` Twice in the week , ' said Miss Clarissa , ` but , as a rule , not oftener . '
Parsing [sent. 13129 len. 4]: I bowed again .
Parsing [sent. 13130 len. 23]: ` Miss Trotwood , ' said Miss Clarissa , ` mentioned in Mr. Copperfield 's letter , will perhaps call upon us .
Parsing [sent. 13131 len. 22]: When visiting is better for the happiness of all parties , we are glad to receive visits , and return them .
Parsing [sent. 13132 len. 37]: When it is better for the happiness of all parties that no visiting should take place , -LRB- as in the case of our brother Francis , and his establishment -RRB- that is quite different . '
Parsing [sent. 13133 len. 32]: I intimated that my aunt would be proud and delighted to make their acquaintance ; though I must say I was not quite sure of their getting on very satisfactorily together .
Parsing [sent. 13134 len. 43]: The conditions being now closed , I expressed my acknowledgements in the warmest manner ; and , taking the hand , first of Miss Clarissa , and then of Miss Lavinia , pressed it , in each case , to my lips .
Parsing [sent. 13135 len. 22]: Miss Lavinia then arose , and begging Mr. Traddles to excuse us for a minute , requested me to follow her .
Parsing [sent. 13136 len. 15]: I obeyed , all in a tremble , and was conducted into another room .
Parsing [sent. 13137 len. 36]: There I found my blessed darling stopping her ears behind the door , with her dear little face against the wall ; and Jip in the plate-warmer with his head tied up in a towel .
Parsing [sent. 13138 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 13139 len. 28]: How beautiful she was in her black frock , and how she sobbed and cried at first , and would n't come out from behind the door !
Parsing [sent. 13140 len. 52]: How fond we were of one another , when she did come out at last ; and what a state of bliss I was in , when we took Jip out of the plate-warmer , and restored him to the light , sneezing very much , and were all three reunited !
Parsing [sent. 13141 len. 5]: ` My dearest Dora !
Parsing [sent. 13142 len. 10]: Now , indeed , my own for ever ! '
Parsing [sent. 13143 len. 7]: ` Oh , DO N'T ! '
Parsing [sent. 13144 len. 3]: pleaded Dora .
Parsing [sent. 13145 len. 4]: ` Please ! '
Parsing [sent. 13146 len. 12]: ` Are you not my own for ever , Dora ? '
Parsing [sent. 13147 len. 10]: ` Oh yes , of course I am ! '
Parsing [sent. 13148 len. 11]: cried Dora , ` but I am so frightened ! '
Parsing [sent. 13149 len. 7]: ` Frightened , my own ? '
Parsing [sent. 13150 len. 4]: ` Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 13151 len. 10]: I do n't like him , ' said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 13152 len. 8]: ` Why do n't he go ? '
Parsing [sent. 13153 len. 7]: ` Who , my life ? '
Parsing [sent. 13154 len. 8]: ` Your friend , ' said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 13155 len. 9]: ` It is n't any business of his .
Parsing [sent. 13156 len. 8]: What a stupid he must be ! '
Parsing [sent. 13157 len. 5]: ` My love ! '
Parsing [sent. 13158 len. 13]: -LRB- There never was anything so coaxing as her childish ways . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 13159 len. 8]: ` He is the best creature ! '
Parsing [sent. 13160 len. 13]: ` Oh , but we do n't want any best creatures ! '
Parsing [sent. 13161 len. 3]: pouted Dora .
Parsing [sent. 13162 len. 23]: ` My dear , ' I argued , ` you will soon know him well , and like him of all things .
Parsing [sent. 13163 len. 24]: And here is my aunt coming soon ; and you 'll like her of all things too , when you know her . '
Parsing [sent. 13164 len. 10]: ` No , please do n't bring her ! '
Parsing [sent. 13165 len. 15]: said Dora , giving me a horrified little kiss , and folding her hands .
Parsing [sent. 13166 len. 4]: ` Do n't .
Parsing [sent. 13167 len. 11]: I know she 's a naughty , mischief-making old thing !
Parsing [sent. 13168 len. 10]: Do n't let her come here , Doady ! '
Parsing [sent. 13169 len. 7]: which was a corruption of David .
Parsing [sent. 13170 len. 90]: Remonstrance was of no use , then ; so I laughed , and admired , and was very much in love and very happy ; and she showed me Jip 's new trick of standing on his hind legs in a corner -- which he did for about the space of a flash of lightning , and then fell down -- and I do n't know how long I should have stayed there , oblivious of Traddles , if Miss Lavinia had not come in to take me away .
Parsing [sent. 13171 len. 46]: Miss Lavinia was very fond of Dora -LRB- she told me Dora was exactly like what she had been herself at her age -- she must have altered a good deal -RRB- , and she treated Dora just as if she had been a toy .
Parsing [sent. 13172 len. 44]: I wanted to persuade Dora to come and see Traddles , but on my proposing it she ran off to her own room and locked herself in ; so I went to Traddles without her , and walked away with him on air .
Parsing [sent. 13173 len. 24]: ` Nothing could be more satisfactory , ' said Traddles ; ` and they are very agreeable old ladies , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 13174 len. 20]: I should n't be at all surprised if you were to be married years before me , Copperfield . '
Parsing [sent. 13175 len. 12]: ` Does your Sophy play on any instrument , Traddles ? '
Parsing [sent. 13176 len. 10]: I inquired , in the pride of my heart .
Parsing [sent. 13177 len. 19]: ` She knows enough of the piano to teach it to her little sisters , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 13178 len. 8]: ` Does she sing at all ? '
Parsing [sent. 13179 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 13180 len. 27]: ` Why , she sings ballads , sometimes , to freshen up the others a little when they 're out of spirits , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 13181 len. 5]: ` Nothing scientific . '
Parsing [sent. 13182 len. 10]: ` She does n't sing to the guitar ? '
Parsing [sent. 13183 len. 8]: said I. ` Oh dear no ! '
Parsing [sent. 13184 len. 3]: said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 13185 len. 6]: ` Paint at all ? '
Parsing [sent. 13186 len. 9]: ` Not at all , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 13187 len. 17]: I promised Traddles that he should hear Dora sing , and see some of her flower-painting .
Parsing [sent. 13188 len. 23]: He said he should like it very much , and we went home arm in arm in great good humour and delight .
Parsing [sent. 13189 len. 27]: I encouraged him to talk about Sophy , on the way ; which he did with a loving reliance on her that I very much admired .
Parsing [sent. 13190 len. 35]: I compared her in my mind with Dora , with considerable inward satisfaction ; but I candidly admitted to myself that she seemed to be an excellent kind of girl for Traddles , too .
Parsing [sent. 13191 len. 31]: Of course my aunt was immediately made acquainted with the successful issue of the conference , and with all that had been said and done in the course of it .
Parsing [sent. 13192 len. 22]: She was happy to see me so happy , and promised to call on Dora 's aunts without loss of time .
Parsing [sent. 13193 len. 34]: But she took such a long walk up and down our rooms that night , while I was writing to Agnes , that I began to think she meant to walk till morning .
Parsing [sent. 13194 len. 25]: My letter to Agnes was a fervent and grateful one , narrating all the good effects that had resulted from my following her advice .
Parsing [sent. 13195 len. 11]: She wrote , by return of post , to me .
Parsing [sent. 13196 len. 10]: Her letter was hopeful , earnest , and cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 13197 len. 8]: She was always cheerful from that time .
Parsing [sent. 13198 len. 11]: I had my hands more full than ever , now .
Parsing [sent. 13199 len. 27]: My daily journeys to Highgate considered , Putney was a long way off ; and I naturally wanted to go there as often as I could .
Parsing [sent. 13200 len. 27]: The proposed tea-drinkings being quite impracticable , I compounded with Miss Lavinia for permission to visit every Saturday afternoon , without detriment to my privileged Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 13201 len. 29]: So , the close of every week was a delicious time for me ; and I got through the rest of the week by looking forward to it .
Parsing [sent. 13202 len. 29]: I was wonderfully relieved to find that my aunt and Dora 's aunts rubbed on , all things considered , much more smoothly than I could have expected .
Parsing [sent. 13203 len. 34]: My aunt made her promised visit within a few days of the conference ; and within a few more days , Dora 's aunts called upon her , in due state and form .
Parsing [sent. 13204 len. 18]: Similar but more friendly exchanges took place afterwards , usually at intervals of three or four weeks .
Parsing [sent. 13205 len. 70]: I know that my aunt distressed Dora 's aunts very much , by utterly setting at naught the dignity of fly-conveyance , and walking out to Putney at extraordinary times , as shortly after breakfast or just before tea ; likewise by wearing her bonnet in any manner that happened to be comfortable to her head , without at all deferring to the prejudices of civilization on that subject .
Parsing [sent. 13206 len. 64]: But Dora 's aunts soon agreed to regard my aunt as an eccentric and somewhat masculine lady , with a strong understanding ; and although my aunt occasionally ruffled the feathers of Dora 's aunts , by expressing heretical opinions on various points of ceremony , she loved me too well not to sacrifice some of her little peculiarities to the general harmony .
Parsing [sent. 13207 len. 19]: The only member of our small society who positively refused to adapt himself to circumstances , was Jip .
Parsing [sent. 13208 len. 42]: He never saw my aunt without immediately displaying every tooth in his head , retiring under a chair , and growling incessantly : with now and then a doleful howl , as if she really were too much for his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 13209 len. 52]: All kinds of treatment were tried with him , coaxing , scolding , slapping , bringing him to Buckingham Street -LRB- where he instantly dashed at the two cats , to the terror of all beholders -RRB- ; but he never could prevail upon himself to bear my aunt 's society .
Parsing [sent. 13210 len. 53]: He would sometimes think he had got the better of his objection , and be amiable for a few minutes ; and then would put up his snub nose , and howl to that extent , that there was nothing for it but to blind him and put him in the plate-warmer .
Parsing [sent. 13211 len. 25]: At length , Dora regularly muffled him in a towel and shut him up there , whenever my aunt was reported at the door .
Parsing [sent. 13212 len. 15]: One thing troubled me much , after we had fallen into this quiet train .
Parsing [sent. 13213 len. 19]: It was , that Dora seemed by one consent to be regarded like a pretty toy or plaything .
Parsing [sent. 13214 len. 47]: My aunt , with whom she gradually became familiar , always called her Little Blossom ; and the pleasure of Miss Lavinia 's life was to wait upon her , curl her hair , make ornaments for her , and treat her like a pet child .
Parsing [sent. 13215 len. 14]: What Miss Lavinia did , her sister did as a matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 13216 len. 27]: It was very odd to me ; but they all seemed to treat Dora , in her degree , much as Dora treated Jip in his .
Parsing [sent. 13217 len. 58]: I made up my mind to speak to Dora about this ; and one day when we were out walking -LRB- for we were licensed by Miss Lavinia , after a while , to go out walking by ourselves -RRB- , I said to her that I wished she could get them to behave towards her differently .
Parsing [sent. 13218 len. 20]: ` Because you know , my darling , ' I remonstrated , ` you are not a child . '
Parsing [sent. 13219 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 13220 len. 3]: said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 13221 len. 10]: ` Now you 're going to be cross ! '
Parsing [sent. 13222 len. 8]: ` Cross , my love ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13223 len. 25]: I am sure they 're very kind to me , ' said Dora , ` and I am very happy -- ' ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 13224 len. 6]: But my dearest life ! '
Parsing [sent. 13225 len. 17]: said I , ` you might be very happy , and yet be treated rationally . '
Parsing [sent. 13226 len. 11]: Dora gave me a reproachful look -- the prettiest look !
Parsing [sent. 13227 len. 29]: -- and then began to sob , saying , if I did n't like her , why had I ever wanted so much to be engaged to her ?
Parsing [sent. 13228 len. 17]: And why did n't I go away , now , if I could n't bear her ?
Parsing [sent. 13229 len. 24]: What could I do , but kiss away her tears , and tell her how I doted on her , after that ! '
Parsing [sent. 13230 len. 25]: I am sure I am very affectionate , ' said Dora ; ` you ought n't to be cruel to me , Doady ! '
Parsing [sent. 13231 len. 7]: ` Cruel , my precious love !
Parsing [sent. 13232 len. 18]: As if I would -- or could -- be cruel to you , for the world ! '
Parsing [sent. 13233 len. 28]: ` Then do n't find fault with me , ' said Dora , making a rosebud of her mouth ; ` and I 'll be good . '
Parsing [sent. 13234 len. 41]: I was charmed by her presently asking me , of her own accord , to give her that cookery-book I had once spoken of , and to show her how to keep accounts as I had once promised I would .
Parsing [sent. 13235 len. 72]: I brought the volume with me on my next visit -LRB- I got it prettily bound , first , to make it look less dry and more inviting -RRB- ; and as we strolled about the Common , I showed her an old housekeeping-book of my aunt 's , and gave her a set of tablets , and a pretty little pencil-case and box of leads , to practise housekeeping with .
Parsing [sent. 13236 len. 16]: But the cookery-book made Dora 's head ache , and the figures made her cry .
Parsing [sent. 13237 len. 9]: They would n't add up , she said .
Parsing [sent. 13238 len. 22]: So she rubbed them out , and drew little nosegays and likenesses of me and Jip , all over the tablets .
Parsing [sent. 13239 len. 19]: Then I playfully tried verbal instruction in domestic matters , as we walked about on a Saturday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 13240 len. 51]: Sometimes , for example , when we passed a butcher 's shop , I would say : ` Now suppose , my pet , that we were married , and you were going to buy a shoulder of mutton for dinner , would you know how to buy it ? '
Parsing [sent. 13241 len. 34]: My pretty little Dora 's face would fall , and she would make her mouth into a bud again , as if she would very much prefer to shut mine with a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 13242 len. 13]: ` Would you know how to buy it , my darling ? '
Parsing [sent. 13243 len. 12]: I would repeat , perhaps , if I were very inflexible .
Parsing [sent. 13244 len. 34]: Dora would think a little , and then reply , perhaps , with great triumph : ` Why , the butcher would know how to sell it , and what need I know ?
Parsing [sent. 13245 len. 7]: Oh , you silly boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 13246 len. 76]: So , when I once asked Dora , with an eye to the cookery-book , what she would do , if we were married , and I were to say I should like a nice Irish stew , she replied that she would tell the servant to make it ; and then clapped her little hands together across my arm , and laughed in such a charming manner that she was more delightful than ever .
Parsing [sent. 13247 len. 25]: Consequently , the principal use to which the cookery-book was devoted , was being put down in the corner for Jip to stand upon .
Parsing [sent. 13248 len. 44]: But Dora was so pleased , when she had trained him to stand upon it without offering to come off , and at the same time to hold the pencil-case in his mouth , that I was very glad I had bought it .
Parsing [sent. 13249 len. 25]: And we fell back on the guitar-case , and the flower-painting , and the songs about never leaving off dancing , Ta ra la !
Parsing [sent. 13250 len. 10]: and were as happy as the week was long .
Parsing [sent. 13251 len. 61]: I occasionally wished I could venture to hint to Miss Lavinia , that she treated the darling of my heart a little too much like a plaything ; and I sometimes awoke , as it were , wondering to find that I had fallen into the general fault , and treated her like a plaything too -- but not often .
Parsing [sent. 13252 len. 54]: Chapter 42 Mischief I feel as if it were not for me to record , even though this manuscript is intended for no eyes but mine , how hard I worked at that tremendous short-hand , and all improvement appertaining to it , in my sense of responsibility to Dora and her aunts .
Parsing [sent. 13253 len. 73]: I will only add , to what I have already written of my perseverance at this time of my life , and of a patient and continuous energy which then began to be matured within me , and which I know to be the strong part of my character , if it have any strength at all , that there , on looking back , I find the source of my success .
Parsing [sent. 13254 len. 75]: I have been very fortunate in worldly matters ; many men have worked much harder , and not succeeded half so well ; but I never could have done what I have done , without the habits of punctuality , order , and diligence , without the determination to concentrate myself on one object at a time , no matter how quickly its successor should come upon its heels , which I then formed .
Parsing [sent. 13255 len. 12]: Heaven knows I write this , in no spirit of self-laudation .
Parsing [sent. 13256 len. 66]: The man who reviews his own life , as I do mine , in going on here , from page to page , had need to have been a good man indeed , if he would be spared the sharp consciousness of many talents neglected , many opportunities wasted , many erratic and perverted feelings constantly at war within his breast , and defeating him .
Parsing [sent. 13257 len. 18]: I do not hold one natural gift , I dare say , that I have not abused .
Parsing [sent. 13258 len. 57]: My meaning simply is , that whatever I have tried to do in life , I have tried with all my heart to do well ; that whatever I have devoted myself to , I have devoted myself to completely ; that in great aims and in small , I have always been thoroughly in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 13259 len. 34]: I have never believed it possible that any natural or improved ability can claim immunity from the companionship of the steady , plain , hard-working qualities , and hope to gain its end .
Parsing [sent. 13260 len. 12]: There is no such thing as such fulfilment on this earth .
Parsing [sent. 13261 len. 54]: Some happy talent , and some fortunate opportunity , may form the two sides of the ladder on which some men mount , but the rounds of that ladder must be made of stuff to stand wear and tear ; and there is no substitute for thorough-going , ardent , and sincere earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 13262 len. 42]: Never to put one hand to anything , on which I could throw my whole self ; and never to affect depreciation of my work , whatever it was ; I find , now , to have been my golden rules .
Parsing [sent. 13263 len. 23]: How much of the practice I have just reduced to precept , I owe to Agnes , I will not repeat here .
Parsing [sent. 13264 len. 11]: My narrative proceeds to Agnes , with a thankful love .
Parsing [sent. 13265 len. 13]: She came on a visit of a fortnight to the Doctor 's .
Parsing [sent. 13266 len. 23]: Mr. Wickfield was the Doctor 's old friend , and the Doctor wished to talk with him , and do him good .
Parsing [sent. 13267 len. 22]: It had been matter of conversation with Agnes when she was last in town , and this visit was the result .
Parsing [sent. 13268 len. 7]: She and her father came together .
Parsing [sent. 13269 len. 44]: I was not much surprised to hear from her that she had engaged to find a lodging in the neighbourhood for Mrs. Heep , whose rheumatic complaint required change of air , and who would be charmed to have it in such company .
Parsing [sent. 13270 len. 27]: Neither was I surprised when , on the very next day , Uriah , like a dutiful son , brought his worthy mother to take possession .
Parsing [sent. 13271 len. 53]: ` You see , Master Copperfield , ' said he , as he forced himself upon my company for a turn in the Doctor 's garden , ` where a person loves , a person is a little jealous -- leastways , anxious to keep an eye on the beloved one . '
Parsing [sent. 13272 len. 10]: ` Of whom are you jealous , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 13273 len. 32]: said I. ` Thanks to you , Master Copperfield , ' he returned , ` of no one in particular just at present -- no male person , at least . '
Parsing [sent. 13274 len. 14]: ` Do you mean that you are jealous of a female person ? '
Parsing [sent. 13275 len. 16]: He gave me a sidelong glance out of his sinister red eyes , and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 13276 len. 43]: ` Really , Master Copperfield , ' he said , ' - I should say Mister , but I know you 'll excuse the abit I 've got into -- you 're so insinuating , that you draw me like a corkscrew !
Parsing [sent. 13277 len. 40]: Well , I do n't mind telling you , ' putting his fish-like hand on mine , ` I 'm not a lady 's man in general , sir , and I never was , with Mrs. Strong . '
Parsing [sent. 13278 len. 15]: His eyes looked green now , as they watched mine with a rascally cunning .
Parsing [sent. 13279 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 13280 len. 36]: said I. ` Why , though I am a lawyer , Master Copperfield , ' he replied , with a dry grin , ' I mean , just at present , what I say . '
Parsing [sent. 13281 len. 11]: ` And what do you mean by your look ? '
Parsing [sent. 13282 len. 5]: I retorted , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 13283 len. 5]: ` By my look ?
Parsing [sent. 13284 len. 10]: Dear me , Copperfield , that 's sharp practice !
Parsing [sent. 13285 len. 9]: What do I mean by my look ? '
Parsing [sent. 13286 len. 12]: ` Yes , ' said I. ` By your look . '
Parsing [sent. 13287 len. 19]: He seemed very much amused , and laughed as heartily as it was in his nature to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 13288 len. 44]: After some scraping of his chin with his hand , he went on to say , with his eyes cast downward -- still scraping , very slowly : ` When I was but an umble clerk , she always looked down upon me .
Parsing [sent. 13289 len. 43]: She was for ever having my Agnes backwards and forwards at her ouse , and she was for ever being a friend to you , Master Copperfield ; but I was too far beneath her , myself , to be noticed . '
Parsing [sent. 13290 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 13291 len. 10]: said I ; ` suppose you were ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 13292 len. 29]: - And beneath him too , ' pursued Uriah , very distinctly , and in a meditative tone of voice , as he continued to scrape his chin .
Parsing [sent. 13293 len. 31]: ` Do n't you know the Doctor better , ' said I , ` than to suppose him conscious of your existence , when you were not before him ? '
Parsing [sent. 13294 len. 43]: He directed his eyes at me in that sidelong glance again , and he made his face very lantern-jawed , for the greater convenience of scraping , as he answered : ` Oh dear , I am not referring to the Doctor !
Parsing [sent. 13295 len. 6]: Oh no , poor man !
Parsing [sent. 13296 len. 6]: I mean Mr. Maldon ! '
Parsing [sent. 13297 len. 7]: My heart quite died within me .
Parsing [sent. 13298 len. 49]: All my old doubts and apprehensions on that subject , all the Doctor 's happiness and peace , all the mingled possibilities of innocence and compromise , that I could not unravel , I saw , in a moment , at the mercy of this fellow 's twisting .
Parsing [sent. 13299 len. 20]: ` He never could come into the office , without ordering and shoving me about , ' said Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 13300 len. 9]: ` One of your fine gentlemen he was !
Parsing [sent. 13301 len. 11]: I was very meek and umble -- and I am .
Parsing [sent. 13302 len. 16]: But I did n't like that sort of thing -- and I do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 13303 len. 29]: He left off scraping his chin , and sucked in his cheeks until they seemed to meet inside ; keeping his sidelong glance upon me all the while .
Parsing [sent. 13304 len. 43]: ` She is one of your lovely women , she is , ' he pursued , when he had slowly restored his face to its natural form ; ` and ready to be no friend to such as me , I know .
Parsing [sent. 13305 len. 17]: She 's just the person as would put my Agnes up to higher sort of game .
Parsing [sent. 13306 len. 30]: Now , I ai n't one of your lady 's men , Master Copperfield ; but I 've had eyes in my ed , a pretty long time back .
Parsing [sent. 13307 len. 18]: We umble ones have got eyes , mostly speaking -- and we look out of 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 13308 len. 21]: I endeavoured to appear unconscious and not disquieted , but , I saw in his face , with poor success .
Parsing [sent. 13309 len. 60]: ` Now , I 'm not a-going to let myself be run down , Copperfield , ' he continued , raising that part of his countenance , where his red eyebrows would have been if he had had any , with malignant triumph , ` and I shall do what I can to put a stop to this friendship .
Parsing [sent. 13310 len. 7]: I do n't approve of it .
Parsing [sent. 13311 len. 24]: I do n't mind acknowledging to you that I 've got rather a grudging disposition , and want to keep off all intruders .
Parsing [sent. 13312 len. 20]: I ai n't a-going , if I know it , to run the risk of being plotted against . '
Parsing [sent. 13313 len. 37]: ` You are always plotting , and delude yourself into the belief that everybody else is doing the like , I think , ' said I. ` Perhaps so , Master Copperfield , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 13314 len. 24]: ` But I 've got a motive , as my fellow-partner used to say ; and I go at it tooth and nail .
Parsing [sent. 13315 len. 15]: I must n't be put upon , as a numble person , too much .
Parsing [sent. 13316 len. 9]: I ca n't allow people in my way .
Parsing [sent. 13317 len. 14]: Really they must come out of the cart , Master Copperfield ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 13318 len. 17]: I do n't understand you , ' said I. ` Do n't you , though ? '
Parsing [sent. 13319 len. 9]: he returned , with one of his jerks .
Parsing [sent. 13320 len. 16]: ` I 'm astonished at that , Master Copperfield , you being usually so quick !
Parsing [sent. 13321 len. 10]: I 'll try to be plainer , another time .
Parsing [sent. 13322 len. 15]: -- Is that Mr. Maldon a-norseback , ringing at the gate , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 13323 len. 16]: ` It looks like him , ' I replied , as carelessly as I could .
Parsing [sent. 13324 len. 21]: Uriah stopped short , put his hands between his great knobs of knees , and doubled himself up with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 13325 len. 5]: With perfectly silent laughter .
Parsing [sent. 13326 len. 7]: Not a sound escaped from him .
Parsing [sent. 13327 len. 43]: I was so repelled by his odious behaviour , particularly by this concluding instance , that I turned away without any ceremony ; and left him doubled up in the middle of the garden , like a scarecrow in want of support .
Parsing [sent. 13328 len. 34]: It was not on that evening ; but , as I well remember , on the next evening but one , which was a Sunday ; that I took Agnes to see Dora .
Parsing [sent. 13329 len. 19]: I had arranged the visit , beforehand , with Miss Lavinia ; and Agnes was expected to tea .
Parsing [sent. 13330 len. 25]: I was in a flutter of pride and anxiety ; pride in my dear little betrothed , and anxiety that Agnes should like her .
Parsing [sent. 13331 len. 82]: All the way to Putney , Agnes being inside the stage-coach , and I outside , I pictured Dora to myself in every one of the pretty looks I knew so well ; now making up my mind that I should like her to look exactly as she looked at such a time , and then doubting whether I should not prefer her looking as she looked at such another time ; and almost worrying myself into a fever about it .
Parsing [sent. 13332 len. 30]: I was troubled by no doubt of her being very pretty , in any case ; but it fell out that I had never seen her look so well .
Parsing [sent. 13333 len. 24]: She was not in the drawing-room when I presented Agnes to her little aunts , but was shyly keeping out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 13334 len. 28]: I knew where to look for her , now ; and sure enough I found her stopping her ears again , behind the same dull old door .
Parsing [sent. 13335 len. 20]: At first she would n't come at all ; and then she pleaded for five minutes by my watch .
Parsing [sent. 13336 len. 31]: When at length she put her arm through mine , to be taken to the drawing-room , her charming little face was flushed , and had never been so pretty .
Parsing [sent. 13337 len. 22]: But , when we went into the room , and it turned pale , she was ten thousand times prettier yet .
Parsing [sent. 13338 len. 6]: Dora was afraid of Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 13339 len. 14]: She had told me that she knew Agnes was ` too clever ' .
Parsing [sent. 13340 len. 52]: But when she saw her looking at once so cheerful and so earnest , and so thoughtful , and so good , she gave a faint little cry of pleased surprise , and just put her affectionate arms round Agnes 's neck , and laid her innocent cheek against her face .
Parsing [sent. 13341 len. 6]: I never was so happy .
Parsing [sent. 13342 len. 19]: I never was so pleased as when I saw those two sit down together , side by side .
Parsing [sent. 13343 len. 16]: As when I saw my little darling looking up so naturally to those cordial eyes .
Parsing [sent. 13344 len. 15]: As when I saw the tender , beautiful regard which Agnes cast upon her .
Parsing [sent. 13345 len. 15]: Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa partook , in their way , of my joy .
Parsing [sent. 13346 len. 9]: It was the pleasantest tea-table in the world .
Parsing [sent. 13347 len. 4]: Miss Clarissa presided .
Parsing [sent. 13348 len. 53]: I cut and handed the sweet seed-cake -- the little sisters had a bird-like fondness for picking up seeds and pecking at sugar ; Miss Lavinia looked on with benignant patronage , as if our happy love were all her work ; and we were perfectly contented with ourselves and one another .
Parsing [sent. 13349 len. 11]: The gentle cheerfulness of Agnes went to all their hearts .
Parsing [sent. 13350 len. 67]: Her quiet interest in everything that interested Dora ; her manner of making acquaintance with Jip -LRB- who responded instantly -RRB- ; her pleasant way , when Dora was ashamed to come over to her usual seat by me ; her modest grace and ease , eliciting a crowd of blushing little marks of confidence from Dora ; seemed to make our circle quite complete . '
Parsing [sent. 13351 len. 18]: I am so glad , ' said Dora , after tea , ` that you like me .
Parsing [sent. 13352 len. 26]: I did n't think you would ; and I want , more than ever , to be liked , now Julia Mills is gone . '
Parsing [sent. 13353 len. 11]: I have omitted to mention it , by the by .
Parsing [sent. 13354 len. 84]: Miss Mills had sailed , and Dora and I had gone aboard a great East Indiaman at Gravesend to see her ; and we had had preserved ginger , and guava , and other delicacies of that sort for lunch ; and we had left Miss Mills weeping on a camp-stool on the quarter-deck , with a large new diary under her arm , in which the original reflections awakened by the contemplation of Ocean were to be recorded under lock and key .
Parsing [sent. 13355 len. 20]: Agnes said she was afraid I must have given her an unpromising character ; but Dora corrected that directly .
Parsing [sent. 13356 len. 5]: ` Oh no ! '
Parsing [sent. 13357 len. 15]: she said , shaking her curls at me ; ` it was all praise .
Parsing [sent. 13358 len. 17]: He thinks so much of your opinion , that I was quite afraid of it . '
Parsing [sent. 13359 len. 33]: ` My good opinion can not strengthen his attachment to some people whom he knows , ' said Agnes , with a smile ; ` it is not worth their having . '
Parsing [sent. 13360 len. 23]: ` But please let me have it , ' said Dora , in her coaxing way , ` if you can ! '
Parsing [sent. 13361 len. 38]: We made merry about Dora 's wanting to be liked , and Dora said I was a goose , and she did n't like me at any rate , and the short evening flew away on gossamer-wings .
Parsing [sent. 13362 len. 14]: The time was at hand when the coach was to call for us .
Parsing [sent. 13363 len. 27]: I was standing alone before the fire , when Dora came stealing softly in , to give me that usual precious little kiss before I went .
Parsing [sent. 13364 len. 59]: ` Do n't you think , if I had had her for a friend a long time ago , Doady , ' said Dora , her bright eyes shining very brightly , and her little right hand idly busying itself with one of the buttons of my coat , ' I might have been more clever perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 13365 len. 5]: ` My love ! '
Parsing [sent. 13366 len. 8]: said I , ` what nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 13367 len. 9]: ` Do you think it is nonsense ? '
Parsing [sent. 13368 len. 8]: returned Dora , without looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 13369 len. 8]: ` Are you sure it is ? '
Parsing [sent. 13370 len. 8]: ` Of course I am ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 13371 len. 30]: I have forgotten , ' said Dora , still turning the button round and round , ` what relation Agnes is to you , you dear bad boy . '
Parsing [sent. 13372 len. 23]: ` No blood-relation , ' I replied ; ` but we were brought up together , like brother and sister . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13373 len. 12]: I wonder why you ever fell in love with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 13374 len. 11]: said Dora , beginning on another button of my coat .
Parsing [sent. 13375 len. 17]: ` Perhaps because I could n't see you , and not love you , Dora ! '
Parsing [sent. 13376 len. 19]: ` Suppose you had never seen me at all , ' said Dora , going to another button .
Parsing [sent. 13377 len. 9]: ` Suppose we had never been born ! '
Parsing [sent. 13378 len. 5]: said I , gaily .
Parsing [sent. 13379 len. 58]: I wondered what she was thinking about , as I glanced in admiring silence at the little soft hand travelling up the row of buttons on my coat , and at the clustering hair that lay against my breast , and at the lashes of her downcast eyes , slightly rising as they followed her idle fingers .
Parsing [sent. 13380 len. 43]: At length her eyes were lifted up to mine , and she stood on tiptoe to give me , more thoughtfully than usual , that precious little kiss -- once , twice , three times -- and went out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 13381 len. 20]: They all came back together within five minutes afterwards , and Dora 's unusual thoughtfulness was quite gone then .
Parsing [sent. 13382 len. 19]: She was laughingly resolved to put Jip through the whole of his performances , before the coach came .
Parsing [sent. 13383 len. 32]: They took some time -LRB- not so much on account of their variety , as Jip 's reluctance -RRB- , and were still unfinished when it was heard at the door .
Parsing [sent. 13384 len. 95]: There was a hurried but affectionate parting between Agnes and herself ; and Dora was to write to Agnes -LRB- who was not to mind her letters being foolish , she said -RRB- , and Agnes was to write to Dora ; and they had a second parting at the coach door , and a third when Dora , in spite of the remonstrances of Miss Lavinia , would come running out once more to remind Agnes at the coach window about writing , and to shake her curls at me on the box .
Parsing [sent. 13385 len. 21]: The stage-coach was to put us down near Covent Garden , where we were to take another stage-coach for Highgate .
Parsing [sent. 13386 len. 19]: I was impatient for the short walk in the interval , that Agnes might praise Dora to me .
Parsing [sent. 13387 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 13388 len. 5]: what praise it was !
Parsing [sent. 13389 len. 28]: How lovingly and fervently did it commend the pretty creature I had won , with all her artless graces best displayed , to my most gentle care !
Parsing [sent. 13390 len. 24]: How thoughtfully remind me , yet with no pretence of doing so , of the trust in which I held the orphan child !
Parsing [sent. 13391 len. 20]: Never , never , had I loved Dora so deeply and truly , as I loved her that night .
Parsing [sent. 13392 len. 32]: When we had again alighted , and were walking in the starlight along the quiet road that led to the Doctor 's house , I told Agnes it was her doing .
Parsing [sent. 13393 len. 35]: ` When you were sitting by her , ' said I , ` you seemed to be no less her guardian angel than mine ; and you seem so now , Agnes . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13394 len. 13]: A poor angel , ' she returned , ` but faithful . '
Parsing [sent. 13395 len. 66]: The clear tone of her voice , going straight to my heart , made it natural to me to say : ` The cheerfulness that belongs to you , Agnes -LRB- and to no one else that ever I have seen -RRB- , is so restored , I have observed today , that I have begun to hope you are happier at home ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13396 len. 19]: I am happier in myself , ' she said ; ' I am quite cheerful and light-hearted . '
Parsing [sent. 13397 len. 22]: I glanced at the serene face looking upward , and thought it was the stars that made it seem so noble .
Parsing [sent. 13398 len. 18]: ` There has been no change at home , ' said Agnes , after a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 13399 len. 39]: ` No fresh reference , ' said I , ` to -- I would n't distress you , Agnes , but I can not help asking -- to what we spoke of , when we parted last ? '
Parsing [sent. 13400 len. 10]: ` No , none , ' she answered . '
Parsing [sent. 13401 len. 9]: I have thought so much about it . '
Parsing [sent. 13402 len. 8]: ` You must think less about it .
Parsing [sent. 13403 len. 12]: Remember that I confide in simple love and truth at last .
Parsing [sent. 13404 len. 30]: Have no apprehensions for me , Trotwood , ' she added , after a moment ; ` the step you dread my taking , I shall never take . '
Parsing [sent. 13405 len. 34]: Although I think I had never really feared it , in any season of cool reflection , it was an unspeakable relief to me to have this assurance from her own truthful lips .
Parsing [sent. 13406 len. 7]: I told her so , earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 13407 len. 44]: ` And when this visit is over , ' said I , -- ` for we may not be alone another time , -- how long is it likely to be , my dear Agnes , before you come to London again ? '
Parsing [sent. 13408 len. 28]: ` Probably a long time , ' she replied ; ' I think it will be best -- for papa 's sake -- to remain at home .
Parsing [sent. 13409 len. 37]: We are not likely to meet often , for some time to come ; but I shall be a good correspondent of Dora 's , and we shall frequently hear of one another that way . '
Parsing [sent. 13410 len. 13]: We were now within the little courtyard of the Doctor 's cottage .
Parsing [sent. 13411 len. 5]: It was growing late .
Parsing [sent. 13412 len. 25]: There was a light in the window of Mrs. Strong 's chamber , and Agnes , pointing to it , bade me good night .
Parsing [sent. 13413 len. 22]: ` Do not be troubled , ' she said , giving me her hand , ` by our misfortunes and anxieties .
Parsing [sent. 13414 len. 11]: I can be happier in nothing than in your happiness .
Parsing [sent. 13415 len. 18]: If you can ever give me help , rely upon it I will ask you for it .
Parsing [sent. 13416 len. 6]: God bless you always ! '
Parsing [sent. 13417 len. 29]: In her beaming smile , and in these last tones of her cheerful voice , I seemed again to see and hear my little Dora in her company .
Parsing [sent. 13418 len. 27]: I stood awhile , looking through the porch at the stars , with a heart full of love and gratitude , and then walked slowly forth .
Parsing [sent. 13419 len. 38]: I had engaged a bed at a decent alehouse close by , and was going out at the gate , when , happening to turn my head , I saw a light in the Doctor 's study .
Parsing [sent. 13420 len. 20]: A half-reproachful fancy came into my mind , that he had been working at the Dictionary without my help .
Parsing [sent. 13421 len. 51]: With the view of seeing if this were so , and , in any case , of bidding him good night , if he were yet sitting among his books , I turned back , and going softly across the hall , and gently opening the door , looked in .
Parsing [sent. 13422 len. 23]: The first person whom I saw , to my surprise , by the sober light of the shaded lamp , was Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 13423 len. 27]: He was standing close beside it , with one of his skeleton hands over his mouth , and the other resting on the Doctor 's table .
Parsing [sent. 13424 len. 15]: The Doctor sat in his study chair , covering his face with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 13425 len. 19]: Mr. Wickfield , sorely troubled and distressed , was leaning forward , irresolutely touching the Doctor 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 13426 len. 12]: For an instant , I supposed that the Doctor was ill .
Parsing [sent. 13427 len. 23]: I hastily advanced a step under that impression , when I met Uriah 's eye , and saw what was the matter .
Parsing [sent. 13428 len. 19]: I would have withdrawn , but the Doctor made a gesture to detain me , and I remained .
Parsing [sent. 13429 len. 25]: ` At any rate , ' observed Uriah , with a writhe of his ungainly person , ` we may keep the door shut .
Parsing [sent. 13430 len. 12]: We need n't make it known to ALL the town . '
Parsing [sent. 13431 len. 23]: Saying which , he went on his toes to the door , which I had left open , and carefully closed it .
Parsing [sent. 13432 len. 12]: He then came back , and took up his former position .
Parsing [sent. 13433 len. 31]: There was an obtrusive show of compassionate zeal in his voice and manner , more intolerable -- at least to me -- than any demeanour he could have assumed . '
Parsing [sent. 13434 len. 31]: I have felt it incumbent upon me , Master Copperfield , ' said Uriah , ` to point out to Doctor Strong what you and me have already talked about .
Parsing [sent. 13435 len. 10]: You did n't exactly understand me , though ? '
Parsing [sent. 13436 len. 35]: I gave him a look , but no other answer ; and , going to my good old master , said a few words that I meant to be words of comfort and encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 13437 len. 32]: He put his hand upon my shoulder , as it had been his custom to do when I was quite a little fellow , but did not lift his grey head .
Parsing [sent. 13438 len. 49]: ` As you did n't understand me , Master Copperfield , ' resumed Uriah in the same officious manner , ' I may take the liberty of umbly mentioning , being among friends , that I have called Doctor Strong 's attention to the goings-on of Mrs. Strong .
Parsing [sent. 13439 len. 43]: It 's much against the grain with me , I assure you , Copperfield , to be concerned in anything so unpleasant ; but really , as it is , we 're all mixing ourselves up with what ought n't to be .
Parsing [sent. 13440 len. 17]: That was what my meaning was , sir , when you did n't understand me . '
Parsing [sent. 13441 len. 29]: I wonder now , when I recall his leer , that I did not collar him , and try to shake the breath out of his body . '
Parsing [sent. 13442 len. 21]: I dare say I did n't make myself very clear , ' he went on , ` nor you neither .
Parsing [sent. 13443 len. 17]: Naturally , we was both of us inclined to give such a subject a wide berth .
Parsing [sent. 13444 len. 32]: Hows ` ever , at last I have made up my mind to speak plain ; and I have mentioned to Doctor Strong that -- did you speak , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 13445 len. 10]: This was to the Doctor , who had moaned .
Parsing [sent. 13446 len. 21]: The sound might have touched any heart , I thought , but it had no effect upon Uriah 's . '
Parsing [sent. 13447 len. 39]: - mentioned to Doctor Strong , ' he proceeded , ` that anyone may see that Mr. Maldon , and the lovely and agreeable lady as is Doctor Strong 's wife , are too sweet on one another .
Parsing [sent. 13448 len. 71]: Really the time is come -LRB- we being at present all mixing ourselves up with what ought n't to be -RRB- , when Doctor Strong must be told that this was full as plain to everybody as the sun , before Mr. Maldon went to India ; that Mr. Maldon made excuses to come back , for nothing else ; and that he 's always here , for nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 13449 len. 48]: When you come in , sir , I was just putting it to my fellow-partner , ' towards whom he turned , ` to say to Doctor Strong upon his word and honour , whether he 'd ever been of this opinion long ago , or not .
Parsing [sent. 13450 len. 7]: Come , Mr. Wickfield , sir !
Parsing [sent. 13451 len. 9]: Would you be so good as tell us ?
Parsing [sent. 13452 len. 6]: Yes or no , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 13453 len. 5]: Come , partner ! '
Parsing [sent. 13454 len. 41]: ` For God 's sake , my dear Doctor , ' said Mr. Wickfield again laying his irresolute hand upon the Doctor 's arm , ` do n't attach too much weight to any suspicions I may have entertained . '
Parsing [sent. 13455 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 13456 len. 7]: cried Uriah , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 13457 len. 10]: ` What a melancholy confirmation : ai n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 13458 len. 2]: Him !
Parsing [sent. 13459 len. 5]: Such an old friend !
Parsing [sent. 13460 len. 81]: Bless your soul , when I was nothing but a clerk in his office , Copperfield , I 've seen him twenty times , if I 've seen him once , quite in a taking about it -- quite put out , you know -LRB- and very proper in him as a father ; I 'm sure I ca n't blame him -RRB- , to think that Miss Agnes was mixing herself up with what ought n't to be . '
Parsing [sent. 13461 len. 50]: ` My dear Strong , ' said Mr. Wickfield in a tremulous voice , ` my good friend , I need n't tell you that it has been my vice to look for some one master motive in everybody , and to try all actions by one narrow test .
Parsing [sent. 13462 len. 17]: I may have fallen into such doubts as I have had , through this mistake . '
Parsing [sent. 13463 len. 19]: ` You have had doubts , Wickfield , ' said the Doctor , without lifting up his head .
Parsing [sent. 13464 len. 7]: ` You have had doubts . '
Parsing [sent. 13465 len. 11]: ` Speak up , fellow-partner , ' urged Uriah . '
Parsing [sent. 13466 len. 14]: I had , at one time , certainly , ' said Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 13467 len. 13]: ` I -- God forgive me -- I thought YOU had . '
Parsing [sent. 13468 len. 8]: ` No , no , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 13469 len. 13]: returned the Doctor , in a tone of most pathetic grief . '
Parsing [sent. 13470 len. 27]: I thought , at one time , ' said Mr. Wickfield , ` that you wished to send Maldon abroad to effect a desirable separation . '
Parsing [sent. 13471 len. 8]: ` No , no , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 13472 len. 4]: returned the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 13473 len. 17]: ` To give Annie pleasure , by making some provision for the companion of her childhood .
Parsing [sent. 13474 len. 4]: Nothing else . '
Parsing [sent. 13475 len. 11]: ` So I found , ' said Mr. Wickfield . '
Parsing [sent. 13476 len. 12]: I could n't doubt it , when you told me so .
Parsing [sent. 13477 len. 52]: But I thought -- I implore you to remember the narrow construction which has been my besetting sin -- that , in a case where there was so much disparity in point of years -- ' ` That 's the way to put it , you see , Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 13478 len. 10]: observed Uriah , with fawning and offensive pity . '
Parsing [sent. 13479 len. 30]: - a lady of such youth , and such attractions , however real her respect for you , might have been influenced in marrying , by worldly considerations only .
Parsing [sent. 13480 len. 17]: I make no allowance for innumerable feelings and circumstances that may have all tended to good .
Parsing [sent. 13481 len. 8]: For Heaven 's sake remember that ! '
Parsing [sent. 13482 len. 8]: ` How kind he puts it ! '
Parsing [sent. 13483 len. 7]: said Uriah , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 13484 len. 53]: ` Always observing her from one point of view , ' said Mr. Wickfield ; ` but by all that is dear to you , my old friend , I entreat you to consider what it was ; I am forced to confess now , having no escape - ' ` No !
Parsing [sent. 13485 len. 27]: There 's no way out of it , Mr. Wickfield , sir , ' observed Uriah , ` when it 's got to this . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13486 len. 77]: - that I did , ' said Mr. Wickfield , glancing helplessly and distractedly at his partner , ` that I did doubt her , and think her wanting in her duty to you ; and that I did sometimes , if I must say all , feel averse to Agnes being in such a familiar relation towards her , as to see what I saw , or in my diseased theory fancied that I saw .
Parsing [sent. 13487 len. 7]: I never mentioned this to anyone .
Parsing [sent. 13488 len. 10]: I never meant it to be known to anyone .
Parsing [sent. 13489 len. 39]: And though it is terrible to you to hear , ' said Mr. Wickfield , quite subdued , ` if you knew how terrible it is for me to tell , you would feel compassion for me ! '
Parsing [sent. 13490 len. 16]: The Doctor , in the perfect goodness of his nature , put out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 13491 len. 18]: Mr. Wickfield held it for a little while in his , with his head bowed down . '
Parsing [sent. 13492 len. 29]: I am sure , ' said Uriah , writhing himself into the silence like a Conger-eel , ` that this is a subject full of unpleasantness to everybody .
Parsing [sent. 13493 len. 24]: But since we have got so far , I ought to take the liberty of mentioning that Copperfield has noticed it too . '
Parsing [sent. 13494 len. 15]: I turned upon him , and asked him how he dared refer to me !
Parsing [sent. 13495 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 13496 len. 49]: it 's very kind of you , Copperfield , ' returned Uriah , undulating all over , ` and we all know what an amiable character yours is ; but you know that the moment I spoke to you the other night , you knew what I meant .
Parsing [sent. 13497 len. 10]: You know you knew what I meant , Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 13498 len. 5]: Do n't deny it !
Parsing [sent. 13499 len. 17]: You deny it with the best intentions ; but do n't do it , Copperfield . '
Parsing [sent. 13500 len. 40]: I saw the mild eye of the good old Doctor turned upon me for a moment , and I felt that the confession of my old misgivings and remembrances was too plainly written in my face to be overlooked .
Parsing [sent. 13501 len. 7]: It was of no use raging .
Parsing [sent. 13502 len. 6]: I could not undo that .
Parsing [sent. 13503 len. 11]: Say what I would , I could not unsay it .
Parsing [sent. 13504 len. 22]: We were silent again , and remained so , until the Doctor rose and walked twice or thrice across the room .
Parsing [sent. 13505 len. 59]: Presently he returned to where his chair stood ; and , leaning on the back of it , and occasionally putting his handkerchief to his eyes , with a simple honesty that did him more honour , to my thinking , than any disguise he could have effected , said : ' I have been much to blame .
Parsing [sent. 13506 len. 10]: I believe I have been very much to blame .
Parsing [sent. 13507 len. 48]: I have exposed one whom I hold in my heart , to trials and aspersions -- I call them aspersions , even to have been conceived in anybody 's inmost mind -- of which she never , but for me , could have been the object . '
Parsing [sent. 13508 len. 8]: Uriah Heep gave a kind of snivel .
Parsing [sent. 13509 len. 6]: I think to express sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 13510 len. 24]: ` Of which my Annie , ' said the Doctor , ` never , but for me , could have been the object .
Parsing [sent. 13511 len. 26]: Gentlemen , I am old now , as you know ; I do not feel , tonight , that I have much to live for .
Parsing [sent. 13512 len. 26]: But my life -- my Life -- upon the truth and honour of the dear lady who has been the subject of this conversation ! '
Parsing [sent. 13513 len. 44]: I do not think that the best embodiment of chivalry , the realization of the handsomest and most romantic figure ever imagined by painter , could have said this , with a more impressive and affecting dignity than the plain old Doctor did .
Parsing [sent. 13514 len. 46]: ` But I am not prepared , ' he went on , ` to deny -- perhaps I may have been , without knowing it , in some degree prepared to admit -- that I may have unwittingly ensnared that lady into an unhappy marriage .
Parsing [sent. 13515 len. 48]: I am a man quite unaccustomed to observe ; and I can not but believe that the observation of several people , of different ages and positions , all too plainly tending in one direction -LRB- and that so natural -RRB- , is better than mine . '
Parsing [sent. 13516 len. 64]: I had often admired , as I have elsewhere described , his benignant manner towards his youthful wife ; but the respectful tenderness he manifested in every reference to her on this occasion , and the almost reverential manner in which he put away from him the lightest doubt of her integrity , exalted him , in my eyes , beyond description . '
Parsing [sent. 13517 len. 17]: I married that lady , ' said the Doctor , ` when she was extremely young .
Parsing [sent. 13518 len. 12]: I took her to myself when her character was scarcely formed .
Parsing [sent. 13519 len. 16]: So far as it was developed , it had been my happiness to form it .
Parsing [sent. 13520 len. 6]: I knew her father well .
Parsing [sent. 13521 len. 5]: I knew her well .
Parsing [sent. 13522 len. 19]: I had taught her what I could , for the love of all her beautiful and virtuous qualities .
Parsing [sent. 13523 len. 41]: If I did her wrong ; as I fear I did , in taking advantage -LRB- but I never meant it -RRB- of her gratitude and her affection ; I ask pardon of that lady , in my heart ! '
Parsing [sent. 13524 len. 33]: He walked across the room , and came back to the same place ; holding the chair with a grasp that trembled , like his subdued voice , in its earnestness . '
Parsing [sent. 13525 len. 18]: I regarded myself as a refuge , for her , from the dangers and vicissitudes of life .
Parsing [sent. 13526 len. 21]: I persuaded myself that , unequal though we were in years , she would live tranquilly and contentedly with me .
Parsing [sent. 13527 len. 40]: I did not shut out of my consideration the time when I should leave her free , and still young and still beautiful , but with her judgement more matured -- no , gentlemen -- upon my truth ! '
Parsing [sent. 13528 len. 14]: His homely figure seemed to be lightened up by his fidelity and generosity .
Parsing [sent. 13529 len. 17]: Every word he uttered had a force that no other grace could have imparted to it .
Parsing [sent. 13530 len. 11]: ` My life with this lady has been very happy .
Parsing [sent. 13531 len. 21]: Until tonight , I have had uninterrupted occasion to bless the day on which I did her great injustice . '
Parsing [sent. 13532 len. 70]: His voice , more and more faltering in the utterance of these words , stopped for a few moments ; then he went on : ` Once awakened from my dream -- I have been a poor dreamer , in one way or other , all my life -- I see how natural it is that she should have some regretful feeling towards her old companion and her equal .
Parsing [sent. 13533 len. 32]: That she does regard him with some innocent regret , with some blameless thoughts of what might have been , but for me , is , I fear , too true .
Parsing [sent. 13534 len. 25]: Much that I have seen , but not noted , has come back upon me with new meaning , during this last trying hour .
Parsing [sent. 13535 len. 27]: But , beyond this , gentlemen , the dear lady 's name never must be coupled with a word , a breath , of doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 13536 len. 23]: For a little while , his eye kindled and his voice was firm ; for a little while he was again silent .
Parsing [sent. 13537 len. 31]: Presently , he proceeded as before : ` It only remains for me , to bear the knowledge of the unhappiness I have occasioned , as submissively as I can .
Parsing [sent. 13538 len. 33]: It is she who should reproach ; not I. To save her from misconstruction , cruel misconstruction , that even my friends have not been able to avoid , becomes my duty .
Parsing [sent. 13539 len. 13]: The more retired we live , the better I shall discharge it .
Parsing [sent. 13540 len. 18]: And when the time comes -- may it come soon , if it be His merciful pleasure !
Parsing [sent. 13541 len. 42]: -- when my death shall release her from constraint , I shall close my eyes upon her honoured face , with unbounded confidence and love ; and leave her , with no sorrow then , to happier and brighter days . '
Parsing [sent. 13542 len. 34]: I could not see him for the tears which his earnestness and goodness , so adorned by , and so adorning , the perfect simplicity of his manner , brought into my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 13543 len. 21]: He had moved to the door , when he added : ` Gentlemen , I have shown you my heart .
Parsing [sent. 13544 len. 8]: I am sure you will respect it .
Parsing [sent. 13545 len. 12]: What we have said tonight is never to be said more .
Parsing [sent. 13546 len. 12]: Wickfield , give me an old friend 's arm upstairs ! '
Parsing [sent. 13547 len. 6]: Mr. Wickfield hastened to him .
Parsing [sent. 13548 len. 18]: Without interchanging a word they went slowly out of the room together , Uriah looking after them .
Parsing [sent. 13549 len. 7]: ` Well , Master Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 13550 len. 8]: said Uriah , meekly turning to me .
Parsing [sent. 13551 len. 25]: ` The thing has n't took quite the turn that might have been expected , for the old Scholar -- what an excellent man !
Parsing [sent. 13552 len. 21]: -- is as blind as a brickbat ; but this family 's out of the cart , I think ! '
Parsing [sent. 13553 len. 25]: I needed but the sound of his voice to be so madly enraged as I never was before , and never have been since .
Parsing [sent. 13554 len. 20]: ` You villain , ' said I , ` what do you mean by entrapping me into your schemes ?
Parsing [sent. 13555 len. 23]: How dare you appeal to me just now , you false rascal , as if we had been in discussion together ? '
Parsing [sent. 13556 len. 64]: As we stood , front to front , I saw so plainly , in the stealthy exultation of his face , what I already so plainly knew ; I mean that he forced his confidence upon me , expressly to make me miserable , and had set a deliberate trap for me in this very matter ; that I could n't bear it .
Parsing [sent. 13557 len. 33]: The whole of his lank cheek was invitingly before me , and I struck it with my open hand with that force that my fingers tingled as if I had burnt them .
Parsing [sent. 13558 len. 19]: He caught the hand in his , and we stood in that connexion , looking at each other .
Parsing [sent. 13559 len. 37]: We stood so , a long time ; long enough for me to see the white marks of my fingers die out of the deep red of his cheek , and leave it a deeper red .
Parsing [sent. 13560 len. 25]: ` Copperfield , ' he said at length , in a breathless voice , ` have you taken leave of your senses ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13561 len. 16]: I have taken leave of you , ' said I , wresting my hand away .
Parsing [sent. 13562 len. 13]: ` You dog , I 'll know no more of you . '
Parsing [sent. 13563 len. 6]: ` Wo n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 13564 len. 16]: said he , constrained by the pain of his cheek to put his hand there .
Parsing [sent. 13565 len. 11]: ` Perhaps you wo n't be able to help it .
Parsing [sent. 13566 len. 11]: Is n't this ungrateful of you , now ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13567 len. 17]: I have shown you often enough , ' said I , ` that I despise you .
Parsing [sent. 13568 len. 13]: I have shown you now , more plainly , that I do .
Parsing [sent. 13569 len. 13]: Why should I dread your doing your worst to all about you ?
Parsing [sent. 13570 len. 8]: What else do you ever do ? '
Parsing [sent. 13571 len. 19]: He perfectly understood this allusion to the considerations that had hitherto restrained me in my communications with him .
Parsing [sent. 13572 len. 29]: I rather think that neither the blow , nor the allusion , would have escaped me , but for the assurance I had had from Agnes that night .
Parsing [sent. 13573 len. 5]: It is no matter .
Parsing [sent. 13574 len. 6]: There was another long pause .
Parsing [sent. 13575 len. 22]: His eyes , as he looked at me , seemed to take every shade of colour that could make eyes ugly .
Parsing [sent. 13576 len. 22]: ` Copperfield , ' he said , removing his hand from his cheek , ` you have always gone against me .
Parsing [sent. 13577 len. 15]: I know you always used to be against me at Mr. Wickfield 's . '
Parsing [sent. 13578 len. 18]: ` You may think what you like , ' said I , still in a towering rage .
Parsing [sent. 13579 len. 14]: ` If it is not true , so much the worthier you . '
Parsing [sent. 13580 len. 11]: ` And yet I always liked you , Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 13581 len. 3]: he rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 13582 len. 30]: I deigned to make him no reply ; and , taking up my hat , was going out to bed , when he came between me and the door .
Parsing [sent. 13583 len. 17]: ` Copperfield , ' he said , ` there must be two parties to a quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 13584 len. 7]: I wo n't be one . '
Parsing [sent. 13585 len. 9]: ` You may go to the devil ! '
Parsing [sent. 13586 len. 9]: said I. ` Do n't say that ! '
Parsing [sent. 13587 len. 4]: he replied . '
Parsing [sent. 13588 len. 8]: I know you 'll be sorry afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 13589 len. 18]: How can you make yourself so inferior to me , as to show such a bad spirit ?
Parsing [sent. 13590 len. 6]: But I forgive you . '
Parsing [sent. 13591 len. 6]: ` You forgive me ! '
Parsing [sent. 13592 len. 5]: I repeated disdainfully . '
Parsing [sent. 13593 len. 14]: I do , and you ca n't help yourself , ' replied Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 13594 len. 19]: ` To think of your going and attacking me , that have always been a friend to you !
Parsing [sent. 13595 len. 18]: But there ca n't be a quarrel without two parties , and I wo n't be one .
Parsing [sent. 13596 len. 13]: I will be a friend to you , in spite of you .
Parsing [sent. 13597 len. 12]: So now you know what you 've got to expect . '
Parsing [sent. 13598 len. 50]: The necessity of carrying on this dialogue -LRB- his part in which was very slow ; mine very quick -RRB- in a low tone , that the house might not be disturbed at an unseasonable hour , did not improve my temper ; though my passion was cooling down .
Parsing [sent. 13599 len. 51]: Merely telling him that I should expect from him what I always had expected , and had never yet been disappointed in , I opened the door upon him , as if he had been a great walnut put there to be cracked , and went out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 13600 len. 29]: But he slept out of the house too , at his mother 's lodging ; and before I had gone many hundred yards , came up with me .
Parsing [sent. 13601 len. 65]: ` You know , Copperfield , ' he said , in my ear -LRB- I did not turn my head -RRB- , ` you 're in quite a wrong position ' ; which I felt to be true , and that made me chafe the more ; ` you ca n't make this a brave thing , and you ca n't help being forgiven .
Parsing [sent. 13602 len. 16]: I do n't intend to mention it to mother , nor to any living soul .
Parsing [sent. 13603 len. 7]: I 'm determined to forgive you .
Parsing [sent. 13604 len. 22]: But I do wonder that you should lift your hand against a person that you knew to be so umble ! '
Parsing [sent. 13605 len. 8]: I felt only less mean than he .
Parsing [sent. 13606 len. 9]: He knew me better than I knew myself .
Parsing [sent. 13607 len. 38]: If he had retorted or openly exasperated me , it would have been a relief and a justification ; but he had put me on a slow fire , on which I lay tormented half the night .
Parsing [sent. 13608 len. 26]: In the morning , when I came out , the early church-bell was ringing , and he was walking up and down with his mother .
Parsing [sent. 13609 len. 18]: He addressed me as if nothing had happened , and I could do no less than reply .
Parsing [sent. 13610 len. 15]: I had struck him hard enough to give him the toothache , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 13611 len. 33]: At all events his face was tied up in a black silk handkerchief , which , with his hat perched on the top of it , was far from improving his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 13612 len. 22]: I heard that he went to a dentist 's in London on the Monday morning , and had a tooth out .
Parsing [sent. 13613 len. 8]: I hope it was a double one .
Parsing [sent. 13614 len. 30]: The Doctor gave out that he was not quite well ; and remained alone , for a considerable part of every day , during the remainder of the visit .
Parsing [sent. 13615 len. 17]: Agnes and her father had been gone a week , before we resumed our usual work .
Parsing [sent. 13616 len. 21]: On the day preceding its resumption , the Doctor gave me with his own hands a folded note not sealed .
Parsing [sent. 13617 len. 29]: It was addressed to myself ; and laid an injunction on me , in a few affectionate words , never to refer to the subject of that evening .
Parsing [sent. 13618 len. 14]: I had confided it to my aunt , but to no one else .
Parsing [sent. 13619 len. 24]: It was not a subject I could discuss with Agnes , and Agnes certainly had not the least suspicion of what had passed .
Parsing [sent. 13620 len. 11]: Neither , I felt convinced , had Mrs. Strong then .
Parsing [sent. 13621 len. 12]: Several weeks elapsed before I saw the least change in her .
Parsing [sent. 13622 len. 14]: It came on slowly , like a cloud when there is no wind .
Parsing [sent. 13623 len. 41]: At first , she seemed to wonder at the gentle compassion with which the Doctor spoke to her , and at his wish that she should have her mother with her , to relieve the dull monotony of her life .
Parsing [sent. 13624 len. 28]: Often , when we were at work , and she was sitting by , I would see her pausing and looking at him with that memorable face .
Parsing [sent. 13625 len. 22]: Afterwards , I sometimes observed her rise , with her eyes full of tears , and go out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 13626 len. 15]: Gradually , an unhappy shadow fell upon her beauty , and deepened every day .
Parsing [sent. 13627 len. 21]: Mrs. Markleham was a regular inmate of the cottage then ; but she talked and talked , and saw nothing .
Parsing [sent. 13628 len. 59]: As this change stole on Annie , once like sunshine in the Doctor 's house , the Doctor became older in appearance , and more grave ; but the sweetness of his temper , the placid kindness of his manner , and his benevolent solicitude for her , if they were capable of any increase , were increased .
Parsing [sent. 13629 len. 72]: I saw him once , early on the morning of her birthday , when she came to sit in the window while we were at work -LRB- which she had always done , but now began to do with a timid and uncertain air that I thought very touching -RRB- , take her forehead between his hands , kiss it , and go hurriedly away , too much moved to remain .
Parsing [sent. 13630 len. 36]: I saw her stand where he had left her , like a statue ; and then bend down her head , and clasp her hands , and weep , I can not say how sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 13631 len. 24]: Sometimes , after that , I fancied that she tried to speak even to me , in intervals when we were left alone .
Parsing [sent. 13632 len. 7]: But she never uttered a word .
Parsing [sent. 13633 len. 53]: The Doctor always had some new project for her participating in amusements away from home , with her mother ; and Mrs. Markleham , who was very fond of amusements , and very easily dissatisfied with anything else , entered into them with great good-will , and was loud in her commendations .
Parsing [sent. 13634 len. 25]: But Annie , in a spiritless unhappy way , only went whither she was led , and seemed to have no care for anything .
Parsing [sent. 13635 len. 8]: I did not know what to think .
Parsing [sent. 13636 len. 21]: Neither did my aunt ; who must have walked , at various times , a hundred miles in her uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 13637 len. 38]: What was strangest of all was , that the only real relief which seemed to make its way into the secret region of this domestic unhappiness , made its way there in the person of Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 13638 len. 36]: What his thoughts were on the subject , or what his observation was , I am as unable to explain , as I dare say he would have been to assist me in the task .
Parsing [sent. 13639 len. 54]: But , as I have recorded in the narrative of my school days , his veneration for the Doctor was unbounded ; and there is a subtlety of perception in real attachment , even when it is borne towards man by one of the lower animals , which leaves the highest intellect behind .
Parsing [sent. 13640 len. 27]: To this mind of the heart , if I may call it so , in Mr. Dick , some bright ray of the truth shot straight .
Parsing [sent. 13641 len. 42]: He had proudly resumed his privilege , in many of his spare hours , of walking up and down the garden with the Doctor ; as he had been accustomed to pace up and down The Doctor 's Walk at Canterbury .
Parsing [sent. 13642 len. 30]: But matters were no sooner in this state , than he devoted all his spare time -LRB- and got up earlier to make it more -RRB- to these perambulations .
Parsing [sent. 13643 len. 40]: If he had never been so happy as when the Doctor read that marvellous performance , the Dictionary , to him ; he was now quite miserable unless the Doctor pulled it out of his pocket , and began .
Parsing [sent. 13644 len. 37]: When the Doctor and I were engaged , he now fell into the custom of walking up and down with Mrs. Strong , and helping her to trim her favourite flowers , or weed the beds .
Parsing [sent. 13645 len. 60]: I dare say he rarely spoke a dozen words in an hour : but his quiet interest , and his wistful face , found immediate response in both their breasts ; each knew that the other liked him , and that he loved both ; and he became what no one else could be -- a link between them .
Parsing [sent. 13646 len. 182]: When I think of him , with his impenetrably wise face , walking up and down with the Doctor , delighted to be battered by the hard words in the Dictionary ; when I think of him carrying huge watering-pots after Annie ; kneeling down , in very paws of gloves , at patient microscopic work among the little leaves ; expressing as no philosopher could have expressed , in everything he did , a delicate desire to be her friend ; showering sympathy , trustfulness , and affection , out of every hole in the watering-pot ; when I think of him never wandering in that better mind of his to which unhappiness addressed itself , never bringing the unfortunate King Charles into the garden , never wavering in his grateful service , never diverted from his knowledge that there was something wrong , or from his wish to set it right - I really feel almost ashamed of having known that he was not quite in his wits , taking account of the utmost I have done with mine .
Parsing [sent. 13647 len. 14]: ` Nobody but myself , Trot , knows what that man is ! '
Parsing [sent. 13648 len. 12]: my aunt would proudly remark , when we conversed about it .
Parsing [sent. 13649 len. 8]: ` Dick will distinguish himself yet ! '
Parsing [sent. 13650 len. 13]: I must refer to one other topic before I close this chapter .
Parsing [sent. 13651 len. 66]: While the visit at the Doctor 's was still in progress , I observed that the postman brought two or three letters every morning for Uriah Heep , who remained at Highgate until the rest went back , it being a leisure time ; and that these were always directed in a business-like manner by Mr. Micawber , who now assumed a round legal hand .
Parsing [sent. 13652 len. 38]: I was glad to infer , from these slight premises , that Mr. Micawber was doing well ; and consequently was much surprised to receive , about this time , the following letter from his amiable wife .
Parsing [sent. 13653 len. 6]: ` CANTERBURY , Monday Evening .
Parsing [sent. 13654 len. 17]: ` You will doubtless be surprised , my dear Mr. Copperfield , to receive this communication .
Parsing [sent. 13655 len. 8]: Still more so , by its contents .
Parsing [sent. 13656 len. 16]: Still more so , by the stipulation of implicit confidence which I beg to impose .
Parsing [sent. 13657 len. 50]: But my feelings as a wife and mother require relief ; and as I do not wish to consult my family -LRB- already obnoxious to the feelings of Mr. Micawber -RRB- , I know no one of whom I can better ask advice than my friend and former lodger .
Parsing [sent. 13658 len. 36]: ` You may be aware , my dear Mr. Copperfield , that between myself and Mr. Micawber -LRB- whom I will never desert -RRB- , there has always been preserved a spirit of mutual confidence .
Parsing [sent. 13659 len. 29]: Mr. Micawber may have occasionally given a bill without consulting me , or he may have misled me as to the period when that obligation would become due .
Parsing [sent. 13660 len. 5]: This has actually happened .
Parsing [sent. 13661 len. 40]: But , in general , Mr. Micawber has had no secrets from the bosom of affection -- I allude to his wife -- and has invariably , on our retirement to rest , recalled the events of the day .
Parsing [sent. 13662 len. 32]: ` You will picture to yourself , my dear Mr. Copperfield , what the poignancy of my feelings must be , when I inform you that Mr. Micawber is entirely changed .
Parsing [sent. 13663 len. 4]: He is reserved .
Parsing [sent. 13664 len. 4]: He is secret .
Parsing [sent. 13665 len. 86]: His life is a mystery to the partner of his joys and sorrows -- I again allude to his wife -- and if I should assure you that beyond knowing that it is passed from morning to night at the office , I now know less of it than I do of the man in the south , connected with whose mouth the thoughtless children repeat an idle tale respecting cold plum porridge , I should adopt a popular fallacy to express an actual fact .
Parsing [sent. 13666 len. 7]: ` But this is not all .
Parsing [sent. 13667 len. 5]: Mr. Micawber is morose .
Parsing [sent. 13668 len. 4]: He is severe .
Parsing [sent. 13669 len. 39]: He is estranged from our eldest son and daughter , he has no pride in his twins , he looks with an eye of coldness even on the unoffending stranger who last became a member of our circle .
Parsing [sent. 13670 len. 53]: The pecuniary means of meeting our expenses , kept down to the utmost farthing , are obtained from him with great difficulty , and even under fearful threats that he will Settle himself -LRB- the exact expression -RRB- ; and he inexorably refuses to give any explanation whatever of this distracting policy .
Parsing [sent. 13671 len. 7]: ` This is hard to bear .
Parsing [sent. 13672 len. 4]: This is heart-breaking .
Parsing [sent. 13673 len. 46]: If you will advise me , knowing my feeble powers such as they are , how you think it will be best to exert them in a dilemma so unwonted , you will add another friendly obligation to the many you have already rendered me .
Parsing [sent. 13674 len. 29]: With loves from the children , and a smile from the happily-unconscious stranger , I remain , dear Mr. Copperfield , Your afflicted , 'EM MA MICAWBER . '
Parsing [sent. 13675 len. 53]: I did not feel justified in giving a wife of Mrs. Micawber 's experience any other recommendation , than that she should try to reclaim Mr. Micawber by patience and kindness -LRB- as I knew she would in any case -RRB- ; but the letter set me thinking about him very much .
Parsing [sent. 13676 len. 18]: Chapter 43 Another Retrospect Once again , let me pause upon a memorable period of my life .
Parsing [sent. 13677 len. 26]: Let me stand aside , to see the phantoms of those days go by me , accompanying the shadow of myself , in dim procession .
Parsing [sent. 13678 len. 9]: Weeks , months , seasons , pass along .
Parsing [sent. 13679 len. 13]: They seem little more than a summer day and a winter evening .
Parsing [sent. 13680 len. 36]: Now , the Common where I walk with Dora is all in bloom , a field of bright gold ; and now the unseen heather lies in mounds and bunches underneath a covering of snow .
Parsing [sent. 13681 len. 34]: In a breath , the river that flows through our Sunday walks is sparkling in the summer sun , is ruffled by the winter wind , or thickened with drifting heaps of ice .
Parsing [sent. 13682 len. 18]: Faster than ever river ran towards the sea , it flashes , darkens , and rolls away .
Parsing [sent. 13683 len. 15]: Not a thread changes , in the house of the two little bird-like ladies .
Parsing [sent. 13684 len. 14]: The clock ticks over the fireplace , the weather-glass hangs in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 13685 len. 16]: Neither clock nor weather-glass is ever right ; but we believe in both , devoutly .
Parsing [sent. 13686 len. 9]: I have come legally to man 's estate .
Parsing [sent. 13687 len. 8]: I have attained the dignity of twenty-one .
Parsing [sent. 13688 len. 14]: But this is a sort of dignity that may be thrust upon one .
Parsing [sent. 13689 len. 8]: Let me think what I have achieved .
Parsing [sent. 13690 len. 8]: I have tamed that savage stenographic mystery .
Parsing [sent. 13691 len. 8]: I make a respectable income by it .
Parsing [sent. 13692 len. 32]: I am in high repute for my accomplishment in all pertaining to the art , and am joined with eleven others in reporting the debates in Parliament for a Morning Newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 13693 len. 27]: Night after night , I record predictions that never come to pass , professions that are never fulfilled , explanations that are only meant to mystify .
Parsing [sent. 13694 len. 5]: I wallow in words .
Parsing [sent. 13695 len. 32]: Britannia , that unfortunate female , is always before me , like a trussed fowl : skewered through and through with office-pens , and bound hand and foot with red tape .
Parsing [sent. 13696 len. 14]: I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth of political life .
Parsing [sent. 13697 len. 14]: I am quite an Infidel about it , and shall never be converted .
Parsing [sent. 13698 len. 22]: My dear old Traddles has tried his hand at the same pursuit , but it is not in Traddles 's way .
Parsing [sent. 13699 len. 19]: He is perfectly good-humoured respecting his failure , and reminds me that he always did consider himself slow .
Parsing [sent. 13700 len. 29]: He has occasional employment on the same newspaper , in getting up the facts of dry subjects , to be written about and embellished by more fertile minds .
Parsing [sent. 13701 len. 29]: He is called to the bar ; and with admirable industry and self-denial has scraped another hundred pounds together , to fee a Conveyancer whose chambers he attends .
Parsing [sent. 13702 len. 34]: A great deal of very hot port wine was consumed at his call ; and , considering the figure , I should think the Inner Temple must have made a profit by it .
Parsing [sent. 13703 len. 8]: I have come out in another way .
Parsing [sent. 13704 len. 10]: I have taken with fear and trembling to authorship .
Parsing [sent. 13705 len. 24]: I wrote a little something , in secret , and sent it to a magazine , and it was published in the magazine .
Parsing [sent. 13706 len. 15]: Since then , I have taken heart to write a good many trifling pieces .
Parsing [sent. 13707 len. 9]: Now , I am regularly paid for them .
Parsing [sent. 13708 len. 35]: Altogether , I am well off , when I tell my income on the fingers of my left hand , I pass the third finger and take in the fourth to the middle joint .
Parsing [sent. 13709 len. 28]: We have removed , from Buckingham Street , to a pleasant little cottage very near the one I looked at , when my enthusiasm first came on .
Parsing [sent. 13710 len. 39]: My aunt , however -LRB- who has sold the house at Dover , to good advantage -RRB- , is not going to remain here , but intends removing herself to a still more tiny cottage close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 13711 len. 5]: What does this portend ?
Parsing [sent. 13712 len. 3]: My marriage ?
Parsing [sent. 13713 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 13714 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 13715 len. 9]: I am going to be married to Dora !
Parsing [sent. 13716 len. 23]: Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa have given their consent ; and if ever canary birds were in a flutter , they are .
Parsing [sent. 13717 len. 44]: Miss Lavinia , self-charged with the superintendence of my darling 's wardrobe , is constantly cutting out brown-paper cuirasses , and differing in opinion from a highly respectable young man , with a long bundle , and a yard measure under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 13718 len. 40]: A dressmaker , always stabbed in the breast with a needle and thread , boards and lodges in the house ; and seems to me , eating , drinking , or sleeping , never to take her thimble off .
Parsing [sent. 13719 len. 8]: They make a lay-figure of my dear .
Parsing [sent. 13720 len. 13]: They are always sending for her to come and try something on .
Parsing [sent. 13721 len. 41]: We ca n't be happy together for five minutes in the evening , but some intrusive female knocks at the door , and says , ` Oh , if you please , Miss Dora , would you step upstairs ! '
Parsing [sent. 13722 len. 24]: Miss Clarissa and my aunt roam all over London , to find out articles of furniture for Dora and me to look at .
Parsing [sent. 13723 len. 51]: It would be better for them to buy the goods at once , without this ceremony of inspection ; for , when we go to see a kitchen fender and meat-screen , Dora sees a Chinese house for Jip , with little bells on the top , and prefers that .
Parsing [sent. 13724 len. 40]: And it takes a long time to accustom Jip to his new residence , after we have bought it ; whenever he goes in or out , he makes all the little bells ring , and is horribly frightened .
Parsing [sent. 13725 len. 14]: Peggotty comes up to make herself useful , and falls to work immediately .
Parsing [sent. 13726 len. 14]: Her department appears to be , to clean everything over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 13727 len. 22]: She rubs everything that can be rubbed , until it shines , like her own honest forehead , with perpetual friction .
Parsing [sent. 13728 len. 33]: And now it is , that I begin to see her solitary brother passing through the dark streets at night , and looking , as he goes , among the wandering faces .
Parsing [sent. 13729 len. 10]: I never speak to him at such an hour .
Parsing [sent. 13730 len. 21]: I know too well , as his grave figure passes onward , what he seeks , and what he dreads .
Parsing [sent. 13731 len. 33]: Why does Traddles look so important when he calls upon me this afternoon in the Commons -- where I still occasionally attend , for form 's sake , when I have time ?
Parsing [sent. 13732 len. 10]: The realization of my boyish day-dreams is at hand .
Parsing [sent. 13733 len. 9]: I am going to take out the licence .
Parsing [sent. 13734 len. 30]: It is a little document to do so much ; and Traddles contemplates it , as it lies upon my desk , half in admiration , half in awe .
Parsing [sent. 13735 len. 79]: There are the names , in the sweet old visionary connexion , David Copperfield and Dora Spenlow ; and there , in the corner , is that Parental Institution , the Stamp Office , which is so benignantly interested in the various transactions of human life , looking down upon our Union ; and there is the Archbishop of Canterbury invoking a blessing on us in print , and doing it as cheap as could possibly be expected .
Parsing [sent. 13736 len. 16]: Nevertheless , I am in a dream , a flustered , happy , hurried dream .
Parsing [sent. 13737 len. 44]: I ca n't believe that it is going to be ; and yet I ca n't believe but that everyone I pass in the street , must have some kind of perception , that I am to be married the day after tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 13738 len. 29]: The Surrogate knows me , when I go down to be sworn ; and disposes of me easily , as if there were a Masonic understanding between us .
Parsing [sent. 13739 len. 17]: Traddles is not at all wanted , but is in attendance as my general backer . '
Parsing [sent. 13740 len. 30]: I hope the next time you come here , my dear fellow , ' I say to Traddles , ` it will be on the same errand for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 13741 len. 9]: And I hope it will be soon . '
Parsing [sent. 13742 len. 17]: ` Thank you for your good wishes , my dear Copperfield , ' he replies . '
Parsing [sent. 13743 len. 5]: I hope so too .
Parsing [sent. 13744 len. 39]: It 's a satisfaction to know that she 'll wait for me any length of time , and that she really is the dearest girl -- ' ` When are you to meet her at the coach ? '
Parsing [sent. 13745 len. 3]: I ask .
Parsing [sent. 13746 len. 35]: ` At seven , ' says Traddles , looking at his plain old silver watch -- the very watch he once took a wheel out of , at school , to make a water-mill .
Parsing [sent. 13747 len. 15]: ` That is about Miss Wickfield 's time , is it not ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13748 len. 4]: A little earlier .
Parsing [sent. 13749 len. 9]: Her time is half past eight . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13750 len. 41]: I assure you , my dear boy , ' says Traddles , ' I am almost as pleased as if I were going to be married myself , to think that this event is coming to such a happy termination .
Parsing [sent. 13751 len. 34]: And really the great friendship and consideration of personally associating Sophy with the joyful occasion , and inviting her to be a bridesmaid in conjunction with Miss Wickfield , demands my warmest thanks .
Parsing [sent. 13752 len. 8]: I am extremely sensible of it . '
Parsing [sent. 13753 len. 31]: I hear him , and shake hands with him ; and we talk , and walk , and dine , and so on ; but I do n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 13754 len. 4]: Nothing is real .
Parsing [sent. 13755 len. 14]: Sophy arrives at the house of Dora 's aunts , in due course .
Parsing [sent. 13756 len. 37]: She has the most agreeable of faces , -- not absolutely beautiful , but extraordinarily pleasant , -- and is one of the most genial , unaffected , frank , engaging creatures I have ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 13757 len. 42]: Traddles presents her to us with great pride ; and rubs his hands for ten minutes by the clock , with every individual hair upon his head standing on tiptoe , when I congratulate him in a corner on his choice .
Parsing [sent. 13758 len. 23]: I have brought Agnes from the Canterbury coach , and her cheerful and beautiful face is among us for the second time .
Parsing [sent. 13759 len. 37]: Agnes has a great liking for Traddles , and it is capital to see them meet , and to observe the glory of Traddles as he commends the dearest girl in the world to her acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 13760 len. 7]: Still I do n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 13761 len. 19]: We have a delightful evening , and are supremely happy ; but I do n't believe it yet .
Parsing [sent. 13762 len. 6]: I ca n't collect myself .
Parsing [sent. 13763 len. 12]: I ca n't check off my happiness as it takes place .
Parsing [sent. 13764 len. 36]: I feel in a misty and unsettled kind of state ; as if I had got up very early in the morning a week or two ago , and had never been to bed since .
Parsing [sent. 13765 len. 9]: I ca n't make out when yesterday was .
Parsing [sent. 13766 len. 17]: I seem to have been carrying the licence about , in my pocket , many months .
Parsing [sent. 13767 len. 36]: Next day , too , when we all go in a flock to see the house -- our house -- Dora 's and mine -- I am quite unable to regard myself as its master .
Parsing [sent. 13768 len. 12]: I seem to be there , by permission of somebody else .
Parsing [sent. 13769 len. 20]: I half expect the real master to come home presently , and say he is glad to see me .
Parsing [sent. 13770 len. 85]: Such a beautiful little house as it is , with everything so bright and new ; with the flowers on the carpets looking as if freshly gathered , and the green leaves on the paper as if they had just come out ; with the spotless muslin curtains , and the blushing rose-coloured furniture , and Dora 's garden hat with the blue ribbon -- do I remember , now , how I loved her in such another hat when I first knew her !
Parsing [sent. 13771 len. 37]: -- already hanging on its little peg ; the guitar-case quite at home on its heels in a corner ; and everybody tumbling over Jip 's pagoda , which is much too big for the establishment .
Parsing [sent. 13772 len. 25]: Another happy evening , quite as unreal as all the rest of it , and I steal into the usual room before going away .
Parsing [sent. 13773 len. 5]: Dora is not there .
Parsing [sent. 13774 len. 10]: I suppose they have not done trying on yet .
Parsing [sent. 13775 len. 16]: Miss Lavinia peeps in , and tells me mysteriously that she will not be long .
Parsing [sent. 13776 len. 23]: She is rather long , notwithstanding ; but by and by I hear a rustling at the door , and someone taps .
Parsing [sent. 13777 len. 8]: I say , ` Come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 13778 len. 5]: but someone taps again .
Parsing [sent. 13779 len. 54]: I go to the door , wondering who it is ; there , I meet a pair of bright eyes , and a blushing face ; they are Dora 's eyes and face , and Miss Lavinia has dressed her in tomorrow 's dress , bonnet and all , for me to see .
Parsing [sent. 13780 len. 44]: I take my little wife to my heart ; and Miss Lavinia gives a little scream because I tumble the bonnet , and Dora laughs and cries at once , because I am so pleased ; and I believe it less than ever .
Parsing [sent. 13781 len. 10]: ` Do you think it pretty , Doady ? '
Parsing [sent. 13782 len. 3]: says Dora .
Parsing [sent. 13783 len. 2]: Pretty !
Parsing [sent. 13784 len. 7]: I should rather think I did .
Parsing [sent. 13785 len. 12]: ` And are you sure you like me very much ? '
Parsing [sent. 13786 len. 3]: says Dora .
Parsing [sent. 13787 len. 41]: The topic is fraught with such danger to the bonnet , that Miss Lavinia gives another little scream , and begs me to understand that Dora is only to be looked at , and on no account to be touched .
Parsing [sent. 13788 len. 32]: So Dora stands in a delightful state of confusion for a minute or two , to be admired ; and then takes off her bonnet -- looking so natural without it !
Parsing [sent. 13789 len. 63]: -- and runs away with it in her hand ; and comes dancing down again in her own familiar dress , and asks Jip if I have got a beautiful little wife , and whether he 'll forgive her for being married , and kneels down to make him stand upon the cookery-book , for the last time in her single life .
Parsing [sent. 13790 len. 38]: I go home , more incredulous than ever , to a lodging that I have hard by ; and get up very early in the morning , to ride to the Highgate road and fetch my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 13791 len. 10]: I have never seen my aunt in such state .
Parsing [sent. 13792 len. 18]: She is dressed in lavender-coloured silk , and has a white bonnet on , and is amazing .
Parsing [sent. 13793 len. 13]: Janet has dressed her , and is there to look at me .
Parsing [sent. 13794 len. 17]: Peggotty is ready to go to church , intending to behold the ceremony from the gallery .
Parsing [sent. 13795 len. 21]: Mr. Dick , who is to give my darling to me at the altar , has had his hair curled .
Parsing [sent. 13796 len. 41]: Traddles , whom I have taken up by appointment at the turnpike , presents a dazzling combination of cream colour and light blue ; and both he and Mr. Dick have a general effect about them of being all gloves .
Parsing [sent. 13797 len. 24]: No doubt I see this , because I know it is so ; but I am astray , and seem to see nothing .
Parsing [sent. 13798 len. 7]: Nor do I believe anything whatever .
Parsing [sent. 13799 len. 51]: Still , as we drive along in an open carriage , this fairy marriage is real enough to fill me with a sort of wondering pity for the unfortunate people who have no part in it , but are sweeping out the shops , and going to their daily occupations .
Parsing [sent. 13800 len. 12]: My aunt sits with my hand in hers all the way .
Parsing [sent. 13801 len. 35]: When we stop a little way short of the church , to put down Peggotty , whom we have brought on the box , she gives it a squeeze , and me a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 13802 len. 7]: ` God bless you , Trot !
Parsing [sent. 13803 len. 8]: My own boy never could be dearer .
Parsing [sent. 13804 len. 10]: I think of poor dear Baby this morning . '
Parsing [sent. 13805 len. 16]: ` So do I. And of all I owe to you , dear aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 13806 len. 6]: ` Tut , child ! '
Parsing [sent. 13807 len. 45]: says my aunt ; and gives her hand in overflowing cordiality to Traddles , who then gives his to Mr. Dick , who then gives his to me , who then gives mine to Traddles , and then we come to the church door .
Parsing [sent. 13808 len. 30]: The church is calm enough , I am sure ; but it might be a steam-power loom in full action , for any sedative effect it has on me .
Parsing [sent. 13809 len. 8]: I am too far gone for that .
Parsing [sent. 13810 len. 11]: The rest is all a more or less incoherent dream .
Parsing [sent. 13811 len. 71]: A dream of their coming in with Dora ; of the pew-opener arranging us , like a drill-sergeant , before the altar rails ; of my wondering , even then , why pew-openers must always be the most disagreeable females procurable , and whether there is any religious dread of a disastrous infection of good-humour which renders it indispensable to set those vessels of vinegar upon the road to Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 13812 len. 48]: Of the clergyman and clerk appearing ; of a few boatmen and some other people strolling in ; of an ancient mariner behind me , strongly flavouring the church with rum ; of the service beginning in a deep voice , and our all being very attentive .
Parsing [sent. 13813 len. 86]: Of Miss Lavinia , who acts as a semi-auxiliary bridesmaid , being the first to cry , and of her doing homage -LRB- as I take it -RRB- to the memory of Pidger , in sobs ; of Miss Clarissa applying a smelling-bottle ; of Agnes taking care of Dora ; of my aunt endeavouring to represent herself as a model of sternness , with tears rolling down her face ; of little Dora trembling very much , and making her responses in faint whispers .
Parsing [sent. 13814 len. 79]: Of our kneeling down together , side by side ; of Dora 's trembling less and less , but always clasping Agnes by the hand ; of the service being got through , quietly and gravely ; of our all looking at each other in an April state of smiles and tears , when it is over ; of my young wife being hysterical in the vestry , and crying for her poor papa , her dear papa .
Parsing [sent. 13815 len. 15]: Of her soon cheering up again , and our signing the register all round .
Parsing [sent. 13816 len. 45]: Of my going into the gallery for Peggotty to bring her to sign it ; of Peggotty 's hugging me in a corner , and telling me she saw my own dear mother married ; of its being over , and our going away .
Parsing [sent. 13817 len. 58]: Of my walking so proudly and lovingly down the aisle with my sweet wife upon my arm , through a mist of half-seen people , pulpits , monuments , pews , fonts , organs , and church windows , in which there flutter faint airs of association with my childish church at home , so long ago .
Parsing [sent. 13818 len. 24]: Of their whispering , as we pass , what a youthful couple we are , and what a pretty little wife she is .
Parsing [sent. 13819 len. 14]: Of our all being so merry and talkative in the carriage going back .
Parsing [sent. 13820 len. 44]: Of Sophy telling us that when she saw Traddles -LRB- whom I had entrusted with the licence -RRB- asked for it , she almost fainted , having been convinced that he would contrive to lose it , or to have his pocket picked .
Parsing [sent. 13821 len. 28]: Of Agnes laughing gaily ; and of Dora being so fond of Agnes that she will not be separated from her , but still keeps her hand .
Parsing [sent. 13822 len. 68]: Of there being a breakfast , with abundance of things , pretty and substantial , to eat and drink , whereof I partake , as I should do in any other dream , without the least perception of their flavour ; eating and drinking , as I may say , nothing but love and marriage , and no more believing in the viands than in anything else .
Parsing [sent. 13823 len. 39]: Of my making a speech in the same dreamy fashion , without having an idea of what I want to say , beyond such as may be comprehended in the full conviction that I have n't said it .
Parsing [sent. 13824 len. 32]: Of our being very sociably and simply happy -LRB- always in a dream though -RRB- ; and of Jip 's having wedding cake , and its not agreeing with him afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 13825 len. 20]: Of the pair of hired post-horses being ready , and of Dora 's going away to change her dress .
Parsing [sent. 13826 len. 48]: Of my aunt and Miss Clarissa remaining with us ; and our walking in the garden ; and my aunt , who has made quite a speech at breakfast touching Dora 's aunts , being mightily amused with herself , but a little proud of it too .
Parsing [sent. 13827 len. 30]: Of Dora 's being ready , and of Miss Lavinia 's hovering about her , loth to lose the pretty toy that has given her so much pleasant occupation .
Parsing [sent. 13828 len. 30]: Of Dora 's making a long series of surprised discoveries that she has forgotten all sorts of little things ; and of everybody 's running everywhere to fetch them .
Parsing [sent. 13829 len. 31]: Of their all closing about Dora , when at last she begins to say good-bye , looking , with their bright colours and ribbons , like a bed of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 13830 len. 25]: Of my darling being almost smothered among the flowers , and coming out , laughing and crying both together , to my jealous arms .
Parsing [sent. 13831 len. 52]: Of my wanting to carry Jip -LRB- who is to go along with us -RRB- , and Dora 's saying no , that she must carry him , or else he 'll think she do n't like him any more , now she is married , and will break his heart .
Parsing [sent. 13832 len. 36]: Of our going , arm in arm , and Dora stopping and looking back , and saying , ` If I have ever been cross or ungrateful to anybody , do n't remember it ! '
Parsing [sent. 13833 len. 5]: and bursting into tears .
Parsing [sent. 13834 len. 14]: Of her waving her little hand , and our going away once more .
Parsing [sent. 13835 len. 30]: Of her once more stopping , and looking back , and hurrying to Agnes , and giving Agnes , above all the others , her last kisses and farewells .
Parsing [sent. 13836 len. 12]: We drive away together , and I awake from the dream .
Parsing [sent. 13837 len. 6]: I believe it at last .
Parsing [sent. 13838 len. 18]: It is my dear , dear , little wife beside me , whom I love so well !
Parsing [sent. 13839 len. 11]: ` Are you happy now , you foolish boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 13840 len. 12]: says Dora , ` and sure you do n't repent ? '
Parsing [sent. 13841 len. 15]: I have stood aside to see the phantoms of those days go by me .
Parsing [sent. 13842 len. 13]: They are gone , and I resume the journey of my story .
Parsing [sent. 13843 len. 59]: Chapter 44 Our Housekeeping It was a strange condition of things , the honeymoon being over , and the bridesmaids gone home , when I found myself sitting down in my own small house with Dora ; quite thrown out of employment , as I may say , in respect of the delicious old occupation of making love .
Parsing [sent. 13844 len. 12]: It seemed such an extraordinary thing to have Dora always there .
Parsing [sent. 13845 len. 48]: It was so unaccountable not to be obliged to go out to see her , not to have any occasion to be tormenting myself about her , not to have to write to her , not to be scheming and devising opportunities of being alone with her .
Parsing [sent. 13846 len. 83]: Sometimes of an evening , when I looked up from my writing , and saw her seated opposite , I would lean back in my chair , and think how queer it was that there we were , alone together as a matter of course -- nobody 's business any more -- all the romance of our engagement put away upon a shelf , to rust -- no one to please but one another -- one another to please , for life .
Parsing [sent. 13847 len. 35]: When there was a debate , and I was kept out very late , it seemed so strange to me , as I was walking home , to think that Dora was at home !
Parsing [sent. 13848 len. 26]: It was such a wonderful thing , at first , to have her coming softly down to talk to me as I ate my supper .
Parsing [sent. 13849 len. 18]: It was such a stupendous thing to know for certain that she put her hair in papers .
Parsing [sent. 13850 len. 13]: It was altogether such an astonishing event to see her do it !
Parsing [sent. 13851 len. 22]: I doubt whether two young birds could have known less about keeping house , than I and my pretty Dora did .
Parsing [sent. 13852 len. 8]: We had a servant , of course .
Parsing [sent. 13853 len. 6]: She kept house for us .
Parsing [sent. 13854 len. 30]: I have still a latent belief that she must have been Mrs. Crupp 's daughter in disguise , we had such an awful time of it with Mary Anne .
Parsing [sent. 13855 len. 5]: Her name was Paragon .
Parsing [sent. 13856 len. 20]: Her nature was represented to us , when we engaged her , as being feebly expressed in her name .
Parsing [sent. 13857 len. 44]: She had a written character , as large as a proclamation ; and , according to this document , could do everything of a domestic nature that ever I heard of , and a great many things that I never did hear of .
Parsing [sent. 13858 len. 33]: She was a woman in the prime of life ; of a severe countenance ; and subject -LRB- particularly in the arms -RRB- to a sort of perpetual measles or fiery rash .
Parsing [sent. 13859 len. 23]: She had a cousin in the Life-Guards , with such long legs that he looked like the afternoon shadow of somebody else .
Parsing [sent. 13860 len. 18]: His shell-jacket was as much too little for him as he was too big for the premises .
Parsing [sent. 13861 len. 22]: He made the cottage smaller than it need have been , by being so very much out of proportion to it .
Parsing [sent. 13862 len. 34]: Besides which , the walls were not thick , and , whenever he passed the evening at our house , we always knew of it by hearing one continual growl in the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 13863 len. 8]: Our treasure was warranted sober and honest .
Parsing [sent. 13864 len. 31]: I am therefore willing to believe that she was in a fit when we found her under the boiler ; and that the deficient tea-spoons were attributable to the dustman .
Parsing [sent. 13865 len. 8]: But she preyed upon our minds dreadfully .
Parsing [sent. 13866 len. 12]: We felt our inexperience , and were unable to help ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 13867 len. 25]: We should have been at her mercy , if she had had any ; but she was a remorseless woman , and had none .
Parsing [sent. 13868 len. 10]: She was the cause of our first little quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 13869 len. 26]: ` My dearest life , ' I said one day to Dora , ` do you think Mary Anne has any idea of time ? '
Parsing [sent. 13870 len. 6]: ` Why , Doady ? '
Parsing [sent. 13871 len. 12]: inquired Dora , looking up , innocently , from her drawing .
Parsing [sent. 13872 len. 19]: ` My love , because it 's five , and we were to have dined at four . '
Parsing [sent. 13873 len. 17]: Dora glanced wistfully at the clock , and hinted that she thought it was too fast .
Parsing [sent. 13874 len. 27]: ` On the contrary , my love , ' said I , referring to my watch , ` it 's a few minutes too slow . '
Parsing [sent. 13875 len. 45]: My little wife came and sat upon my knee , to coax me to be quiet , and drew a line with her pencil down the middle of my nose ; but I could n't dine off that , though it was very agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 13876 len. 27]: ` Do n't you think , my dear , ' said I , ` it would be better for you to remonstrate with Mary Anne ? '
Parsing [sent. 13877 len. 6]: ` Oh no , please !
Parsing [sent. 13878 len. 7]: I could n't , Doady ! '
Parsing [sent. 13879 len. 3]: said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 13880 len. 8]: ` Why not , my love ? '
Parsing [sent. 13881 len. 4]: I gently asked .
Parsing [sent. 13882 len. 23]: ` Oh , because I am such a little goose , ' said Dora , ` and she knows I am ! '
Parsing [sent. 13883 len. 24]: I thought this sentiment so incompatible with the establishment of any system of check on Mary Anne , that I frowned a little .
Parsing [sent. 13884 len. 14]: ` Oh , what ugly wrinkles in my bad boy 's forehead ! '
Parsing [sent. 13885 len. 52]: said Dora , and still being on my knee , she traced them with her pencil ; putting it to her rosy lips to make it mark blacker , and working at my forehead with a quaint little mockery of being industrious , that quite delighted me in spite of myself .
Parsing [sent. 13886 len. 23]: ` There 's a good child , ' said Dora , ` it makes its face so much prettier to laugh . '
Parsing [sent. 13887 len. 14]: ` But , my love , ' said I. ` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 13888 len. 3]: please ! '
Parsing [sent. 13889 len. 16]: cried Dora , with a kiss , ` do n't be a naughty Blue Beard !
Parsing [sent. 13890 len. 6]: Do n't be serious ! '
Parsing [sent. 13891 len. 16]: ` my precious wife , ' said I , ` we must be serious sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 13892 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 13893 len. 10]: Sit down on this chair , close beside me !
Parsing [sent. 13894 len. 5]: Give me the pencil !
Parsing [sent. 13895 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 13896 len. 6]: Now let us talk sensibly .
Parsing [sent. 13897 len. 25]: You know , dear ' ; what a little hand it was to hold , and what a tiny wedding-ring it was to see !
Parsing [sent. 13898 len. 22]: ` You know , my love , it is not exactly comfortable to have to go out without one 's dinner .
Parsing [sent. 13899 len. 6]: Now , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 13900 len. 4]: ` N-n-no ! '
Parsing [sent. 13901 len. 5]: replied Dora , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 13902 len. 9]: ` My love , how you tremble ! '
Parsing [sent. 13903 len. 20]: ` Because I KNOW you 're going to scold me , ' exclaimed Dora , in a piteous voice .
Parsing [sent. 13904 len. 12]: ` My sweet , I am only going to reason . '
Parsing [sent. 13905 len. 11]: ` Oh , but reasoning is worse than scolding ! '
Parsing [sent. 13906 len. 7]: exclaimed Dora , in despair . '
Parsing [sent. 13907 len. 9]: I did n't marry to be reasoned with .
Parsing [sent. 13908 len. 28]: If you meant to reason with such a poor little thing as I am , you ought to have told me so , you cruel boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 13909 len. 33]: I tried to pacify Dora , but she turned away her face , and shook her curls from side to side , and said , ` You cruel , cruel boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 13910 len. 35]: so many times , that I really did not exactly know what to do : so I took a few turns up and down the room in my uncertainty , and came back again .
Parsing [sent. 13911 len. 7]: ` Dora , my darling ! '
Parsing [sent. 13912 len. 9]: ` No , I am not your darling .
Parsing [sent. 13913 len. 20]: Because you must be sorry that you married me , or else you would n't reason with me ! '
Parsing [sent. 13914 len. 3]: returned Dora .
Parsing [sent. 13915 len. 21]: I felt so injured by the inconsequential nature of this charge , that it gave me courage to be grave .
Parsing [sent. 13916 len. 22]: ` Now , my own Dora , ' said I , ` you are very childish , and are talking nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 13917 len. 75]: You must remember , I am sure , that I was obliged to go out yesterday when dinner was half over ; and that , the day before , I was made quite unwell by being obliged to eat underdone veal in a hurry ; today , I do n't dine at all -- and I am afraid to say how long we waited for breakfast -- and then the water did n't boil .
Parsing [sent. 13918 len. 18]: I do n't mean to reproach you , my dear , but this is not comfortable . '
Parsing [sent. 13919 len. 18]: ` Oh , you cruel , cruel boy , to say I am a disagreeable wife ! '
Parsing [sent. 13920 len. 3]: cried Dora .
Parsing [sent. 13921 len. 17]: ` Now , my dear Dora , you must know that I never said that ! '
Parsing [sent. 13922 len. 10]: ` You said , I was n't comfortable ! '
Parsing [sent. 13923 len. 4]: cried Dora . '
Parsing [sent. 13924 len. 9]: I said the housekeeping was not comfortable ! '
Parsing [sent. 13925 len. 9]: ` It 's exactly the same thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 13926 len. 3]: cried Dora .
Parsing [sent. 13927 len. 12]: And she evidently thought so , for she wept most grievously .
Parsing [sent. 13928 len. 29]: I took another turn across the room , full of love for my pretty wife , and distracted by self-accusatory inclinations to knock my head against the door .
Parsing [sent. 13929 len. 17]: I sat down again , and said : ' I am not blaming you , Dora .
Parsing [sent. 13930 len. 9]: We have both a great deal to learn .
Parsing [sent. 13931 len. 39]: I am only trying to show you , my dear , that you must -- you really must ' -LRB- I was resolved not to give this up -RRB- -- ` accustom yourself to look after Mary Anne .
Parsing [sent. 13932 len. 13]: Likewise to act a little for yourself , and me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13933 len. 17]: I wonder , I do , at your making such ungrateful speeches , ' sobbed Dora .
Parsing [sent. 13934 len. 39]: ` When you know that the other day , when you said you would like a little bit of fish , I went out myself , miles and miles , and ordered it , to surprise you . '
Parsing [sent. 13935 len. 45]: ` And it was very kind of you , my own darling , ' said I. ' I felt it so much that I would n't on any account have even mentioned that you bought a Salmon -- which was too much for two .
Parsing [sent. 13936 len. 17]: Or that it cost one pound six -- which was more than we can afford . '
Parsing [sent. 13937 len. 11]: ` You enjoyed it very much , ' sobbed Dora .
Parsing [sent. 13938 len. 10]: ` And you said I was a Mouse . '
Parsing [sent. 13939 len. 21]: ` And I 'll say so again , my love , ' I returned , ' a thousand times ! '
Parsing [sent. 13940 len. 18]: But I had wounded Dora 's soft little heart , and she was not to be comforted .
Parsing [sent. 13941 len. 27]: She was so pathetic in her sobbing and bewailing , that I felt as if I had said I do n't know what to hurt her .
Parsing [sent. 13942 len. 27]: I was obliged to hurry away ; I was kept out late ; and I felt all night such pangs of remorse as made me miserable .
Parsing [sent. 13943 len. 19]: I had the conscience of an assassin , and was haunted by a vague sense of enormous wickedness .
Parsing [sent. 13944 len. 13]: It was two or three hours past midnight when I got home .
Parsing [sent. 13945 len. 14]: I found my aunt , in our house , sitting up for me .
Parsing [sent. 13946 len. 9]: ` Is anything the matter , aunt ? '
Parsing [sent. 13947 len. 5]: said I , alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 13948 len. 9]: ` Nothing , Trot , ' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 13949 len. 7]: ` Sit down , sit down .
Parsing [sent. 13950 len. 17]: Little Blossom has been rather out of spirits , and I have been keeping her company .
Parsing [sent. 13951 len. 5]: That 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 13952 len. 39]: I leaned my head upon my hand ; and felt more sorry and downcast , as I sat looking at the fire , than I could have supposed possible so soon after the fulfilment of my brightest hopes .
Parsing [sent. 13953 len. 21]: As I sat thinking , I happened to meet my aunt 's eyes , which were resting on my face .
Parsing [sent. 13954 len. 14]: There was an anxious expression in them , but it cleared directly . '
Parsing [sent. 13955 len. 28]: I assure you , aunt , ' said I , ' I have been quite unhappy myself all night , to think of Dora 's being so .
Parsing [sent. 13956 len. 19]: But I had no other intention than to speak to her tenderly and lovingly about our home-affairs . '
Parsing [sent. 13957 len. 5]: My aunt nodded encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 13958 len. 12]: ` You must have patience , Trot , ' said she .
Parsing [sent. 13959 len. 4]: ` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 13960 len. 13]: Heaven knows I do n't mean to be unreasonable , aunt ! '
Parsing [sent. 13961 len. 10]: ` No , no , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 13962 len. 21]: ` But Little Blossom is a very tender little blossom , and the wind must be gentle with her . '
Parsing [sent. 13963 len. 27]: I thanked my good aunt , in my heart , for her tenderness towards my wife ; and I was sure that she knew I did .
Parsing [sent. 13964 len. 41]: ` Do n't you think , aunt , ' said I , after some further contemplation of the fire , ` that you could advise and counsel Dora a little , for our mutual advantage , now and then ? '
Parsing [sent. 13965 len. 15]: ` Trot , ' returned my aunt , with some emotion , ` no !
Parsing [sent. 13966 len. 9]: Do n't ask me such a thing . '
Parsing [sent. 13967 len. 15]: Her tone was so very earnest that I raised my eyes in surprise . '
Parsing [sent. 13968 len. 36]: I look back on my life , child , ' said my aunt , ` and I think of some who are in their graves , with whom I might have been on kinder terms .
Parsing [sent. 13969 len. 28]: If I judged harshly of other people 's mistakes in marriage , it may have been because I had bitter reason to judge harshly of my own .
Parsing [sent. 13970 len. 4]: Let that pass .
Parsing [sent. 13971 len. 19]: I have been a grumpy , frumpy , wayward sort of a woman , a good many years .
Parsing [sent. 13972 len. 10]: I am still , and I always shall be .
Parsing [sent. 13973 len. 42]: But you and I have done one another some good , Trot , -- at all events , you have done me good , my dear ; and division must not come between us , at this time of day . '
Parsing [sent. 13974 len. 6]: ` Division between us ! '
Parsing [sent. 13975 len. 8]: cried I. ` Child , child ! '
Parsing [sent. 13976 len. 39]: said my aunt , smoothing her dress , ` how soon it might come between us , or how unhappy I might make our Little Blossom , if I meddled in anything , a prophet could n't say .
Parsing [sent. 13977 len. 16]: I want our pet to like me , and be as gay as a butterfly .
Parsing [sent. 13978 len. 25]: Remember your own home , in that second marriage ; and never do both me and her the injury you have hinted at ! '
Parsing [sent. 13979 len. 27]: I comprehended , at once , that my aunt was right ; and I comprehended the full extent of her generous feeling towards my dear wife .
Parsing [sent. 13980 len. 27]: ` These are early days , Trot , ' she pursued , ` and Rome was not built in a day , nor in a year .
Parsing [sent. 13981 len. 35]: You have chosen freely for yourself ' ; a cloud passed over her face for a moment , I thought ; ` and you have chosen a very pretty and a very affectionate creature .
Parsing [sent. 13982 len. 52]: It will be your duty , and it will be your pleasure too -- of course I know that ; I am not delivering a lecture -- to estimate her -LRB- as you chose her -RRB- by the qualities she has , and not by the qualities she may not have .
Parsing [sent. 13983 len. 12]: The latter you must develop in her , if you can .
Parsing [sent. 13984 len. 27]: And if you can not , child , ' here my aunt rubbed her nose , ` you must just accustom yourself to do without 'em .
Parsing [sent. 13985 len. 13]: But remember , my dear , your future is between you two .
Parsing [sent. 13986 len. 15]: No one can assist you ; you are to work it out for yourselves .
Parsing [sent. 13987 len. 28]: This is marriage , Trot ; and Heaven bless you both , in it , for a pair of babes in the wood as you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 13988 len. 19]: My aunt said this in a sprightly way , and gave me a kiss to ratify the blessing .
Parsing [sent. 13989 len. 37]: ` Now , ' said she , ` light my little lantern , and see me into my bandbox by the garden path ' ; for there was a communication between our cottages in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 13990 len. 55]: ` Give Betsey Trotwood 's love to Blossom , when you come back ; and whatever you do , Trot , never dream of setting Betsey up as a scarecrow , for if I ever saw her in the glass , she 's quite grim enough and gaunt enough in her private capacity ! '
Parsing [sent. 13991 len. 33]: With this my aunt tied her head up in a handkerchief , with which she was accustomed to make a bundle of it on such occasions ; and I escorted her home .
Parsing [sent. 13992 len. 88]: As she stood in her garden , holding up her little lantern to light me back , I thought her observation of me had an anxious air again ; but I was too much occupied in pondering on what she had said , and too much impressed -- for the first time , in reality -- by the conviction that Dora and I had indeed to work out our future for ourselves , and that no one could assist us , to take much notice of it .
Parsing [sent. 13993 len. 84]: Dora came stealing down in her little slippers , to meet me , now that I was alone ; and cried upon my shoulder , and said I had been hard-hearted and she had been naughty ; and I said much the same thing in effect , I believe ; and we made it up , and agreed that our first little difference was to be our last , and that we were never to have another if we lived a hundred years .
Parsing [sent. 13994 len. 14]: The next domestic trial we went through , was the Ordeal of Servants .
Parsing [sent. 13995 len. 43]: Mary Anne 's cousin deserted into our coal-hole , and was brought out , to our great amazement , by a piquet of his companions in arms , who took him away handcuffed in a procession that covered our front-garden with ignominy .
Parsing [sent. 13996 len. 51]: This nerved me to get rid of Mary Anne , who went so mildly , on receipt of wages , that I was surprised , until I found out about the tea-spoons , and also about the little sums she had borrowed in my name of the tradespeople without authority .
Parsing [sent. 13997 len. 84]: After an interval of Mrs. Kidgerbury -- the oldest inhabitant of Kentish Town , I believe , who went out charing , but was too feeble to execute her conceptions of that art -- we found another treasure , who was one of the most amiable of women , but who generally made a point of falling either up or down the kitchen stairs with the tray , and almost plunged into the parlour , as into a bath , with the tea-things .
Parsing [sent. 13998 len. 48]: The ravages committed by this unfortunate , rendering her dismissal necessary , she was succeeded -LRB- with intervals of Mrs. Kidgerbury -RRB- by a long line of Incapables ; terminating in a young person of genteel appearance , who went to Greenwich Fair in Dora 's bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 13999 len. 12]: After whom I remember nothing but an average equality of failure .
Parsing [sent. 14000 len. 12]: Everybody we had anything to do with seemed to cheat us .
Parsing [sent. 14001 len. 18]: Our appearance in a shop was a signal for the damaged goods to be brought out immediately .
Parsing [sent. 14002 len. 12]: If we bought a lobster , it was full of water .
Parsing [sent. 14003 len. 19]: All our meat turned out to be tough , and there was hardly any crust to our loaves .
Parsing [sent. 14004 len. 55]: In search of the principle on which joints ought to be roasted , to be roasted enough , and not too much , I myself referred to the Cookery Book , and found it there established as the allowance of a quarter of an hour to every pound , and say a quarter over .
Parsing [sent. 14005 len. 23]: But the principle always failed us by some curious fatality , and we never could hit any medium between redness and cinders .
Parsing [sent. 14006 len. 26]: I had reason to believe that in accomplishing these failures we incurred a far greater expense than if we had achieved a series of triumphs .
Parsing [sent. 14007 len. 38]: It appeared to me , on looking over the tradesmen 's books , as if we might have kept the basement storey paved with butter , such was the extensive scale of our consumption of that article .
Parsing [sent. 14008 len. 44]: I do n't know whether the Excise returns of the period may have exhibited any increase in the demand for pepper ; but if our performances did not affect the market , I should say several families must have left off using it .
Parsing [sent. 14009 len. 18]: And the most wonderful fact of all was , that we never had anything in the house .
Parsing [sent. 14010 len. 30]: As to the washerwoman pawning the clothes , and coming in a state of penitent intoxication to apologize , I suppose that might have happened several times to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 14011 len. 19]: Also the chimney on fire , the parish engine , and perjury on the part of the Beadle .
Parsing [sent. 14012 len. 90]: But I apprehend that we were personally fortunate in engaging a servant with a taste for cordials , who swelled our running account for porter at the public-house by such inexplicable items as ` quartern rum shrub -LRB- Mrs. C. -RRB- ' ; ` Half-quartern gin and cloves -LRB- Mrs. C. -RRB- ' ; ` Glass rum and peppermint -LRB- Mrs. C. -RRB- ' -- the parentheses always referring to Dora , who was supposed , it appeared on explanation , to have imbibed the whole of these refreshments .
Parsing [sent. 14013 len. 16]: One of our first feats in the housekeeping way was a little dinner to Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 14014 len. 17]: I met him in town , and asked him to walk out with me that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 14015 len. 16]: He readily consenting , I wrote to Dora , saying I would bring him home .
Parsing [sent. 14016 len. 19]: It was pleasant weather , and on the road we made my domestic happiness the theme of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 14017 len. 38]: Traddles was very full of it ; and said , that , picturing himself with such a home , and Sophy waiting and preparing for him , he could think of nothing wanting to complete his bliss .
Parsing [sent. 14018 len. 36]: I could not have wished for a prettier little wife at the opposite end of the table , but I certainly could have wished , when we sat down , for a little more room .
Parsing [sent. 14019 len. 37]: I did not know how it was , but though there were only two of us , we were at once always cramped for room , and yet had always room enough to lose everything in .
Parsing [sent. 14020 len. 28]: I suspect it may have been because nothing had a place of its own , except Jip 's pagoda , which invariably blocked up the main thoroughfare .
Parsing [sent. 14021 len. 58]: On the present occasion , Traddles was so hemmed in by the pagoda and the guitar-case , and Dora 's flower-painting , and my writing-table , that I had serious doubts of the possibility of his using his knife and fork ; but he protested , with his own good-humour , ` Oceans of room , Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 14022 len. 7]: I assure you , Oceans ! '
Parsing [sent. 14023 len. 25]: There was another thing I could have wished , namely , that Jip had never been encouraged to walk about the tablecloth during dinner .
Parsing [sent. 14024 len. 36]: I began to think there was something disorderly in his being there at all , even if he had not been in the habit of putting his foot in the salt or the melted butter .
Parsing [sent. 14025 len. 49]: On this occasion he seemed to think he was introduced expressly to keep Traddles at bay ; and he barked at my old friend , and made short runs at his plate , with such undaunted pertinacity , that he may be said to have engrossed the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 14026 len. 30]: However , as I knew how tender-hearted my dear Dora was , and how sensitive she would be to any slight upon her favourite , I hinted no objection .
Parsing [sent. 14027 len. 50]: For similar reasons I made no allusion to the skirmishing plates upon the floor ; or to the disreputable appearance of the castors , which were all at sixes and sevens , and looked drunk ; or to the further blockade of Traddles by wandering vegetable dishes and jugs .
Parsing [sent. 14028 len. 66]: I could not help wondering in my own mind , as I contemplated the boiled leg of mutton before me , previous to carving it , how it came to pass that our joints of meat were of such extraordinary shapes -- and whether our butcher contracted for all the deformed sheep that came into the world ; but I kept my reflections to myself .
Parsing [sent. 14029 len. 20]: ` My love , ' said I to Dora , ` what have you got in that dish ? '
Parsing [sent. 14030 len. 23]: I could not imagine why Dora had been making tempting little faces at me , as if she wanted to kiss me .
Parsing [sent. 14031 len. 11]: ` Oysters , dear , ' said Dora , timidly .
Parsing [sent. 14032 len. 7]: ` Was that YOUR thought ? '
Parsing [sent. 14033 len. 5]: said I , delighted .
Parsing [sent. 14034 len. 9]: ` Ye-yes , Doady , ' said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 14035 len. 9]: ` There never was a happier one ! '
Parsing [sent. 14036 len. 10]: I exclaimed , laying down the carving-knife and fork .
Parsing [sent. 14037 len. 10]: ` There is nothing Traddles likes so much ! '
Parsing [sent. 14038 len. 30]: ` Ye-yes , Doady , ' said Dora , ` and so I bought a beautiful little barrel of them , and the man said they were very good .
Parsing [sent. 14039 len. 14]: But I -- I am afraid there 's something the matter with them .
Parsing [sent. 14040 len. 7]: They do n't seem right . '
Parsing [sent. 14041 len. 13]: Here Dora shook her head , and diamonds twinkled in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 14042 len. 23]: ` They are only opened in both shells , ' said I. ` Take the top one off , my love . '
Parsing [sent. 14043 len. 9]: ` But it wo n't come off ! '
Parsing [sent. 14044 len. 13]: said Dora , trying very hard , and looking very much distressed .
Parsing [sent. 14045 len. 45]: ` Do you know , Copperfield , ' said Traddles , cheerfully examining the dish , ' I think it is in consequence -- they are capital oysters , but I think it is in consequence -- of their never having been opened . '
Parsing [sent. 14046 len. 33]: They never had been opened ; and we had no oyster-knives -- and could n't have used them if we had ; so we looked at the oysters and ate the mutton .
Parsing [sent. 14047 len. 18]: At least we ate as much of it as was done , and made up with capers .
Parsing [sent. 14048 len. 73]: If I had permitted him , I am satisfied that Traddles would have made a perfect savage of himself , and eaten a plateful of raw meat , to express enjoyment of the repast ; but I would hear of no such immolation on the altar of friendship , and we had a course of bacon instead ; there happening , by good fortune , to be cold bacon in the larder .
Parsing [sent. 14049 len. 92]: My poor little wife was in such affliction when she thought I should be annoyed , and in such a state of joy when she found I was not , that the discomfiture I had subdued , very soon vanished , and we passed a happy evening ; Dora sitting with her arm on my chair while Traddles and I discussed a glass of wine , and taking every opportunity of whispering in my ear that it was so good of me not to be a cruel , cross old boy .
Parsing [sent. 14050 len. 45]: By and by she made tea for us ; which it was so pretty to see her do , as if she was busying herself with a set of doll 's tea-things , that I was not particular about the quality of the beverage .
Parsing [sent. 14051 len. 53]: Then Traddles and I played a game or two at cribbage ; and Dora singing to the guitar the while , it seemed to me as if our courtship and marriage were a tender dream of mine , and the night when I first listened to her voice were not yet over .
Parsing [sent. 14052 len. 34]: When Traddles went away , and I came back into the parlour from seeing him out , my wife planted her chair close to mine , and sat down by my side . '
Parsing [sent. 14053 len. 9]: I am very sorry , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 14054 len. 12]: ` Will you try to teach me , Doady ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 14055 len. 22]: I must teach myself first , Dora , ' said I. ' I am as bad as you , love . '
Parsing [sent. 14056 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 14057 len. 20]: But you can learn , ' she returned ; ` and you are a clever , clever man ! '
Parsing [sent. 14058 len. 6]: ` Nonsense , mouse ! '
Parsing [sent. 14059 len. 37]: said I. ' I wish , ' resumed my wife , after a long silence , ` that I could have gone down into the country for a whole year , and lived with Agnes ! '
Parsing [sent. 14060 len. 24]: Her hands were clasped upon my shoulder , and her chin rested on them , and her blue eyes looked quietly into mine .
Parsing [sent. 14061 len. 5]: ` Why so ? '
Parsing [sent. 14062 len. 4]: I asked . '
Parsing [sent. 14063 len. 22]: I think she might have improved me , and I think I might have learned from her , ' said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 14064 len. 9]: ` All in good time , my love .
Parsing [sent. 14065 len. 18]: Agnes has had her father to take care of for these many years , you should remember .
Parsing [sent. 14066 len. 34]: Even when she was quite a child , she was the Agnes whom we know , ' said I. ` Will you call me a name I want you to call me ? '
Parsing [sent. 14067 len. 6]: inquired Dora , without moving .
Parsing [sent. 14068 len. 6]: ` What is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 14069 len. 6]: I asked with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 14070 len. 18]: ` It 's a stupid name , ' she said , shaking her curls for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 14071 len. 4]: ` Child-wife . '
Parsing [sent. 14072 len. 16]: I laughingly asked my child-wife what her fancy was in desiring to be so called .
Parsing [sent. 14073 len. 44]: She answered without moving , otherwise than as the arm I twined about her may have brought her blue eyes nearer to me : ' I do n't mean , you silly fellow , that you should use the name instead of Dora .
Parsing [sent. 14074 len. 12]: I only mean that you should think of me that way .
Parsing [sent. 14075 len. 22]: When you are going to be angry with me , say to yourself , `` it 's only my child-wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14076 len. 26]: When I am very disappointing , say , `` I knew , a long time ago , that she would make but a child-wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14077 len. 28]: When you miss what I should like to be , and I think can never be , say , `` still my foolish child-wife loves me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14078 len. 6]: For indeed I do . '
Parsing [sent. 14079 len. 20]: I had not been serious with her ; having no idea until now , that she was serious herself .
Parsing [sent. 14080 len. 33]: But her affectionate nature was so happy in what I now said to her with my whole heart , that her face became a laughing one before her glittering eyes were dry .
Parsing [sent. 14081 len. 54]: She was soon my child-wife indeed ; sitting down on the floor outside the Chinese House , ringing all the little bells one after another , to punish Jip for his recent bad behaviour ; while Jip lay blinking in the doorway with his head out , even too lazy to be teased .
Parsing [sent. 14082 len. 12]: This appeal of Dora 's made a strong impression on me .
Parsing [sent. 14083 len. 58]: I look back on the time I write of ; I invoke the innocent figure that I dearly loved , to come out from the mists and shadows of the past , and turn its gentle head towards me once again ; and I can still declare that this one little speech was constantly in my memory .
Parsing [sent. 14084 len. 29]: I may not have used it to the best account ; I was young and inexperienced ; but I never turned a deaf ear to its artless pleading .
Parsing [sent. 14085 len. 17]: Dora told me , shortly afterwards , that she was going to be a wonderful housekeeper .
Parsing [sent. 14086 len. 54]: Accordingly , she polished the tablets , pointed the pencil , bought an immense account-book , carefully stitched up with a needle and thread all the leaves of the Cookery Book which Jip had torn , and made quite a desperate little attempt ` to be good ' , as she called it .
Parsing [sent. 14087 len. 15]: But the figures had the old obstinate propensity -- they WOULD NOT add up .
Parsing [sent. 14088 len. 30]: When she had entered two or three laborious items in the account-book , Jip would walk over the page , wagging his tail , and smear them all out .
Parsing [sent. 14089 len. 26]: Her own little right-hand middle finger got steeped to the very bone in ink ; and I think that was the only decided result obtained .
Parsing [sent. 14090 len. 53]: Sometimes , of an evening , when I was at home and at work -- for I wrote a good deal now , and was beginning in a small way to be known as a writer -- I would lay down my pen , and watch my child-wife trying to be good .
Parsing [sent. 14091 len. 25]: First of all , she would bring out the immense account-book , and lay it down upon the table , with a deep sigh .
Parsing [sent. 14092 len. 28]: Then she would open it at the place where Jip had made it illegible last night , and call Jip up , to look at his misdeeds .
Parsing [sent. 14093 len. 23]: This would occasion a diversion in Jip 's favour , and some inking of his nose , perhaps , as a penalty .
Parsing [sent. 14094 len. 50]: Then she would tell Jip to lie down on the table instantly , ` like a lion ' -- which was one of his tricks , though I can not say the likeness was striking -- and , if he were in an obedient humour , he would obey .
Parsing [sent. 14095 len. 20]: Then she would take up a pen , and begin to write , and find a hair in it .
Parsing [sent. 14096 len. 19]: Then she would take up another pen , and begin to write , and find that it spluttered .
Parsing [sent. 14097 len. 35]: Then she would take up another pen , and begin to write , and say in a low voice , ` Oh , it 's a talking pen , and will disturb Doady ! '
Parsing [sent. 14098 len. 27]: And then she would give it up as a bad job , and put the account-book away , after pretending to crush the lion with it .
Parsing [sent. 14099 len. 52]: Or , if she were in a very sedate and serious state of mind , she would sit down with the tablets , and a little basket of bills and other documents , which looked more like curl-papers than anything else , and endeavour to get some result out of them .
Parsing [sent. 14100 len. 67]: After severely comparing one with another , and making entries on the tablets , and blotting them out , and counting all the fingers of her left hand over and over again , backwards and forwards , she would be so vexed and discouraged , and would look so unhappy , that it gave me pain to see her bright face clouded -- and for me !
Parsing [sent. 14101 len. 21]: -- and I would go softly to her , and say : ` What 's the matter , Dora ? '
Parsing [sent. 14102 len. 16]: Dora would look up hopelessly , and reply , ` They wo n't come right .
Parsing [sent. 14103 len. 7]: They make my head ache so .
Parsing [sent. 14104 len. 10]: And they wo n't do anything I want ! '
Parsing [sent. 14105 len. 12]: Then I would say , ` Now let us try together .
Parsing [sent. 14106 len. 8]: Let me show you , Dora . '
Parsing [sent. 14107 len. 53]: Then I would commence a practical demonstration , to which Dora would pay profound attention , perhaps for five minutes ; when she would begin to be dreadfully tired , and would lighten the subject by curling my hair , or trying the effect of my face with my shirt-collar turned down .
Parsing [sent. 14108 len. 68]: If I tacitly checked this playfulness , and persisted , she would look so scared and disconsolate , as she became more and more bewildered , that the remembrance of her natural gaiety when I first strayed into her path , and of her being my child-wife , would come reproachfully upon me ; and I would lay the pencil down , and call for the guitar .
Parsing [sent. 14109 len. 26]: I had a great deal of work to do , and had many anxieties , but the same considerations made me keep them to myself .
Parsing [sent. 14110 len. 26]: I am far from sure , now , that it was right to do this , but I did it for my child-wife 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 14111 len. 23]: I search my breast , and I commit its secrets , if I know them , without any reservation to this paper .
Parsing [sent. 14112 len. 29]: The old unhappy loss or want of something had , I am conscious , some place in my heart ; but not to the embitterment of my life .
Parsing [sent. 14113 len. 60]: When I walked alone in the fine weather , and thought of the summer days when all the air had been filled with my boyish enchantment , I did miss something of the realization of my dreams ; but I thought it was a softened glory of the Past , which nothing could have thrown upon the present time .
Parsing [sent. 14114 len. 84]: I did feel , sometimes , for a little while , that I could have wished my wife had been my counsellor ; had had more character and purpose , to sustain me and improve me by ; had been endowed with power to fill up the void which somewhere seemed to be about me ; but I felt as if this were an unearthly consummation of my happiness , that never had been meant to be , and never could have been .
Parsing [sent. 14115 len. 9]: I was a boyish husband as to years .
Parsing [sent. 14116 len. 19]: I had known the softening influence of no other sorrows or experiences than those recorded in these leaves .
Parsing [sent. 14117 len. 27]: If I did any wrong , as I may have done much , I did it in mistaken love , and in my want of wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 14118 len. 6]: I write the exact truth .
Parsing [sent. 14119 len. 10]: It would avail me nothing to extenuate it now .
Parsing [sent. 14120 len. 23]: Thus it was that I took upon myself the toils and cares of our life , and had no partner in them .
Parsing [sent. 14121 len. 34]: We lived much as before , in reference to our scrambling household arrangements ; but I had got used to those , and Dora I was pleased to see was seldom vexed now .
Parsing [sent. 14122 len. 23]: She was bright and cheerful in the old childish way , loved me dearly , and was happy with her old trifles .
Parsing [sent. 14123 len. 51]: When the debates were heavy -- I mean as to length , not quality , for in the last respect they were not often otherwise -- and I went home late , Dora would never rest when she heard my footsteps , but would always come downstairs to meet me .
Parsing [sent. 14124 len. 55]: When my evenings were unoccupied by the pursuit for which I had qualified myself with so much pains , and I was engaged in writing at home , she would sit quietly near me , however late the hour , and be so mute , that I would often think she had dropped asleep .
Parsing [sent. 14125 len. 28]: But generally , when I raised my head , I saw her blue eyes looking at me with the quiet attention of which I have already spoken .
Parsing [sent. 14126 len. 9]: ` Oh , what a weary boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 14127 len. 18]: said Dora one night , when I met her eyes as I was shutting up my desk .
Parsing [sent. 14128 len. 7]: ` What a weary girl ! '
Parsing [sent. 14129 len. 10]: said I. ` That 's more to the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 14130 len. 11]: You must go to bed another time , my love .
Parsing [sent. 14131 len. 9]: It 's far too late for you . '
Parsing [sent. 14132 len. 11]: ` No , do n't send me to bed ! '
Parsing [sent. 14133 len. 8]: pleaded Dora , coming to my side .
Parsing [sent. 14134 len. 9]: ` Pray , do n't do that ! '
Parsing [sent. 14135 len. 4]: ` Dora ! '
Parsing [sent. 14136 len. 10]: To my amazement she was sobbing on my neck .
Parsing [sent. 14137 len. 7]: ` Not well , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 14138 len. 4]: not happy ! '
Parsing [sent. 14139 len. 3]: ` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 14140 len. 8]: quite well , and very happy ! '
Parsing [sent. 14141 len. 3]: said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 14142 len. 15]: ` But say you 'll let me stop , and see you write . '
Parsing [sent. 14143 len. 14]: ` Why , what a sight for such bright eyes at midnight ! '
Parsing [sent. 14144 len. 3]: I replied .
Parsing [sent. 14145 len. 8]: ` Are they bright , though ? '
Parsing [sent. 14146 len. 5]: returned Dora , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 14147 len. 10]: ` I 'm so glad they 're bright . '
Parsing [sent. 14148 len. 5]: ` Little Vanity ! '
Parsing [sent. 14149 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 14150 len. 15]: But it was not vanity ; it was only harmless delight in my admiration .
Parsing [sent. 14151 len. 12]: I knew that very well , before she told me so .
Parsing [sent. 14152 len. 19]: ` If you think them pretty , say I may always stop , and see you write ! '
Parsing [sent. 14153 len. 3]: said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 14154 len. 8]: ` Do you think them pretty ? '
Parsing [sent. 14155 len. 5]: ` Very pretty . '
Parsing [sent. 14156 len. 13]: ` Then let me always stop and see you write . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14157 len. 13]: I am afraid that wo n't improve their brightness , Dora . '
Parsing [sent. 14158 len. 6]: ` Yes , it will !
Parsing [sent. 14159 len. 21]: Because , you clever boy , you 'll not forget me then , while you are full of silent fancies .
Parsing [sent. 14160 len. 14]: Will you mind it , if I say something very , very silly ?
Parsing [sent. 14161 len. 6]: -- more than usual ? '
Parsing [sent. 14162 len. 11]: inquired Dora , peeping over my shoulder into my face .
Parsing [sent. 14163 len. 8]: ` What wonderful thing is that ? '
Parsing [sent. 14164 len. 15]: said I. ` Please let me hold the pens , ' said Dora . '
Parsing [sent. 14165 len. 18]: I want to have something to do with all those many hours when you are so industrious .
Parsing [sent. 14166 len. 7]: May I hold the pens ? '
Parsing [sent. 14167 len. 17]: The remembrance of her pretty joy when I said yes , brings tears into my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 14168 len. 30]: The next time I sat down to write , and regularly afterwards , she sat in her old place , with a spare bundle of pens at her side .
Parsing [sent. 14169 len. 38]: Her triumph in this connexion with my work , and her delight when I wanted a new pen -- which I very often feigned to do - suggested to me a new way of pleasing my child-wife .
Parsing [sent. 14170 len. 15]: I occasionally made a pretence of wanting a page or two of manuscript copied .
Parsing [sent. 14171 len. 7]: Then Dora was in her glory .
Parsing [sent. 14172 len. 112]: The preparations she made for this great work , the aprons she put on , the bibs she borrowed from the kitchen to keep off the ink , the time she took , the innumerable stoppages she made to have a laugh with Jip as if he understood it all , her conviction that her work was incomplete unless she signed her name at the end , and the way in which she would bring it to me , like a school-copy , and then , when I praised it , clasp me round the neck , are touching recollections to me , simple as they might appear to other men .
Parsing [sent. 14173 len. 31]: She took possession of the keys soon after this , and went jingling about the house with the whole bunch in a little basket , tied to her slender waist .
Parsing [sent. 14174 len. 37]: I seldom found that the places to which they belonged were locked , or that they were of any use except as a plaything for Jip -- but Dora was pleased , and that pleased me .
Parsing [sent. 14175 len. 33]: She was quite satisfied that a good deal was effected by this make-belief of housekeeping ; and was as merry as if we had been keeping a baby-house , for a joke .
Parsing [sent. 14176 len. 5]: So we went on .
Parsing [sent. 14177 len. 32]: Dora was hardly less affectionate to my aunt than to me , and often told her of the time when she was afraid she was ' a cross old thing ' .
Parsing [sent. 14178 len. 11]: I never saw my aunt unbend more systematically to anyone .
Parsing [sent. 14179 len. 109]: She courted Jip , though Jip never responded ; listened , day after day , to the guitar , though I am afraid she had no taste for music ; never attacked the Incapables , though the temptation must have been severe ; went wonderful distances on foot to purchase , as surprises , any trifles that she found out Dora wanted ; and never came in by the garden , and missed her from the room , but she would call out , at the foot of the stairs , in a voice that sounded cheerfully all over the house : ` Where 's Little Blossom ? '
Parsing [sent. 14180 len. 22]: Chapter 45 Mr. Dick fulfils my aunt 's Predictions It was some time now , since I had left the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 14181 len. 27]: Living in his neighbourhood , I saw him frequently ; and we all went to his house on two or three occasions to dinner or tea .
Parsing [sent. 14182 len. 13]: The Old Soldier was in permanent quarters under the Doctor 's roof .
Parsing [sent. 14183 len. 18]: She was exactly the same as ever , and the same immortal butterflies hovered over her cap .
Parsing [sent. 14184 len. 29]: Like some other mothers , whom I have known in the course of my life , Mrs. Markleham was far more fond of pleasure than her daughter was .
Parsing [sent. 14185 len. 32]: She required a great deal of amusement , and , like a deep old soldier , pretended , in consulting her own inclinations , to be devoting herself to her child .
Parsing [sent. 14186 len. 27]: The Doctor 's desire that Annie should be entertained , was therefore particularly acceptable to this excellent parent ; who expressed unqualified approval of his discretion .
Parsing [sent. 14187 len. 18]: I have no doubt , indeed , that she probed the Doctor 's wound without knowing it .
Parsing [sent. 14188 len. 60]: Meaning nothing but a certain matured frivolity and selfishness , not always inseparable from full-blown years , I think she confirmed him in his fear that he was a constraint upon his young wife , and that there was no congeniality of feeling between them , by so strongly commending his design of lightening the load of her life .
Parsing [sent. 14189 len. 40]: ` My dear soul , ' she said to him one day when I was present , ` you know there is no doubt it would be a little pokey for Annie to be always shut up here . '
Parsing [sent. 14190 len. 7]: The Doctor nodded his benevolent head .
Parsing [sent. 14191 len. 30]: ` When she comes to her mother 's age , ' said Mrs. Markleham , with a flourish of her fan , ` then it 'll be another thing .
Parsing [sent. 14192 len. 24]: You might put ME into a Jail , with genteel society and a rubber , and I should never care to come out .
Parsing [sent. 14193 len. 17]: But I am not Annie , you know ; and Annie is not her mother . '
Parsing [sent. 14194 len. 10]: ` Surely , surely , ' said the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 14195 len. 16]: ` You are the best of creatures -- no , I beg your pardon ! '
Parsing [sent. 14196 len. 43]: for the Doctor made a gesture of deprecation , ' I must say before your face , as I always say behind your back , you are the best of creatures ; but of course you do n't -- now do you ?
Parsing [sent. 14197 len. 12]: -- enter into the same pursuits and fancies as Annie ? '
Parsing [sent. 14198 len. 13]: ` No , ' said the Doctor , in a sorrowful tone .
Parsing [sent. 14199 len. 13]: ` No , of course not , ' retorted the Old Soldier .
Parsing [sent. 14200 len. 8]: ` Take your Dictionary , for example .
Parsing [sent. 14201 len. 8]: What a useful work a Dictionary is !
Parsing [sent. 14202 len. 5]: What a necessary work !
Parsing [sent. 14203 len. 5]: The meanings of words !
Parsing [sent. 14204 len. 25]: Without Doctor Johnson , or somebody of that sort , we might have been at this present moment calling an Italian-iron , a bedstead .
Parsing [sent. 14205 len. 22]: But we ca n't expect a Dictionary -- especially when it 's making -- to interest Annie , can we ? '
Parsing [sent. 14206 len. 6]: The Doctor shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 14207 len. 30]: ` And that 's why I so much approve , ' said Mrs. Markleham , tapping him on the shoulder with her shut-up fan , ` of your thoughtfulness .
Parsing [sent. 14208 len. 21]: It shows that you do n't expect , as many elderly people do expect , old heads on young shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 14209 len. 12]: You have studied Annie 's character , and you understand it .
Parsing [sent. 14210 len. 9]: That 's what I find so charming ! '
Parsing [sent. 14211 len. 26]: Even the calm and patient face of Doctor Strong expressed some little sense of pain , I thought , under the infliction of these compliments .
Parsing [sent. 14212 len. 31]: ` Therefore , my dear Doctor , ' said the Old Soldier , giving him several affectionate taps , ` you may command me , at all times and seasons .
Parsing [sent. 14213 len. 12]: Now , do understand that I am entirely at your service .
Parsing [sent. 14214 len. 29]: I am ready to go with Annie to operas , concerts , exhibitions , all kinds of places ; and you shall never find that I am tired .
Parsing [sent. 14215 len. 14]: Duty , my dear Doctor , before every consideration in the universe ! '
Parsing [sent. 14216 len. 8]: She was as good as her word .
Parsing [sent. 14217 len. 26]: She was one of those people who can bear a great deal of pleasure , and she never flinched in her perseverance in the cause .
Parsing [sent. 14218 len. 49]: She seldom got hold of the newspaper -LRB- which she settled herself down in the softest chair in the house to read through an eye-glass , every day , for two hours -RRB- , but she found out something that she was certain Annie would like to see .
Parsing [sent. 14219 len. 16]: It was in vain for Annie to protest that she was weary of such things .
Parsing [sent. 14220 len. 46]: Her mother 's remonstrance always was , ` Now , my dear Annie , I am sure you know better ; and I must tell you , my love , that you are not making a proper return for the kindness of Doctor Strong . '
Parsing [sent. 14221 len. 29]: This was usually said in the Doctor 's presence , and appeared to me to constitute Annie 's principal inducement for withdrawing her objections when she made any .
Parsing [sent. 14222 len. 18]: But in general she resigned herself to her mother , and went where the Old Soldier would .
Parsing [sent. 14223 len. 10]: It rarely happened now that Mr. Maldon accompanied them .
Parsing [sent. 14224 len. 16]: Sometimes my aunt and Dora were invited to do so , and accepted the invitation .
Parsing [sent. 14225 len. 6]: Sometimes Dora only was asked .
Parsing [sent. 14226 len. 38]: The time had been , when I should have been uneasy in her going ; but reflection on what had passed that former night in the Doctor 's study , had made a change in my mistrust .
Parsing [sent. 14227 len. 15]: I believed that the Doctor was right , and I had no worse suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 14228 len. 52]: My aunt rubbed her nose sometimes when she happened to be alone with me , and said she could n't make it out ; she wished they were happier ; she did n't think our military friend -LRB- so she always called the Old Soldier -RRB- mended the matter at all .
Parsing [sent. 14229 len. 42]: My aunt further expressed her opinion , ` that if our military friend would cut off those butterflies , and give 'em to the chimney-sweepers for May-day , it would look like the beginning of something sensible on her part . '
Parsing [sent. 14230 len. 9]: But her abiding reliance was on Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 14231 len. 41]: That man had evidently an idea in his head , she said ; and if he could only once pen it up into a corner , which was his great difficulty , he would distinguish himself in some extraordinary manner .
Parsing [sent. 14232 len. 24]: Unconscious of this prediction , Mr. Dick continued to occupy precisely the same ground in reference to the Doctor and to Mrs. Strong .
Parsing [sent. 14233 len. 9]: He seemed neither to advance nor to recede .
Parsing [sent. 14234 len. 38]: He appeared to have settled into his original foundation , like a building ; and I must confess that my faith in his ever Moving , was not much greater than if he had been a building .
Parsing [sent. 14235 len. 70]: But one night , when I had been married some months , Mr. Dick put his head into the parlour , where I was writing alone -LRB- Dora having gone out with my aunt to take tea with the two little birds -RRB- , and said , with a significant cough : ` You could n't speak to me without inconveniencing yourself , Trotwood , I am afraid ? '
Parsing [sent. 14236 len. 15]: ` Certainly , Mr. Dick , ' said I ; ` come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 14237 len. 26]: ` Trotwood , ' said Mr. Dick , laying his finger on the side of his nose , after he had shaken hands with me .
Parsing [sent. 14238 len. 13]: ` Before I sit down , I wish to make an observation .
Parsing [sent. 14239 len. 7]: You know your aunt ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 14240 len. 7]: A little , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 14241 len. 14]: ` She is the most wonderful woman in the world , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 14242 len. 36]: After the delivery of this communication , which he shot out of himself as if he were loaded with it , Mr. Dick sat down with greater gravity than usual , and looked at me .
Parsing [sent. 14243 len. 22]: ` Now , boy , ' said Mr. Dick , ' I am going to put a question to you . '
Parsing [sent. 14244 len. 20]: ` As many as you please , ' said I. ` What do you consider me , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 14245 len. 9]: asked Mr. Dick , folding his arms . '
Parsing [sent. 14246 len. 33]: A dear old friend , ' said I. ` Thank you , Trotwood , ' returned Mr. Dick , laughing , and reaching across in high glee to shake hands with me .
Parsing [sent. 14247 len. 23]: ` But I mean , boy , ' resuming his gravity , ` what do you consider me in this respect ? '
Parsing [sent. 14248 len. 4]: touching his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 14249 len. 15]: I was puzzled how to answer , but he helped me with a word .
Parsing [sent. 14250 len. 4]: ` Weak ? '
Parsing [sent. 14251 len. 4]: said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 14252 len. 9]: ` Well , ' I replied , dubiously .
Parsing [sent. 14253 len. 5]: ` Rather so . '
Parsing [sent. 14254 len. 4]: ` Exactly ! '
Parsing [sent. 14255 len. 12]: cried Mr. Dick , who seemed quite enchanted by my reply .
Parsing [sent. 14256 len. 69]: ` That is , Trotwood , when they took some of the trouble out of you-know-who 's head , and put it you know where , there was a -- ' Mr. Dick made his two hands revolve very fast about each other a great number of times , and then brought them into collision , and rolled them over and over one another , to express confusion .
Parsing [sent. 14257 len. 12]: ` There was that sort of thing done to me somehow .
Parsing [sent. 14258 len. 3]: Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 14259 len. 11]: I nodded at him , and he nodded back again .
Parsing [sent. 14260 len. 24]: ` In short , boy , ' said Mr. Dick , dropping his voice to a whisper , ' I am simple . '
Parsing [sent. 14261 len. 12]: I would have qualified that conclusion , but he stopped me .
Parsing [sent. 14262 len. 6]: ` Yes , I am !
Parsing [sent. 14263 len. 6]: She pretends I am not .
Parsing [sent. 14264 len. 11]: She wo n't hear of it ; but I am .
Parsing [sent. 14265 len. 5]: I know I am .
Parsing [sent. 14266 len. 26]: If she had n't stood my friend , sir , I should have been shut up , to lead a dismal life these many years .
Parsing [sent. 14267 len. 7]: But I 'll provide for her !
Parsing [sent. 14268 len. 7]: I never spend the copying money .
Parsing [sent. 14269 len. 7]: I put it in a box .
Parsing [sent. 14270 len. 6]: I have made a will .
Parsing [sent. 14271 len. 8]: I 'll leave it all to her .
Parsing [sent. 14272 len. 8]: She shall be rich -- noble ! '
Parsing [sent. 14273 len. 12]: Mr. Dick took out his pocket-handkerchief , and wiped his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 14274 len. 33]: He then folded it up with great care , pressed it smooth between his two hands , put it in his pocket , and seemed to put my aunt away with it .
Parsing [sent. 14275 len. 14]: ` Now you are a scholar , Trotwood , ' said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 14276 len. 7]: ` You are a fine scholar .
Parsing [sent. 14277 len. 16]: You know what a learned man , what a great man , the Doctor is .
Parsing [sent. 14278 len. 10]: You know what honour he has always done me .
Parsing [sent. 14279 len. 6]: Not proud in his wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 14280 len. 17]: Humble , humble -- condescending even to poor Dick , who is simple and knows nothing .
Parsing [sent. 14281 len. 33]: I have sent his name up , on a scrap of paper , to the kite , along the string , when it has been in the sky , among the larks .
Parsing [sent. 14282 len. 21]: The kite has been glad to receive it , sir , and the sky has been brighter with it . '
Parsing [sent. 14283 len. 22]: I delighted him by saying , most heartily , that the Doctor was deserving of our best respect and highest esteem .
Parsing [sent. 14284 len. 15]: ` And his beautiful wife is a star , ' said Mr. Dick . '
Parsing [sent. 14285 len. 4]: A shining star .
Parsing [sent. 14286 len. 8]: I have seen her shine , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14287 len. 24]: But , ' bringing his chair nearer , and laying one hand upon my knee -- ` clouds , sir -- clouds . '
Parsing [sent. 14288 len. 23]: I answered the solicitude which his face expressed , by conveying the same expression into my own , and shaking my head .
Parsing [sent. 14289 len. 5]: ` What clouds ? '
Parsing [sent. 14290 len. 4]: said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 14291 len. 39]: He looked so wistfully into my face , and was so anxious to understand , that I took great pains to answer him slowly and distinctly , as I might have entered on an explanation to a child .
Parsing [sent. 14292 len. 13]: ` There is some unfortunate division between them , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 14293 len. 7]: ` Some unhappy cause of separation .
Parsing [sent. 14294 len. 3]: A secret .
Parsing [sent. 14295 len. 11]: It may be inseparable from the discrepancy in their years .
Parsing [sent. 14296 len. 11]: It may have grown up out of almost nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 14297 len. 38]: Mr. Dick , who had told off every sentence with a thoughtful nod , paused when I had done , and sat considering , with his eyes upon my face , and his hand upon my knee .
Parsing [sent. 14298 len. 10]: ` Doctor not angry with her , Trotwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 14299 len. 7]: he said , after some time .
Parsing [sent. 14300 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 14301 len. 5]: Devoted to her . '
Parsing [sent. 14302 len. 11]: ` Then , I have got it , boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 14303 len. 4]: said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 14304 len. 45]: The sudden exultation with which he slapped me on the knee , and leaned back in his chair , with his eyebrows lifted up as high as he could possibly lift them , made me think him farther out of his wits than ever .
Parsing [sent. 14305 len. 41]: He became as suddenly grave again , and leaning forward as before , said -- first respectfully taking out his pocket-handkerchief , as if it really did represent my aunt : ` Most wonderful woman in the world , Trotwood .
Parsing [sent. 14306 len. 11]: Why has she done nothing to set things right ? '
Parsing [sent. 14307 len. 15]: ` Too delicate and difficult a subject for such interference , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 14308 len. 15]: ` Fine scholar , ' said Mr. Dick , touching me with his finger .
Parsing [sent. 14309 len. 8]: ` Why has HE done nothing ? '
Parsing [sent. 14310 len. 10]: ` For the same reason , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 14311 len. 11]: ` Then , I have got it , boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 14312 len. 4]: said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 14313 len. 45]: And he stood up before me , more exultingly than before , nodding his head , and striking himself repeatedly upon the breast , until one might have supposed that he had nearly nodded and struck all the breath out of his body . '
Parsing [sent. 14314 len. 29]: A poor fellow with a craze , sir , ' said Mr. Dick , ' a simpleton , a weak-minded person -- present company , you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 14315 len. 14]: striking himself again , ` may do what wonderful people may not do .
Parsing [sent. 14316 len. 8]: I 'll bring them together , boy .
Parsing [sent. 14317 len. 4]: I 'll try .
Parsing [sent. 14318 len. 6]: They 'll not blame me .
Parsing [sent. 14319 len. 7]: They 'll not object to me .
Parsing [sent. 14320 len. 13]: They 'll not mind what I do , if it 's wrong .
Parsing [sent. 14321 len. 6]: I 'm only Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 14322 len. 5]: And who minds Dick ?
Parsing [sent. 14323 len. 4]: Dick 's nobody !
Parsing [sent. 14324 len. 3]: Whoo ! '
Parsing [sent. 14325 len. 15]: He blew a slight , contemptuous breath , as if he blew himself away .
Parsing [sent. 14326 len. 32]: It was fortunate he had proceeded so far with his mystery , for we heard the coach stop at the little garden gate , which brought my aunt and Dora home .
Parsing [sent. 14327 len. 8]: ` Not a word , boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 14328 len. 20]: he pursued in a whisper ; ` leave all the blame with Dick -- simple Dick -- mad Dick .
Parsing [sent. 14329 len. 24]: I have been thinking , sir , for some time , that I was getting it , and now I have got it .
Parsing [sent. 14330 len. 16]: After what you have said to me , I am sure I have got it .
Parsing [sent. 14331 len. 4]: All right ! '
Parsing [sent. 14332 len. 42]: Not another word did Mr. Dick utter on the subject ; but he made a very telegraph of himself for the next half-hour -LRB- to the great disturbance of my aunt 's mind -RRB- , to enjoin inviolable secrecy on me .
Parsing [sent. 14333 len. 59]: To my surprise , I heard no more about it for some two or three weeks , though I was sufficiently interested in the result of his endeavours ; descrying a strange gleam of good sense -- I say nothing of good feeling , for that he always exhibited -- in the conclusion to which he had come .
Parsing [sent. 14334 len. 29]: At last I began to believe , that , in the flighty and unsettled state of his mind , he had either forgotten his intention or abandoned it .
Parsing [sent. 14335 len. 25]: One fair evening , when Dora was not inclined to go out , my aunt and I strolled up to the Doctor 's cottage .
Parsing [sent. 14336 len. 52]: It was autumn , when there were no debates to vex the evening air ; and I remember how the leaves smelt like our garden at Blunderstone as we trod them under foot , and how the old , unhappy feeling , seemed to go by , on the sighing wind .
Parsing [sent. 14337 len. 9]: It was twilight when we reached the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 14338 len. 29]: Mrs. Strong was just coming out of the garden , where Mr. Dick yet lingered , busy with his knife , helping the gardener to point some stakes .
Parsing [sent. 14339 len. 31]: The Doctor was engaged with someone in his study ; but the visitor would be gone directly , Mrs. Strong said , and begged us to remain and see him .
Parsing [sent. 14340 len. 16]: We went into the drawing-room with her , and sat down by the darkening window .
Parsing [sent. 14341 len. 18]: There was never any ceremony about the visits of such old friends and neighbours as we were .
Parsing [sent. 14342 len. 62]: We had not sat here many minutes , when Mrs. Markleham , who usually contrived to be in a fuss about something , came bustling in , with her newspaper in her hand , and said , out of breath , ` My goodness gracious , Annie , why did n't you tell me there was someone in the Study ! '
Parsing [sent. 14343 len. 22]: ` My dear mama , ' she quietly returned , ` how could I know that you desired the information ? '
Parsing [sent. 14344 len. 6]: ` Desired the information ! '
Parsing [sent. 14345 len. 10]: said Mrs. Markleham , sinking on the sofa . '
Parsing [sent. 14346 len. 12]: I never had such a turn in all my life ! '
Parsing [sent. 14347 len. 13]: ` Have you been to the Study , then , mama ? '
Parsing [sent. 14348 len. 3]: asked Annie .
Parsing [sent. 14349 len. 10]: ` BEEN to the Study , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 14350 len. 4]: she returned emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 14351 len. 5]: ` Indeed I have !
Parsing [sent. 14352 len. 28]: I came upon the amiable creature -- if you 'll imagine my feelings , Miss Trotwood and David -- in the act of making his will . '
Parsing [sent. 14353 len. 9]: Her daughter looked round from the window quickly .
Parsing [sent. 14354 len. 40]: ` In the act , my dear Annie , ' repeated Mrs. Markleham , spreading the newspaper on her lap like a table-cloth , and patting her hands upon it , ` of making his last Will and Testament .
Parsing [sent. 14355 len. 8]: The foresight and affection of the dear !
Parsing [sent. 14356 len. 8]: I must tell you how it was .
Parsing [sent. 14357 len. 16]: I really must , in justice to the darling -- for he is nothing less !
Parsing [sent. 14358 len. 7]: -- tell you how it was .
Parsing [sent. 14359 len. 38]: Perhaps you know , Miss Trotwood , that there is never a candle lighted in this house , until one 's eyes are literally falling out of one 's head with being stretched to read the paper .
Parsing [sent. 14360 len. 29]: And that there is not a chair in this house , in which a paper can be what I call , read , except one in the Study .
Parsing [sent. 14361 len. 13]: This took me to the Study , where I saw a light .
Parsing [sent. 14362 len. 5]: I opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 14363 len. 34]: In company with the dear Doctor were two professional people , evidently connected with the law , and they were all three standing at the table : the darling Doctor pen in hand .
Parsing [sent. 14364 len. 45]: `` This simply expresses then , '' said the Doctor -- Annie , my love , attend to the very words -- `` this simply expresses then , gentlemen , the confidence I have in Mrs. Strong , and gives her all unconditionally ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14365 len. 15]: One of the professional people replied , `` And gives her all unconditionally . ''
Parsing [sent. 14366 len. 24]: Upon that , with the natural feelings of a mother , I said , `` Good God , I beg your pardon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14367 len. 19]: fell over the door-step , and came away through the little back passage where the pantry is . '
Parsing [sent. 14368 len. 21]: Mrs. Strong opened the window , and went out into the verandah , where she stood leaning against a pillar .
Parsing [sent. 14369 len. 55]: ` But now is n't it , Miss Trotwood , is n't it , David , invigorating , ' said Mrs. Markleham , mechanically following her with her eyes , ` to find a man at Doctor Strong 's time of life , with the strength of mind to do this kind of thing ?
Parsing [sent. 14370 len. 8]: It only shows how right I was .
Parsing [sent. 14371 len. 69]: I said to Annie , when Doctor Strong paid a very flattering visit to myself , and made her the subject of a declaration and an offer , I said , `` My dear , there is no doubt whatever , in my opinion , with reference to a suitable provision for you , that Doctor Strong will do more than he binds himself to do . '' '
Parsing [sent. 14372 len. 20]: Here the bell rang , and we heard the sound of the visitors ' feet as they went out .
Parsing [sent. 14373 len. 37]: ` It 's all over , no doubt , ' said the Old Soldier , after listening ; ` the dear creature has signed , sealed , and delivered , and his mind 's at rest .
Parsing [sent. 14374 len. 5]: Well it may be !
Parsing [sent. 14375 len. 4]: What a mind !
Parsing [sent. 14376 len. 24]: Annie , my love , I am going to the Study with my paper , for I am a poor creature without news .
Parsing [sent. 14377 len. 13]: Miss Trotwood , David , pray come and see the Doctor . '
Parsing [sent. 14378 len. 114]: I was conscious of Mr. Dick 's standing in the shadow of the room , shutting up his knife , when we accompanied her to the Study ; and of my aunt 's rubbing her nose violently , by the way , as a mild vent for her intolerance of our military friend ; but who got first into the Study , or how Mrs. Markleham settled herself in a moment in her easy-chair , or how my aunt and I came to be left together near the door -LRB- unless her eyes were quicker than mine , and she held me back -RRB- , I have forgotten , if I ever knew .
Parsing [sent. 14379 len. 38]: But this I know , -- that we saw the Doctor before he saw us , sitting at his table , among the folio volumes in which he delighted , resting his head calmly on his hand .
Parsing [sent. 14380 len. 18]: That , in the same moment , we saw Mrs. Strong glide in , pale and trembling .
Parsing [sent. 14381 len. 9]: That Mr. Dick supported her on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 14382 len. 22]: That he laid his other hand upon the Doctor 's arm , causing him to look up with an abstracted air .
Parsing [sent. 14383 len. 40]: That , as the Doctor moved his head , his wife dropped down on one knee at his feet , and , with her hands imploringly lifted , fixed upon his face the memorable look I had never forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 14384 len. 34]: That at this sight Mrs. Markleham dropped the newspaper , and stared more like a figure-head intended for a ship to be called The Astonishment , than anything else I can think of .
Parsing [sent. 14385 len. 46]: The gentleness of the Doctor 's manner and surprise , the dignity that mingled with the supplicating attitude of his wife , the amiable concern of Mr. Dick , and the earnestness with which my aunt said to herself , ` That man mad ! '
Parsing [sent. 14386 len. 29]: -LRB- triumphantly expressive of the misery from which she had saved him -RRB- -- I see and hear , rather than remember , as I write about it .
Parsing [sent. 14387 len. 4]: ` Doctor ! '
Parsing [sent. 14388 len. 4]: said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 14389 len. 8]: ` What is it that 's amiss ?
Parsing [sent. 14390 len. 4]: Look here ! '
Parsing [sent. 14391 len. 4]: ` Annie ! '
Parsing [sent. 14392 len. 4]: cried the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 14393 len. 10]: ` Not at my feet , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 14394 len. 4]: ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 14395 len. 4]: she said . '
Parsing [sent. 14396 len. 12]: I beg and pray that no one will leave the room !
Parsing [sent. 14397 len. 12]: Oh , my husband and father , break this long silence .
Parsing [sent. 14398 len. 14]: Let us both know what it is that has come between us ! '
Parsing [sent. 14399 len. 63]: Mrs. Markleham , by this time recovering the power of speech , and seeming to swell with family pride and motherly indignation , here exclaimed , ` Annie , get up immediately , and do n't disgrace everybody belonging to you by humbling yourself like that , unless you wish to see me go out of my mind on the spot ! '
Parsing [sent. 14400 len. 4]: ` Mama ! '
Parsing [sent. 14401 len. 3]: returned Annie .
Parsing [sent. 14402 len. 23]: ` Waste no words on me , for my appeal is to my husband , and even you are nothing here . '
Parsing [sent. 14403 len. 4]: ` Nothing ! '
Parsing [sent. 14404 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs. Markleham .
Parsing [sent. 14405 len. 5]: ` Me , nothing !
Parsing [sent. 14406 len. 9]: The child has taken leave of her senses .
Parsing [sent. 14407 len. 10]: Please to get me a glass of water ! '
Parsing [sent. 14408 len. 39]: I was too attentive to the Doctor and his wife , to give any heed to this request ; and it made no impression on anybody else ; so Mrs. Markleham panted , stared , and fanned herself .
Parsing [sent. 14409 len. 4]: ` Annie ! '
Parsing [sent. 14410 len. 11]: said the Doctor , tenderly taking her in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 14411 len. 4]: ` My dear !
Parsing [sent. 14412 len. 24]: If any unavoidable change has come , in the sequence of time , upon our married life , you are not to blame .
Parsing [sent. 14413 len. 9]: The fault is mine , and only mine .
Parsing [sent. 14414 len. 13]: There is no change in my affection , admiration , and respect .
Parsing [sent. 14415 len. 7]: I wish to make you happy .
Parsing [sent. 14416 len. 7]: I truly love and honour you .
Parsing [sent. 14417 len. 7]: Rise , Annie , pray ! '
Parsing [sent. 14418 len. 6]: But she did not rise .
Parsing [sent. 14419 len. 128]: After looking at him for a little while , she sank down closer to him , laid her arm across his knee , and dropping her head upon it , said : ` If I have any friend here , who can speak one word for me , or for my husband in this matter ; if I have any friend here , who can give a voice to any suspicion that my heart has sometimes whispered to me ; if I have any friend here , who honours my husband , or has ever cared for me , and has anything within his knowledge , no matter what it is , that may help to mediate between us , I implore that friend to speak ! '
Parsing [sent. 14420 len. 6]: There was a profound silence .
Parsing [sent. 14421 len. 13]: After a few moments of painful hesitation , I broke the silence .
Parsing [sent. 14422 len. 34]: ` Mrs. Strong , ' I said , ` there is something within my knowledge , which I have been earnestly entreated by Doctor Strong to conceal , and have concealed until tonight .
Parsing [sent. 14423 len. 33]: But , I believe the time has come when it would be mistaken faith and delicacy to conceal it any longer , and when your appeal absolves me from his injunction . '
Parsing [sent. 14424 len. 18]: She turned her face towards me for a moment , and I knew that I was right .
Parsing [sent. 14425 len. 20]: I could not have resisted its entreaty , if the assurance that it gave me had been less convincing .
Parsing [sent. 14426 len. 16]: ` Our future peace , ' she said , ` may be in your hands .
Parsing [sent. 14427 len. 10]: I trust it confidently to your not suppressing anything .
Parsing [sent. 14428 len. 28]: I know beforehand that nothing you , or anyone , can tell me , will show my husband 's noble heart in any other light than one .
Parsing [sent. 14429 len. 13]: Howsoever it may seem to you to touch me , disregard that .
Parsing [sent. 14430 len. 15]: I will speak for myself , before him , and before God afterwards . '
Parsing [sent. 14431 len. 47]: Thus earnestly besought , I made no reference to the Doctor for his permission , but , without any other compromise of the truth than a little softening of the coarseness of Uriah Heep , related plainly what had passed in that same room that night .
Parsing [sent. 14432 len. 26]: The staring of Mrs. Markleham during the whole narration , and the shrill , sharp interjections with which she occasionally interrupted it , defy description .
Parsing [sent. 14433 len. 26]: When I had finished , Annie remained , for some few moments , silent , with her head bent down , as I have described .
Parsing [sent. 14434 len. 36]: Then , she took the Doctor 's hand -LRB- he was sitting in the same attitude as when we had entered the room -RRB- , and pressed it to her breast , and kissed it .
Parsing [sent. 14435 len. 35]: Mr. Dick softly raised her ; and she stood , when she began to speak , leaning on him , and looking down upon her husband -- from whom she never turned her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 14436 len. 35]: ` All that has ever been in my mind , since I was married , ' she said in a low , submissive , tender voice , ' I will lay bare before you .
Parsing [sent. 14437 len. 16]: I could not live and have one reservation , knowing what I know now . '
Parsing [sent. 14438 len. 22]: ` Nay , Annie , ' said the Doctor , mildly , ' I have never doubted you , my child .
Parsing [sent. 14439 len. 15]: There is no need ; indeed there is no need , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 14440 len. 56]: ` There is great need , ' she answered , in the same way , ` that I should open my whole heart before the soul of generosity and truth , whom , year by year , and day by day , I have loved and venerated more and more , as Heaven knows ! '
Parsing [sent. 14441 len. 39]: ` Really , ' interrupted Mrs. Markleham , ` if I have any discretion at all -- ' -LRB- ` Which you have n't , you Marplot , ' observed my aunt , in an indignant whisper . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 14442 len. 21]: - ' I must be permitted to observe that it can not be requisite to enter into these details . '
Parsing [sent. 14443 len. 31]: ` No one but my husband can judge of that , mama , ' said Annie without removing her eyes from his face , ` and he will hear me .
Parsing [sent. 14444 len. 14]: If I say anything to give you pain , mama , forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 14445 len. 13]: I have borne pain first , often and long , myself . '
Parsing [sent. 14446 len. 6]: ` Upon my word ! '
Parsing [sent. 14447 len. 4]: gasped Mrs. Markleham .
Parsing [sent. 14448 len. 48]: ` When I was very young , ' said Annie , ` quite a little child , my first associations with knowledge of any kind were inseparable from a patient friend and teacher -- the friend of my dead father -- who was always dear to me .
Parsing [sent. 14449 len. 12]: I can remember nothing that I know , without remembering him .
Parsing [sent. 14450 len. 17]: He stored my mind with its first treasures , and stamped his character upon them all .
Parsing [sent. 14451 len. 29]: They never could have been , I think , as good as they have been to me , if I had taken them from any other hands . '
Parsing [sent. 14452 len. 7]: ` Makes her mother nothing ! '
Parsing [sent. 14453 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs. Markleham .
Parsing [sent. 14454 len. 18]: ` Not so mama , ' said Annie ; ` but I make him what he was .
Parsing [sent. 14455 len. 5]: I must do that .
Parsing [sent. 14456 len. 12]: As I grew up , he occupied the same place still .
Parsing [sent. 14457 len. 16]: I was proud of his interest : deeply , fondly , gratefully attached to him .
Parsing [sent. 14458 len. 50]: I looked up to him , I can hardly describe how -- as a father , as a guide , as one whose praise was different from all other praise , as one in whom I could have trusted and confided , if I had doubted all the world .
Parsing [sent. 14459 len. 29]: You know , mama , how young and inexperienced I was , when you presented him before me , of a sudden , as a lover . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14460 len. 16]: I have mentioned the fact , fifty times at least , to everybody here ! '
Parsing [sent. 14461 len. 4]: said Mrs. Markleham .
Parsing [sent. 14462 len. 22]: -LRB- ` Then hold your tongue , for the Lord 's sake , and do n't mention it any more ! '
Parsing [sent. 14463 len. 5]: muttered my aunt . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 14464 len. 40]: ` It was so great a change : so great a loss , I felt it , at first , ' said Annie , still preserving the same look and tone , ` that I was agitated and distressed .
Parsing [sent. 14465 len. 33]: I was but a girl ; and when so great a change came in the character in which I had so long looked up to him , I think I was sorry .
Parsing [sent. 14466 len. 32]: But nothing could have made him what he used to be again ; and I was proud that he should think me so worthy , and we were married . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14467 len. 12]: - At Saint Alphage , Canterbury , ' observed Mrs. Markleham .
Parsing [sent. 14468 len. 7]: -LRB- ` Confound the woman ! '
Parsing [sent. 14469 len. 14]: said my aunt , ` she WO N'T be quiet ! ' -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 14470 len. 26]: I never thought , ' proceeded Annie , with a heightened colour , ` of any worldly gain that my husband would bring to me .
Parsing [sent. 14471 len. 15]: My young heart had no room in its homage for any such poor reference .
Parsing [sent. 14472 len. 36]: Mama , forgive me when I say that it was you who first presented to my mind the thought that anyone could wrong me , and wrong him , by such a cruel suspicion . '
Parsing [sent. 14473 len. 4]: ` Me ! '
Parsing [sent. 14474 len. 4]: cried Mrs. Markleham .
Parsing [sent. 14475 len. 4]: -LRB- ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 14476 len. 7]: You , to be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 14477 len. 19]: observed my aunt , ` and you ca n't fan it away , my military friend ! ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 14478 len. 15]: ` It was the first unhappiness of my new life , ' said Annie .
Parsing [sent. 14479 len. 14]: ` It was the first occasion of every unhappy moment I have known .
Parsing [sent. 14480 len. 21]: These moments have been more , of late , than I can count ; but not -- my generous husband !
Parsing [sent. 14481 len. 34]: -- not for the reason you suppose ; for in my heart there is not a thought , a recollection , or a hope , that any power could separate from you ! '
Parsing [sent. 14482 len. 24]: She raised her eyes , and clasped her hands , and looked as beautiful and true , I thought , as any Spirit .
Parsing [sent. 14483 len. 15]: The Doctor looked on her , henceforth , as steadfastly as she on him .
Parsing [sent. 14484 len. 122]: ` Mama is blameless , ' she went on , ` of having ever urged you for herself , and she is blameless in intention every way , I am sure , -- but when I saw how many importunate claims were pressed upon you in my name ; how you were traded on in my name ; how generous you were , and how Mr. Wickfield , who had your welfare very much at heart , resented it ; the first sense of my exposure to the mean suspicion that my tenderness was bought -- and sold to you , of all men on earth -- fell upon me like unmerited disgrace , in which I forced you to participate .
Parsing [sent. 14485 len. 50]: I can not tell you what it was -- mama can not imagine what it was -- to have this dread and trouble always on my mind , yet know in my own soul that on my marriage-day I crowned the love and honour of my life ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 14486 len. 25]: A specimen of the thanks one gets , ' cried Mrs. Markleham , in tears , ` for taking care of one 's family !
Parsing [sent. 14487 len. 8]: I wish I was a Turk ! '
Parsing [sent. 14488 len. 19]: -LRB- ' I wish you were , with all my heart -- and in your native country ! '
Parsing [sent. 14489 len. 5]: said my aunt . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 14490 len. 16]: ` It was at that time that mama was most solicitous about my Cousin Maldon .
Parsing [sent. 14491 len. 19]: I had liked him ' : she spoke softly , but without any hesitation : ` very much .
Parsing [sent. 14492 len. 7]: We had been little lovers once .
Parsing [sent. 14493 len. 31]: If circumstances had not happened otherwise , I might have come to persuade myself that I really loved him , and might have married him , and been most wretched .
Parsing [sent. 14494 len. 15]: There can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose . '
Parsing [sent. 14495 len. 34]: I pondered on those words , even while I was studiously attending to what followed , as if they had some particular interest , or some strange application that I could not divine .
Parsing [sent. 14496 len. 29]: ` There can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose ' -- ` no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose . '
Parsing [sent. 14497 len. 16]: ` There is nothing , ' said Annie , ` that we have in common .
Parsing [sent. 14498 len. 9]: I have long found that there is nothing .
Parsing [sent. 14499 len. 38]: If I were thankful to my husband for no more , instead of for so much , I should be thankful to him for having saved me from the first mistaken impulse of my undisciplined heart . '
Parsing [sent. 14500 len. 18]: She stood quite still , before the Doctor , and spoke with an earnestness that thrilled me .
Parsing [sent. 14501 len. 10]: Yet her voice was just as quiet as before .
Parsing [sent. 14502 len. 51]: ` When he was waiting to be the object of your munificence , so freely bestowed for my sake , and when I was unhappy in the mercenary shape I was made to wear , I thought it would have become him better to have worked his own way on .
Parsing [sent. 14503 len. 25]: I thought that if I had been he , I would have tried to do it , at the cost of almost any hardship .
Parsing [sent. 14504 len. 17]: But I thought no worse of him , until the night of his departure for India .
Parsing [sent. 14505 len. 12]: That night I knew he had a false and thankless heart .
Parsing [sent. 14506 len. 16]: I saw a double meaning , then , in Mr. Wickfield 's scrutiny of me .
Parsing [sent. 14507 len. 17]: I perceived , for the first time , the dark suspicion that shadowed my life . '
Parsing [sent. 14508 len. 6]: ` Suspicion , Annie ! '
Parsing [sent. 14509 len. 4]: said the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 14510 len. 8]: ` No , no , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 14511 len. 15]: ` In your mind there was none , I know , my husband ! '
Parsing [sent. 14512 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 14513 len. 92]: ` And when I came to you , that night , to lay down all my load of shame and grief , and knew that I had to tell that , underneath your roof , one of my own kindred , to whom you had been a benefactor , for the love of me , had spoken to me words that should have found no utterance , even if I had been the weak and mercenary wretch he thought me -- my mind revolted from the taint the very tale conveyed .
Parsing [sent. 14514 len. 18]: It died upon my lips , and from that hour till now has never passed them . '
Parsing [sent. 14515 len. 31]: Mrs. Markleham , with a short groan , leaned back in her easy-chair ; and retired behind her fan , as if she were never coming out any more . '
Parsing [sent. 14516 len. 33]: I have never , but in your presence , interchanged a word with him from that time ; then , only when it has been necessary for the avoidance of this explanation .
Parsing [sent. 14517 len. 16]: Years have passed since he knew , from me , what his situation here was .
Parsing [sent. 14518 len. 41]: The kindnesses you have secretly done for his advancement , and then disclosed to me , for my surprise and pleasure , have been , you will believe , but aggravations of the unhappiness and burden of my secret . '
Parsing [sent. 14519 len. 39]: She sunk down gently at the Doctor 's feet , though he did his utmost to prevent her ; and said , looking up , tearfully , into his face : ` Do not speak to me yet !
Parsing [sent. 14520 len. 7]: Let me say a little more !
Parsing [sent. 14521 len. 21]: Right or wrong , if this were to be done again , I think I should do just the same .
Parsing [sent. 14522 len. 49]: You never can know what it was to be devoted to you , with those old associations ; to find that anyone could be so hard as to suppose that the truth of my heart was bartered away , and to be surrounded by appearances confirming that belief .
Parsing [sent. 14523 len. 10]: I was very young , and had no adviser .
Parsing [sent. 14524 len. 17]: Between mama and me , in all relating to you , there was a wide division .
Parsing [sent. 14525 len. 33]: If I shrunk into myself , hiding the disrespect I had undergone , it was because I honoured you so much , and so much wished that you should honour me ! '
Parsing [sent. 14526 len. 8]: ` Annie , my pure heart ! '
Parsing [sent. 14527 len. 11]: said the Doctor , ` my dear girl ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 14528 len. 4]: A little more !
Parsing [sent. 14529 len. 6]: a very few words more !
Parsing [sent. 14530 len. 37]: I used to think there were so many whom you might have married , who would not have brought such charge and trouble on you , and who would have made your home a worthier home .
Parsing [sent. 14531 len. 19]: I used to be afraid that I had better have remained your pupil , and almost your child .
Parsing [sent. 14532 len. 15]: I used to fear that I was so unsuited to your learning and wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 14533 len. 43]: If all this made me shrink within myself -LRB- as indeed it did -RRB- , when I had that to tell , it was still because I honoured you so much , and hoped that you might one day honour me . '
Parsing [sent. 14534 len. 28]: ` That day has shone this long time , Annie , ' said the Doctor , and can have but one long night , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 14535 len. 4]: ` Another word !
Parsing [sent. 14536 len. 31]: I afterwards meant -- steadfastly meant , and purposed to myself -- to bear the whole weight of knowing the unworthiness of one to whom you had been so good .
Parsing [sent. 14537 len. 12]: And now a last word , dearest and best of friends !
Parsing [sent. 14538 len. 74]: The cause of the late change in you , which I have seen with so much pain and sorrow , and have sometimes referred to my old apprehension -- at other times to lingering suppositions nearer to the truth -- has been made clear tonight ; and by an accident I have also come to know , tonight , the full measure of your noble trust in me , even under that mistake .
Parsing [sent. 14539 len. 94]: I do not hope that any love and duty I may render in return , will ever make me worthy of your priceless confidence ; but with all this knowledge fresh upon me , I can lift my eyes to this dear face , revered as a father 's , loved as a husband 's , sacred to me in my childhood as a friend 's , and solemnly declare that in my lightest thought I have never wronged you ; never wavered in the love and the fidelity I owe you ! '
Parsing [sent. 14540 len. 29]: She had her arms around the Doctor 's neck , and he leant his head down over her , mingling his grey hair with her dark brown tresses .
Parsing [sent. 14541 len. 12]: ` Oh , hold me to your heart , my husband !
Parsing [sent. 14542 len. 5]: Never cast me out !
Parsing [sent. 14543 len. 22]: Do not think or speak of disparity between us , for there is none , except in all my many imperfections .
Parsing [sent. 14544 len. 18]: Every succeeding year I have known this better , as I have esteemed you more and more .
Parsing [sent. 14545 len. 25]: Oh , take me to your heart , my husband , for my love was founded on a rock , and it endures ! '
Parsing [sent. 14546 len. 31]: In the silence that ensued , my aunt walked gravely up to Mr. Dick , without at all hurrying herself , and gave him a hug and a sounding kiss .
Parsing [sent. 14547 len. 48]: And it was very fortunate , with a view to his credit , that she did so ; for I am confident that I detected him at that moment in the act of making preparations to stand on one leg , as an appropriate expression of delight .
Parsing [sent. 14548 len. 11]: ` You are a very remarkable man , Dick ! '
Parsing [sent. 14549 len. 26]: said my aunt , with an air of unqualified approbation ; ` and never pretend to be anything else , for I know better ! '
Parsing [sent. 14550 len. 30]: With that , my aunt pulled him by the sleeve , and nodded to me ; and we three stole quietly out of the room , and came away .
Parsing [sent. 14551 len. 25]: ` That 's a settler for our military friend , at any rate , ' said my aunt , on the way home . '
Parsing [sent. 14552 len. 19]: I should sleep the better for that , if there was nothing else to be glad of ! '
Parsing [sent. 14553 len. 19]: ` She was quite overcome , I am afraid , ' said Mr. Dick , with great commiseration .
Parsing [sent. 14554 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 14555 len. 9]: Did you ever see a crocodile overcome ? '
Parsing [sent. 14556 len. 5]: inquired my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 14557 len. 17]: I do n't think I ever saw a crocodile , ' returned Mr. Dick , mildly .
Parsing [sent. 14558 len. 29]: ` There never would have been anything the matter , if it had n't been for that old Animal , ' said my aunt , with strong emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 14559 len. 26]: ` It 's very much to be wished that some mothers would leave their daughters alone after marriage , and not be so violently affectionate .
Parsing [sent. 14560 len. 40]: They seem to think the only return that can be made them for bringing an unfortunate young woman into the world -- God bless my soul , as if she asked to be brought , or wanted to come !
Parsing [sent. 14561 len. 12]: -- is full liberty to worry her out of it again .
Parsing [sent. 14562 len. 9]: What are you thinking of , Trot ? '
Parsing [sent. 14563 len. 10]: I was thinking of all that had been said .
Parsing [sent. 14564 len. 12]: My mind was still running on some of the expressions used .
Parsing [sent. 14565 len. 16]: ` There can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose . '
Parsing [sent. 14566 len. 11]: ` The first mistaken impulse of an undisciplined heart . '
Parsing [sent. 14567 len. 10]: ` My love was founded on a rock . '
Parsing [sent. 14568 len. 21]: But we were at home ; and the trodden leaves were lying under-foot , and the autumn wind was blowing .
Parsing [sent. 14569 len. 81]: Chapter 46 Intelligence I must have been married , if I may trust to my imperfect memory for dates , about a year or so , when one evening , as I was returning from a solitary walk , thinking of the book I was then writing -- for my success had steadily increased with my steady application , and I was engaged at that time upon my first work of fiction -- I came past Mrs. Steerforth 's house .
Parsing [sent. 14570 len. 23]: I had often passed it before , during my residence in that neighbourhood , though never when I could choose another road .
Parsing [sent. 14571 len. 36]: Howbeit , it did sometimes happen that it was not easy to find another , without making a long circuit ; and so I had passed that way , upon the whole , pretty often .
Parsing [sent. 14572 len. 20]: I had never done more than glance at the house , as I went by with a quickened step .
Parsing [sent. 14573 len. 8]: It had been uniformly gloomy and dull .
Parsing [sent. 14574 len. 39]: None of the best rooms abutted on the road ; and the narrow , heavily-framed old-fashioned windows , never cheerful under any circumstances , looked very dismal , close shut , and with their blinds always drawn down .
Parsing [sent. 14575 len. 51]: There was a covered way across a little paved court , to an entrance that was never used ; and there was one round staircase window , at odds with all the rest , and the only one unshaded by a blind , which had the same unoccupied blank look .
Parsing [sent. 14576 len. 15]: I do not remember that I ever saw a light in all the house .
Parsing [sent. 14577 len. 22]: If I had been a casual passer-by , I should have probably supposed that some childless person lay dead in it .
Parsing [sent. 14578 len. 36]: If I had happily possessed no knowledge of the place , and had seen it often in that changeless state , I should have pleased my fancy with many ingenious speculations , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 14579 len. 14]: As it was , I thought as little of it as I might .
Parsing [sent. 14580 len. 27]: But my mind could not go by it and leave it , as my body did ; and it usually awakened a long train of meditations .
Parsing [sent. 14581 len. 63]: Coming before me , on this particular evening that I mention , mingled with the childish recollections and later fancies , the ghosts of half-formed hopes , the broken shadows of disappointments dimly seen and understood , the blending of experience and imagination , incidental to the occupation with which my thoughts had been busy , it was more than commonly suggestive .
Parsing [sent. 14582 len. 21]: I fell into a brown study as I walked on , and a voice at my side made me start .
Parsing [sent. 14583 len. 9]: It was a woman 's voice , too .
Parsing [sent. 14584 len. 22]: I was not long in recollecting Mrs. Steerforth 's little parlour-maid , who had formerly worn blue ribbons in her cap .
Parsing [sent. 14585 len. 34]: She had taken them out now , to adapt herself , I suppose , to the altered character of the house ; and wore but one or two disconsolate bows of sober brown .
Parsing [sent. 14586 len. 23]: ` If you please , sir , would you have the goodness to walk in , and speak to Miss Dartle ? '
Parsing [sent. 14587 len. 10]: ` Has Miss Dartle sent you for me ? '
Parsing [sent. 14588 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 14589 len. 13]: ` Not tonight , sir , but it 's just the same .
Parsing [sent. 14590 len. 42]: Miss Dartle saw you pass a night or two ago ; and I was to sit at work on the staircase , and when I saw you pass again , to ask you to step in and speak to her . '
Parsing [sent. 14591 len. 20]: I turned back , and inquired of my conductor , as we went along , how Mrs. Steerforth was .
Parsing [sent. 14592 len. 17]: She said her lady was but poorly , and kept her own room a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 14593 len. 28]: When we arrived at the house , I was directed to Miss Dartle in the garden , and left to make my presence known to her myself .
Parsing [sent. 14594 len. 20]: She was sitting on a seat at one end of a kind of terrace , overlooking the great city .
Parsing [sent. 14595 len. 54]: It was a sombre evening , with a lurid light in the sky ; and as I saw the prospect scowling in the distance , with here and there some larger object starting up into the sullen glare , I fancied it was no inapt companion to the memory of this fierce woman .
Parsing [sent. 14596 len. 16]: She saw me as I advanced , and rose for a moment to receive me .
Parsing [sent. 14597 len. 31]: I thought her , then , still more colourless and thin than when I had seen her last ; the flashing eyes still brighter , and the scar still plainer .
Parsing [sent. 14598 len. 6]: Our meeting was not cordial .
Parsing [sent. 14599 len. 28]: We had parted angrily on the last occasion ; and there was an air of disdain about her , which she took no pains to conceal . '
Parsing [sent. 14600 len. 41]: I am told you wish to speak to me , Miss Dartle , ' said I , standing near her , with my hand upon the back of the seat , and declining her gesture of invitation to sit down .
Parsing [sent. 14601 len. 9]: ` If you please , ' said she .
Parsing [sent. 14602 len. 9]: ` Pray has this girl been found ? '
Parsing [sent. 14603 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 14604 len. 9]: ` And yet she has run away ! '
Parsing [sent. 14605 len. 23]: I saw her thin lips working while she looked at me , as if they were eager to load her with reproaches .
Parsing [sent. 14606 len. 5]: ` Run away ? '
Parsing [sent. 14607 len. 3]: I repeated .
Parsing [sent. 14608 len. 3]: ` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 14609 len. 11]: From him , ' she said , with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 14610 len. 14]: ` If she is not found , perhaps she never will be found .
Parsing [sent. 14611 len. 6]: She may be dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 14612 len. 24]: The vaunting cruelty with which she met my glance , I never saw expressed in any other face that ever I have seen .
Parsing [sent. 14613 len. 27]: ` To wish her dead , ' said I , ` may be the kindest wish that one of her own sex could bestow upon her .
Parsing [sent. 14614 len. 15]: I am glad that time has softened you so much , Miss Dartle . '
Parsing [sent. 14615 len. 34]: She condescended to make no reply , but , turning on me with another scornful laugh , said : ` The friends of this excellent and much-injured young lady are friends of yours .
Parsing [sent. 14616 len. 10]: You are their champion , and assert their rights .
Parsing [sent. 14617 len. 12]: Do you wish to know what is known of her ? '
Parsing [sent. 14618 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' said I .
Parsing [sent. 14619 len. 42]: She rose with an ill-favoured smile , and taking a few steps towards a wall of holly that was near at hand , dividing the lawn from a kitchen-garden , said , in a louder voice , ` Come here ! '
Parsing [sent. 14620 len. 11]: -- as if she were calling to some unclean beast .
Parsing [sent. 14621 len. 20]: ` You will restrain any demonstrative championship or vengeance in this place , of course , Mr. Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 14622 len. 14]: said she , looking over her shoulder at me with the same expression .
Parsing [sent. 14623 len. 20]: I inclined my head , without knowing what she meant ; and she said , ` Come here ! '
Parsing [sent. 14624 len. 31]: again ; and returned , followed by the respectable Mr. Littimer , who , with undiminished respectability , made me a bow , and took up his position behind her .
Parsing [sent. 14625 len. 49]: The air of wicked grace : of triumph , in which , strange to say , there was yet something feminine and alluring : with which she reclined upon the seat between us , and looked at me , was worthy of a cruel Princess in a Legend .
Parsing [sent. 14626 len. 35]: ` Now , ' said she , imperiously , without glancing at him , and touching the old wound as it throbbed : perhaps , in this instance , with pleasure rather than pain .
Parsing [sent. 14627 len. 9]: ` Tell Mr. Copperfield about the flight . '
Parsing [sent. 14628 len. 18]: ` Mr. James and myself , ma'am -- ' ` Do n't address yourself to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 14629 len. 6]: she interrupted with a frown .
Parsing [sent. 14630 len. 22]: ` Mr. James and myself , sir -- ' ` Nor to me , if you please , ' said I .
Parsing [sent. 14631 len. 33]: Mr. Littimer , without being at all discomposed , signified by a slight obeisance , that anything that was most agreeable to us was most agreeable to him ; and began again .
Parsing [sent. 14632 len. 24]: ` Mr. James and myself have been abroad with the young woman , ever since she left Yarmouth under Mr. james 's protection .
Parsing [sent. 14633 len. 17]: We have been in a variety of places , and seen a deal of foreign country .
Parsing [sent. 14634 len. 18]: We have been in France , Switzerland , Italy , in fact , almost all parts . '
Parsing [sent. 14635 len. 38]: He looked at the back of the seat , as if he were addressing himself to that ; and softly played upon it with his hands , as if he were striking chords upon a dumb piano .
Parsing [sent. 14636 len. 37]: ` Mr. James took quite uncommonly to the young woman ; and was more settled , for a length of time , than I have known him to be since I have been in his service .
Parsing [sent. 14637 len. 23]: The young woman was very improvable , and spoke the languages ; and would n't have been known for the same country-person .
Parsing [sent. 14638 len. 12]: I noticed that she was much admired wherever we went . '
Parsing [sent. 14639 len. 9]: Miss Dartle put her hand upon her side .
Parsing [sent. 14640 len. 15]: I saw him steal a glance at her , and slightly smile to himself .
Parsing [sent. 14641 len. 12]: ` Very much admired , indeed , the young woman was .
Parsing [sent. 14642 len. 38]: What with her dress ; what with the air and sun ; what with being made so much of ; what with this , that , and the other ; her merits really attracted general notice . '
Parsing [sent. 14643 len. 6]: He made a short pause .
Parsing [sent. 14644 len. 21]: Her eyes wandered restlessly over the distant prospect , and she bit her nether lip to stop that busy mouth .
Parsing [sent. 14645 len. 98]: Taking his hands from the seat , and placing one of them within the other , as he settled himself on one leg , Mr. Littimer proceeded , with his eyes cast down , and his respectable head a little advanced , and a little on one side : ` The young woman went on in this manner for some time , being occasionally low in her spirits , until I think she began to weary Mr. James by giving way to her low spirits and tempers of that kind ; and things were not so comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 14646 len. 9]: Mr. James he began to be restless again .
Parsing [sent. 14647 len. 33]: The more restless he got , the worse she got ; and I must say , for myself , that I had a very difficult time of it indeed between the two .
Parsing [sent. 14648 len. 36]: Still matters were patched up here , and made good there , over and over again ; and altogether lasted , I am sure , for a longer time than anybody could have expected . '
Parsing [sent. 14649 len. 19]: Recalling her eyes from the distance , she looked at me again now , with her former air .
Parsing [sent. 14650 len. 122]: Mr. Littimer , clearing his throat behind his hand with a respectable short cough , changed legs , and went on : ` At last , when there had been , upon the whole , a good many words and reproaches , Mr. James he set off one morning , from the neighbourhood of Naples , where we had a villa -LRB- the young woman being very partial to the sea -RRB- , and , under pretence of coming back in a day or so , left it in charge with me to break it out , that , for the general happiness of all concerned , he was ' -- here an interruption of the short cough -- ` gone .
Parsing [sent. 14651 len. 67]: But Mr. James , I must say , certainly did behave extremely honourable ; for he proposed that the young woman should marry a very respectable person , who was fully prepared to overlook the past , and who was , at least , as good as anybody the young woman could have aspired to in a regular way : her connexions being very common . '
Parsing [sent. 14652 len. 10]: He changed legs again , and wetted his lips .
Parsing [sent. 14653 len. 22]: I was convinced that the scoundrel spoke of himself , and I saw my conviction reflected in Miss Dartle 's face .
Parsing [sent. 14654 len. 11]: ` This I also had it in charge to communicate .
Parsing [sent. 14655 len. 34]: I was willing to do anything to relieve Mr. James from his difficulty , and to restore harmony between himself and an affectionate parent , who has undergone so much on his account .
Parsing [sent. 14656 len. 6]: Therefore I undertook the commission .
Parsing [sent. 14657 len. 24]: The young woman 's violence when she came to , after I broke the fact of his departure , was beyond all expectations .
Parsing [sent. 14658 len. 43]: She was quite mad , and had to be held by force ; or , if she could n't have got to a knife , or got to the sea , she 'd have beaten her head against the marble floor . '
Parsing [sent. 14659 len. 29]: Miss Dartle , leaning back upon the seat , with a light of exultation in her face , seemed almost to caress the sounds this fellow had uttered .
Parsing [sent. 14660 len. 58]: ` But when I came to the second part of what had been entrusted to me , ' said Mr. Littimer , rubbing his hands uneasily , ` which anybody might have supposed would have been , at all events , appreciated as a kind intention , then the young woman came out in her true colours .
Parsing [sent. 14661 len. 9]: A more outrageous person I never did see .
Parsing [sent. 14662 len. 6]: Her conduct was surprisingly bad .
Parsing [sent. 14663 len. 27]: She had no more gratitude , no more feeling , no more patience , no more reason in her , than a stock or a stone .
Parsing [sent. 14664 len. 21]: If I had n't been upon my guard , I am convinced she would have had my blood . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14665 len. 15]: I think the better of her for it , ' said I , indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 14666 len. 17]: Mr. Littimer bent his head , as much as to say , ` Indeed , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 14667 len. 6]: But you 're young ! '
Parsing [sent. 14668 len. 5]: and resumed his narrative .
Parsing [sent. 14669 len. 40]: ` It was necessary , in short , for a time , to take away everything nigh her , that she could do herself , or anybody else , an injury with , and to shut her up close .
Parsing [sent. 14670 len. 49]: Notwithstanding which , she got out in the night ; forced the lattice of a window , that I had nailed up myself ; dropped on a vine that was trailed below ; and never has been seen or heard of , to my knowledge , since . '
Parsing [sent. 14671 len. 29]: ` She is dead , perhaps , ' said Miss Dartle , with a smile , as if she could have spurned the body of the ruined girl .
Parsing [sent. 14672 len. 24]: ` She may have drowned herself , miss , ' returned Mr. Littimer , catching at an excuse for addressing himself to somebody .
Parsing [sent. 14673 len. 6]: ` It 's very possible .
Parsing [sent. 14674 len. 19]: Or , she may have had assistance from the boatmen , and the boatmen 's wives and children .
Parsing [sent. 14675 len. 30]: Being given to low company , she was very much in the habit of talking to them on the beach , Miss Dartle , and sitting by their boats .
Parsing [sent. 14676 len. 17]: I have known her do it , when Mr. James has been away , whole days .
Parsing [sent. 14677 len. 46]: Mr. James was far from pleased to find out , once , that she had told the children she was a boatman 's daughter , and that in her own country , long ago , she had roamed about the beach , like them . '
Parsing [sent. 14678 len. 4]: Oh , Emily !
Parsing [sent. 14679 len. 3]: Unhappy beauty !
Parsing [sent. 14680 len. 61]: What a picture rose before me of her sitting on the far-off shore , among the children like herself when she was innocent , listening to little voices such as might have called her Mother had she been a poor man 's wife ; and to the great voice of the sea , with its eternal ` Never more ! '
Parsing [sent. 14681 len. 27]: ` When it was clear that nothing could be done , Miss Dartle -- ' ` Did I tell you not to speak to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 14682 len. 7]: she said , with stern contempt .
Parsing [sent. 14683 len. 13]: ` You spoke to me , miss , ' he replied . '
Parsing [sent. 14684 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 14685 len. 9]: But it is my service to obey . '
Parsing [sent. 14686 len. 9]: ` Do your service , ' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 14687 len. 9]: ` Finish your story , and go ! '
Parsing [sent. 14688 len. 56]: ` When it was clear , ' he said , with infinite respectability and an obedient bow , ` that she was not to be found , I went to Mr. James , at the place where it had been agreed that I should write to him , and informed him of what had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 14689 len. 19]: Words passed between us in consequence , and I felt it due to my character to leave him .
Parsing [sent. 14690 len. 23]: I could bear , and I have borne , a great deal from Mr. James ; but he insulted me too far .
Parsing [sent. 14691 len. 4]: He hurt me .
Parsing [sent. 14692 len. 50]: Knowing the unfortunate difference between himself and his mother , and what her anxiety of mind was likely to be , I took the liberty of coming home to England , and relating -- ' ` For money which I paid him , ' said Miss Dartle to me .
Parsing [sent. 14693 len. 12]: ` Just so , ma'am -- and relating what I knew .
Parsing [sent. 14694 len. 23]: I am not aware , ' said Mr. Littimer , after a moment 's reflection , ` that there is anything else .
Parsing [sent. 14695 len. 20]: I am at present out of employment , and should be happy to meet with a respectable situation . '
Parsing [sent. 14696 len. 21]: Miss Dartle glanced at me , as though she would inquire if there were anything that I desired to ask .
Parsing [sent. 14697 len. 64]: As there was something which had occurred to my mind , I said in reply : ' I could wish to know from this -- creature , ' I could not bring myself to utter any more conciliatory word , ` whether they intercepted a letter that was written to her from home , or whether he supposes that she received it . '
Parsing [sent. 14698 len. 36]: He remained calm and silent , with his eyes fixed on the ground , and the tip of every finger of his right hand delicately poised against the tip of every finger of his left .
Parsing [sent. 14699 len. 10]: Miss Dartle turned her head disdainfully towards him . '
Parsing [sent. 14700 len. 33]: I beg your pardon , miss , ' he said , awakening from his abstraction , ` but , however submissive to you , I have my position , though a servant .
Parsing [sent. 14701 len. 11]: Mr. Copperfield and you , miss , are different people .
Parsing [sent. 14702 len. 27]: If Mr. Copperfield wishes to know anything from me , I take the liberty of reminding Mr. Copperfield that he can put a question to me .
Parsing [sent. 14703 len. 8]: I have a character to maintain . '
Parsing [sent. 14704 len. 24]: After a momentary struggle with myself , I turned my eyes upon him , and said , ` You have heard my question .
Parsing [sent. 14705 len. 10]: Consider it addressed to yourself , if you choose .
Parsing [sent. 14706 len. 7]: What answer do you make ? '
Parsing [sent. 14707 len. 49]: ` Sir , ' he rejoined , with an occasional separation and reunion of those delicate tips , ` my answer must be qualified ; because , to betray Mr. james 's confidence to his mother , and to betray it to you , are two different actions .
Parsing [sent. 14708 len. 40]: It is not probable , I consider , that Mr. James would encourage the receipt of letters likely to increase low spirits and unpleasantness ; but further than that , sir , I should wish to avoid going . '
Parsing [sent. 14709 len. 6]: ` Is that all ? '
Parsing [sent. 14710 len. 6]: inquired Miss Dartle of me .
Parsing [sent. 14711 len. 10]: I indicated that I had nothing more to say .
Parsing [sent. 14712 len. 62]: ` Except , ' I added , as I saw him moving off , ` that I understand this fellow 's part in the wicked story , and that , as I shall make it known to the honest man who has been her father from her childhood , I would recommend him to avoid going too much into public . '
Parsing [sent. 14713 len. 18]: He had stopped the moment I began , and had listened with his usual repose of manner .
Parsing [sent. 14714 len. 6]: ` Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14715 len. 37]: But you 'll excuse me if I say , sir , that there are neither slaves nor slave-drivers in this country , and that people are not allowed to take the law into their own hands .
Parsing [sent. 14716 len. 21]: If they do , it is more to their own peril , I believe , than to other people 's .
Parsing [sent. 14717 len. 19]: Consequently speaking , I am not at all afraid of going wherever I may wish , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 14718 len. 33]: With that , he made a polite bow ; and , with another to Miss Dartle , went away through the arch in the wall of holly by which he had come .
Parsing [sent. 14719 len. 29]: Miss Dartle and I regarded each other for a little while in silence ; her manner being exactly what it was , when she had produced the man .
Parsing [sent. 14720 len. 46]: ` He says besides , ' she observed , with a slow curling of her lip , ` that his master , as he hears , is coasting Spain ; and this done , is away to gratify his seafaring tastes till he is weary .
Parsing [sent. 14721 len. 9]: But this is of no interest to you .
Parsing [sent. 14722 len. 41]: Between these two proud persons , mother and son , there is a wider breach than before , and little hope of its healing , for they are one at heart , and time makes each more obstinate and imperious .
Parsing [sent. 14723 len. 18]: Neither is this of any interest to you ; but it introduces what I wish to say .
Parsing [sent. 14724 len. 9]: This devil whom you make an angel of .
Parsing [sent. 14725 len. 45]: I mean this low girl whom he picked out of the tide-mud , ' with her black eyes full upon me , and her passionate finger up , ` may be alive , -- for I believe some common things are hard to die .
Parsing [sent. 14726 len. 20]: If she is , you will desire to have a pearl of such price found and taken care of .
Parsing [sent. 14727 len. 19]: We desire that , too ; that he may not by any chance be made her prey again .
Parsing [sent. 14728 len. 44]: So far , we are united in one interest ; and that is why I , who would do her any mischief that so coarse a wretch is capable of feeling , have sent for you to hear what you have heard . '
Parsing [sent. 14729 len. 17]: I saw , by the change in her face , that someone was advancing behind me .
Parsing [sent. 14730 len. 52]: It was Mrs. Steerforth , who gave me her hand more coldly than of yore , and with an augmentation of her former stateliness of manner , but still , I perceived -- and I was touched by it -- with an ineffaceable remembrance of my old love for her son .
Parsing [sent. 14731 len. 5]: She was greatly altered .
Parsing [sent. 14732 len. 22]: Her fine figure was far less upright , her handsome face was deeply marked , and her hair was almost white .
Parsing [sent. 14733 len. 40]: But when she sat down on the seat , she was a handsome lady still ; and well I knew the bright eye with its lofty look , that had been a light in my very dreams at school .
Parsing [sent. 14734 len. 11]: ` Is Mr. Copperfield informed of everything , Rosa ? '
Parsing [sent. 14735 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 14736 len. 9]: ` And has he heard Littimer himself ? '
Parsing [sent. 14737 len. 13]: ` Yes ; I have told him why you wished it . '
Parsing [sent. 14738 len. 7]: ` You are a good girl .
Parsing [sent. 14739 len. 31]: I have had some slight correspondence with your former friend , sir , ' addressing me , ` but it has not restored his sense of duty or natural obligation .
Parsing [sent. 14740 len. 15]: Therefore I have no other object in this , than what Rosa has mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 14741 len. 50]: If , by the course which may relieve the mind of the decent man you brought here -LRB- for whom I am sorry -- I can say no more -RRB- , my son may be saved from again falling into the snares of a designing enemy , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 14742 len. 15]: She drew herself up , and sat looking straight before her , far away .
Parsing [sent. 14743 len. 12]: ` Madam , ' I said respectfully , ' I understand .
Parsing [sent. 14744 len. 17]: I assure you I am in no danger of putting any strained construction on your motives .
Parsing [sent. 14745 len. 62]: But I must say , even to you , having known this injured family from childhood , that if you suppose the girl , so deeply wronged , has not been cruelly deluded , and would not rather die a hundred deaths than take a cup of water from your son 's hand now , you cherish a terrible mistake . '
Parsing [sent. 14746 len. 8]: ` Well , Rosa , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 14747 len. 18]: said Mrs. Steerforth , as the other was about to interpose , ` it is no matter .
Parsing [sent. 14748 len. 4]: Let it be .
Parsing [sent. 14749 len. 11]: You are married , sir , I am told ? '
Parsing [sent. 14750 len. 10]: I answered that I had been some time married .
Parsing [sent. 14751 len. 6]: ` And are doing well ?
Parsing [sent. 14752 len. 22]: I hear little in the quiet life I lead , but I understand you are beginning to be famous . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14753 len. 21]: I have been very fortunate , ' I said , ` and find my name connected with some praise . '
Parsing [sent. 14754 len. 7]: ` You have no mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 14755 len. 6]: -- in a softened voice .
Parsing [sent. 14756 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 14757 len. 10]: ` It is a pity , ' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 14758 len. 9]: ` She would have been proud of you .
Parsing [sent. 14759 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 14760 len. 30]: I took the hand she held out with a dignified , unbending air , and it was as calm in mine as if her breast had been at peace .
Parsing [sent. 14761 len. 33]: Her pride could still its very pulses , it appeared , and draw the placid veil before her face , through which she sat looking straight before her on the far distance .
Parsing [sent. 14762 len. 34]: As I moved away from them along the terrace , I could not help observing how steadily they both sat gazing on the prospect , and how it thickened and closed around them .
Parsing [sent. 14763 len. 30]: Here and there , some early lamps were seen to twinkle in the distant city ; and in the eastern quarter of the sky the lurid light still hovered .
Parsing [sent. 14764 len. 39]: But , from the greater part of the broad valley interposed , a mist was rising like a sea , which , mingling with the darkness , made it seem as if the gathering waters would encompass them .
Parsing [sent. 14765 len. 32]: I have reason to remember this , and think of it with awe ; for before I looked upon those two again , a stormy sea had risen to their feet .
Parsing [sent. 14766 len. 22]: Reflecting on what had been thus told me , I felt it right that it should be communicated to Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 14767 len. 13]: On the following evening I went into London in quest of him .
Parsing [sent. 14768 len. 29]: He was always wandering about from place to place , with his one object of recovering his niece before him ; but was more in London than elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 14769 len. 42]: Often and often , now , had I seen him in the dead of night passing along the streets , searching , among the few who loitered out of doors at those untimely hours , for what he dreaded to find .
Parsing [sent. 14770 len. 38]: He kept a lodging over the little chandler 's shop in Hungerford Market , which I have had occasion to mention more than once , and from which he first went forth upon his errand of mercy .
Parsing [sent. 14771 len. 6]: Hither I directed my walk .
Parsing [sent. 14772 len. 32]: On making inquiry for him , I learned from the people of the house that he had not gone out yet , and I should find him in his room upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 14773 len. 15]: He was sitting reading by a window in which he kept a few plants .
Parsing [sent. 14774 len. 8]: The room was very neat and orderly .
Parsing [sent. 14775 len. 32]: I saw in a moment that it was always kept prepared for her reception , and that he never went out but he thought it possible he might bring her home .
Parsing [sent. 14776 len. 24]: He had not heard my tap at the door , and only raised his eyes when I laid my hand upon his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 14777 len. 6]: ` Mas ' r Davy !
Parsing [sent. 14778 len. 4]: Thankee , sir !
Parsing [sent. 14779 len. 7]: thankee hearty , for this visit !
Parsing [sent. 14780 len. 4]: Sit ye down .
Parsing [sent. 14781 len. 8]: You 're kindly welcome , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 14782 len. 21]: ` Mr. Peggotty , ' said I , taking the chair he handed me , ` do n't expect much !
Parsing [sent. 14783 len. 7]: I have heard some news . '
Parsing [sent. 14784 len. 7]: ` Of Em ` ly ! '
Parsing [sent. 14785 len. 26]: He put his hand , in a nervous manner , on his mouth , and turned pale , as he fixed his eyes on mine .
Parsing [sent. 14786 len. 18]: ` It gives no clue to where she is ; but she is not with him . '
Parsing [sent. 14787 len. 21]: He sat down , looking intently at me , and listened in profound silence to all I had to tell .
Parsing [sent. 14788 len. 44]: I well remember the sense of dignity , beauty even , with which the patient gravity of his face impressed me , when , having gradually removed his eyes from mine , he sat looking downward , leaning his forehead on his hand .
Parsing [sent. 14789 len. 11]: He offered no interruption , but remained throughout perfectly still .
Parsing [sent. 14790 len. 26]: He seemed to pursue her figure through the narrative , and to let every other shape go by him , as if it were nothing .
Parsing [sent. 14791 len. 14]: When I had done , he shaded his face , and continued silent .
Parsing [sent. 14792 len. 18]: I looked out of the window for a little while , and occupied myself with the plants .
Parsing [sent. 14793 len. 16]: ` How do you fare to feel about it , Mas ' r Davy ? '
Parsing [sent. 14794 len. 6]: he inquired at length . '
Parsing [sent. 14795 len. 12]: I think that she is living , ' I replied . '
Parsing [sent. 14796 len. 5]: I doe n't know .
Parsing [sent. 14797 len. 17]: Maybe the first shock was too rough , and in the wildness of her art -- !
Parsing [sent. 14798 len. 11]: That there blue water as she used to speak on .
Parsing [sent. 14799 len. 20]: Could she have thowt o ' that so many year , because it was to be her grave ! '
Parsing [sent. 14800 len. 20]: He said this , musing , in a low , frightened voice ; and walked across the little room .
Parsing [sent. 14801 len. 70]: ` And yet , ' he added , ` Mas ' r Davy , I have felt so sure as she was living -- I have know 'd , awake and sleeping , as it was so trew that I should find her -- I have been so led on by it , and held up by it - that I doe n't believe I can have been deceived .
Parsing [sent. 14802 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 14803 len. 7]: Em ` ly 's alive ! '
Parsing [sent. 14804 len. 20]: He put his hand down firmly on the table , and set his sunburnt face into a resolute expression .
Parsing [sent. 14805 len. 14]: ` My niece , Em ` ly , is alive , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 14806 len. 6]: he said , steadfastly . '
Parsing [sent. 14807 len. 24]: I doe n't know wheer it comes from , or how 't is , but I am told as she 's alive ! '
Parsing [sent. 14808 len. 13]: He looked almost like a man inspired , as he said it .
Parsing [sent. 14809 len. 41]: I waited for a few moments , until he could give me his undivided attention ; and then proceeded to explain the precaution , that , it had occurred to me last night , it would be wise to take .
Parsing [sent. 14810 len. 11]: ` Now , my dear friend -- ' I began .
Parsing [sent. 14811 len. 20]: ` Thankee , thankee , kind sir , ' he said , grasping my hand in both of his .
Parsing [sent. 14812 len. 49]: ` If she should make her way to London , which is likely -- for where could she lose herself so readily as in this vast city ; and what would she wish to do , but lose and hide herself , if she does not go home ?
Parsing [sent. 14813 len. 19]: -- ' ` And she wo n't go home , ' he interposed , shaking his head mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 14814 len. 21]: ` If she had left of her own accord , she might ; not as It was , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 14815 len. 33]: ` If she should come here , ' said I , ' I believe there is one person , here , more likely to discover her than any other in the world .
Parsing [sent. 14816 len. 18]: Do you remember -- hear what I say , with fortitude -- think of your great object !
Parsing [sent. 14817 len. 7]: -- do you remember Martha ? '
Parsing [sent. 14818 len. 6]: ` Of our town ? '
Parsing [sent. 14819 len. 9]: I needed no other answer than his face .
Parsing [sent. 14820 len. 12]: ` Do you know that she is in London ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 14821 len. 16]: I have seen her in the streets , ' he answered , with a shiver .
Parsing [sent. 14822 len. 31]: ` But you do n't know , ' said I , ` that Emily was charitable to her , with Ham 's help , long before she fled from home .
Parsing [sent. 14823 len. 29]: Nor , that , when we met one night , and spoke together in the room yonder , over the way , she listened at the door . '
Parsing [sent. 14824 len. 7]: ` Mas ' r Davy ! '
Parsing [sent. 14825 len. 5]: he replied in astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 14826 len. 10]: ` That night when it snew so hard ? '
Parsing [sent. 14827 len. 4]: ` That night .
Parsing [sent. 14828 len. 7]: I have never seen her since .
Parsing [sent. 14829 len. 19]: I went back , after parting from you , to speak to her , but she was gone .
Parsing [sent. 14830 len. 34]: I was unwilling to mention her to you then , and I am now ; but she is the person of whom I speak , and with whom I think we should communicate .
Parsing [sent. 14831 len. 5]: Do you understand ? '
Parsing [sent. 14832 len. 10]: ` Too well , sir , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 14833 len. 19]: We had sunk our voices , almost to a whisper , and continued to speak in that tone .
Parsing [sent. 14834 len. 8]: ` You say you have seen her .
Parsing [sent. 14835 len. 9]: Do you think that you could find her ?
Parsing [sent. 14836 len. 12]: I could only hope to do so by chance . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14837 len. 15]: I think , Mas ' r Davy , I know wheer to look . '
Parsing [sent. 14838 len. 5]: ` It is dark .
Parsing [sent. 14839 len. 17]: Being together , shall we go out now , and try to find her tonight ? '
Parsing [sent. 14840 len. 9]: He assented , and prepared to accompany me .
Parsing [sent. 14841 len. 74]: Without appearing to observe what he was doing , I saw how carefully he adjusted the little room , put a candle ready and the means of lighting it , arranged the bed , and finally took out of a drawer one of her dresses -LRB- I remember to have seen her wear it -RRB- , neatly folded with some other garments , and a bonnet , which he placed upon a chair .
Parsing [sent. 14842 len. 12]: He made no allusion to these clothes , neither did I .
Parsing [sent. 14843 len. 17]: There they had been waiting for her , many and many a night , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 14844 len. 42]: ` The time was , Mas ' r Davy , ' he said , as we came downstairs , ` when I thowt this girl , Martha , a ` most like the dirt underneath my Em ` ly 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 14845 len. 11]: God forgive me , theer 's a difference now ! '
Parsing [sent. 14846 len. 24]: As we went along , partly to hold him in conversation , and partly to satisfy myself , I asked him about Ham .
Parsing [sent. 14847 len. 42]: He said , almost in the same words as formerly , that Ham was just the same , ` wearing away his life with kiender no care nohow for ` t ; but never murmuring , and liked by all ' .
Parsing [sent. 14848 len. 22]: I asked him what he thought Ham 's state of mind was , in reference to the cause of their misfortunes ?
Parsing [sent. 14849 len. 7]: Whether he believed it was dangerous ?
Parsing [sent. 14850 len. 20]: What he supposed , for example , Ham would do , if he and Steerforth ever should encounter ? '
Parsing [sent. 14851 len. 12]: I doe n't know , sir , ' he replied . '
Parsing [sent. 14852 len. 20]: I have thowt of it oftentimes , but I ca n't awize myself of it , no matters . '
Parsing [sent. 14853 len. 20]: I recalled to his remembrance the morning after her departure , when we were all three on the beach .
Parsing [sent. 14854 len. 33]: ` Do you recollect , ' said I , ' a certain wild way in which he looked out to sea , and spoke about `` the end of it '' ? '
Parsing [sent. 14855 len. 6]: ` Sure I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 14856 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 14857 len. 9]: ` What do you suppose he meant ? '
Parsing [sent. 14858 len. 30]: ` Mas ' r Davy , ' he replied , ` I 've put the question to myself a mort o ' times , and never found no answer .
Parsing [sent. 14859 len. 32]: And theer 's one curious thing - that , though he is so pleasant , I would n't fare to feel comfortable to try and get his mind upon ` t .
Parsing [sent. 14860 len. 50]: He never said a wured to me as war n't as dootiful as dootiful could be , and it ai n't likely as he 'd begin to speak any other ways now ; but it 's fur from being fleet water in his mind , where them thowts lays .
Parsing [sent. 14861 len. 14]: It 's deep , sir , and I ca n't see down . '
Parsing [sent. 14862 len. 19]: ` You are right , ' said I , ` and that has sometimes made me anxious . '
Parsing [sent. 14863 len. 14]: ` And me too , Mas ' r Davy , ' he rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 14864 len. 24]: ` Even more so , I do assure you , than his ventersome ways , though both belongs to the alteration in him .
Parsing [sent. 14865 len. 25]: I doe n't know as he 'd do violence under any circumstances , but I hope as them two may be kep asunders . '
Parsing [sent. 14866 len. 12]: We had come , through Temple Bar , into the city .
Parsing [sent. 14867 len. 46]: Conversing no more now , and walking at my side , he yielded himself up to the one aim of his devoted life , and went on , with that hushed concentration of his faculties which would have made his figure solitary in a multitude .
Parsing [sent. 14868 len. 29]: We were not far from Blackfriars Bridge , when he turned his head and pointed to a solitary female figure flitting along the opposite side of the street .
Parsing [sent. 14869 len. 14]: I knew it , readily , to be the figure that we sought .
Parsing [sent. 14870 len. 57]: We crossed the road , and were pressing on towards her , when it occurred to me that she might be more disposed to feel a woman 's interest in the lost girl , if we spoke to her in a quieter place , aloof from the crowd , and where we should be less observed .
Parsing [sent. 14871 len. 37]: I advised my companion , therefore , that we should not address her yet , but follow her ; consulting in this , likewise , an indistinct desire I had , to know where she went .
Parsing [sent. 14872 len. 29]: He acquiescing , we followed at a distance : never losing sight of her , but never caring to come very near , as she frequently looked about .
Parsing [sent. 14873 len. 18]: Once , she stopped to listen to a band of music ; and then we stopped too .
Parsing [sent. 14874 len. 7]: She went on a long way .
Parsing [sent. 14875 len. 5]: Still we went on .
Parsing [sent. 14876 len. 58]: It was evident , from the manner in which she held her course , that she was going to some fixed destination ; and this , and her keeping in the busy streets , and I suppose the strange fascination in the secrecy and mystery of so following anyone , made me adhere to my first purpose .
Parsing [sent. 14877 len. 43]: At length she turned into a dull , dark street , where the noise and crowd were lost ; and I said , ` We may speak to her now ' ; and , mending our pace , we went after her .
Parsing [sent. 14878 len. 10]: Chapter 47 Martha We were now down in Westminster .
Parsing [sent. 14879 len. 35]: We had turned back to follow her , having encountered her coming towards us ; and Westminster Abbey was the point at which she passed from the lights and noise of the leading streets .
Parsing [sent. 14880 len. 54]: She proceeded so quickly , when she got free of the two currents of passengers setting towards and from the bridge , that , between this and the advance she had of us when she struck off , we were in the narrow water-side street by Millbank before we came up with her .
Parsing [sent. 14881 len. 33]: At that moment she crossed the road , as if to avoid the footsteps that she heard so close behind ; and , without looking back , passed on even more rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 14882 len. 25]: A glimpse of the river through a dull gateway , where some waggons were housed for the night , seemed to arrest my feet .
Parsing [sent. 14883 len. 46]: I touched my companion without speaking , and we both forbore to cross after her , and both followed on that opposite side of the way ; keeping as quietly as we could in the shadow of the houses , but keeping very near her .
Parsing [sent. 14884 len. 29]: There was , and is when I write , at the end of that low-lying street , a dilapidated little wooden building , probably an obsolete old ferry-house .
Parsing [sent. 14885 len. 27]: Its position is just at that point where the street ceases , and the road begins to lie between a row of houses and the river .
Parsing [sent. 14886 len. 40]: As soon as she came here , and saw the water , she stopped as if she had come to her destination ; and presently went slowly along by the brink of the river , looking intently at it .
Parsing [sent. 14887 len. 38]: All the way here , I had supposed that she was going to some house ; indeed , I had vaguely entertained the hope that the house might be in some way associated with the lost girl .
Parsing [sent. 14888 len. 23]: But that one dark glimpse of the river , through the gateway , had instinctively prepared me for her going no farther .
Parsing [sent. 14889 len. 25]: The neighbourhood was a dreary one at that time ; as oppressive , sad , and solitary by night , as any about London .
Parsing [sent. 14890 len. 18]: There were neither wharves nor houses on the melancholy waste of road near the great blank Prison .
Parsing [sent. 14891 len. 11]: A sluggish ditch deposited its mud at the prison walls .
Parsing [sent. 14892 len. 15]: Coarse grass and rank weeds straggled over all the marshy land in the vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 14893 len. 17]: In one part , carcases of houses , inauspiciously begun and never finished , rotted away .
Parsing [sent. 14894 len. 76]: In another , the ground was cumbered with rusty iron monsters of steam-boilers , wheels , cranks , pipes , furnaces , paddles , anchors , diving-bells , windmill-sails , and I know not what strange objects , accumulated by some speculator , and grovelling in the dust , underneath which -- having sunk into the soil of their own weight in wet weather -- they had the appearance of vainly trying to hide themselves .
Parsing [sent. 14895 len. 31]: The clash and glare of sundry fiery Works upon the river-side , arose by night to disturb everything except the heavy and unbroken smoke that poured out of their chimneys .
Parsing [sent. 14896 len. 53]: Slimy gaps and causeways , winding among old wooden piles , with a sickly substance clinging to the latter , like green hair , and the rags of last year 's handbills offering rewards for drowned men fluttering above high-water mark , led down through the ooze and slush to the ebb-tide .
Parsing [sent. 14897 len. 38]: There was a story that one of the pits dug for the dead in the time of the Great Plague was hereabout ; and a blighting influence seemed to have proceeded from it over the whole place .
Parsing [sent. 14898 len. 24]: Or else it looked as if it had gradually decomposed into that nightmare condition , out of the overflowings of the polluted stream .
Parsing [sent. 14899 len. 52]: As if she were a part of the refuse it had cast out , and left to corruption and decay , the girl we had followed strayed down to the river 's brink , and stood in the midst of this night-picture , lonely and still , looking at the water .
Parsing [sent. 14900 len. 27]: There were some boats and barges astrand in the mud , and these enabled us to come within a few yards of her without being seen .
Parsing [sent. 14901 len. 22]: I then signed to Mr. Peggotty to remain where he was , and emerged from their shade to speak to her .
Parsing [sent. 14902 len. 54]: I did not approach her solitary figure without trembling ; for this gloomy end to her determined walk , and the way in which she stood , almost within the cavernous shadow of the iron bridge , looking at the lights crookedly reflected in the strong tide , inspired a dread within me .
Parsing [sent. 14903 len. 8]: I think she was talking to herself .
Parsing [sent. 14904 len. 49]: I am sure , although absorbed in gazing at the water , that her shawl was off her shoulders , and that she was muffling her hands in it , in an unsettled and bewildered way , more like the action of a sleep-walker than a waking person .
Parsing [sent. 14905 len. 39]: I know , and never can forget , that there was that in her wild manner which gave me no assurance but that she would sink before my eyes , until I had her arm within my grasp .
Parsing [sent. 14906 len. 10]: At the same moment I said ` Martha ! '
Parsing [sent. 14907 len. 24]: She uttered a terrified scream , and struggled with me with such strength that I doubt if I could have held her alone .
Parsing [sent. 14908 len. 36]: But a stronger hand than mine was laid upon her ; and when she raised her frightened eyes and saw whose it was , she made but one more effort and dropped down between us .
Parsing [sent. 14909 len. 25]: We carried her away from the water to where there were some dry stones , and there laid her down , crying and moaning .
Parsing [sent. 14910 len. 19]: In a little while she sat among the stones , holding her wretched head with both her hands .
Parsing [sent. 14911 len. 7]: ` Oh , the river ! '
Parsing [sent. 14912 len. 4]: she cried passionately .
Parsing [sent. 14913 len. 7]: ` Oh , the river ! '
Parsing [sent. 14914 len. 6]: ` Hush , hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 14915 len. 7]: said I. ` Calm yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 14916 len. 18]: But she still repeated the same words , continually exclaiming , ` Oh , the river ! '
Parsing [sent. 14917 len. 6]: over and over again . '
Parsing [sent. 14918 len. 8]: I know it 's like me ! '
Parsing [sent. 14919 len. 4]: she exclaimed . '
Parsing [sent. 14920 len. 8]: I know that I belong to it .
Parsing [sent. 14921 len. 14]: I know that it 's the natural company of such as I am !
Parsing [sent. 14922 len. 57]: It comes from country places , where there was once no harm in it -- and it creeps through the dismal streets , defiled and miserable -- and it goes away , like my life , to a great sea , that is always troubled -- and I feel that I must go with it ! '
Parsing [sent. 14923 len. 17]: I have never known what despair was , except in the tone of those words . '
Parsing [sent. 14924 len. 8]: I ca n't keep away from it .
Parsing [sent. 14925 len. 6]: I ca n't forget it .
Parsing [sent. 14926 len. 7]: It haunts me day and night .
Parsing [sent. 14927 len. 22]: It 's the only thing in all the world that I am fit for , or that 's fit for me .
Parsing [sent. 14928 len. 7]: Oh , the dreadful river ! '
Parsing [sent. 14929 len. 41]: The thought passed through my mind that in the face of my companion , as he looked upon her without speech or motion , I might have read his niece 's history , if I had known nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 14930 len. 17]: I never saw , in any painting or reality , horror and compassion so impressively blended .
Parsing [sent. 14931 len. 30]: He shook as if he would have fallen ; and his hand -- I touched it with my own , for his appearance alarmed me -- was deadly cold .
Parsing [sent. 14932 len. 15]: ` She is in a state of frenzy , ' I whispered to him .
Parsing [sent. 14933 len. 11]: ` She will speak differently in a little time . '
Parsing [sent. 14934 len. 12]: I do n't know what he would have said in answer .
Parsing [sent. 14935 len. 28]: He made some motion with his mouth , and seemed to think he had spoken ; but he had only pointed to her with his outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 14936 len. 35]: A new burst of crying came upon her now , in which she once more hid her face among the stones , and lay before us , a prostrate image of humiliation and ruin .
Parsing [sent. 14937 len. 41]: Knowing that this state must pass , before we could speak to her with any hope , I ventured to restrain him when he would have raised her , and we stood by in silence until she became more tranquil .
Parsing [sent. 14938 len. 43]: ` Martha , ' said I then , leaning down , and helping her to rise -- she seemed to want to rise as if with the intention of going away , but she was weak , and leaned against a boat .
Parsing [sent. 14939 len. 14]: ` Do you know who this is , who is with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 14940 len. 8]: She said faintly , ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 14941 len. 15]: ` Do you know that we have followed you a long way tonight ? '
Parsing [sent. 14942 len. 5]: She shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 14943 len. 42]: She looked neither at him nor at me , but stood in a humble attitude , holding her bonnet and shawl in one hand , without appearing conscious of them , and pressing the other , clenched , against her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 14944 len. 28]: ` Are you composed enough , ' said I , ` to speak on the subject which so interested you -- I hope Heaven may remember it !
Parsing [sent. 14945 len. 6]: -- that snowy night ? '
Parsing [sent. 14946 len. 25]: Her sobs broke out afresh , and she murmured some inarticulate thanks to me for not having driven her away from the door . '
Parsing [sent. 14947 len. 18]: I want to say nothing for myself , ' she said , after a few moments . '
Parsing [sent. 14948 len. 8]: I am bad , I am lost .
Parsing [sent. 14949 len. 7]: I have no hope at all .
Parsing [sent. 14950 len. 42]: But tell him , sir , ' she had shrunk away from him , ` if you do n't feel too hard to me to do it , that I never was in any way the cause of his misfortune . '
Parsing [sent. 14951 len. 19]: ` It has never been attributed to you , ' I returned , earnestly responding to her earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 14952 len. 61]: ` It was you , if I do n't deceive myself , ' she said , in a broken voice , ` that came into the kitchen , the night she took such pity on me ; was so gentle to me ; did n't shrink away from me like all the rest , and gave me such kind help !
Parsing [sent. 14953 len. 7]: Was it you , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 14954 len. 42]: ` It was , ' said I. ' I should have been in the river long ago , ' she said , glancing at it with a terrible expression , ` if any wrong to her had been upon my mind .
Parsing [sent. 14955 len. 27]: I never could have kept out of it a single winter 's night , if I had not been free of any share in that ! '
Parsing [sent. 14956 len. 15]: ` The cause of her flight is too well understood , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 14957 len. 19]: ` You are innocent of any part in it , we thoroughly believe , -- we know . '
Parsing [sent. 14958 len. 22]: ` Oh , I might have been much the better for her , if I had had a better heart ! '
Parsing [sent. 14959 len. 18]: exclaimed the girl , with most forlorn regret ; ` for she was always good to me !
Parsing [sent. 14960 len. 14]: She never spoke a word to me but what was pleasant and right .
Parsing [sent. 14961 len. 23]: Is it likely I would try to make her what I am myself , knowing what I am myself , so well ?
Parsing [sent. 14962 len. 26]: When I lost everything that makes life dear , the worst of all my thoughts was that I was parted for ever from her ! '
Parsing [sent. 14963 len. 28]: Mr. Peggotty , standing with one hand on the gunwale of the boat , and his eyes cast down , put his disengaged hand before his face .
Parsing [sent. 14964 len. 54]: ` And when I heard what had happened before that snowy night , from some belonging to our town , ' cried Martha , ` the bitterest thought in all my mind was , that the people would remember she once kept company with me , and would say I had corrupted her !
Parsing [sent. 14965 len. 18]: When , Heaven knows , I would have died to have brought back her good name ! '
Parsing [sent. 14966 len. 17]: Long unused to any self-control , the piercing agony of her remorse and grief was terrible .
Parsing [sent. 14967 len. 16]: ` To have died , would not have been much -- what can I say ?
Parsing [sent. 14968 len. 7]: -- I would have lived ! '
Parsing [sent. 14969 len. 4]: she cried . '
Parsing [sent. 14970 len. 67]: I would have lived to be old , in the wretched streets -- and to wander about , avoided , in the dark -- and to see the day break on the ghastly line of houses , and remember how the same sun used to shine into my room , and wake me once -- I would have done even that , to save her ! '
Parsing [sent. 14971 len. 25]: Sinking on the stones , she took some in each hand , and clenched them up , as if she would have ground them .
Parsing [sent. 14972 len. 46]: She writhed into some new posture constantly : stiffening her arms , twisting them before her face , as though to shut out from her eyes the little light there was , and drooping her head , as if it were heavy with insupportable recollections .
Parsing [sent. 14973 len. 8]: ` What shall I ever do ! '
Parsing [sent. 14974 len. 9]: she said , fighting thus with her despair .
Parsing [sent. 14975 len. 26]: ` How can I go on as I am , a solitary curse to myself , a living disgrace to everyone I come near ! '
Parsing [sent. 14976 len. 7]: Suddenly she turned to my companion .
Parsing [sent. 14977 len. 8]: ` Stamp upon me , kill me !
Parsing [sent. 14978 len. 25]: When she was your pride , you would have thought I had done her harm if I had brushed against her in the street .
Parsing [sent. 14979 len. 9]: You ca n't believe -- why should you ?
Parsing [sent. 14980 len. 10]: -- a syllable that comes out of my lips .
Parsing [sent. 14981 len. 20]: It would be a burning shame upon you , even now , if she and I exchanged a word .
Parsing [sent. 14982 len. 5]: I do n't complain .
Parsing [sent. 14983 len. 22]: I do n't say she and I are alike -- I know there is a long , long way between us .
Parsing [sent. 14984 len. 28]: I only say , with all my guilt and wretchedness upon my head , that I am grateful to her from my soul , and love her .
Parsing [sent. 14985 len. 19]: Oh , do n't think that all the power I had of loving anything is quite worn out !
Parsing [sent. 14986 len. 10]: Throw me away , as all the world does .
Parsing [sent. 14987 len. 23]: Kill me for being what I am , and having ever known her ; but do n't think that of me ! '
Parsing [sent. 14988 len. 28]: He looked upon her , while she made this supplication , in a wild distracted manner ; and , when she was silent , gently raised her .
Parsing [sent. 14989 len. 17]: ` Martha , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` God forbid as I should judge you .
Parsing [sent. 14990 len. 15]: Forbid as I , of all men , should do that , my girl !
Parsing [sent. 14991 len. 25]: You doe n't know half the change that 's come , in course of time , upon me , when you think it likely .
Parsing [sent. 14992 len. 3]: Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 14993 len. 9]: he paused a moment , then went on .
Parsing [sent. 14994 len. 21]: ` You doe n't understand how 't is that this here gentleman and me has wished to speak to you .
Parsing [sent. 14995 len. 12]: You doe n't understand what 't is we has afore us .
Parsing [sent. 14996 len. 4]: Listen now ! '
Parsing [sent. 14997 len. 7]: His influence upon her was complete .
Parsing [sent. 14998 len. 28]: She stood , shrinkingly , before him , as if she were afraid to meet his eyes ; but her passionate sorrow was quite hushed and mute .
Parsing [sent. 14999 len. 49]: ` If you heerd , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` owt of what passed between Mas ' r Davy and me , th ' night when it snew so hard , you know as I have been -- wheer not -- fur to seek my dear niece .
Parsing [sent. 15000 len. 9]: My dear niece , ' he repeated steadily .
Parsing [sent. 15001 len. 19]: ` Fur she 's more dear to me now , Martha , than she was dear afore . '
Parsing [sent. 15002 len. 14]: She put her hands before her face ; but otherwise remained quiet . '
Parsing [sent. 15003 len. 36]: I have heerd her tell , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` as you was early left fatherless and motherless , with no friend fur to take , in a rough seafaring-way , their place .
Parsing [sent. 15004 len. 41]: Maybe you can guess that if you 'd had such a friend , you 'd have got into a way of being fond of him in course of time , and that my niece was kiender daughter-like to me . '
Parsing [sent. 15005 len. 24]: As she was silently trembling , he put her shawl carefully about her , taking it up from the ground for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 15006 len. 50]: ` Whereby , ' said he , ' I know , both as she would go to the wureld 's furdest end with me , if she could once see me again ; and that she would fly to the wureld 's furdest end to keep off seeing me .
Parsing [sent. 15007 len. 49]: For though she ai n't no call to doubt my love , and doe n't -- and doe n't , ' he repeated , with a quiet assurance of the truth of what he said , ` there 's shame steps in , and keeps betwixt us . '
Parsing [sent. 15008 len. 32]: I read , in every word of his plain impressive way of delivering himself , new evidence of his having thought of this one topic , in every feature it presented .
Parsing [sent. 15009 len. 38]: ` According to our reckoning , ' he proceeded , ` Mas ' r Davy 's here , and mine , she is like , one day , to make her own poor solitary course to London .
Parsing [sent. 15010 len. 32]: We believe -- Mas ' r Davy , me , and all of us -- that you are as innocent of everything that has befell her , as the unborn child .
Parsing [sent. 15011 len. 15]: You 've spoke of her being pleasant , kind , and gentle to you .
Parsing [sent. 15012 len. 8]: Bless her , I knew she was !
Parsing [sent. 15013 len. 9]: I knew she always was , to all .
Parsing [sent. 15014 len. 11]: You 're thankful to her , and you love her .
Parsing [sent. 15015 len. 16]: Help us all you can to find her , and may Heaven reward you ! '
Parsing [sent. 15016 len. 23]: She looked at him hastily , and for the first time , as if she were doubtful of what he had said .
Parsing [sent. 15017 len. 7]: ` Will you trust me ? '
Parsing [sent. 15018 len. 10]: she asked , in a low voice of astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 15019 len. 6]: ` Full and free ! '
Parsing [sent. 15020 len. 4]: said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 15021 len. 44]: ` To speak to her , if I should ever find her ; shelter her , if I have any shelter to divide with her ; and then , without her knowledge , come to you , and bring you to her ? '
Parsing [sent. 15022 len. 4]: she asked hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 15023 len. 9]: We both replied together , ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 15024 len. 22]: She lifted up her eyes , and solemnly declared that she would devote herself to this task , fervently and faithfully .
Parsing [sent. 15025 len. 26]: That she would never waver in it , never be diverted from it , never relinquish it , while there was any chance of hope .
Parsing [sent. 15026 len. 72]: If she were not true to it , might the object she now had in life , which bound her to something devoid of evil , in its passing away from her , leave her more forlorn and more despairing , if that were possible , than she had been upon the river 's brink that night ; and then might all help , human and Divine , renounce her evermore !
Parsing [sent. 15027 len. 33]: She did not raise her voice above her breath , or address us , but said this to the night sky ; then stood profoundly quiet , looking at the gloomy water .
Parsing [sent. 15028 len. 20]: We judged it expedient , now , to tell her all we knew ; which I recounted at length .
Parsing [sent. 15029 len. 25]: She listened with great attention , and with a face that often changed , but had the same purpose in all its varying expressions .
Parsing [sent. 15030 len. 12]: Her eyes occasionally filled with tears , but those she repressed .
Parsing [sent. 15031 len. 18]: It seemed as if her spirit were quite altered , and she could not be too quiet .
Parsing [sent. 15032 len. 21]: She asked , when all was told , where we were to be communicated with , if occasion should arise .
Parsing [sent. 15033 len. 38]: Under a dull lamp in the road , I wrote our two addresses on a leaf of my pocket-book , which I tore out and gave to her , and which she put in her poor bosom .
Parsing [sent. 15034 len. 8]: I asked her where she lived herself .
Parsing [sent. 15035 len. 12]: She said , after a pause , in no place long .
Parsing [sent. 15036 len. 7]: It were better not to know .
Parsing [sent. 15037 len. 52]: Mr. Peggotty suggesting to me , in a whisper , what had already occurred to myself , I took out my purse ; but I could not prevail upon her to accept any money , nor could I exact any promise from her that she would do so at another time .
Parsing [sent. 15038 len. 42]: I represented to her that Mr. Peggotty could not be called , for one in his condition , poor ; and that the idea of her engaging in this search , while depending on her own resources , shocked us both .
Parsing [sent. 15039 len. 4]: She continued steadfast .
Parsing [sent. 15040 len. 14]: In this particular , his influence upon her was equally powerless with mine .
Parsing [sent. 15041 len. 8]: She gratefully thanked him but remained inexorable .
Parsing [sent. 15042 len. 13]: ` There may be work to be got , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 15043 len. 6]: ` I 'll try . '
Parsing [sent. 15044 len. 19]: ` At least take some assistance , ' I returned , ` until you have tried . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15045 len. 17]: I could not do what I have promised , for money , ' she replied . '
Parsing [sent. 15046 len. 11]: I could not take it , if I was starving .
Parsing [sent. 15047 len. 38]: To give me money would be to take away your trust , to take away the object that you have given me , to take away the only certain thing that saves me from the river . '
Parsing [sent. 15048 len. 33]: ` In the name of the great judge , ' said I , ` before whom you and all of us must stand at His dread time , dismiss that terrible idea !
Parsing [sent. 15049 len. 12]: We can all do some good , if we will . '
Parsing [sent. 15050 len. 37]: She trembled , and her lip shook , and her face was paler , as she answered : ` It has been put into your hearts , perhaps , to save a wretched creature for repentance .
Parsing [sent. 15051 len. 12]: I am afraid to think so ; it seems too bold .
Parsing [sent. 15052 len. 26]: If any good should come of me , I might begin to hope ; for nothing but harm has ever come of my deeds yet .
Parsing [sent. 15053 len. 32]: I am to be trusted , for the first time in a long while , with my miserable life , on account of what you have given me to try for .
Parsing [sent. 15054 len. 13]: I know no more , and I can say no more . '
Parsing [sent. 15055 len. 41]: Again she repressed the tears that had begun to flow ; and , putting out her trembling hand , and touching Mr. Peggotty , as if there was some healing virtue in him , went away along the desolate road .
Parsing [sent. 15056 len. 11]: She had been ill , probably for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 15057 len. 27]: I observed , upon that closer opportunity of observation , that she was worn and haggard , and that her sunken eyes expressed privation and endurance .
Parsing [sent. 15058 len. 27]: We followed her at a short distance , our way lying in the same direction , until we came back into the lighted and populous streets .
Parsing [sent. 15059 len. 38]: I had such implicit confidence in her declaration , that I then put it to Mr. Peggotty , whether it would not seem , in the onset , like distrusting her , to follow her any farther .
Parsing [sent. 15060 len. 31]: He being of the same mind , and equally reliant on her , we suffered her to take her own road , and took ours , which was towards Highgate .
Parsing [sent. 15061 len. 44]: He accompanied me a good part of the way ; and when we parted , with a prayer for the success of this fresh effort , there was a new and thoughtful compassion in him that I was at no loss to interpret .
Parsing [sent. 15062 len. 9]: It was midnight when I arrived at home .
Parsing [sent. 15063 len. 71]: I had reached my own gate , and was standing listening for the deep bell of St. Paul 's , the sound of which I thought had been borne towards me among the multitude of striking clocks , when I was rather surprised to see that the door of my aunt 's cottage was open , and that a faint light in the entry was shining out across the road .
Parsing [sent. 15064 len. 35]: Thinking that my aunt might have relapsed into one of her old alarms , and might be watching the progress of some imaginary conflagration in the distance , I went to speak to her .
Parsing [sent. 15065 len. 17]: It was with very great surprise that I saw a man standing in her little garden .
Parsing [sent. 15066 len. 18]: He had a glass and bottle in his hand , and was in the act of drinking .
Parsing [sent. 15067 len. 53]: I stopped short , among the thick foliage outside , for the moon was up now , though obscured ; and I recognized the man whom I had once supposed to be a delusion of Mr. Dick 's , and had once encountered with my aunt in the streets of the city .
Parsing [sent. 15068 len. 17]: He was eating as well as drinking , and seemed to eat with a hungry appetite .
Parsing [sent. 15069 len. 21]: He seemed curious regarding the cottage , too , as if it were the first time he had seen it .
Parsing [sent. 15070 len. 38]: After stooping to put the bottle on the ground , he looked up at the windows , and looked about ; though with a covert and impatient air , as if he was anxious to be gone .
Parsing [sent. 15071 len. 17]: The light in the passage was obscured for a moment , and my aunt came out .
Parsing [sent. 15072 len. 12]: She was agitated , and told some money into his hand .
Parsing [sent. 15073 len. 5]: I heard it chink .
Parsing [sent. 15074 len. 9]: ` What 's the use of this ? '
Parsing [sent. 15075 len. 4]: he demanded . '
Parsing [sent. 15076 len. 11]: I can spare no more , ' returned my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 15077 len. 11]: ` Then I ca n't go , ' said he .
Parsing [sent. 15078 len. 3]: ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 15079 len. 7]: You may take it back ! '
Parsing [sent. 15080 len. 22]: ` You bad man , ' returned my aunt , with great emotion ; ` how can you use me so ?
Parsing [sent. 15081 len. 6]: But why do I ask ?
Parsing [sent. 15082 len. 10]: It is because you know how weak I am !
Parsing [sent. 15083 len. 24]: What have I to do , to free myself for ever of your visits , but to abandon you to your deserts ? '
Parsing [sent. 15084 len. 13]: ` And why do n't you abandon me to my deserts ? '
Parsing [sent. 15085 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 15086 len. 7]: ` You ask me why ! '
Parsing [sent. 15087 len. 4]: returned my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 15088 len. 9]: ` What a heart you must have ! '
Parsing [sent. 15089 len. 31]: He stood moodily rattling the money , and shaking his head , until at length he said : ` Is this all you mean to give me , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 15090 len. 14]: ` It is all I CAN give you , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 15091 len. 17]: ` You know I have had losses , and am poorer than I used to be .
Parsing [sent. 15092 len. 6]: I have told you so .
Parsing [sent. 15093 len. 28]: Having got it , why do you give me the pain of looking at you for another moment , and seeing what you have become ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 15094 len. 16]: I have become shabby enough , if you mean that , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 15095 len. 9]: I lead the life of an owl . '
Parsing [sent. 15096 len. 19]: ` You stripped me of the greater part of all I ever had , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 15097 len. 14]: ` You closed my heart against the whole world , years and years .
Parsing [sent. 15098 len. 10]: You treated me falsely , ungratefully , and cruelly .
Parsing [sent. 15099 len. 7]: Go , and repent of it .
Parsing [sent. 15100 len. 19]: Do n't add new injuries to the long , long list of injuries you have done me ! '
Parsing [sent. 15101 len. 4]: ` Aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 15102 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 15103 len. 9]: ` It 's all very fine -- Well !
Parsing [sent. 15104 len. 16]: I must do the best I can , for the present , I suppose . '
Parsing [sent. 15105 len. 23]: In spite of himself , he appeared abashed by my aunt 's indignant tears , and came slouching out of the garden .
Parsing [sent. 15106 len. 30]: Taking two or three quick steps , as if I had just come up , I met him at the gate , and went in as he came out .
Parsing [sent. 15107 len. 13]: We eyed one another narrowly in passing , and with no favour .
Parsing [sent. 15108 len. 9]: ` Aunt , ' said I , hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 15109 len. 7]: ` This man alarming you again !
Parsing [sent. 15110 len. 6]: Let me speak to him .
Parsing [sent. 15111 len. 5]: Who is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 15112 len. 27]: ` Child , ' returned my aunt , taking my arm , ` come in , and do n't speak to me for ten minutes . '
Parsing [sent. 15113 len. 8]: We sat down in her little parlour .
Parsing [sent. 15114 len. 36]: My aunt retired behind the round green fan of former days , which was screwed on the back of a chair , and occasionally wiped her eyes , for about a quarter of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 15115 len. 12]: Then she came out , and took a seat beside me .
Parsing [sent. 15116 len. 17]: ` Trot , ' said my aunt , calmly , ` it 's my husband . '
Parsing [sent. 15117 len. 6]: ` Your husband , aunt ?
Parsing [sent. 15118 len. 8]: I thought he had been dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 15119 len. 15]: ` Dead to me , ' returned my aunt , ` but living . '
Parsing [sent. 15120 len. 6]: I sat in silent amazement .
Parsing [sent. 15121 len. 38]: ` Betsey Trotwood do n't look a likely subject for the tender passion , ' said my aunt , composedly , ` but the time was , Trot , when she believed in that man most entirely .
Parsing [sent. 15122 len. 10]: When she loved him , Trot , right well .
Parsing [sent. 15123 len. 17]: When there was no proof of attachment and affection that she would not have given him .
Parsing [sent. 15124 len. 14]: He repaid her by breaking her fortune , and nearly breaking her heart .
Parsing [sent. 15125 len. 29]: So she put all that sort of sentiment , once and for ever , in a grave , and filled it up , and flattened it down . '
Parsing [sent. 15126 len. 9]: ` My dear , good aunt ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 15127 len. 23]: I left him , ' my aunt proceeded , laying her hand as usual on the back of mine , ` generously .
Parsing [sent. 15128 len. 17]: I may say at this distance of time , Trot , that I left him generously .
Parsing [sent. 15129 len. 26]: He had been so cruel to me , that I might have effected a separation on easy terms for myself ; but I did not .
Parsing [sent. 15130 len. 35]: He soon made ducks and drakes of what I gave him , sank lower and lower , married another woman , I believe , became an adventurer , a gambler , and a cheat .
Parsing [sent. 15131 len. 8]: What he is now , you see .
Parsing [sent. 15132 len. 40]: But he was a fine-looking man when I married him , ' said my aunt , with an echo of her old pride and admiration in her tone ; ` and I believed him -- I was a fool !
Parsing [sent. 15133 len. 9]: -- to be the soul of honour ! '
Parsing [sent. 15134 len. 12]: She gave my hand a squeeze , and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 15135 len. 14]: ` He is nothing to me now , Trot - less than nothing .
Parsing [sent. 15136 len. 44]: But , sooner than have him punished for his offences -LRB- as he would be if he prowled about in this country -RRB- , I give him more money than I can afford , at intervals when he reappears , to go away .
Parsing [sent. 15137 len. 50]: I was a fool when I married him ; and I am so far an incurable fool on that subject , that , for the sake of what I once believed him to be , I would n't have even this shadow of my idle fancy hardly dealt with .
Parsing [sent. 15138 len. 15]: For I was in earnest , Trot , if ever a woman was . '
Parsing [sent. 15139 len. 15]: My aunt dismissed the matter with a heavy sigh , and smoothed her dress .
Parsing [sent. 15140 len. 7]: ` There , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 15141 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 15142 len. 17]: ` Now you know the beginning , middle , and end , and all about it .
Parsing [sent. 15143 len. 25]: We wo n't mention the subject to one another any more ; neither , of course , will you mention it to anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 15144 len. 19]: This is my grumpy , frumpy story , and we 'll keep it to ourselves , Trot ! '
Parsing [sent. 15145 len. 33]: Chapter 48 Domestic I laboured hard at my book , without allowing it to interfere with the punctual discharge of my newspaper duties ; and it came out and was very successful .
Parsing [sent. 15146 len. 40]: I was not stunned by the praise which sounded in my ears , notwithstanding that I was keenly alive to it , and thought better of my own performance , I have little doubt , than anybody else did .
Parsing [sent. 15147 len. 41]: It has always been in my observation of human nature , that a man who has any good reason to believe in himself never flourishes himself before the faces of other people in order that they may believe in him .
Parsing [sent. 15148 len. 26]: For this reason , I retained my modesty in very self-respect ; and the more praise I got , the more I tried to deserve .
Parsing [sent. 15149 len. 30]: It is not my purpose , in this record , though in all other essentials it is my written memory , to pursue the history of my own fictions .
Parsing [sent. 15150 len. 11]: They express themselves , and I leave them to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 15151 len. 18]: When I refer to them , incidentally , it is only as a part of my progress .
Parsing [sent. 15152 len. 27]: Having some foundation for believing , by this time , that nature and accident had made me an author , I pursued my vocation with confidence .
Parsing [sent. 15153 len. 20]: Without such assurance I should certainly have left it alone , and bestowed my energy on some other endeavour .
Parsing [sent. 15154 len. 25]: I should have tried to find out what nature and accident really had made me , and to be that , and nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 15155 len. 34]: I had been writing , in the newspaper and elsewhere , so prosperously , that when my new success was achieved , I considered myself reasonably entitled to escape from the dreary debates .
Parsing [sent. 15156 len. 61]: One joyful night , therefore , I noted down the music of the parliamentary bagpipes for the last time , and I have never heard it since ; though I still recognize the old drone in the newspapers , without any substantial variation -LRB- except , perhaps , that there is more of it -RRB- , all the livelong session .
Parsing [sent. 15157 len. 22]: I now write of the time when I had been married , I suppose , about a year and a half .
Parsing [sent. 15158 len. 17]: After several varieties of experiment , we had given up the housekeeping as a bad job .
Parsing [sent. 15159 len. 11]: The house kept itself , and we kept a page .
Parsing [sent. 15160 len. 36]: The principal function of this retainer was to quarrel with the cook ; in which respect he was a perfect Whittington , without his cat , or the remotest chance of being made Lord Mayor .
Parsing [sent. 15161 len. 13]: He appears to me to have lived in a hail of saucepan-lids .
Parsing [sent. 15162 len. 7]: His whole existence was a scuffle .
Parsing [sent. 15163 len. 45]: He would shriek for help on the most improper occasions , -- as when we had a little dinner-party , or a few friends in the evening , -- and would come tumbling out of the kitchen , with iron missiles flying after him .
Parsing [sent. 15164 len. 22]: We wanted to get rid of him , but he was very much attached to us , and would n't go .
Parsing [sent. 15165 len. 31]: He was a tearful boy , and broke into such deplorable lamentations , when a cessation of our connexion was hinted at , that we were obliged to keep him .
Parsing [sent. 15166 len. 49]: He had no mother -- no anything in the way of a relative , that I could discover , except a sister , who fled to America the moment we had taken him off her hands ; and he became quartered on us like a horrible young changeling .
Parsing [sent. 15167 len. 56]: He had a lively perception of his own unfortunate state , and was always rubbing his eyes with the sleeve of his jacket , or stooping to blow his nose on the extreme corner of a little pocket-handkerchief , which he never would take completely out of his pocket , but always economized and secreted .
Parsing [sent. 15168 len. 25]: This unlucky page , engaged in an evil hour at six pounds ten per annum , was a source of continual trouble to me .
Parsing [sent. 15169 len. 39]: I watched him as he grew -- and he grew like scarlet beans -- with painful apprehensions of the time when he would begin to shave ; even of the days when he would be bald or grey .
Parsing [sent. 15170 len. 35]: I saw no prospect of ever getting rid of him ; and , projecting myself into the future , used to think what an inconvenience he would be when he was an old man .
Parsing [sent. 15171 len. 19]: I never expected anything less , than this unfortunate 's manner of getting me out of my difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 15172 len. 55]: He stole Dora 's watch , which , like everything else belonging to us , had no particular place of its own ; and , converting it into money , spent the produce -LRB- he was always a weak-minded boy -RRB- in incessantly riding up and down between London and Uxbridge outside the coach .
Parsing [sent. 15173 len. 40]: He was taken to Bow Street , as well as I remember , on the completion of his fifteenth journey ; when four-and-sixpence , and a second-hand fife which he could n't play , were found upon his person .
Parsing [sent. 15174 len. 20]: The surprise and its consequences would have been much less disagreeable to me if he had not been penitent .
Parsing [sent. 15175 len. 22]: But he was very penitent indeed , and in a peculiar way -- not in the lump , but by instalments .
Parsing [sent. 15176 len. 48]: For example : the day after that on which I was obliged to appear against him , he made certain revelations touching a hamper in the cellar , which we believed to be full of wine , but which had nothing in it except bottles and corks .
Parsing [sent. 15177 len. 70]: We supposed he had now eased his mind , and told the worst he knew of the cook ; but , a day or two afterwards , his conscience sustained a new twinge , and he disclosed how she had a little girl , who , early every morning , took away our bread ; and also how he himself had been suborned to maintain the milkman in coals .
Parsing [sent. 15178 len. 34]: In two or three days more , I was informed by the authorities of his having led to the discovery of sirloins of beef among the kitchen-stuff , and sheets in the rag-bag .
Parsing [sent. 15179 len. 40]: A little while afterwards , he broke out in an entirely new direction , and confessed to a knowledge of burglarious intentions as to our premises , on the part of the pot-boy , who was immediately taken up .
Parsing [sent. 15180 len. 40]: I got to be so ashamed of being such a victim , that I would have given him any money to hold his tongue , or would have offered a round bribe for his being permitted to run away .
Parsing [sent. 15181 len. 39]: It was an aggravating circumstance in the case that he had no idea of this , but conceived that he was making me amends in every new discovery : not to say , heaping obligations on my head .
Parsing [sent. 15182 len. 36]: At last I ran away myself , whenever I saw an emissary of the police approaching with some new intelligence ; and lived a stealthy life until he was tried and ordered to be transported .
Parsing [sent. 15183 len. 45]: Even then he could n't be quiet , but was always writing us letters ; and wanted so much to see Dora before he went away , that Dora went to visit him , and fainted when she found herself inside the iron bars .
Parsing [sent. 15184 len. 41]: In short , I had no peace of my life until he was expatriated , and made -LRB- as I afterwards heard -RRB- a shepherd of , ` up the country ' somewhere ; I have no geographical idea where .
Parsing [sent. 15185 len. 37]: All this led me into some serious reflections , and presented our mistakes in a new aspect ; as I could not help communicating to Dora one evening , in spite of my tenderness for her .
Parsing [sent. 15186 len. 43]: ` My love , ' said I , ` it is very painful to me to think that our want of system and management , involves not only ourselves -LRB- which we have got used to -RRB- , but other people . '
Parsing [sent. 15187 len. 20]: ` You have been silent for a long time , and now you are going to be cross ! '
Parsing [sent. 15188 len. 3]: said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 15189 len. 8]: ` No , my dear , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 15190 len. 11]: Let me explain to you what I mean . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15191 len. 13]: I think I do n't want to know , ' said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 15192 len. 11]: ` But I want you to know , my love .
Parsing [sent. 15193 len. 5]: Put Jip down . '
Parsing [sent. 15194 len. 13]: Dora put his nose to mine , and said ` Boh ! '
Parsing [sent. 15195 len. 37]: to drive my seriousness away ; but , not succeeding , ordered him into his Pagoda , and sat looking at me , with her hands folded , and a most resigned little expression of countenance .
Parsing [sent. 15196 len. 19]: ` The fact is , my dear , ' I began , ` there is contagion in us .
Parsing [sent. 15197 len. 7]: We infect everyone about us . '
Parsing [sent. 15198 len. 50]: I might have gone on in this figurative manner , if Dora 's face had not admonished me that she was wondering with all her might whether I was going to propose any new kind of vaccination , or other medical remedy , for this unwholesome state of ours .
Parsing [sent. 15199 len. 11]: Therefore I checked myself , and made my meaning plainer .
Parsing [sent. 15200 len. 57]: ` It is not merely , my pet , ' said I , ` that we lose money and comfort , and even temper sometimes , by not learning to be more careful ; but that we incur the serious responsibility of spoiling everyone who comes into our service , or has any dealings with us .
Parsing [sent. 15201 len. 34]: I begin to be afraid that the fault is not entirely on one side , but that these people all turn out ill because we do n't turn out very well ourselves . '
Parsing [sent. 15202 len. 28]: ` Oh , what an accusation , ' exclaimed Dora , opening her eyes wide ; ` to say that you ever saw me take gold watches !
Parsing [sent. 15203 len. 3]: Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 15204 len. 15]: ` My dearest , ' I remonstrated , ` do n't talk preposterous nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 15205 len. 11]: Who has made the least allusion to gold watches ? '
Parsing [sent. 15206 len. 8]: ` You did , ' returned Dora .
Parsing [sent. 15207 len. 6]: ` You know you did .
Parsing [sent. 15208 len. 16]: You said I had n't turned out well , and compared me to him . '
Parsing [sent. 15209 len. 5]: ` To whom ? '
Parsing [sent. 15210 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 15211 len. 9]: ` To the page , ' sobbed Dora .
Parsing [sent. 15212 len. 17]: ` Oh , you cruel fellow , to compare your affectionate wife to a transported page !
Parsing [sent. 15213 len. 15]: Why did n't you tell me your opinion of me before we were married ?
Parsing [sent. 15214 len. 22]: Why did n't you say , you hard-hearted thing , that you were convinced I was worse than a transported page ?
Parsing [sent. 15215 len. 11]: Oh , what a dreadful opinion to have of me !
Parsing [sent. 15216 len. 6]: Oh , my goodness ! '
Parsing [sent. 15217 len. 38]: ` Now , Dora , my love , ' I returned , gently trying to remove the handkerchief she pressed to her eyes , ` this is not only very ridiculous of you , but very wrong .
Parsing [sent. 15218 len. 11]: In the first place , it 's not true . '
Parsing [sent. 15219 len. 13]: ` You always said he was a story-teller , ' sobbed Dora .
Parsing [sent. 15220 len. 10]: ` And now you say the same of me !
Parsing [sent. 15221 len. 7]: Oh , what shall I do !
Parsing [sent. 15222 len. 6]: What shall I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 15223 len. 31]: ` My darling girl , ' I retorted , ' I really must entreat you to be reasonable , and listen to what I did say , and do say .
Parsing [sent. 15224 len. 28]: My dear Dora , unless we learn to do our duty to those whom we employ , they will never learn to do their duty to us .
Parsing [sent. 15225 len. 19]: I am afraid we present opportunities to people to do wrong , that never ought to be presented .
Parsing [sent. 15226 len. 57]: Even if we were as lax as we are , in all our arrangements , by choice -- which we are not -- even if we liked it , and found it agreeable to be so -- which we do n't -- I am persuaded we should have no right to go on in this way .
Parsing [sent. 15227 len. 6]: We are positively corrupting people .
Parsing [sent. 15228 len. 8]: We are bound to think of that .
Parsing [sent. 15229 len. 10]: I ca n't help thinking of it , Dora .
Parsing [sent. 15230 len. 18]: It is a reflection I am unable to dismiss , and it sometimes makes me very uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 15231 len. 8]: There , dear , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 15232 len. 3]: Come now .
Parsing [sent. 15233 len. 6]: Do n't be foolish ! '
Parsing [sent. 15234 len. 16]: Dora would not allow me , for a long time , to remove the handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 15235 len. 22]: She sat sobbing and murmuring behind it , that , if I was uneasy , why had I ever been married ?
Parsing [sent. 15236 len. 29]: Why had n't I said , even the day before we went to church , that I knew I should be uneasy , and I would rather not ?
Parsing [sent. 15237 len. 27]: If I could n't bear her , why did n't I send her away to her aunts at Putney , or to Julia Mills in India ?
Parsing [sent. 15238 len. 27]: Julia would be glad to see her , and would not call her a transported page ; Julia never had called her anything of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 15239 len. 45]: In short , Dora was so afflicted , and so afflicted me by being in that condition , that I felt it was of no use repeating this kind of effort , though never so mildly , and I must take some other course .
Parsing [sent. 15240 len. 8]: What other course was left to take ?
Parsing [sent. 15241 len. 7]: To ` form her mind ' ?
Parsing [sent. 15242 len. 24]: This was a common phrase of words which had a fair and promising sound , and I resolved to form Dora 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 15243 len. 4]: I began immediately .
Parsing [sent. 15244 len. 30]: When Dora was very childish , and I would have infinitely preferred to humour her , I tried to be grave -- and disconcerted her , and myself too .
Parsing [sent. 15245 len. 27]: I talked to her on the subjects which occupied my thoughts ; and I read Shakespeare to her -- and fatigued her to the last degree .
Parsing [sent. 15246 len. 41]: I accustomed myself to giving her , as it were quite casually , little scraps of useful information , or sound opinion -- and she started from them when I let them off , as if they had been crackers .
Parsing [sent. 15247 len. 43]: No matter how incidentally or naturally I endeavoured to form my little wife 's mind , I could not help seeing that she always had an instinctive perception of what I was about , and became a prey to the keenest apprehensions .
Parsing [sent. 15248 len. 17]: In particular , it was clear to me , that she thought Shakespeare a terrible fellow .
Parsing [sent. 15249 len. 7]: The formation went on very slowly .
Parsing [sent. 15250 len. 32]: I pressed Traddles into the service without his knowledge ; and whenever he came to see us , exploded my mines upon him for the edification of Dora at second hand .
Parsing [sent. 15251 len. 51]: The amount of practical wisdom I bestowed upon Traddles in this manner was immense , and of the best quality ; but it had no other effect upon Dora than to depress her spirits , and make her always nervous with the dread that it would be her turn next .
Parsing [sent. 15252 len. 37]: I found myself in the condition of a schoolmaster , a trap , a pitfall ; of always playing spider to Dora 's fly , and always pouncing out of my hole to her infinite disturbance .
Parsing [sent. 15253 len. 46]: Still , looking forward through this intermediate stage , to the time when there should be a perfect sympathy between Dora and me , and when I should have ` formed her mind ' to my entire satisfaction , I persevered , even for months .
Parsing [sent. 15254 len. 47]: Finding at last , however , that , although I had been all this time a very porcupine or hedgehog , bristling all over with determination , I had effected nothing , it began to occur to me that perhaps Dora 's mind was already formed .
Parsing [sent. 15255 len. 49]: On further consideration this appeared so likely , that I abandoned my scheme , which had had a more promising appearance in words than in action ; resolving henceforth to be satisfied with my child-wife , and to try to change her into nothing else by any process .
Parsing [sent. 15256 len. 47]: I was heartily tired of being sagacious and prudent by myself , and of seeing my darling under restraint ; so I bought a pretty pair of ear-rings for her , and a collar for Jip , and went home one day to make myself agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 15257 len. 38]: Dora was delighted with the little presents , and kissed me joyfully ; but there was a shadow between us , however slight , and I had made up my mind that it should not be there .
Parsing [sent. 15258 len. 21]: If there must be such a shadow anywhere , I would keep it for the future in my own breast .
Parsing [sent. 15259 len. 49]: I sat down by my wife on the sofa , and put the ear-rings in her ears ; and then I told her that I feared we had not been quite as good company lately , as we used to be , and that the fault was mine .
Parsing [sent. 15260 len. 11]: Which I sincerely felt , and which indeed it was .
Parsing [sent. 15261 len. 24]: ` The truth is , Dora , my life , ' I said ; ' I have been trying to be wise . '
Parsing [sent. 15262 len. 14]: ` And to make me wise too , ' said Dora , timidly .
Parsing [sent. 15263 len. 8]: ` Have n't you , Doady ? '
Parsing [sent. 15264 len. 18]: I nodded assent to the pretty inquiry of the raised eyebrows , and kissed the parted lips .
Parsing [sent. 15265 len. 24]: ` It 's of not a bit of use , ' said Dora , shaking her head , until the ear-rings rang again .
Parsing [sent. 15266 len. 22]: ` You know what a little thing I am , and what I wanted you to call me from the first .
Parsing [sent. 15267 len. 16]: If you ca n't do so , I am afraid you 'll never like me .
Parsing [sent. 15268 len. 27]: Are you sure you do n't think , sometimes , it would have been better to have -- ' ` Done what , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 15269 len. 8]: For she made no effort to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 15270 len. 4]: ` Nothing ! '
Parsing [sent. 15271 len. 3]: said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 15272 len. 4]: ` Nothing ? '
Parsing [sent. 15273 len. 3]: I repeated .
Parsing [sent. 15274 len. 49]: She put her arms round my neck , and laughed , and called herself by her favourite name of a goose , and hid her face on my shoulder in such a profusion of curls that it was quite a task to clear them away and see it .
Parsing [sent. 15275 len. 28]: ` Do n't I think it would have been better to have done nothing , than to have tried to form my little wife 's mind ? '
Parsing [sent. 15276 len. 7]: said I , laughing at myself .
Parsing [sent. 15277 len. 6]: ` Is that the question ?
Parsing [sent. 15278 len. 8]: Yes , indeed , I do . '
Parsing [sent. 15279 len. 10]: ` Is that what you have been trying ? '
Parsing [sent. 15280 len. 3]: cried Dora .
Parsing [sent. 15281 len. 8]: ` Oh what a shocking boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 15282 len. 23]: ` But I shall never try any more , ' said I. ` For I love her dearly as she is . '
Parsing [sent. 15283 len. 8]: ` Without a story -- really ? '
Parsing [sent. 15284 len. 8]: inquired Dora , creeping closer to me .
Parsing [sent. 15285 len. 24]: ` Why should I seek to change , ' said I , ` what has been so precious to me for so long !
Parsing [sent. 15286 len. 37]: You never can show better than as your own natural self , my sweet Dora ; and we 'll try no conceited experiments , but go back to our old way , and be happy . '
Parsing [sent. 15287 len. 6]: ` And be happy ! '
Parsing [sent. 15288 len. 3]: returned Dora .
Parsing [sent. 15289 len. 3]: ` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 15290 len. 3]: All day !
Parsing [sent. 15291 len. 15]: And you wo n't mind things going a tiny morsel wrong , sometimes ? '
Parsing [sent. 15292 len. 18]: ` No , no , ' said I. ` We must do the best we can . '
Parsing [sent. 15293 len. 26]: ` And you wo n't tell me , any more , that we make other people bad , ' coaxed Dora ; ` will you ?
Parsing [sent. 15294 len. 10]: Because you know it 's so dreadfully cross ! '
Parsing [sent. 15295 len. 25]: ` No , no , ' said I. ` it 's better for me to be stupid than uncomfortable , is n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 15296 len. 3]: said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 15297 len. 14]: ` Better to be naturally Dora than anything else in the world . '
Parsing [sent. 15298 len. 5]: ` In the world !
Parsing [sent. 15299 len. 11]: Ah , Doady , it 's a large place ! '
Parsing [sent. 15300 len. 34]: She shook her head , turned her delighted bright eyes up to mine , kissed me , broke into a merry laugh , and sprang away to put on Jip 's new collar .
Parsing [sent. 15301 len. 12]: So ended my last attempt to make any change in Dora .
Parsing [sent. 15302 len. 32]: I had been unhappy in trying it ; I could not endure my own solitary wisdom ; I could not reconcile it with her former appeal to me as my child-wife .
Parsing [sent. 15303 len. 47]: I resolved to do what I could , in a quiet way , to improve our proceedings myself , but I foresaw that my utmost would be very little , or I must degenerate into the spider again , and be for ever lying in wait .
Parsing [sent. 15304 len. 27]: And the shadow I have mentioned , that was not to be between us any more , but was to rest wholly on my own heart ?
Parsing [sent. 15305 len. 5]: How did that fall ?
Parsing [sent. 15306 len. 8]: The old unhappy feeling pervaded my life .
Parsing [sent. 15307 len. 34]: It was deepened , if it were changed at all ; but it was as undefined as ever , and addressed me like a strain of sorrowful music faintly heard in the night .
Parsing [sent. 15308 len. 35]: I loved my wife dearly , and I was happy ; but the happiness I had vaguely anticipated , once , was not the happiness I enjoyed , and there was always something wanting .
Parsing [sent. 15309 len. 34]: In fulfilment of the compact I have made with myself , to reflect my mind on this paper , I again examine it , closely , and bring its secrets to the light .
Parsing [sent. 15310 len. 49]: What I missed , I still regarded -- I always regarded -- as something that had been a dream of my youthful fancy ; that was incapable of realization ; that I was now discovering to be so , with some natural pain , as all men did .
Parsing [sent. 15311 len. 40]: But that it would have been better for me if my wife could have helped me more , and shared the many thoughts in which I had no partner ; and that this might have been ; I knew .
Parsing [sent. 15312 len. 49]: Between these two irreconcilable conclusions : the one , that what I felt was general and unavoidable ; the other , that it was particular to me , and might have been different : I balanced curiously , with no distinct sense of their opposition to each other .
Parsing [sent. 15313 len. 69]: When I thought of the airy dreams of youth that are incapable of realization , I thought of the better state preceding manhood that I had outgrown ; and then the contented days with Agnes , in the dear old house , arose before me , like spectres of the dead , that might have some renewal in another world , but never more could be reanimated here .
Parsing [sent. 15314 len. 30]: Sometimes , the speculation came into my thoughts , What might have happened , or what would have happened , if Dora and I had never known each other ?
Parsing [sent. 15315 len. 36]: But she was so incorporated with my existence , that it was the idlest of all fancies , and would soon rise out of my reach and sight , like gossamer floating in the air .
Parsing [sent. 15316 len. 5]: I always loved her .
Parsing [sent. 15317 len. 23]: What I am describing , slumbered , and half awoke , and slept again , in the innermost recesses of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 15318 len. 23]: There was no evidence of it in me ; I know of no influence it had in anything I said or did .
Parsing [sent. 15319 len. 34]: I bore the weight of all our little cares , and all my projects ; Dora held the pens ; and we both felt that our shares were adjusted as the case required .
Parsing [sent. 15320 len. 82]: She was truly fond of me , and proud of me ; and when Agnes wrote a few earnest words in her letters to Dora , of the pride and interest with which my old friends heard of my growing reputation , and read my book as if they heard me speaking its contents , Dora read them out to me with tears of joy in her bright eyes , and said I was a dear old clever , famous boy .
Parsing [sent. 15321 len. 11]: ` The first mistaken impulse of an undisciplined heart . '
Parsing [sent. 15322 len. 24]: Those words of Mrs. Strong 's were constantly recurring to me , at this time ; were almost always present to my mind .
Parsing [sent. 15323 len. 29]: I awoke with them , often , in the night ; I remember to have even read them , in dreams , inscribed upon the walls of houses .
Parsing [sent. 15324 len. 46]: For I knew , now , that my own heart was undisciplined when it first loved Dora ; and that if it had been disciplined , it never could have felt , when we were married , what it had felt in its secret experience .
Parsing [sent. 15325 len. 17]: ` There can be no disparity in marriage , like unsuitability of mind and purpose . '
Parsing [sent. 15326 len. 6]: Those words I remembered too .
Parsing [sent. 15327 len. 14]: I had endeavoured to adapt Dora to myself , and found it impracticable .
Parsing [sent. 15328 len. 37]: It remained for me to adapt myself to Dora ; to share with her what I could , and be happy ; to bear on my own shoulders what I must , and be happy still .
Parsing [sent. 15329 len. 19]: This was the discipline to which I tried to bring my heart , when I began to think .
Parsing [sent. 15330 len. 25]: It made my second year much happier than my first ; and , what was better still , made Dora 's life all sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 15331 len. 13]: But , as that year wore on , Dora was not strong .
Parsing [sent. 15332 len. 30]: I had hoped that lighter hands than mine would help to mould her character , and that a baby-smile upon her breast might change my child-wife to a woman .
Parsing [sent. 15333 len. 6]: It was not to be .
Parsing [sent. 15334 len. 23]: The spirit fluttered for a moment on the threshold of its little prison , and , unconscious of captivity , took wing .
Parsing [sent. 15335 len. 27]: ` When I can run about again , as I used to do , aunt , ' said Dora , ' I shall make Jip race .
Parsing [sent. 15336 len. 10]: He is getting quite slow and lazy . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15337 len. 25]: I suspect , my dear , ' said my aunt quietly working by her side , ` he has a worse disorder than that .
Parsing [sent. 15338 len. 5]: Age , Dora . '
Parsing [sent. 15339 len. 9]: ` Do you think he is old ? '
Parsing [sent. 15340 len. 5]: said Dora , astonished .
Parsing [sent. 15341 len. 14]: ` Oh , how strange it seems that Jip should be old ! '
Parsing [sent. 15342 len. 48]: ` It 's a complaint we are all liable to , Little One , as we get on in life , ' said my aunt , cheerfully ; ' I do n't feel more free from it than I used to be , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 15343 len. 19]: ` But Jip , ' said Dora , looking at him with compassion , ` even little Jip !
Parsing [sent. 15344 len. 7]: Oh , poor fellow ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 15345 len. 61]: I dare say he 'll last a long time yet , Blossom , ' said my aunt , patting Dora on the cheek , as she leaned out of her couch to look at Jip , who responded by standing on his hind legs , and baulking himself in various asthmatic attempts to scramble up by the head and shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 15346 len. 34]: ` He must have a piece of flannel in his house this winter , and I should n't wonder if he came out quite fresh again , with the flowers in the spring .
Parsing [sent. 15347 len. 6]: Bless the little dog ! '
Parsing [sent. 15348 len. 39]: exclaimed my aunt , ` if he had as many lives as a cat , and was on the point of losing 'em all , he 'd bark at me with his last breath , I believe ! '
Parsing [sent. 15349 len. 34]: Dora had helped him up on the sofa ; where he really was defying my aunt to such a furious extent , that he could n't keep straight , but barked himself sideways .
Parsing [sent. 15350 len. 33]: The more my aunt looked at him , the more he reproached her ; for she had lately taken to spectacles , and for some inscrutable reason he considered the glasses personal .
Parsing [sent. 15351 len. 41]: Dora made him lie down by her , with a good deal of persuasion ; and when he was quiet , drew one of his long ears through and through her hand , repeating thoughtfully , ` Even little Jip !
Parsing [sent. 15352 len. 6]: Oh , poor fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 15353 len. 24]: ` His lungs are good enough , ' said my aunt , gaily , ` and his dislikes are not at all feeble .
Parsing [sent. 15354 len. 12]: He has a good many years before him , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 15355 len. 29]: But if you want a dog to race with , Little Blossom , he has lived too well for that , and I 'll give you one . '
Parsing [sent. 15356 len. 12]: ` Thank you , aunt , ' said Dora , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 15357 len. 8]: ` But do n't , please ! '
Parsing [sent. 15358 len. 4]: ` No ? '
Parsing [sent. 15359 len. 10]: said my aunt , taking off her spectacles . '
Parsing [sent. 15360 len. 14]: I could n't have any other dog but Jip , ' said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 15361 len. 9]: ` It would be so unkind to Jip !
Parsing [sent. 15362 len. 42]: Besides , I could n't be such friends with any other dog but Jip ; because he would n't have known me before I was married , and would n't have barked at Doady when he first came to our house .
Parsing [sent. 15363 len. 18]: I could n't care for any other dog but Jip , I am afraid , aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 15364 len. 6]: ` To be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 15365 len. 9]: said my aunt , patting her cheek again .
Parsing [sent. 15366 len. 6]: ` You are right . '
Parsing [sent. 15367 len. 10]: ` You are not offended , ' said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 15368 len. 5]: ` Are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 15369 len. 11]: ` Why , what a sensitive pet it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 15370 len. 9]: cried my aunt , bending over her affectionately .
Parsing [sent. 15371 len. 10]: ` To think that I could be offended ! '
Parsing [sent. 15372 len. 56]: ` No , no , I did n't really think so , ' returned Dora ; ` but I am a little tired , and it made me silly for a moment -- I am always a silly little thing , you know , but it made me more silly -- to talk about Jip .
Parsing [sent. 15373 len. 18]: He has known me in all that has happened to me , have n't you , Jip ?
Parsing [sent. 15374 len. 22]: And I could n't bear to slight him , because he was a little altered -- could I , Jip ? '
Parsing [sent. 15375 len. 13]: Jip nestled closer to his mistress , and lazily licked her hand .
Parsing [sent. 15376 len. 21]: ` You are not so old , Jip , are you , that you 'll leave your mistress yet ? '
Parsing [sent. 15377 len. 3]: said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 15378 len. 12]: ` We may keep one another company a little longer ! '
Parsing [sent. 15379 len. 4]: My pretty Dora !
Parsing [sent. 15380 len. 49]: When she came down to dinner on the ensuing Sunday , and was so glad to see old Traddles -LRB- who always dined with us on Sunday -RRB- , we thought she would be ` running about as she used to do ' , in a few days .
Parsing [sent. 15381 len. 27]: But they said , wait a few days more ; and then , wait a few days more ; and still she neither ran nor walked .
Parsing [sent. 15382 len. 31]: She looked very pretty , and was very merry ; but the little feet that used to be so nimble when they danced round Jip , were dull and motionless .
Parsing [sent. 15383 len. 14]: I began to carry her downstairs every morning , and upstairs every night .
Parsing [sent. 15384 len. 22]: She would clasp me round the neck and laugh , the while , as if I did it for a wager .
Parsing [sent. 15385 len. 30]: Jip would bark and caper round us , and go on before , and look back on the landing , breathing short , to see that we were coming .
Parsing [sent. 15386 len. 24]: My aunt , the best and most cheerful of nurses , would trudge after us , a moving mass of shawls and pillows .
Parsing [sent. 15387 len. 14]: Mr. Dick would not have relinquished his post of candle-bearer to anyone alive .
Parsing [sent. 15388 len. 30]: Traddles would be often at the bottom of the staircase , looking on , and taking charge of sportive messages from Dora to the dearest girl in the world .
Parsing [sent. 15389 len. 17]: We made quite a gay procession of it , and my child-wife was the gayest there .
Parsing [sent. 15390 len. 45]: But , sometimes , when I took her up , and felt that she was lighter in my arms , a dead blank feeling came upon me , as if I were approaching to some frozen region yet unseen , that numbed my life .
Parsing [sent. 15391 len. 82]: I avoided the recognition of this feeling by any name , or by any communing with myself ; until one night , when it was very strong upon me , and my aunt had left her with a parting cry of ` Good night , Little Blossom , ' I sat down at my desk alone , and cried to think , Oh what a fatal name it was , and how the blossom withered in its bloom upon the tree !
Parsing [sent. 15392 len. 119]: Chapter 49 I Am Involved in Mystery I received one morning by the post , the following letter , dated Canterbury , and addressed to me at Doctor 's Commons ; which I read with some surprise : ` My DEAR SIR , ` Circumstances beyond my individual control have , for a considerable lapse of time , effected a severance of that intimacy which , in the limited opportunities conceded to me in the midst of my professional duties , of contemplating the scenes and events of the past , tinged by the prismatic hues of memory , has ever afforded me , as it ever must continue to afford , gratifying emotions of no common description .
Parsing [sent. 15393 len. 44]: This fact , my dear sir , combined with the distinguished elevation to which your talents have raised you , deters me from presuming to aspire to the liberty of addressing the companion of my youth , by the familiar appellation of Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 15394 len. 55]: It is sufficient to know that the name to which I do myself the honour to refer , will ever be treasured among the muniments of our house -LRB- I allude to the archives connected with our former lodgers , preserved by Mrs. Micawber -RRB- , with sentiments of personal esteem amounting to affection .
Parsing [sent. 15395 len. 73]: ` It is not for one , situated , through his original errors and a fortuitous combination of unpropitious events , as is the foundered Bark -LRB- if he may be allowed to assume so maritime a denomination -RRB- , who now takes up the pen to address you -- it is not , I repeat , for one so circumstanced , to adopt the language of compliment , or of congratulation .
Parsing [sent. 15396 len. 10]: That he leaves to abler and to purer hands .
Parsing [sent. 15397 len. 50]: ` If your more important avocations should admit of your ever tracing these imperfect characters thus far -- which may be , or may not be , as circumstances arise -- you will naturally inquire by what object am I influenced , then , in inditing the present missive ?
Parsing [sent. 15398 len. 34]: Allow me to say that I fully defer to the reasonable character of that inquiry , and proceed to develop it ; premising that it is not an object of a pecuniary nature .
Parsing [sent. 15399 len. 87]: ` Without more directly referring to any latent ability that may possibly exist on my part , of wielding the thunderbolt , or directing the devouring and avenging flame in any quarter , I may be permitted to observe , in passing , that my brightest visions are for ever dispelled -- that my peace is shattered and my power of enjoyment destroyed -- that my heart is no longer in the right place - and that I no more walk erect before my fellow man .
Parsing [sent. 15400 len. 7]: The canker is in the flower .
Parsing [sent. 15401 len. 8]: The cup is bitter to the brim .
Parsing [sent. 15402 len. 15]: The worm is at his work , and will soon dispose of his victim .
Parsing [sent. 15403 len. 5]: The sooner the better .
Parsing [sent. 15404 len. 6]: But I will not digress .
Parsing [sent. 15405 len. 64]: ` Placed in a mental position of peculiar painfulness , beyond the assuaging reach even of Mrs. Micawber 's influence , though exercised in the tripartite character of woman , wife , and mother , it is my intention to fly from myself for a short period , and devote a respite of eight-and-forty hours to revisiting some metropolitan scenes of past enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 15406 len. 23]: Among other havens of domestic tranquillity and peace of mind , my feet will naturally tend towards the King 's Bench Prison .
Parsing [sent. 15407 len. 49]: In stating that I shall be -LRB- D. V. -RRB- on the outside of the south wall of that place of incarceration on civil process , the day after tomorrow , at seven in the evening , precisely , my object in this epistolary communication is accomplished . '
Parsing [sent. 15408 len. 57]: I do not feel warranted in soliciting my former friend Mr. Copperfield , or my former friend Mr. Thomas Traddles of the Inner Temple , if that gentleman is still existent and forthcoming , to condescend to meet me , and renew -LRB- so far as may be -RRB- our past relations of the olden time .
Parsing [sent. 15409 len. 43]: I confine myself to throwing out the observation , that , at the hour and place I have indicated , may be found such ruined vestiges as yet ` Remain , ` Of ' A ` Fallen Tower , ` WILKINS MICAWBER .
Parsing [sent. 15410 len. 3]: ` P.S. .
Parsing [sent. 15411 len. 25]: It may be advisable to superadd to the above , the statement that Mrs. Micawber is not in confidential possession of my intentions . '
Parsing [sent. 15412 len. 8]: I read the letter over several times .
Parsing [sent. 15413 len. 49]: Making due allowance for Mr. Micawber 's lofty style of composition , and for the extraordinary relish with which he sat down and wrote long letters on all possible and impossible occasions , I still believed that something important lay hidden at the bottom of this roundabout communication .
Parsing [sent. 15414 len. 39]: I put it down , to think about it ; and took it up again , to read it once more ; and was still pursuing it , when Traddles found me in the height of my perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 15415 len. 19]: ` My dear fellow , ' said I , ' I never was better pleased to see you .
Parsing [sent. 15416 len. 17]: You come to give me the benefit of your sober judgement at a most opportune time .
Parsing [sent. 15417 len. 15]: I have received a very singular letter , Traddles , from Mr. Micawber . '
Parsing [sent. 15418 len. 4]: ` No ? '
Parsing [sent. 15419 len. 3]: cried Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 15420 len. 7]: ` You do n't say so ?
Parsing [sent. 15421 len. 10]: And I have received one from Mrs. Micawber ! '
Parsing [sent. 15422 len. 45]: With that , Traddles , who was flushed with walking , and whose hair , under the combined effects of exercise and excitement , stood on end as if he saw a cheerful ghost , produced his letter and made an exchange with me .
Parsing [sent. 15423 len. 37]: I watched him into the heart of Mr. Micawber 's letter , and returned the elevation of eyebrows with which he said '' ` Wielding the thunderbolt , or directing the devouring and avenging flame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15424 len. 6]: Bless me , Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 15425 len. 13]: - and then entered on the perusal of Mrs. Micawber 's epistle .
Parsing [sent. 15426 len. 43]: It ran thus : ` My best regards to Mr. Thomas Traddles , and if he should still remember one who formerly had the happiness of being well acquainted with him , may I beg a few moments of his leisure time ?
Parsing [sent. 15427 len. 27]: I assure Mr. T. T. that I would not intrude upon his kindness , were I in any other position than on the confines of distraction .
Parsing [sent. 15428 len. 43]: ` Though harrowing to myself to mention , the alienation of Mr. Micawber -LRB- formerly so domesticated -RRB- from his wife and family , is the cause of my addressing my unhappy appeal to Mr. Traddles , and soliciting his best indulgence .
Parsing [sent. 15429 len. 24]: Mr. T. can form no adequate idea of the change in Mr. Micawber 's conduct , of his wildness , of his violence .
Parsing [sent. 15430 len. 15]: It has gradually augmented , until it assumes the appearance of aberration of intellect .
Parsing [sent. 15431 len. 19]: Scarcely a day passes , I assure Mr. Traddles , on which some paroxysm does not take place .
Parsing [sent. 15432 len. 49]: Mr. T. will not require me to depict my feelings , when I inform him that I have become accustomed to hear Mr. Micawber assert that he has sold himself to the D. Mystery and secrecy have long been his principal characteristic , have long replaced unlimited confidence .
Parsing [sent. 15433 len. 27]: The slightest provocation , even being asked if there is anything he would prefer for dinner , causes him to express a wish for a separation .
Parsing [sent. 15434 len. 29]: Last night , on being childishly solicited for twopence , to buy ` lemon-stunners ' -- a local sweetmeat -- he presented an oyster-knife at the twins ! '
Parsing [sent. 15435 len. 14]: I entreat Mr. Traddles to bear with me in entering into these details .
Parsing [sent. 15436 len. 20]: Without them , Mr. T. would indeed find it difficult to form the faintest conception of my heart-rending situation .
Parsing [sent. 15437 len. 16]: ` May I now venture to confide to Mr. T. the purport of my letter ?
Parsing [sent. 15438 len. 13]: Will he now allow me to throw myself on his friendly consideration ?
Parsing [sent. 15439 len. 9]: Oh yes , for I know his heart !
Parsing [sent. 15440 len. 17]: ` The quick eye of affection is not easily blinded , when of the female sex .
Parsing [sent. 15441 len. 7]: Mr. Micawber is going to London .
Parsing [sent. 15442 len. 44]: Though he studiously concealed his hand , this morning before breakfast , in writing the direction-card which he attached to the little brown valise of happier days , the eagle-glance of matrimonial anxiety detected , d , o , n , distinctly traced .
Parsing [sent. 15443 len. 12]: The West-End destination of the coach , is the Golden Cross .
Parsing [sent. 15444 len. 18]: Dare I fervently implore Mr. T. to see my misguided husband , and to reason with him ?
Parsing [sent. 15445 len. 18]: Dare I ask Mr. T. to endeavour to step in between Mr. Micawber and his agonized family ?
Parsing [sent. 15446 len. 10]: Oh no , for that would be too much !
Parsing [sent. 15447 len. 25]: ` If Mr. Copperfield should yet remember one unknown to fame , will Mr. T. take charge of my unalterable regards and similar entreaties ?
Parsing [sent. 15448 len. 36]: In any case , he will have the benevolence to consider this communication strictly private , and on no account whatever to be alluded to , however distantly , in the presence of Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 15449 len. 70]: If Mr. T. should ever reply to it -LRB- which I can not but feel to be most improbable -RRB- , a letter addressed to M. E. , Post Office , Canterbury , will be fraught with less painful consequences than any addressed immediately to one , who subscribes herself , in extreme distress , ` Mr. Thomas Traddles 's respectful friend and suppliant , 'EM MA MICAWBER . '
Parsing [sent. 15450 len. 10]: ` What do you think of that letter ? '
Parsing [sent. 15451 len. 16]: said Traddles , casting his eyes upon me , when I had read it twice .
Parsing [sent. 15452 len. 10]: ` What do you think of the other ? '
Parsing [sent. 15453 len. 13]: said I. For he was still reading it with knitted brows . '
Parsing [sent. 15454 len. 34]: I think that the two together , Copperfield , ' replied Traddles , ` mean more than Mr. and Mrs. Micawber usually mean in their correspondence -- but I do n't know what .
Parsing [sent. 15455 len. 18]: They are both written in good faith , I have no doubt , and without any collusion .
Parsing [sent. 15456 len. 4]: Poor thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 15457 len. 50]: he was now alluding to Mrs. Micawber 's letter , and we were standing side by side comparing the two ; ` it will be a charity to write to her , at all events , and tell her that we will not fail to see Mr. Micawber . '
Parsing [sent. 15458 len. 22]: I acceded to this the more readily , because I now reproached myself with having treated her former letter rather lightly .
Parsing [sent. 15459 len. 49]: It had set me thinking a good deal at the time , as I have mentioned in its place ; but my absorption in my own affairs , my experience of the family , and my hearing nothing more , had gradually ended in my dismissing the subject .
Parsing [sent. 15460 len. 41]: I had often thought of the Micawbers , but chiefly to wonder what ` pecuniary liabilities ' they were establishing in Canterbury , and to recall how shy Mr. Micawber was of me when he became clerk to Uriah Heep .
Parsing [sent. 15461 len. 23]: However , I now wrote a comforting letter to Mrs. Micawber , in our joint names , and we both signed it .
Parsing [sent. 15462 len. 31]: As we walked into town to post it , Traddles and I held a long conference , and launched into a number of speculations , which I need not repeat .
Parsing [sent. 15463 len. 31]: We took my aunt into our counsels in the afternoon ; but our only decided conclusion was , that we would be very punctual in keeping Mr. Micawber 's appointment .
Parsing [sent. 15464 len. 23]: Although we appeared at the stipulated place a quarter of an hour before the time , we found Mr. Micawber already there .
Parsing [sent. 15465 len. 43]: He was standing with his arms folded , over against the wall , looking at the spikes on the top , with a sentimental expression , as if they were the interlacing boughs of trees that had shaded him in his youth .
Parsing [sent. 15466 len. 21]: When we accosted him , his manner was something more confused , and something less genteel , than of yore .
Parsing [sent. 15467 len. 31]: He had relinquished his legal suit of black for the purposes of this excursion , and wore the old surtout and tights , but not quite with the old air .
Parsing [sent. 15468 len. 41]: He gradually picked up more and more of it as we conversed with him ; but , his very eye-glass seemed to hang less easily , and his shirt-collar , though still of the old formidable dimensions , rather drooped .
Parsing [sent. 15469 len. 4]: ` Gentlemen ! '
Parsing [sent. 15470 len. 20]: said Mr. Micawber , after the first salutations , ` you are friends in need , and friends indeed .
Parsing [sent. 15471 len. 55]: Allow me to offer my inquiries with reference to the physical welfare of Mrs. Copperfield in esse , and Mrs. Traddles in posse , -- presuming , that is to say , that my friend Mr. Traddles is not yet united to the object of his affections , for weal and for woe . '
Parsing [sent. 15472 len. 10]: We acknowledged his politeness , and made suitable replies .
Parsing [sent. 15473 len. 47]: He then directed our attention to the wall , and was beginning , ' I assure you , gentlemen , ' when I ventured to object to that ceremonious form of address , and to beg that he would speak to us in the old way .
Parsing [sent. 15474 len. 19]: ` My dear Copperfield , ' he returned , pressing my hand , ` your cordiality overpowers me .
Parsing [sent. 15475 len. 35]: This reception of a shattered fragment of the Temple once called Man -- if I may be permitted so to express myself -- bespeaks a heart that is an honour to our common nature .
Parsing [sent. 15476 len. 25]: I was about to observe that I again behold the serene spot where some of the happiest hours of my existence fleeted by . '
Parsing [sent. 15477 len. 23]: ` Made so , I am sure , by Mrs. Micawber , ' said I. ' I hope she is well ? '
Parsing [sent. 15478 len. 22]: ` Thank you , ' returned Mr. Micawber , whose face clouded at this reference , ` she is but so-so .
Parsing [sent. 15479 len. 18]: And this , ' said Mr. Micawber , nodding his head sorrowfully , ` is the Bench !
Parsing [sent. 15480 len. 68]: Where , for the first time in many revolving years , the overwhelming pressure of pecuniary liabilities was not proclaimed , from day to day , by importune voices declining to vacate the passage ; where there was no knocker on the door for any creditor to appeal to ; where personal service of process was not required , and detainees were merely lodged at the gate !
Parsing [sent. 15481 len. 49]: Gentlemen , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` when the shadow of that iron-work on the summit of the brick structure has been reflected on the gravel of the Parade , I have seen my children thread the mazes of the intricate pattern , avoiding the dark marks .
Parsing [sent. 15482 len. 11]: I have been familiar with every stone in the place .
Parsing [sent. 15483 len. 14]: If I betray weakness , you will know how to excuse me . '
Parsing [sent. 15484 len. 55]: ` We have all got on in life since then , Mr. Micawber , ' said I. ` Mr. Copperfield , ' returned Mr. Micawber , bitterly , ` when I was an inmate of that retreat I could look my fellow-man in the face , and punch his head if he offended me .
Parsing [sent. 15485 len. 13]: My fellow-man and myself are no longer on those glorious terms ! '
Parsing [sent. 15486 len. 35]: Turning from the building in a downcast manner , Mr. Micawber accepted my proffered arm on one side , and the proffered arm of Traddles on the other , and walked away between us .
Parsing [sent. 15487 len. 45]: ` There are some landmarks , ' observed Mr. Micawber , looking fondly back over his shoulder , ` on the road to the tomb , which , but for the impiety of the aspiration , a man would wish never to have passed .
Parsing [sent. 15488 len. 10]: Such is the Bench in my chequered career . '
Parsing [sent. 15489 len. 17]: ` Oh , you are in low spirits , Mr. Micawber , ' said Traddles . '
Parsing [sent. 15490 len. 11]: I am , sir , ' interposed Mr. Micawber . '
Parsing [sent. 15491 len. 32]: I hope , ' said Traddles , ` it is not because you have conceived a dislike to the law -- for I am a lawyer myself , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 15492 len. 7]: Mr. Micawber answered not a word .
Parsing [sent. 15493 len. 11]: ` How is our friend Heep , Mr. Micawber ? '
Parsing [sent. 15494 len. 7]: said I , after a silence .
Parsing [sent. 15495 len. 54]: ` My dear Copperfield , ' returned Mr. Micawber , bursting into a state of much excitement , and turning pale , ` if you ask after my employer as your friend , I am sorry for it ; if you ask after him as My friend , I sardonically smile at it .
Parsing [sent. 15496 len. 43]: In whatever capacity you ask after my employer , I beg , without offence to you , to limit my reply to this -- that whatever his state of health may be , his appearance is foxy : not to say diabolical .
Parsing [sent. 15497 len. 31]: You will allow me , as a private individual , to decline pursuing a subject which has lashed me to the utmost verge of desperation in my professional capacity . '
Parsing [sent. 15498 len. 17]: I expressed my regret for having innocently touched upon a theme that roused him so much .
Parsing [sent. 15499 len. 29]: ` May I ask , ' said I , ` without any hazard of repeating the mistake , how my old friends Mr. and Miss Wickfield are ? '
Parsing [sent. 15500 len. 29]: ` Miss Wickfield , ' said Mr. Micawber , now turning red , ` is , as she always is , a pattern , and a bright example .
Parsing [sent. 15501 len. 15]: My dear Copperfield , she is the only starry spot in a miserable existence .
Parsing [sent. 15502 len. 26]: My respect for that young lady , my admiration of her character , my devotion to her for her love and truth , and goodness !
Parsing [sent. 15503 len. 34]: -- Take me , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` down a turning , for , upon my soul , in my present state of mind I am not equal to this ! '
Parsing [sent. 15504 len. 25]: We wheeled him off into a narrow street , where he took out his pocket-handkerchief , and stood with his back to a wall .
Parsing [sent. 15505 len. 22]: If I looked as gravely at him as Traddles did , he must have found our company by no means inspiriting .
Parsing [sent. 15506 len. 52]: ` It is my fate , ' said Mr. Micawber , unfeignedly sobbing , but doing even that , with a shadow of the old expression of doing something genteel ; ` it is my fate , gentlemen , that the finer feelings of our nature have become reproaches to me .
Parsing [sent. 15507 len. 15]: My homage to Miss Wickfield , is a flight of arrows in my bosom .
Parsing [sent. 15508 len. 18]: You had better leave me , if you please , to walk the earth as a vagabond .
Parsing [sent. 15509 len. 11]: The worm will settle my business in double-quick time . '
Parsing [sent. 15510 len. 50]: Without attending to this invocation , we stood by , until he put up his pocket-handkerchief , pulled up his shirt-collar , and , to delude any person in the neighbourhood who might have been observing him , hummed a tune with his hat very much on one side .
Parsing [sent. 15511 len. 48]: I then mentioned - not knowing what might be lost if we lost sight of him yet -- that it would give me great pleasure to introduce him to my aunt , if he would ride out to Highgate , where a bed was at his service .
Parsing [sent. 15512 len. 34]: ` You shall make us a glass of your own punch , Mr. Micawber , ' said I , ` and forget whatever you have on your mind , in pleasanter reminiscences . '
Parsing [sent. 15513 len. 32]: ` Or , if confiding anything to friends will be more likely to relieve you , you shall impart it to us , Mr. Micawber , ' said Traddles , prudently .
Parsing [sent. 15514 len. 16]: ` Gentlemen , ' returned Mr. Micawber , ` do with me as you will !
Parsing [sent. 15515 len. 34]: I am a straw upon the surface of the deep , and am tossed in all directions by the elephants -- I beg your pardon ; I should have said the elements . '
Parsing [sent. 15516 len. 29]: We walked on , arm-in-arm , again ; found the coach in the act of starting ; and arrived at Highgate without encountering any difficulties by the way .
Parsing [sent. 15517 len. 25]: I was very uneasy and very uncertain in my mind what to say or do for the best -- so was Traddles , evidently .
Parsing [sent. 15518 len. 12]: Mr. Micawber was for the most part plunged into deep gloom .
Parsing [sent. 15519 len. 49]: He occasionally made an attempt to smarten himself , and hum the fag-end of a tune ; but his relapses into profound melancholy were only made the more impressive by the mockery of a hat exceedingly on one side , and a shirt-collar pulled up to his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 15520 len. 20]: We went to my aunt 's house rather than to mine , because of Dora 's not being well .
Parsing [sent. 15521 len. 17]: My aunt presented herself on being sent for , and welcomed Mr. Micawber with gracious cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 15522 len. 24]: Mr. Micawber kissed her hand , retired to the window , and pulling out his pocket-handkerchief , had a mental wrestle with himself .
Parsing [sent. 15523 len. 6]: Mr. Dick was at home .
Parsing [sent. 15524 len. 44]: He was by nature so exceedingly compassionate of anyone who seemed to be ill at ease , and was so quick to find any such person out , that he shook hands with Mr. Micawber , at least half-a-dozen times in five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 15525 len. 47]: To Mr. Micawber , in his trouble , this warmth , on the part of a stranger , was so extremely touching , that he could only say , on the occasion of each successive shake , ` My dear sir , you overpower me ! '
Parsing [sent. 15526 len. 19]: Which gratified Mr. Dick so much , that he went at it again with greater vigour than before .
Parsing [sent. 15527 len. 42]: ` The friendliness of this gentleman , ' said Mr. Micawber to my aunt , ` if you will allow me , ma'am , to cull a figure of speech from the vocabulary of our coarser national sports -- floors me .
Parsing [sent. 15528 len. 26]: To a man who is struggling with a complicated burden of perplexity and disquiet , such a reception is trying , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 15529 len. 20]: ` My friend Mr. Dick , ' replied my aunt proudly , ` is not a common man . '
Parsing [sent. 15530 len. 12]: ` That I am convinced of , ' said Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 15531 len. 6]: ` My dear sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 15532 len. 20]: for Mr. Dick was shaking hands with him again ; ' I am deeply sensible of your cordiality ! '
Parsing [sent. 15533 len. 8]: ` How do you find yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 15534 len. 9]: said Mr. Dick , with an anxious look .
Parsing [sent. 15535 len. 14]: ` Indifferent , my dear sir , ' returned Mr. Micawber , sighing .
Parsing [sent. 15536 len. 23]: ` You must keep up your spirits , ' said Mr. Dick , ` and make yourself as comfortable as possible . '
Parsing [sent. 15537 len. 22]: Mr. Micawber was quite overcome by these friendly words , and by finding Mr. Dick 's hand again within his own .
Parsing [sent. 15538 len. 43]: ` It has been my lot , ' he observed , ` to meet , in the diversified panorama of human existence , with an occasional oasis , but never with one so green , so gushing , as the present ! '
Parsing [sent. 15539 len. 56]: At another time I should have been amused by this ; but I felt that we were all constrained and uneasy , and I watched Mr. Micawber so anxiously , in his vacillations between an evident disposition to reveal something , and a counter-disposition to reveal nothing , that I was in a perfect fever .
Parsing [sent. 15540 len. 47]: Traddles , sitting on the edge of his chair , with his eyes wide open , and his hair more emphatically erect than ever , stared by turns at the ground and at Mr. Micawber , without so much as attempting to put in a word .
Parsing [sent. 15541 len. 52]: My aunt , though I saw that her shrewdest observation was concentrated on her new guest , had more useful possession of her wits than either of us ; for she held him in conversation , and made it necessary for him to talk , whether he liked it or not .
Parsing [sent. 15542 len. 21]: ` You are a very old friend of my nephew 's , Mr. Micawber , ' said my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 15543 len. 13]: I wish I had had the pleasure of seeing you before . '
Parsing [sent. 15544 len. 24]: ` Madam , ' returned Mr. Micawber , ' I wish I had had the honour of knowing you at an earlier period .
Parsing [sent. 15545 len. 13]: I was not always the wreck you at present behold . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15546 len. 17]: I hope Mrs. Micawber and your family are well , sir , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 15547 len. 6]: Mr. Micawber inclined his head .
Parsing [sent. 15548 len. 28]: ` They are as well , ma'am , ' he desperately observed after a pause , ` as Aliens and Outcasts can ever hope to be . '
Parsing [sent. 15549 len. 8]: ` Lord bless you , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 15550 len. 9]: exclaimed my aunt , in her abrupt way .
Parsing [sent. 15551 len. 8]: ` What are you talking about ? '
Parsing [sent. 15552 len. 20]: ` The subsistence of my family , ma'am , ' returned Mr. Micawber , ` trembles in the balance .
Parsing [sent. 15553 len. 39]: My employer -- ' Here Mr. Micawber provokingly left off ; and began to peel the lemons that had been under my directions set before him , together with all the other appliances he used in making punch .
Parsing [sent. 15554 len. 20]: ` Your employer , you know , ' said Mr. Dick , jogging his arm as a gentle reminder .
Parsing [sent. 15555 len. 22]: ` My good sir , ' returned Mr. Micawber , ` you recall me , I am obliged to you . '
Parsing [sent. 15556 len. 5]: They shook hands again .
Parsing [sent. 15557 len. 58]: ` My employer , ma'am -- Mr. Heep - once did me the favour to observe to me , that if I were not in the receipt of the stipendiary emoluments appertaining to my engagement with him , I should probably be a mountebank about the country , swallowing a sword-blade , and eating the devouring element .
Parsing [sent. 15558 len. 41]: For anything that I can perceive to the contrary , it is still probable that my children may be reduced to seek a livelihood by personal contortion , while Mrs. Micawber abets their unnatural feats by playing the barrel-organ . '
Parsing [sent. 15559 len. 38]: Mr. Micawber , with a random but expressive flourish of his knife , signified that these performances might be expected to take place after he was no more ; then resumed his peeling with a desperate air .
Parsing [sent. 15560 len. 22]: My aunt leaned her elbow on the little round table that she usually kept beside her , and eyed him attentively .
Parsing [sent. 15561 len. 85]: Notwithstanding the aversion with which I regarded the idea of entrapping him into any disclosure he was not prepared to make voluntarily , I should have taken him up at this point , but for the strange proceedings in which I saw him engaged ; whereof his putting the lemon-peel into the kettle , the sugar into the snuffer-tray , the spirit into the empty jug , and confidently attempting to pour boiling water out of a candlestick , were among the most remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 15562 len. 13]: I saw that a crisis was at hand , and it came .
Parsing [sent. 15563 len. 24]: He clattered all his means and implements together , rose from his chair , pulled out his pocket-handkerchief , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 15564 len. 32]: ` My dear Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber , behind his handkerchief , ` this is an occupation , of all others , requiring an untroubled mind , and self-respect .
Parsing [sent. 15565 len. 6]: I can not perform it .
Parsing [sent. 15566 len. 8]: It is out of the question . '
Parsing [sent. 15567 len. 14]: ` Mr. Micawber , ' said I , ` what is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 15568 len. 4]: Pray speak out .
Parsing [sent. 15569 len. 6]: You are among friends . '
Parsing [sent. 15570 len. 7]: ` Among friends , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 15571 len. 15]: repeated Mr. Micawber ; and all he had reserved came breaking out of him .
Parsing [sent. 15572 len. 22]: ` Good heavens , it is principally because I AM among friends that my state of mind is what it is .
Parsing [sent. 15573 len. 7]: What is the matter , gentlemen ?
Parsing [sent. 15574 len. 6]: What is NOT the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 15575 len. 33]: Villainy is the matter ; baseness is the matter ; deception , fraud , conspiracy , are the matter ; and the name of the whole atrocious mass is -- HEEP ! '
Parsing [sent. 15576 len. 17]: My aunt clapped her hands , and we all started up as if we were possessed .
Parsing [sent. 15577 len. 7]: ` The struggle is over ! '
Parsing [sent. 15578 len. 31]: said Mr. Micawber violently gesticulating with his pocket-handkerchief , and fairly striking out from time to time with both arms , as if he were swimming under superhuman difficulties . '
Parsing [sent. 15579 len. 8]: I will lead this life no longer .
Parsing [sent. 15580 len. 15]: I am a wretched being , cut off from everything that makes life tolerable .
Parsing [sent. 15581 len. 13]: I have been under a Taboo in that infernal scoundrel 's service .
Parsing [sent. 15582 len. 46]: Give me back my wife , give me back my family , substitute Micawber for the petty wretch who walks about in the boots at present on my feet , and call upon me to swallow a sword tomorrow , and I 'll do it .
Parsing [sent. 15583 len. 5]: With an appetite ! '
Parsing [sent. 15584 len. 11]: I never saw a man so hot in my life .
Parsing [sent. 15585 len. 28]: I tried to calm him , that we might come to something rational ; but he got hotter and hotter , and would n't hear a word .
Parsing [sent. 15586 len. 57]: ` I 'll put my hand in no man 's hand , ' said Mr. Micawber , gasping , puffing , and sobbing , to that degree that he was like a man fighting with cold water , ` until I have -- blown to fragments -- the - a -- detestable -- serpent -- HEEP !
Parsing [sent. 15587 len. 32]: I 'll partake of no one 's hospitality , until I have -- a -- moved Mount Vesuvius -- to eruption - on -- a -- the abandoned rascal -- HEEP !
Parsing [sent. 15588 len. 46]: Refreshment -- a -- underneath this roof -- particularly punch -- would -- a -- choke me -- unless -- I had -- previously -- choked the eyes -- out of the head -- a -- of -- interminable cheat , and liar -- HEEP !
Parsing [sent. 15589 len. 47]: I -- a - I 'll know nobody -- and -- a -- say nothing -- and -- a -- live nowhere -- until I have crushed -- to -- a -- undiscoverable atoms -- the -- transcendent and immortal hypocrite and perjurer -- HEEP ! '
Parsing [sent. 15590 len. 14]: I really had some fear of Mr. Micawber 's dying on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 15591 len. 120]: The manner in which he struggled through these inarticulate sentences , and , whenever he found himself getting near the name of Heep , fought his way on to it , dashed at it in a fainting state , and brought it out with a vehemence little less than marvellous , was frightful ; but now , when he sank into a chair , steaming , and looked at us , with every possible colour in his face that had no business there , and an endless procession of lumps following one another in hot haste up his throat , whence they seemed to shoot into his forehead , he had the appearance of being in the last extremity .
Parsing [sent. 15592 len. 21]: I would have gone to his assistance , but he waved me off , and would n't hear a word .
Parsing [sent. 15593 len. 5]: ` No , Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 15594 len. 24]: -- No communication -- a -- until -- Miss Wickfield - a -- redress from wrongs inflicted by consummate scoundrel -- HEEP ! '
Parsing [sent. 15595 len. 31]: -LRB- I am quite convinced he could not have uttered three words , but for the amazing energy with which this word inspired him when he felt it coming . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 15596 len. 74]: ` Inviolable secret -- a -- from the whole world - a -- no exceptions -- this day week -- a -- at breakfast-time -- a -- everybody present -- including aunt -- a -- and extremely friendly gentleman -- to be at the hotel at Canterbury -- a -- where -- Mrs. Micawber and myself -- Auld Lang Syne in chorus -- and -- a -- will expose intolerable ruffian -- HEEP !
Parsing [sent. 15597 len. 35]: No more to say -- a -- or listen to persuasion -- go immediately -- not capable -- a -- bear society -- upon the track of devoted and doomed traitor -- HEEP ! '
Parsing [sent. 15598 len. 59]: With this last repetition of the magic word that had kept him going at all , and in which he surpassed all his previous efforts , Mr. Micawber rushed out of the house ; leaving us in a state of excitement , hope , and wonder , that reduced us to a condition little better than his own .
Parsing [sent. 15599 len. 61]: But even then his passion for writing letters was too strong to be resisted ; for while we were yet in the height of our excitement , hope , and wonder , the following pastoral note was brought to me from a neighbouring tavern , at which he had called to write it : -- ` Most secret and confidential .
Parsing [sent. 15600 len. 28]: ` My DEAR SIR , ' I beg to be allowed to convey , through you , my apologies to your excellent aunt for my late excitement .
Parsing [sent. 15601 len. 23]: An explosion of a smouldering volcano long suppressed , was the result of an internal contest more easily conceived than described . '
Parsing [sent. 15602 len. 54]: I trust I rendered tolerably intelligible my appointment for the morning of this day week , at the house of public entertainment at Canterbury , where Mrs. Micawber and myself had once the honour of uniting our voices to yours , in the well-known strain of the Immortal exciseman nurtured beyond the Tweed .
Parsing [sent. 15603 len. 29]: ` The duty done , and act of reparation performed , which can alone enable me to contemplate my fellow mortal , I shall be known no more .
Parsing [sent. 15604 len. 44]: I shall simply require to be deposited in that place of universal resort , where Each in his narrow cell for ever laid , The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep , ' - With the plain Inscription , ` WILKINS MICAWBER . '
Parsing [sent. 15605 len. 28]: Chapter 50 Mr. Peggotty 's Dream Comes True By this time , some months had passed since our interview on the bank of the river with Martha .
Parsing [sent. 15606 len. 18]: I had never seen her since , but she had communicated with Mr. Peggotty on several occasions .
Parsing [sent. 15607 len. 35]: Nothing had come of her zealous intervention ; nor could I infer , from what he told me , that any clue had been obtained , for a moment , to Emily 's fate .
Parsing [sent. 15608 len. 26]: I confess that I began to despair of her recovery , and gradually to sink deeper and deeper into the belief that she was dead .
Parsing [sent. 15609 len. 5]: His conviction remained unchanged .
Parsing [sent. 15610 len. 30]: So far as I know -- and I believe his honest heart was transparent to me -- he never wavered again , in his solemn certainty of finding her .
Parsing [sent. 15611 len. 5]: His patience never tired .
Parsing [sent. 15612 len. 64]: And , although I trembled for the agony it might one day be to him to have his strong assurance shivered at a blow , there was something so religious in it , so affectingly expressive of its anchor being in the purest depths of his fine nature , that the respect and honour in which I held him were exalted every day .
Parsing [sent. 15613 len. 14]: His was not a lazy trustfulness that hoped , and did no more .
Parsing [sent. 15614 len. 35]: He had been a man of sturdy action all his life , and he knew that in all things wherein he wanted help he must do his own part faithfully , and help himself .
Parsing [sent. 15615 len. 37]: I have known him set out in the night , on a misgiving that the light might not be , by some accident , in the window of the old boat , and walk to Yarmouth .
Parsing [sent. 15616 len. 35]: I have known him , on reading something in the newspaper that might apply to her , take up his stick , and go forth on a journey of three - or four-score miles .
Parsing [sent. 15617 len. 24]: He made his way by sea to Naples , and back , after hearing the narrative to which Miss Dartle had assisted me .
Parsing [sent. 15618 len. 29]: All his journeys were ruggedly performed ; for he was always steadfast in a purpose of saving money for Emily 's sake , when she should be found .
Parsing [sent. 15619 len. 26]: In all this long pursuit , I never heard him repine ; I never heard him say he was fatigued , or out of heart .
Parsing [sent. 15620 len. 16]: Dora had often seen him since our marriage , and was quite fond of him .
Parsing [sent. 15621 len. 39]: I fancy his figure before me now , standing near her sofa , with his rough cap in his hand , and the blue eyes of my child-wife raised , with a timid wonder , to his face .
Parsing [sent. 15622 len. 82]: Sometimes of an evening , about twilight , when he came to talk with me , I would induce him to smoke his pipe in the garden , as we slowly paced to and fro together ; and then , the picture of his deserted home , and the comfortable air it used to have in my childish eyes of an evening when the fire was burning , and the wind moaning round it , came most vividly into my mind .
Parsing [sent. 15623 len. 50]: One evening , at this hour , he told me that he had found Martha waiting near his lodging on the preceding night when he came out , and that she had asked him not to leave London on any account , until he should have seen her again .
Parsing [sent. 15624 len. 8]: ` Did she tell you why ? '
Parsing [sent. 15625 len. 4]: I inquired . '
Parsing [sent. 15626 len. 39]: I asked her , Mas ' r Davy , ' he replied , ` but it is but few words as she ever says , and she on ' y got my promise and so went away . '
Parsing [sent. 15627 len. 14]: ` Did she say when you might expect to see her again ? '
Parsing [sent. 15628 len. 3]: I demanded .
Parsing [sent. 15629 len. 21]: ` No , Mas ' r Davy , ' he returned , drawing his hand thoughtfully down his face . '
Parsing [sent. 15630 len. 19]: I asked that too ; but it was more -LRB- she said -RRB- than she could tell . '
Parsing [sent. 15631 len. 33]: As I had long forborne to encourage him with hopes that hung on threads , I made no other comment on this information than that I supposed he would see her soon .
Parsing [sent. 15632 len. 18]: Such speculations as it engendered within me I kept to myself , and those were faint enough .
Parsing [sent. 15633 len. 16]: I was walking alone in the garden , one evening , about a fortnight afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 15634 len. 6]: I remember that evening well .
Parsing [sent. 15635 len. 12]: It was the second in Mr. Micawber 's week of suspense .
Parsing [sent. 15636 len. 17]: There had been rain all day , and there was a damp feeling in the air .
Parsing [sent. 15637 len. 34]: The leaves were thick upon the trees , and heavy with wet ; but the rain had ceased , though the sky was still dark ; and the hopeful birds were singing cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 15638 len. 57]: As I walked to and fro in the garden , and the twilight began to close around me , their little voices were hushed ; and that peculiar silence which belongs to such an evening in the country when the lightest trees are quite still , save for the occasional droppings from their boughs , prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 15639 len. 38]: There was a little green perspective of trellis-work and ivy at the side of our cottage , through which I could see , from the garden where I was walking , into the road before the house .
Parsing [sent. 15640 len. 31]: I happened to turn my eyes towards this place , as I was thinking of many things ; and I saw a figure beyond , dressed in a plain cloak .
Parsing [sent. 15641 len. 10]: It was bending eagerly towards me , and beckoning .
Parsing [sent. 15642 len. 4]: ` Martha ! '
Parsing [sent. 15643 len. 7]: said I , going to it .
Parsing [sent. 15644 len. 8]: ` Can you come with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 15645 len. 9]: she inquired , in an agitated whisper . '
Parsing [sent. 15646 len. 13]: I have been to him , and he is not at home .
Parsing [sent. 15647 len. 20]: I wrote down where he was to come , and left it on his table with my own hand .
Parsing [sent. 15648 len. 9]: They said he would not be out long .
Parsing [sent. 15649 len. 6]: I have tidings for him .
Parsing [sent. 15650 len. 6]: Can you come directly ? '
Parsing [sent. 15651 len. 12]: My answer was , to pass out at the gate immediately .
Parsing [sent. 15652 len. 38]: She made a hasty gesture with her hand , as if to entreat my patience and my silence , and turned towards London , whence , as her dress betokened , she had come expeditiously on foot .
Parsing [sent. 15653 len. 10]: I asked her if that were not our destination ?
Parsing [sent. 15654 len. 29]: On her motioning Yes , with the same hasty gesture as before , I stopped an empty coach that was coming by , and we got into it .
Parsing [sent. 15655 len. 20]: When I asked her where the coachman was to drive , she answered , ` Anywhere near Golden Square !
Parsing [sent. 15656 len. 4]: And quick ! '
Parsing [sent. 15657 len. 32]: -- then shrunk into a corner , with one trembling hand before her face , and the other making the former gesture , as if she could not bear a voice .
Parsing [sent. 15658 len. 22]: Now much disturbed , and dazzled with conflicting gleams of hope and dread , I looked at her for some explanation .
Parsing [sent. 15659 len. 35]: But seeing how strongly she desired to remain quiet , and feeling that it was my own natural inclination too , at such a time , I did not attempt to break the silence .
Parsing [sent. 15660 len. 8]: We proceeded without a word being spoken .
Parsing [sent. 15661 len. 32]: Sometimes she glanced out of the window , as though she thought we were going slowly , though indeed we were going fast ; but otherwise remained exactly as at first .
Parsing [sent. 15662 len. 34]: We alighted at one of the entrances to the Square she had mentioned , where I directed the coach to wait , not knowing but that we might have some occasion for it .
Parsing [sent. 15663 len. 58]: She laid her hand on my arm , and hurried me on to one of the sombre streets , of which there are several in that part , where the houses were once fair dwellings in the occupation of single families , but have , and had , long degenerated into poor lodgings let off in rooms .
Parsing [sent. 15664 len. 36]: Entering at the open door of one of these , and releasing my arm , she beckoned me to follow her up the common staircase , which was like a tributary channel to the street .
Parsing [sent. 15665 len. 6]: The house swarmed with inmates .
Parsing [sent. 15666 len. 31]: As we went up , doors of rooms were opened and people 's heads put out ; and we passed other people on the stairs , who were coming down .
Parsing [sent. 15667 len. 46]: In glancing up from the outside , before we entered , I had seen women and children lolling at the windows over flower-pots ; and we seemed to have attracted their curiosity , for these were principally the observers who looked out of their doors .
Parsing [sent. 15668 len. 34]: It was a broad panelled staircase , with massive balustrades of some dark wood ; cornices above the doors , ornamented with carved fruit and flowers ; and broad seats in the windows .
Parsing [sent. 15669 len. 35]: But all these tokens of past grandeur were miserably decayed and dirty ; rot , damp , and age , had weakened the flooring , which in many places was unsound and even unsafe .
Parsing [sent. 15670 len. 60]: Some attempts had been made , I noticed , to infuse new blood into this dwindling frame , by repairing the costly old wood-work here and there with common deal ; but it was like the marriage of a reduced old noble to a plebeian pauper , and each party to the ill-assorted union shrunk away from the other .
Parsing [sent. 15671 len. 16]: Several of the back windows on the staircase had been darkened or wholly blocked up .
Parsing [sent. 15672 len. 68]: In those that remained , there was scarcely any glass ; and , through the crumbling frames by which the bad air seemed always to come in , and never to go out , I saw , through other glassless windows , into other houses in a similar condition , and looked giddily down into a wretched yard , which was the common dust-heap of the mansion .
Parsing [sent. 15673 len. 9]: We proceeded to the top-storey of the house .
Parsing [sent. 15674 len. 28]: Two or three times , by the way , I thought I observed in the indistinct light the skirts of a female figure going up before us .
Parsing [sent. 15675 len. 33]: As we turned to ascend the last flight of stairs between us and the roof , we caught a full view of this figure pausing for a moment , at a door .
Parsing [sent. 15676 len. 10]: Then it turned the handle , and went in .
Parsing [sent. 15677 len. 6]: ` What 's this ! '
Parsing [sent. 15678 len. 7]: said Martha , in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 15679 len. 8]: ` She has gone into my room .
Parsing [sent. 15680 len. 7]: I do n't know her ! '
Parsing [sent. 15681 len. 4]: I knew her .
Parsing [sent. 15682 len. 11]: I had recognized her with amazement , for Miss Dartle .
Parsing [sent. 15683 len. 54]: I said something to the effect that it was a lady whom I had seen before , in a few words , to my conductress ; and had scarcely done so , when we heard her voice in the room , though not , from where we stood , what she was saying .
Parsing [sent. 15684 len. 60]: Martha , with an astonished look , repeated her former action , and softly led me up the stairs ; and then , by a little back-door which seemed to have no lock , and which she pushed open with a touch , into a small empty garret with a low sloping roof , little better than a cupboard .
Parsing [sent. 15685 len. 23]: Between this , and the room she had called hers , there was a small door of communication , standing partly open .
Parsing [sent. 15686 len. 19]: Here we stopped , breathless with our ascent , and she placed her hand lightly on my lips .
Parsing [sent. 15687 len. 37]: I could only see , of the room beyond , that it was pretty large ; that there was a bed in it ; and that there were some common pictures of ships upon the walls .
Parsing [sent. 15688 len. 17]: I could not see Miss Dartle , or the person whom we had heard her address .
Parsing [sent. 15689 len. 14]: Certainly , my companion could not , for my position was the best .
Parsing [sent. 15690 len. 8]: A dead silence prevailed for some moments .
Parsing [sent. 15691 len. 17]: Martha kept one hand on my lips , and raised the other in a listening attitude .
Parsing [sent. 15692 len. 25]: ` It matters little to me her not being at home , ' said Rosa Dartle haughtily , ' I know nothing of her .
Parsing [sent. 15693 len. 9]: It is you I come to see . '
Parsing [sent. 15694 len. 4]: ` Me ? '
Parsing [sent. 15695 len. 5]: replied a soft voice .
Parsing [sent. 15696 len. 13]: At the sound of it , a thrill went through my frame .
Parsing [sent. 15697 len. 6]: For it was Emily 's !
Parsing [sent. 15698 len. 17]: ` Yes , ' returned Miss Dartle , ' I have come to look at you .
Parsing [sent. 15699 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 15700 len. 14]: You are not ashamed of the face that has done so much ? '
Parsing [sent. 15701 len. 35]: The resolute and unrelenting hatred of her tone , its cold stern sharpness , and its mastered rage , presented her before me , as if I had seen her standing in the light .
Parsing [sent. 15702 len. 35]: I saw the flashing black eyes , and the passion-wasted figure ; and I saw the scar , with its white track cutting through her lips , quivering and throbbing as she spoke . '
Parsing [sent. 15703 len. 50]: I have come to see , ' she said , ` James Steerforth 's fancy ; the girl who ran away with him , and is the town-talk of the commonest people of her native place ; the bold , flaunting , practised companion of persons like James Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 15704 len. 12]: I want to know what such a thing is like . '
Parsing [sent. 15705 len. 32]: There was a rustle , as if the unhappy girl , on whom she heaped these taunts , ran towards the door , and the speaker swiftly interposed herself before it .
Parsing [sent. 15706 len. 9]: It was succeeded by a moment 's pause .
Parsing [sent. 15707 len. 21]: When Miss Dartle spoke again , it was through her set teeth , and with a stamp upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 15708 len. 5]: ` Stay there ! '
Parsing [sent. 15709 len. 18]: she said , ` or I 'll proclaim you to the house , and the whole street !
Parsing [sent. 15710 len. 28]: If you try to evade me , I 'll stop you , if it 's by the hair , and raise the very stones against you ! '
Parsing [sent. 15711 len. 12]: A frightened murmur was the only reply that reached my ears .
Parsing [sent. 15712 len. 4]: A silence succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 15713 len. 8]: I did not know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 15714 len. 37]: Much as I desired to put an end to the interview , I felt that I had no right to present myself ; that it was for Mr. Peggotty alone to see her and recover her .
Parsing [sent. 15715 len. 5]: Would he never come ?
Parsing [sent. 15716 len. 4]: I thought impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 15717 len. 4]: ` So ! '
Parsing [sent. 15718 len. 16]: said Rosa Dartle , with a contemptuous laugh , ' I see her at last !
Parsing [sent. 15719 len. 21]: Why , he was a poor creature to be taken by that delicate mock-modesty , and that hanging head ! '
Parsing [sent. 15720 len. 12]: ` Oh , for Heaven 's sake , spare me ! '
Parsing [sent. 15721 len. 3]: exclaimed Emily .
Parsing [sent. 15722 len. 27]: ` Whoever you are , you know my pitiable story , and for Heaven 's sake spare me , if you would be spared yourself ! '
Parsing [sent. 15723 len. 8]: ` If I would be spared ! '
Parsing [sent. 15724 len. 19]: returned the other fiercely ; ` what is there in common between US , do you think ! '
Parsing [sent. 15725 len. 16]: ` Nothing but our sex , ' said Emily , with a burst of tears .
Parsing [sent. 15726 len. 44]: ` And that , ' said Rosa Dartle , ` is so strong a claim , preferred by one so infamous , that if I had any feeling in my breast but scorn and abhorrence of you , it would freeze it up .
Parsing [sent. 15727 len. 3]: Our sex !
Parsing [sent. 15728 len. 10]: You are an honour to our sex ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 15729 len. 15]: I have deserved this , ' said Emily , ` but it 's dreadful !
Parsing [sent. 15730 len. 17]: Dear , dear lady , think what I have suffered , and how I am fallen !
Parsing [sent. 15731 len. 7]: Oh , Martha , come back !
Parsing [sent. 15732 len. 7]: Oh , home , home ! '
Parsing [sent. 15733 len. 29]: Miss Dartle placed herself in a chair , within view of the door , and looked downward , as if Emily were crouching on the floor before her .
Parsing [sent. 15734 len. 30]: Being now between me and the light , I could see her curled lip , and her cruel eyes intently fixed on one place , with a greedy triumph .
Parsing [sent. 15735 len. 8]: ` Listen to what I say ! '
Parsing [sent. 15736 len. 13]: she said ; ` and reserve your false arts for your dupes .
Parsing [sent. 15737 len. 10]: Do you hope to move me by your tears ?
Parsing [sent. 15738 len. 16]: No more than you could charm me by your smiles , you purchased slave . '
Parsing [sent. 15739 len. 10]: ` Oh , have some mercy on me ! '
Parsing [sent. 15740 len. 3]: cried Emily .
Parsing [sent. 15741 len. 13]: ` Show me some compassion , or I shall die mad ! '
Parsing [sent. 15742 len. 18]: ` It would be no great penance , ' said Rosa Dartle , ` for your crimes .
Parsing [sent. 15743 len. 8]: Do you know what you have done ?
Parsing [sent. 15744 len. 13]: Do you ever think of the home you have laid waste ? '
Parsing [sent. 15745 len. 19]: ` Oh , is there ever night or day , when I do n't think of it ! '
Parsing [sent. 15746 len. 42]: cried Emily ; and now I could just see her , on her knees , with her head thrown back , her pale face looking upward , her hands wildly clasped and held out , and her hair streaming about her .
Parsing [sent. 15747 len. 44]: ` Has there ever been a single minute , waking or sleeping , when it has n't been before me , just as it used to be in the lost days when I turned my back upon it for ever and for ever !
Parsing [sent. 15748 len. 6]: Oh , home , home !
Parsing [sent. 15749 len. 66]: Oh dear , dear uncle , if you ever could have known the agony your love would cause me when I fell away from good , you never would have shown it to me so constant , much as you felt it ; but would have been angry to me , at least once in my life , that I might have had some comfort !
Parsing [sent. 15750 len. 22]: I have none , none , no comfort upon earth , for all of them were always fond of me ! '
Parsing [sent. 15751 len. 26]: She dropped on her face , before the imperious figure in the chair , with an imploring effort to clasp the skirt of her dress .
Parsing [sent. 15752 len. 16]: Rosa Dartle sat looking down upon her , as inflexible as a figure of brass .
Parsing [sent. 15753 len. 41]: Her lips were tightly compressed , as if she knew that she must keep a strong constraint upon herself -- I write what I sincerely believe -- or she would be tempted to strike the beautiful form with her foot .
Parsing [sent. 15754 len. 21]: I saw her , distinctly , and the whole power of her face and character seemed forced into that expression .
Parsing [sent. 15755 len. 6]: -- Would he never come ?
Parsing [sent. 15756 len. 9]: ` The miserable vanity of these earth-worms ! '
Parsing [sent. 15757 len. 24]: she said , when she had so far controlled the angry heavings of her breast , that she could trust herself to speak .
Parsing [sent. 15758 len. 4]: ` YOUR home !
Parsing [sent. 15759 len. 33]: Do you imagine that I bestow a thought on it , or suppose you could do any harm to that low place , which money would not pay for , and handsomely ?
Parsing [sent. 15760 len. 3]: YOUR home !
Parsing [sent. 15761 len. 27]: You were a part of the trade of your home , and were bought and sold like any other vendible thing your people dealt in . '
Parsing [sent. 15762 len. 7]: ` Oh , not that ! '
Parsing [sent. 15763 len. 3]: cried Emily .
Parsing [sent. 15764 len. 30]: ` Say anything of me ; but do n't visit my disgrace and shame , more than I have done , on folks who are as honourable as you !
Parsing [sent. 15765 len. 22]: Have some respect for them , as you are a lady , if you have no mercy for me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15766 len. 41]: I speak , ' she said , not deigning to take any heed of this appeal , and drawing away her dress from the contamination of Emily 's touch , ' I speak of HIS home -- where I live .
Parsing [sent. 15767 len. 60]: Here , ' she said , stretching out her hand with her contemptuous laugh , and looking down upon the prostrate girl , ` is a worthy cause of division between lady-mother and gentleman-son ; of grief in a house where she would n't have been admitted as a kitchen-girl ; of anger , and repining , and reproach .
Parsing [sent. 15768 len. 30]: This piece of pollution , picked up from the water-side , to be made much of for an hour , and then tossed back to her original place ! '
Parsing [sent. 15769 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 15770 len. 3]: no ! '
Parsing [sent. 15771 len. 8]: cried Emily , clasping her hands together .
Parsing [sent. 15772 len. 29]: ` When he first came into my way -- that the day had never dawned upon me , and he had met me being carried to my grave !
Parsing [sent. 15773 len. 38]: -- I had been brought up as virtuous as you or any lady , and was going to be the wife of as good a man as you or any lady in the world can ever marry .
Parsing [sent. 15774 len. 27]: If you live in his home and know him , you know , perhaps , what his power with a weak , vain girl might be .
Parsing [sent. 15775 len. 58]: I do n't defend myself , but I know well , and he knows well , or he will know when he comes to die , and his mind is troubled with it , that he used all his power to deceive me , and that I believed him , trusted him , and loved him ! '
Parsing [sent. 15776 len. 40]: Rosa Dartle sprang up from her seat ; recoiled ; and in recoiling struck at her , with a face of such malignity , so darkened and disfigured by passion , that I had almost thrown myself between them .
Parsing [sent. 15777 len. 13]: The blow , which had no aim , fell upon the air .
Parsing [sent. 15778 len. 48]: As she now stood panting , looking at her with the utmost detestation that she was capable of expressing , and trembling from head to foot with rage and scorn , I thought I had never seen such a sight , and never could see such another .
Parsing [sent. 15779 len. 5]: ` YOU love him ?
Parsing [sent. 15780 len. 3]: You ? '
Parsing [sent. 15781 len. 24]: she cried , with her clenched hand , quivering as if it only wanted a weapon to stab the object of her wrath .
Parsing [sent. 15782 len. 8]: Emily had shrunk out of my view .
Parsing [sent. 15783 len. 5]: There was no reply .
Parsing [sent. 15784 len. 17]: ` And tell that to ME , ' she added , ` with your shameful lips ?
Parsing [sent. 15785 len. 8]: Why do n't they whip these creatures ?
Parsing [sent. 15786 len. 19]: If I could order it to be done , I would have this girl whipped to death . '
Parsing [sent. 15787 len. 10]: And so she would , I have no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 15788 len. 17]: I would not have trusted her with the rack itself , while that furious look lasted .
Parsing [sent. 15789 len. 32]: She slowly , very slowly , broke into a laugh , and pointed at Emily with her hand , as if she were a sight of shame for gods and men .
Parsing [sent. 15790 len. 5]: ` SHE love ! '
Parsing [sent. 15791 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 15792 len. 4]: ` THAT carrion !
Parsing [sent. 15793 len. 12]: And he ever cared for her , she 'd tell me .
Parsing [sent. 15794 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 15795 len. 8]: The liars that these traders are ! '
Parsing [sent. 15796 len. 9]: Her mockery was worse than her undisguised rage .
Parsing [sent. 15797 len. 17]: Of the two , I would have much preferred to be the object of the latter .
Parsing [sent. 15798 len. 17]: But , when she suffered it to break loose , it was only for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 15799 len. 22]: She had chained it up again , and however it might tear her within , she subdued it to herself . '
Parsing [sent. 15800 len. 34]: I came here , you pure fountain of love , ' she said , ` to see -- as I began by telling you -- what such a thing as you was like .
Parsing [sent. 15801 len. 4]: I was curious .
Parsing [sent. 15802 len. 4]: I am satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 15803 len. 39]: Also to tell you , that you had best seek that home of yours , with all speed , and hide your head among those excellent people who are expecting you , and whom your money will console .
Parsing [sent. 15804 len. 20]: When it 's all gone , you can believe , and trust , and love again , you know !
Parsing [sent. 15805 len. 23]: I thought you a broken toy that had lasted its time ; a worthless spangle that was tarnished , and thrown away .
Parsing [sent. 15806 len. 39]: But , finding you true gold , a very lady , and an ill-used innocent , with a fresh heart full of love and trustfulness -- which you look like , and is quite consistent with your story !
Parsing [sent. 15807 len. 8]: -- I have something more to say .
Parsing [sent. 15808 len. 12]: Attend to it ; for what I say I 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 15809 len. 9]: Do you hear me , you fairy spirit ?
Parsing [sent. 15810 len. 10]: What I say , I mean to do ! '
Parsing [sent. 15811 len. 28]: Her rage got the better of her again , for a moment ; but it passed over her face like a spasm , and left her smiling .
Parsing [sent. 15812 len. 16]: ` Hide yourself , ' she pursued , ` if not at home , somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 15813 len. 22]: Let it be somewhere beyond reach ; in some obscure life -- or , better still , in some obscure death .
Parsing [sent. 15814 len. 23]: I wonder , if your loving heart will not break , you have found no way of helping it to be still !
Parsing [sent. 15815 len. 8]: I have heard of such means sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 15816 len. 9]: I believe they may be easily found . '
Parsing [sent. 15817 len. 14]: A low crying , on the part of Emily , interrupted her here .
Parsing [sent. 15818 len. 14]: She stopped , and listened to it as if it were music . '
Parsing [sent. 15819 len. 28]: I am of a strange nature , perhaps , ' Rosa Dartle went on ; ` but I ca n't breathe freely in the air you breathe .
Parsing [sent. 15820 len. 5]: I find it sickly .
Parsing [sent. 15821 len. 16]: Therefore , I will have it cleared ; I will have it purified of you .
Parsing [sent. 15822 len. 20]: If you live here tomorrow , I 'll have your story and your character proclaimed on the common stair .
Parsing [sent. 15823 len. 30]: There are decent women in the house , I am told ; and it is a pity such a light as you should be among them , and concealed .
Parsing [sent. 15824 len. 48]: If , leaving here , you seek any refuge in this town in any character but your true one -LRB- which you are welcome to bear , without molestation from me -RRB- , the same service shall be done you , if I hear of your retreat .
Parsing [sent. 15825 len. 25]: Being assisted by a gentleman who not long ago aspired to the favour of your hand , I am sanguine as to that . '
Parsing [sent. 15826 len. 7]: Would he never , never come ?
Parsing [sent. 15827 len. 8]: How long was I to bear this ?
Parsing [sent. 15828 len. 7]: How long could I bear it ?
Parsing [sent. 15829 len. 8]: ` Oh me , oh me ! '
Parsing [sent. 15830 len. 32]: exclaimed the wretched Emily , in a tone that might have touched the hardest heart , I should have thought ; but there was no relenting in Rosa Dartle 's smile .
Parsing [sent. 15831 len. 10]: ` What , what , shall I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 15832 len. 4]: ` Do ? '
Parsing [sent. 15833 len. 4]: returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 15834 len. 8]: ` Live happy in your own reflections !
Parsing [sent. 15835 len. 26]: Consecrate your existence to the recollection of James Steerforth 's tenderness -- he would have made you his serving-man 's wife , would he not ?
Parsing [sent. 15836 len. 20]: -- or to feeling grateful to the upright and deserving creature who would have taken you as his gift .
Parsing [sent. 15837 len. 53]: Or , if those proud remembrances , and the consciousness of your own virtues , and the honourable position to which they have raised you in the eyes of everything that wears the human shape , will not sustain you , marry that good man , and be happy in his condescension .
Parsing [sent. 15838 len. 9]: If this will not do either , die !
Parsing [sent. 15839 len. 24]: There are doorways and dust-heaps for such deaths , and such despair -- find one , and take your flight to Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 15840 len. 9]: I heard a distant foot upon the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 15841 len. 8]: I knew it , I was certain .
Parsing [sent. 15842 len. 7]: It was his , thank God !
Parsing [sent. 15843 len. 19]: She moved slowly from before the door when she said this , and passed out of my sight .
Parsing [sent. 15844 len. 5]: ` But mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 15845 len. 50]: she added , slowly and sternly , opening the other door to go away , ' I am resolved , for reasons that I have and hatreds that I entertain , to cast you out , unless you withdraw from my reach altogether , or drop your pretty mask .
Parsing [sent. 15846 len. 19]: This is what I had to say ; and what I say , I mean to do ! '
Parsing [sent. 15847 len. 22]: The foot upon the stairs came nearer -- nearer -- passed her as she went down -- rushed into the room !
Parsing [sent. 15848 len. 4]: ` Uncle ! '
Parsing [sent. 15849 len. 7]: A fearful cry followed the word .
Parsing [sent. 15850 len. 19]: I paused a moment , and looking in , saw him supporting her insensible figure in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 15851 len. 21]: He gazed for a few seconds in the face ; then stooped to kiss it -- oh , how tenderly !
Parsing [sent. 15852 len. 8]: -- and drew a handkerchief before it .
Parsing [sent. 15853 len. 36]: ` Mas ' r Davy , ' he said , in a low tremulous voice , when it was covered , ' I thank my Heav ` nly Father as my dream 's come true !
Parsing [sent. 15854 len. 20]: I thank Him hearty for having guided of me , in His own ways , to my darling ! '
Parsing [sent. 15855 len. 39]: With those words he took her up in his arms ; and , with the veiled face lying on his bosom , and addressed towards his own , carried her , motionless and unconscious , down the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 15856 len. 63]: Chapter 51 The Beginning of a Longer Journey It was yet early in the morning of the following day , when , as I was walking in my garden with my aunt -LRB- who took little other exercise now , being so much in attendance on my dear Dora -RRB- , I was told that Mr. Peggotty desired to speak with me .
Parsing [sent. 15857 len. 44]: He came into the garden to meet me half-way , on my going towards the gate ; and bared his head , as it was always his custom to do when he saw my aunt , for whom he had a high respect .
Parsing [sent. 15858 len. 11]: I had been telling her all that had happened overnight .
Parsing [sent. 15859 len. 25]: Without saying a word , she walked up with a cordial face , shook hands with him , and patted him on the arm .
Parsing [sent. 15860 len. 16]: It was so expressively done , that she had no need to say a word .
Parsing [sent. 15861 len. 15]: Mr. Peggotty understood her quite as well as if she had said a thousand .
Parsing [sent. 15862 len. 29]: ` I 'll go in now , Trot , ' said my aunt , ` and look after Little Blossom , who will be getting up presently . '
Parsing [sent. 15863 len. 14]: ` Not along of my being heer , ma'am , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 15864 len. 4]: said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 15865 len. 43]: ` Unless my wits is gone a bahd 's neezing ' -- by which Mr. Peggotty meant to say , bird 's - nesting -- ` this morning , 't is along of me as you 're a-going to quit us ? '
Parsing [sent. 15866 len. 25]: ` You have something to say , my good friend , ' returned my aunt , ` and will do better without me . '
Parsing [sent. 15867 len. 34]: ` By your leave , ma'am , ' returned Mr. Peggotty , ' I should take it kind , pervising you doe n't mind my clicketten , if you 'd bide heer . '
Parsing [sent. 15868 len. 5]: ` Would you ? '
Parsing [sent. 15869 len. 8]: said my aunt , with short good-nature .
Parsing [sent. 15870 len. 9]: ` Then I am sure I will ! '
Parsing [sent. 15871 len. 42]: So , she drew her arm through Mr. Peggotty 's , and walked with him to a leafy little summer-house there was at the bottom of the garden , where she sat down on a bench , and I beside her .
Parsing [sent. 15872 len. 24]: There was a seat for Mr. Peggotty too , but he preferred to stand , leaning his hand on the small rustic table .
Parsing [sent. 15873 len. 51]: As he stood , looking at his cap for a little while before beginning to speak , I could not help observing what power and force of character his sinewy hand expressed , and what a good and trusty companion it was to his honest brow and iron-grey hair . '
Parsing [sent. 15874 len. 42]: I took my dear child away last night , ' Mr. Peggotty began , as he raised his eyes to ours , ` to my lodging , wheer I have a long time been expecting of her and preparing fur her .
Parsing [sent. 15875 len. 41]: It was hours afore she knowed me right ; and when she did , she kneeled down at my feet , and kiender said to me , as if it was her prayers , how it all come to be .
Parsing [sent. 15876 len. 60]: You may believe me , when I heerd her voice , as I had heerd at home so playful -- and see her humbled , as it might be in the dust our Saviour wrote in with his blessed hand -- I felt a wownd go to my ` art , in the midst of all its thankfulness . '
Parsing [sent. 15877 len. 21]: He drew his sleeve across his face , without any pretence of concealing why ; and then cleared his voice .
Parsing [sent. 15878 len. 16]: ` It war n't for long as I felt that ; for she was found .
Parsing [sent. 15879 len. 17]: I had on ' y to think as she was found , and it was gone .
Parsing [sent. 15880 len. 19]: I doe n't know why I do so much as mention of it now , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 15881 len. 39]: I did n't have it in my mind a minute ago , to say a word about myself ; but it come up so nat ` ral , that I yielded to it afore I was aweer . '
Parsing [sent. 15882 len. 20]: ` You are a self-denying soul , ' said my aunt , ` and will have your reward . '
Parsing [sent. 15883 len. 42]: Mr. Peggotty , with the shadows of the leaves playing athwart his face , made a surprised inclination of the head towards my aunt , as an acknowledgement of her good opinion ; then took up the thread he had relinquished .
Parsing [sent. 15884 len. 55]: ` When my Em ` ly took flight , ' he said , in stern wrath for the moment , ` from the house wheer she was made a prisoner by that theer spotted snake as Mas ' r Davy see , -- and his story 's trew , and may GOD confound him !
Parsing [sent. 15885 len. 8]: -- she took flight in the night .
Parsing [sent. 15886 len. 12]: It was a dark night , with a many stars a-shining .

Parsing [sent. 16007 len. 24]: You see , wen Missis Gummidge falls a-thinking of the old ` un , she a n't what you may call good company .
Parsing [sent. 16008 len. 55]: Betwixt you and me , Mas ' r Davy -- and you , ma'am - wen Mrs. Gummidge takes to wimicking , ' -- our old country word for crying , -- ` she 's liable to be considered to be , by them as did n't know the old ` un , peevish-like .

Parsing [sent. 16010 len. 7]: My aunt and I both acquiesced .

Parsing [sent. 16012 len. 31]: Theerfur ` ta n't my intentions to moor Missis Gummidge ` long with them , but to find a Beein ' fur her wheer she can fisherate for herself . '
Parsing [sent. 16013 len. 21]: -LRB- A Beein ' signifies , in that dialect , a home , and to fisherate is to provide . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 16014 len. 32]: ` Fur which purpose , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ' I means to make her a ` lowance afore I go , as 'll leave her pretty comfort ` ble .
Parsing [sent. 16015 len. 7]: She 's the faithfullest of creeturs .
Parsing [sent. 16016 len. 47]: ` Ta n't to be expected , of course , at her time of life , and being lone and lorn , as the good old Mawther is to be knocked about aboardship , and in the woods and wilds of a new and fur-away country .
Parsing [sent. 16017 len. 13]: So that 's what I 'm a-going to do with her . '
Parsing [sent. 16018 len. 4]: He forgot nobody .
Parsing [sent. 16019 len. 13]: He thought of everybody 's claims and strivings , but his own .
Parsing [sent. 16020 len. 28]: 'Em ` ly , ' he continued , ` will keep along with me -- poor child , she 's sore in need of peace and rest !
Parsing [sent. 16021 len. 11]: -- until such time as we goes upon our voyage .

Parsing [sent. 16023 len. 16]: My aunt nodded confirmation of this hope , and imparted great satisfaction to Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 16024 len. 43]: ` Theer 's one thing furder , Mas ' r Davy , ' said he , putting his hand in his breast-pocket , and gravely taking out the little paper bundle I had seen before , which he unrolled on the table .
Parsing [sent. 16025 len. 13]: ` Theer 's these here banknotes -- fifty pound , and ten .
Parsing [sent. 16026 len. 14]: To them I wish to add the money as she come away with .
Parsing [sent. 16027 len. 20]: I 've asked her about that -LRB- but not saying why -RRB- , and have added of it up .
Parsing [sent. 16028 len. 6]: I a n't a scholar .
Parsing [sent. 16029 len. 12]: Would you be so kind as see how 't is ? '
Parsing [sent. 16030 len. 23]: He handed me , apologetically for his scholarship , a piece of paper , and observed me while I looked it over .
Parsing [sent. 16031 len. 5]: It was quite right .
Parsing [sent. 16032 len. 13]: ` Thankee , sir , ' he said , taking it back .
Parsing [sent. 16033 len. 44]: ` This money , if you doe n't see objections , Mas ' r Davy , I shall put up jest afore I go , in a cover directed to him ; and put that up in another , directed to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 16034 len. 36]: I shall tell her , in no more wureds than I speak to you , what it 's the price on ; and that I 'm gone , and past receiving of it back . '
Parsing [sent. 16035 len. 32]: I told him that I thought it would be right to do so -- that I was thoroughly convinced it would be , since he felt it to be right . '
Parsing [sent. 16036 len. 43]: I said that theer was on ' y one thing furder , ' he proceeded with a grave smile , when he had made up his little bundle again , and put it in his pocket ; ` but theer was two .
Parsing [sent. 16037 len. 35]: I war n't sure in my mind , wen I come out this morning , as I could go and break to Ham , of my own self , what had so thankfully happened .
Parsing [sent. 16038 len. 59]: So I writ a letter while I was out , and put it in the post-office , telling of 'em how all was as 't is ; and that I should come down tomorrow to unload my mind of what little needs a-doing of down theer , and , most-like , take my farewell leave of Yarmouth . '
Parsing [sent. 16039 len. 12]: ` And do you wish me to go with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 16040 len. 10]: said I , seeing that he left something unsaid .
Parsing [sent. 16041 len. 20]: ` If you could do me that kind favour , Mas ' r Davy , ' he replied . '
Parsing [sent. 16042 len. 14]: I know the sight on you would cheer 'em up a bit . '
Parsing [sent. 16043 len. 39]: My little Dora being in good spirits , and very desirous that I should go -- as I found on talking it over with her -- I readily pledged myself to accompany him in accordance with his wish .
Parsing [sent. 16044 len. 20]: Next morning , consequently , we were on the Yarmouth coach , and again travelling over the old ground .
Parsing [sent. 16045 len. 46]: As we passed along the familiar street at night -- Mr. Peggotty , in despite of all my remonstrances , carrying my bag -- I glanced into Omer and Joram 's shop , and saw my old friend Mr. Omer there , smoking his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 16046 len. 27]: I felt reluctant to be present , when Mr. Peggotty first met his sister and Ham ; and made Mr. Omer my excuse for lingering behind .
Parsing [sent. 16047 len. 12]: ` How is Mr. Omer , after this long time ? '
Parsing [sent. 16048 len. 6]: said I , going in .
Parsing [sent. 16049 len. 28]: He fanned away the smoke of his pipe , that he might get a better view of me , and soon recognized me with great delight . '
Parsing [sent. 16050 len. 36]: I should get up , sir , to acknowledge such an honour as this visit , ' said he , ` only my limbs are rather out of sorts , and I am wheeled about .
Parsing [sent. 16051 len. 29]: With the exception of my limbs and my breath , howsoever , I am as hearty as a man can be , I 'm thankful to say . '
Parsing [sent. 16052 len. 24]: I congratulated him on his contented looks and his good spirits , and saw , now , that his easy-chair went on wheels .
Parsing [sent. 16053 len. 12]: ` It 's an ingenious thing , ai n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 16054 len. 18]: he inquired , following the direction of my glance , and polishing the elbow with his arm .
Parsing [sent. 16055 len. 17]: ` It runs as light as a feather , and tracks as true as a mail-coach .
Parsing [sent. 16056 len. 44]: Bless you , my little Minnie -- my grand-daughter you know , Minnie 's child -- puts her little strength against the back , gives it a shove , and away we go , as clever and merry as ever you see anything !
Parsing [sent. 16057 len. 19]: And I tell you what -- it 's a most uncommon chair to smoke a pipe in . '
Parsing [sent. 16058 len. 28]: I never saw such a good old fellow to make the best of a thing , and find out the enjoyment of it , as Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 16059 len. 37]: He was as radiant , as if his chair , his asthma , and the failure of his limbs , were the various branches of a great invention for enhancing the luxury of a pipe . '
Parsing [sent. 16060 len. 30]: I see more of the world , I can assure you , ' said Mr. Omer , ` in this chair , than ever I see out of it .
Parsing [sent. 16061 len. 20]: You 'd be surprised at the number of people that looks in of a day to have a chat .
Parsing [sent. 16062 len. 4]: You really would !
Parsing [sent. 16063 len. 23]: There 's twice as much in the newspaper , since I 've taken to this chair , as there used to be .
Parsing [sent. 16064 len. 18]: As to general reading , dear me , what a lot of it I do get through !
Parsing [sent. 16065 len. 11]: That 's what I feel so strong , you know !
Parsing [sent. 16066 len. 13]: If it had been my eyes , what should I have done ?
Parsing [sent. 16067 len. 13]: If it had been my ears , what should I have done ?
Parsing [sent. 16068 len. 9]: Being my limbs , what does it signify ?
Parsing [sent. 16069 len. 14]: Why , my limbs only made my breath shorter when I used 'em .
Parsing [sent. 16070 len. 49]: And now , if I want to go out into the street or down to the sands , I 've only got to call Dick , Joram 's youngest ` prentice , and away I go in my own carriage , like the Lord Mayor of London . '
Parsing [sent. 16071 len. 8]: He half suffocated himself with laughing here .
Parsing [sent. 16072 len. 6]: ` Lord bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 16073 len. 34]: said Mr. Omer , resuming his pipe , ' a man must take the fat with the lean ; that 's what he must make up his mind to , in this life .
Parsing [sent. 16074 len. 6]: Joram does a fine business .
Parsing [sent. 16075 len. 5]: Ex-cellent business ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 16076 len. 23]: I am very glad to hear it , ' said I. ' I knew you would be , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 16077 len. 9]: ` And Joram and Minnie are like Valentines .
Parsing [sent. 16078 len. 7]: What more can a man expect ?
Parsing [sent. 16079 len. 8]: What 's his limbs to that ! '
Parsing [sent. 16080 len. 24]: His supreme contempt for his own limbs , as he sat smoking , was one of the pleasantest oddities I have ever encountered .
Parsing [sent. 16081 len. 22]: ` And since I 've took to general reading , you 've took to general writing , eh , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 16082 len. 8]: said Mr. Omer , surveying me admiringly .
Parsing [sent. 16083 len. 10]: ` What a lovely work that was of yours !
Parsing [sent. 16084 len. 5]: What expressions in it !
Parsing [sent. 16085 len. 9]: I read it every word -- every word .
Parsing [sent. 16086 len. 6]: And as to feeling sleepy !
Parsing [sent. 16087 len. 5]: Not at all ! '
Parsing [sent. 16088 len. 20]: I laughingly expressed my satisfaction , but I must confess that I thought this association of ideas significant . '
Parsing [sent. 16089 len. 67]: I give you my word and honour , sir , ' said Mr. Omer , ` that when I lay that book upon the table , and look at it outside ; compact in three separate and indiwidual wollumes -- one , two , three ; I am as proud as Punch to think that I once had the honour of being connected with your family .
Parsing [sent. 16090 len. 17]: And dear me , it 's a long time ago , now , ai n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 16091 len. 4]: Over at Blunderstone .
Parsing [sent. 16092 len. 12]: With a pretty little party laid along with the other party .
Parsing [sent. 16093 len. 10]: And you quite a small party then , yourself .
Parsing [sent. 16094 len. 5]: Dear , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 16095 len. 9]: I changed the subject by referring to Emily .
Parsing [sent. 16096 len. 53]: After assuring him that I did not forget how interested he had always been in her , and how kindly he had always treated her , I gave him a general account of her restoration to her uncle by the aid of Martha ; which I knew would please the old man .
Parsing [sent. 16097 len. 26]: He listened with the utmost attention , and said , feelingly , when I had done : ' I am rejoiced at it , sir !
Parsing [sent. 16098 len. 13]: It 's the best news I have heard for many a day .
Parsing [sent. 16099 len. 6]: Dear , dear , dear !
Parsing [sent. 16100 len. 18]: And what 's going to be undertook for that unfortunate young woman , Martha , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 16101 len. 34]: ` You touch a point that my thoughts have been dwelling on since yesterday , ' said I , ` but on which I can give you no information yet , Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 16102 len. 17]: Mr. Peggotty has not alluded to it , and I have a delicacy in doing so .
Parsing [sent. 16103 len. 9]: I am sure he has not forgotten it .
Parsing [sent. 16104 len. 10]: He forgets nothing that is disinterested and good . '
Parsing [sent. 16105 len. 34]: ` Because you know , ' said Mr. Omer , taking himself up , where he had left off , ` whatever is done , I should wish to be a member of .
Parsing [sent. 16106 len. 15]: Put me down for anything you may consider right , and let me know .
Parsing [sent. 16107 len. 19]: I never could think the girl all bad , and I am glad to find she 's not .
Parsing [sent. 16108 len. 7]: So will my daughter Minnie be .
Parsing [sent. 16109 len. 26]: Young women are contradictory creatures in some things -- her mother was just the same as her -- but their hearts are soft and kind .
Parsing [sent. 16110 len. 10]: It 's all show with Minnie , about Martha .
Parsing [sent. 16111 len. 19]: Why she should consider it necessary to make any show , I do n't undertake to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 16112 len. 9]: But it 's all show , bless you .
Parsing [sent. 16113 len. 9]: She 'd do her any kindness in private .
Parsing [sent. 16114 len. 18]: So , put me down for whatever you may consider right , will you be so good ?
Parsing [sent. 16115 len. 10]: and drop me a line where to forward it .
Parsing [sent. 16116 len. 4]: Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 16117 len. 61]: said Mr. Omer , ` when a man is drawing on to a time of life , where the two ends of life meet ; when he finds himself , however hearty he is , being wheeled about for the second time , in a speeches of go-cart ; he should be over-rejoiced to do a kindness if he can .
Parsing [sent. 16118 len. 4]: He wants plenty .
Parsing [sent. 16119 len. 58]: And I do n't speak of myself , particular , ' said Mr. Omer , ` because , sir , the way I look at it is , that we are all drawing on to the bottom of the hill , whatever age we are , on account of time never standing still for a single moment .
Parsing [sent. 16120 len. 12]: So let us always do a kindness , and be over-rejoiced .
Parsing [sent. 16121 len. 5]: To be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 16122 len. 28]: He knocked the ashes out of his pipe , and put it on a ledge in the back of his chair , expressly made for its reception .
Parsing [sent. 16123 len. 40]: ` There 's Em ` ly 's cousin , him that she was to have been married to , ' said Mr. Omer , rubbing his hands feebly , ` as fine a fellow as there is in Yarmouth !
Parsing [sent. 16124 len. 20]: He 'll come and talk or read to me , in the evening , for an hour together sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 16125 len. 10]: That 's a kindness , I should call it !
Parsing [sent. 16126 len. 9]: All his life 's a kindness . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16127 len. 16]: I am going to see him now , ' said I. ` Are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 16128 len. 4]: said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 16129 len. 12]: ` Tell him I was hearty , and sent my respects .
Parsing [sent. 16130 len. 8]: Minnie and Joram 's at a ball .
Parsing [sent. 16131 len. 18]: They would be as proud to see you as I am , if they was at home .
Parsing [sent. 16132 len. 23]: Minnie wo n't hardly go out at all , you see , `` on account of father '' , as she says .
Parsing [sent. 16133 len. 20]: So I swore tonight , that if she did n't go , I 'd go to bed at six .
Parsing [sent. 16134 len. 32]: In consequence of which , ' Mr. Omer shook himself and his chair with laughter at the success of his device , ` she and Joram 's at a ball . '
Parsing [sent. 16135 len. 12]: I shook hands with him , and wished him good night .
Parsing [sent. 16136 len. 12]: ` Half a minute , sir , ' said Mr. Omer .
Parsing [sent. 16137 len. 20]: ` If you was to go without seeing my little elephant , you 'd lose the best of sights .
Parsing [sent. 16138 len. 7]: You never see such a sight !
Parsing [sent. 16139 len. 3]: Minnie ! '
Parsing [sent. 16140 len. 18]: A musical little voice answered , from somewhere upstairs , ' I am coming , grandfather ! '
Parsing [sent. 16141 len. 20]: and a pretty little girl with long , flaxen , curling hair , soon came running into the shop .
Parsing [sent. 16142 len. 18]: ` This is my little elephant , sir , ' said Mr. Omer , fondling the child .
Parsing [sent. 16143 len. 6]: ` Siamese breed , sir .
Parsing [sent. 16144 len. 6]: Now , little elephant ! '
Parsing [sent. 16145 len. 61]: The little elephant set the door of the parlour open , enabling me to see that , in these latter days , it was converted into a bedroom for Mr. Omer who could not be easily conveyed upstairs ; and then hid her pretty forehead , and tumbled her long hair , against the back of Mr. Omer 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 16146 len. 25]: ` The elephant butts , you know , sir , ' said Mr. Omer , winking , ` when he goes at a object .
Parsing [sent. 16147 len. 4]: Once , elephant .
Parsing [sent. 16148 len. 2]: Twice .
Parsing [sent. 16149 len. 4]: Three times ! '
Parsing [sent. 16150 len. 76]: At this signal , the little elephant , with a dexterity that was next to marvellous in so small an animal , whisked the chair round with Mr. Omer in it , and rattled it off , pell-mell , into the parlour , without touching the door-post : Mr. Omer indescribably enjoying the performance , and looking back at me on the road as if it were the triumphant issue of his life 's exertions .
Parsing [sent. 16151 len. 13]: After a stroll about the town I went to Ham 's house .
Parsing [sent. 16152 len. 40]: Peggotty had now removed here for good ; and had let her own house to the successor of Mr. Barkis in the carrying business , who had paid her very well for the good-will , cart , and horse .
Parsing [sent. 16153 len. 16]: I believe the very same slow horse that Mr. Barkis drove was still at work .
Parsing [sent. 16154 len. 26]: I found them in the neat kitchen , accompanied by Mrs. Gummidge , who had been fetched from the old boat by Mr. Peggotty himself .
Parsing [sent. 16155 len. 17]: I doubt if she could have been induced to desert her post , by anyone else .
Parsing [sent. 16156 len. 7]: He had evidently told them all .
Parsing [sent. 16157 len. 28]: Both Peggotty and Mrs. Gummidge had their aprons to their eyes , and Ham had just stepped out ` to take a turn on the beach ' .
Parsing [sent. 16158 len. 24]: He presently came home , very glad to see me ; and I hope they were all the better for my being there .
Parsing [sent. 16159 len. 31]: We spoke , with some approach to cheerfulness , of Mr. Peggotty 's growing rich in a new country , and of the wonders he would describe in his letters .
Parsing [sent. 16160 len. 17]: We said nothing of Emily by name , but distantly referred to her more than once .
Parsing [sent. 16161 len. 8]: Ham was the serenest of the party .
Parsing [sent. 16162 len. 34]: But , Peggotty told me , when she lighted me to a little chamber where the Crocodile book was lying ready for me on the table , that he always was the same .
Parsing [sent. 16163 len. 41]: She believed -LRB- she told me , crying -RRB- that he was broken-hearted ; though he was as full of courage as of sweetness , and worked harder and better than any boat-builder in any yard in all that part .
Parsing [sent. 16164 len. 31]: There were times , she said , of an evening , when he talked of their old life in the boat-house ; and then he mentioned Emily as a child .
Parsing [sent. 16165 len. 10]: But , he never mentioned her as a woman .
Parsing [sent. 16166 len. 18]: I thought I had read in his face that he would like to speak to me alone .
Parsing [sent. 16167 len. 20]: I therefore resolved to put myself in his way next evening , as he came home from his work .
Parsing [sent. 16168 len. 10]: Having settled this with myself , I fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 16169 len. 46]: That night , for the first time in all those many nights , the candle was taken out of the window , Mr. Peggotty swung in his old hammock in the old boat , and the wind murmured with the old sound round his head .
Parsing [sent. 16170 len. 55]: All next day , he was occupied in disposing of his fishing-boat and tackle ; in packing up , and sending to London by waggon , such of his little domestic possessions as he thought would be useful to him ; and in parting with the rest , or bestowing them on Mrs. Gummidge .
Parsing [sent. 16171 len. 7]: She was with him all day .
Parsing [sent. 16172 len. 30]: As I had a sorrowful wish to see the old place once more , before it was locked up , I engaged to meet them there in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 16173 len. 14]: But I so arranged it , as that I should meet Ham first .
Parsing [sent. 16174 len. 16]: It was easy to come in his way , as I knew where he worked .
Parsing [sent. 16175 len. 38]: I met him at a retired part of the sands , which I knew he would cross , and turned back with him , that he might have leisure to speak to me if he really wished .
Parsing [sent. 16176 len. 10]: I had not mistaken the expression of his face .
Parsing [sent. 16177 len. 30]: We had walked but a little way together , when he said , without looking at me : ` Mas ' r Davy , have you seen her ? '
Parsing [sent. 16178 len. 18]: ` Only for a moment , when she was in a swoon , ' I softly answered .
Parsing [sent. 16179 len. 25]: We walked a little farther , and he said : ` Mas ' r Davy , shall you see her , d'ye think ? '
Parsing [sent. 16180 len. 25]: ` It would be too painful to her , perhaps , ' said I. ' I have thowt of that , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 16181 len. 12]: ` So ` twould , sir , so ` twould . '
Parsing [sent. 16182 len. 59]: ` But , Ham , ' said I , gently , ` if there is anything that I could write to her , for you , in case I could not tell it ; if there is anything you would wish to make known to her through me ; I should consider it a sacred trust . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16183 len. 6]: I am sure o n't .
Parsing [sent. 16184 len. 8]: I thankee , sir , most kind !
Parsing [sent. 16185 len. 13]: I think theer is something I could wish said or wrote . '
Parsing [sent. 16186 len. 6]: ` What is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 16187 len. 14]: We walked a little farther in silence , and then he spoke . ''
Parsing [sent. 16188 len. 7]: Ta n't that I forgive her .
Parsing [sent. 16189 len. 7]: ` Ta n't that so much .
Parsing [sent. 16190 len. 20]: 'T is more as I beg of her to forgive me , for having pressed my affections upon her .
Parsing [sent. 16191 len. 60]: Odd times , I think that if I had n't had her promise fur to marry me , sir , she was that trustful of me , in a friendly way , that she 'd have told me what was struggling in her mind , and would have counselled with me , and I might have saved her . '
Parsing [sent. 16192 len. 5]: I pressed his hand .
Parsing [sent. 16193 len. 6]: ` Is that all ? '
Parsing [sent. 16194 len. 25]: ` Theer 's yet a something else , ' he returned , ` if I can say it , Mas ' r Davy . '
Parsing [sent. 16195 len. 16]: We walked on , farther than we had walked yet , before he spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 16196 len. 15]: He was not crying when he made the pauses I shall express by lines .
Parsing [sent. 16197 len. 11]: He was merely collecting himself to speak very plainly . '
Parsing [sent. 16198 len. 36]: I loved her -- and I love the mem ` ry of her -- too deep -- to be able to lead her to believe of my own self as I 'm a happy man .
Parsing [sent. 16199 len. 29]: I could only be happy -- by forgetting of her -- and I 'm afeerd I could n't hardly bear as she should be told I done that .
Parsing [sent. 16200 len. 140]: But if you , being so full of learning , Mas ' r Davy , could think of anything to say as might bring her to believe I was n't greatly hurt : still loving of her , and mourning for her : anything as might bring her to believe as I was not tired of my life , and yet was hoping fur to see her without blame , wheer the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest -- anything as would ease her sorrowful mind , and yet not make her think as I could ever marry , or as 't was possible that anyone could ever be to me what she was -- I should ask of you to say that -- with my prayers for her -- that was so dear . '
Parsing [sent. 16201 len. 24]: I pressed his manly hand again , and told him I would charge myself to do this as well as I could . '
Parsing [sent. 16202 len. 10]: I thankee , sir , ' he answered . ''
Parsing [sent. 16203 len. 8]: Twas kind of you to meet me .
Parsing [sent. 16204 len. 11]: 'T was kind of you to bear him company down .
Parsing [sent. 16205 len. 41]: Mas ' r Davy , I unnerstan ' very well , though my aunt will come to Lon ` on afore they sail , and they 'll unite once more , that I am not like to see him agen .
Parsing [sent. 16206 len. 8]: I fare to feel sure o n't .
Parsing [sent. 16207 len. 16]: We doe n't say so , but so ` twill be , and better so .
Parsing [sent. 16208 len. 35]: The last you see on him -- the very last -- will you give him the lovingest duty and thanks of the orphan , as he was ever more than a father to ? '
Parsing [sent. 16209 len. 8]: This I also promised , faithfully . '
Parsing [sent. 16210 len. 15]: I thankee agen , sir , ' he said , heartily shaking hands . '
Parsing [sent. 16211 len. 7]: I know wheer you 're a-going .
Parsing [sent. 16212 len. 3]: Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 16213 len. 27]: With a slight wave of his hand , as though to explain to me that he could not enter the old place , he turned away .
Parsing [sent. 16214 len. 47]: As I looked after his figure , crossing the waste in the moonlight , I saw him turn his face towards a strip of silvery light upon the sea , and pass on , looking at it , until he was a shadow in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 16215 len. 52]: The door of the boat-house stood open when I approached ; and , on entering , I found it emptied of all its furniture , saving one of the old lockers , on which Mrs. Gummidge , with a basket on her knee , was seated , looking at Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 16216 len. 40]: He leaned his elbow on the rough chimney-piece , and gazed upon a few expiring embers in the grate ; but he raised his head , hopefully , on my coming in , and spoke in a cheery manner .
Parsing [sent. 16217 len. 22]: ` Come , according to promise , to bid farewell to ` t , eh , Mas ' r Davy ? '
Parsing [sent. 16218 len. 8]: he said , taking up the candle .
Parsing [sent. 16219 len. 11]: ` Bare enough , now , a n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 16220 len. 25]: ` Indeed you have made good use of the time , ' said I. ` Why , we have not been idle , sir .
Parsing [sent. 16221 len. 37]: Missis Gummidge has worked like a -- I doe n't know what Missis Gummidge a n't worked like , ' said Mr. Peggotty , looking at her , at a loss for a sufficiently approving simile .
Parsing [sent. 16222 len. 12]: Mrs. Gummidge , leaning on her basket , made no observation .
Parsing [sent. 16223 len. 21]: ` Theer 's the very locker that you used to sit on , ` long with Em ` ly ! '
Parsing [sent. 16224 len. 8]: said Mr. Peggotty , in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 16225 len. 15]: ` I 'm a-going to carry it away with me , last of all .
Parsing [sent. 16226 len. 15]: And heer 's your old little bedroom , see , Mas ' r Davy !
Parsing [sent. 16227 len. 12]: A'most as bleak tonight , as ` art could wish ! '
Parsing [sent. 16228 len. 31]: In truth , the wind , though it was low , had a solemn sound , and crept around the deserted house with a whispered wailing that was very mournful .
Parsing [sent. 16229 len. 14]: Everything was gone , down to the little mirror with the oyster-shell frame .
Parsing [sent. 16230 len. 19]: I thought of myself , lying here , when that first great change was being wrought at home .
Parsing [sent. 16231 len. 11]: I thought of the blue-eyed child who had enchanted me .
Parsing [sent. 16232 len. 31]: I thought of Steerforth : and a foolish , fearful fancy came upon me of his being near at hand , and liable to be met at any turn . ''
Parsing [sent. 16233 len. 24]: Tis like to be long , ' said Mr. Peggotty , in a low voice , ` afore the boat finds new tenants .
Parsing [sent. 16234 len. 15]: They look upon ` t , down beer , as being unfortunate now ! '
Parsing [sent. 16235 len. 11]: ` Does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood ? '
Parsing [sent. 16236 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 16237 len. 12]: ` To a mast-maker up town , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 16238 len. 13]: ` I 'm a-going to give the key to him tonight . '
Parsing [sent. 16239 len. 48]: We looked into the other little room , and came back to Mrs. Gummidge , sitting on the locker , whom Mr. Peggotty , putting the light on the chimney-piece , requested to rise , that he might carry it outside the door before extinguishing the candle .
Parsing [sent. 16240 len. 44]: ` Dan ` l , ' said Mrs. Gummidge , suddenly deserting her basket , and clinging to his arm ` my dear Dan ` l , the parting words I speak in this house is , I must n't be left behind .
Parsing [sent. 16241 len. 13]: Doe n't ye think of leaving me behind , Dan ` l !
Parsing [sent. 16242 len. 10]: Oh , doe n't ye ever do it ! '
Parsing [sent. 16243 len. 30]: Mr. Peggotty , taken aback , looked from Mrs. Gummidge to me , and from me to Mrs. Gummidge , as if he had been awakened from a sleep .
Parsing [sent. 16244 len. 15]: ` Doe n't ye , dearest Dan ` l , doe n't ye ! '
Parsing [sent. 16245 len. 6]: cried Mrs. Gummidge , fervently .
Parsing [sent. 16246 len. 23]: ` Take me ` long with you , Dan ` l , take me ` long with you and Em ` ly !
Parsing [sent. 16247 len. 10]: I 'll be your servant , constant and trew .
Parsing [sent. 16248 len. 43]: If there 's slaves in them parts where you 're a-going , I 'll be bound to you for one , and happy , but doe n't ye leave me behind , Dan ` l , that 's a deary dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 16249 len. 33]: ` My good soul , ' said Mr. Peggotty , shaking his head , ` you doe n't know what a long voyage , and what a hard life 't is ! '
Parsing [sent. 16250 len. 10]: ` Yes , I do , Dan ` l !
Parsing [sent. 16251 len. 5]: I can guess ! '
Parsing [sent. 16252 len. 4]: cried Mrs. Gummidge .
Parsing [sent. 16253 len. 25]: ` But my parting words under this roof is , I shall go into the house and die , if I am not took .
Parsing [sent. 16254 len. 11]: I can dig , Dan ` l. I can work .
Parsing [sent. 16255 len. 5]: I can live hard .
Parsing [sent. 16256 len. 26]: I can be loving and patient now -- more than you think , Dan ` l , if you 'll on ' y try me .
Parsing [sent. 16257 len. 47]: I would n't touch the ` lowance , not if I was dying of want , Dan ' l Peggotty ; but I 'll go with you and Em ` ly , if you 'll on ' y let me , to the world 's end !
Parsing [sent. 16258 len. 29]: I know how 't is ; I know you think that I am lone and lorn ; but , deary love , ` ta n't so no more !
Parsing [sent. 16259 len. 24]: I ai n't sat here , so long , a-watching , and a-thinking of your trials , without some good being done me .
Parsing [sent. 16260 len. 11]: Mas ' r Davy , speak to him for me !
Parsing [sent. 16261 len. 35]: I knows his ways , and Em ` ly 's , and I knows their sorrows , and can be a comfort to 'em , some odd times , and labour for 'em allus !
Parsing [sent. 16262 len. 18]: Dan ` l , deary Dan ` l , let me go ` long with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 16263 len. 31]: And Mrs. Gummidge took his hand , and kissed it with a homely pathos and affection , in a homely rapture of devotion and gratitude , that he well deserved .
Parsing [sent. 16264 len. 34]: We brought the locker out , extinguished the candle , fastened the door on the outside , and left the old boat close shut up , a dark speck in the cloudy night .
Parsing [sent. 16265 len. 30]: Next day , when we were returning to London outside the coach , Mrs. Gummidge and her basket were on the seat behind , and Mrs. Gummidge was happy .
Parsing [sent. 16266 len. 45]: Chapter 52 I Assist at an Explosion When the time Mr. Micawber had appointed so mysteriously , was within four-and-twenty hours of being come , my aunt and I consulted how we should proceed ; for my aunt was very unwilling to leave Dora .
Parsing [sent. 16267 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 16268 len. 12]: how easily I carried Dora up and down stairs , now !
Parsing [sent. 16269 len. 33]: We were disposed , notwithstanding Mr. Micawber 's stipulation for my aunt 's attendance , to arrange that she should stay at home , and be represented by Mr. Dick and me .
Parsing [sent. 16270 len. 44]: In short , we had resolved to take this course , when Dora again unsettled us by declaring that she never would forgive herself , and never would forgive her bad boy , if my aunt remained behind , on any pretence . '
Parsing [sent. 16271 len. 18]: I wo n't speak to you , ' said Dora , shaking her curls at my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 16272 len. 6]: ` I 'll be disagreeable !
Parsing [sent. 16273 len. 10]: I 'll make Jip bark at you all day .
Parsing [sent. 16274 len. 20]: I shall be sure that you really are a cross old thing , if you do n't go ! '
Parsing [sent. 16275 len. 6]: ` Tut , Blossom ! '
Parsing [sent. 16276 len. 4]: laughed my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 16277 len. 11]: ` You know you ca n't do without me ! '
Parsing [sent. 16278 len. 10]: ` Yes , I can , ' said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 16279 len. 10]: ` You are no use to me at all .
Parsing [sent. 16280 len. 14]: You never run up and down stairs for me , all day long .
Parsing [sent. 16281 len. 35]: You never sit and tell me stories about Doady , when his shoes were worn out , and he was covered with dust -- oh , what a poor little mite of a fellow !
Parsing [sent. 16282 len. 16]: You never do anything at all to please me , do you , dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 16283 len. 17]: Dora made haste to kiss my aunt , and say , ` Yes , you do !
Parsing [sent. 16284 len. 6]: I 'm only joking ! '
Parsing [sent. 16285 len. 11]: - lest my aunt should think she really meant it .
Parsing [sent. 16286 len. 15]: ` But , aunt , ' said Dora , coaxingly , ` now listen .
Parsing [sent. 16287 len. 4]: You must go .
Parsing [sent. 16288 len. 16]: I shall tease you , 'till you let me have my own way about it .
Parsing [sent. 16289 len. 18]: I shall lead my naughty boy such a life , if he do n't make you go .
Parsing [sent. 16290 len. 12]: I shall make myself so disagreeable -- and so will Jip !
Parsing [sent. 16291 len. 25]: You 'll wish you had gone , like a good thing , for ever and ever so long , if you do n't go .
Parsing [sent. 16292 len. 28]: Besides , ' said Dora , putting back her hair , and looking wonderingly at my aunt and me , ` why should n't you both go ?
Parsing [sent. 16293 len. 7]: I am not very ill indeed .
Parsing [sent. 16294 len. 4]: Am I ? '
Parsing [sent. 16295 len. 8]: ` Why , what a question ! '
Parsing [sent. 16296 len. 4]: cried my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 16297 len. 6]: ` What a fancy ! '
Parsing [sent. 16298 len. 5]: said I. ` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 16299 len. 10]: I know I am a silly little thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 16300 len. 30]: said Dora , slowly looking from one of us to the other , and then putting up her pretty lips to kiss us as she lay upon her couch .
Parsing [sent. 16301 len. 24]: ` Well , then , you must both go , or I shall not believe you ; and then I shall cry ! '
Parsing [sent. 16302 len. 28]: I saw , in my aunt 's face , that she began to give way now , and Dora brightened again , as she saw it too .
Parsing [sent. 16303 len. 26]: ` You 'll come back with so much to tell me , that it 'll take at least a week to make me understand ! '
Parsing [sent. 16304 len. 3]: said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 16305 len. 23]: ` Because I know I sha n't understand , for a length of time , if there 's any business in it .
Parsing [sent. 16306 len. 11]: And there 's sure to be some business in it !
Parsing [sent. 16307 len. 33]: If there 's anything to add up , besides , I do n't know when I shall make it out ; and my bad boy will look so miserable all the time .
Parsing [sent. 16308 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 16309 len. 9]: Now you 'll go , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 16310 len. 20]: You 'll only be gone one night , and Jip will take care of me while you are gone .
Parsing [sent. 16311 len. 43]: Doady will carry me upstairs before you go , and I wo n't come down again till you come back ; and you shall take Agnes a dreadfully scolding letter from me , because she has never been to see us ! '
Parsing [sent. 16312 len. 36]: We agreed , without any more consultation , that we would both go , and that Dora was a little Impostor , who feigned to be rather unwell , because she liked to be petted .
Parsing [sent. 16313 len. 40]: She was greatly pleased , and very merry ; and we four , that is to say , my aunt , Mr. Dick , Traddles , and I , went down to Canterbury by the Dover mail that night .
Parsing [sent. 16314 len. 48]: At the hotel where Mr. Micawber had requested us to await him , which we got into , with some trouble , in the middle of the night , I found a letter , importing that he would appear in the morning punctually at half past nine .
Parsing [sent. 16315 len. 42]: After which , we went shivering , at that uncomfortable hour , to our respective beds , through various close passages ; which smelt as if they had been steeped , for ages , in a solution of soup and stables .
Parsing [sent. 16316 len. 27]: Early in the morning , I sauntered through the dear old tranquil streets , and again mingled with the shadows of the venerable gateways and churches .
Parsing [sent. 16317 len. 48]: The rooks were sailing about the cathedral towers ; and the towers themselves , overlooking many a long unaltered mile of the rich country and its pleasant streams , were cutting the bright morning air , as if there were no such thing as change on earth .
Parsing [sent. 16318 len. 87]: Yet the bells , when they sounded , told me sorrowfully of change in everything ; told me of their own age , and my pretty Dora 's youth ; and of the many , never old , who had lived and loved and died , while the reverberations of the bells had hummed through the rusty armour of the Black Prince hanging up within , and , motes upon the deep of Time , had lost themselves in air , as circles do in water .
Parsing [sent. 16319 len. 41]: I looked at the old house from the corner of the street , but did not go nearer to it , lest , being observed , I might unwittingly do any harm to the design I had come to aid .
Parsing [sent. 16320 len. 30]: The early sun was striking edgewise on its gables and lattice-windows , touching them with gold ; and some beams of its old peace seemed to touch my heart .
Parsing [sent. 16321 len. 32]: I strolled into the country for an hour or so , and then returned by the main street , which in the interval had shaken off its last night 's sleep .
Parsing [sent. 16322 len. 31]: Among those who were stirring in the shops , I saw my ancient enemy the butcher , now advanced to top-boots and a baby , and in business for himself .
Parsing [sent. 16323 len. 16]: He was nursing the baby , and appeared to be a benignant member of society .
Parsing [sent. 16324 len. 15]: We all became very anxious and impatient , when we sat down to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 16325 len. 20]: As it approached nearer and nearer to half past nine o'clock , our restless expectation of Mr. Micawber increased .
Parsing [sent. 16326 len. 73]: At last we made no more pretence of attending to the meal , which , except with Mr. Dick , had been a mere form from the first ; but my aunt walked up and down the room , Traddles sat upon the sofa affecting to read the paper with his eyes on the ceiling ; and I looked out of the window to give early notice of Mr. Micawber 's coming .
Parsing [sent. 16327 len. 24]: Nor had I long to watch , for , at the first chime of the half hour , he appeared in the street .
Parsing [sent. 16328 len. 18]: ` Here he is , ' said I , ` and not in his legal attire ! '
Parsing [sent. 16329 len. 38]: My aunt tied the strings of her bonnet -LRB- she had come down to breakfast in it -RRB- , and put on her shawl , as if she were ready for anything that was resolute and uncompromising .
Parsing [sent. 16330 len. 9]: Traddles buttoned his coat with a determined air .
Parsing [sent. 16331 len. 47]: Mr. Dick , disturbed by these formidable appearances , but feeling it necessary to imitate them , pulled his hat , with both hands , as firmly over his ears as he possibly could ; and instantly took it off again , to welcome Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 16332 len. 15]: ` Gentlemen , and madam , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` good morning !
Parsing [sent. 16333 len. 23]: My dear sir , ' to Mr. Dick , who shook hands with him violently , ` you are extremely good . '
Parsing [sent. 16334 len. 6]: ` Have you breakfasted ? '
Parsing [sent. 16335 len. 4]: said Mr. Dick .
Parsing [sent. 16336 len. 6]: ` Have a chop ! '
Parsing [sent. 16337 len. 11]: ` Not for the world , my good sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 16338 len. 27]: cried Mr. Micawber , stopping him on his way to the bell ; ` appetite and myself , Mr. Dixon , have long been strangers . '
Parsing [sent. 16339 len. 40]: Mr. Dixon was so well pleased with his new name , and appeared to think it so obliging in Mr. Micawber to confer it upon him , that he shook hands with him again , and laughed rather childishly .
Parsing [sent. 16340 len. 12]: ` Dick , ' said my aunt , ` attention ! '
Parsing [sent. 16341 len. 9]: Mr. Dick recovered himself , with a blush .
Parsing [sent. 16342 len. 39]: ` Now , sir , ' said my aunt to Mr. Micawber , as she put on her gloves , ` we are ready for Mount Vesuvius , or anything else , as soon as YOU please . '
Parsing [sent. 16343 len. 18]: ` Madam , ' returned Mr. Micawber , ' I trust you will shortly witness an eruption .
Parsing [sent. 16344 len. 23]: Mr. Traddles , I have your permission , I believe , to mention here that we have been in communication together ? '
Parsing [sent. 16345 len. 20]: ` It is undoubtedly the fact , Copperfield , ' said Traddles , to whom I looked in surprise .
Parsing [sent. 16346 len. 28]: ` Mr. Micawber has consulted me in reference to what he has in contemplation ; and I have advised him to the best of my judgement . '
Parsing [sent. 16347 len. 27]: ` Unless I deceive myself , Mr. Traddles , ' pursued Mr. Micawber , ` what I contemplate is a disclosure of an important nature . '
Parsing [sent. 16348 len. 8]: ` Highly so , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 16349 len. 87]: ` Perhaps , under such circumstances , madam and gentlemen , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` you will do me the favour to submit yourselves , for the moment , to the direction of one who , however unworthy to be regarded in any other light but as a Waif and Stray upon the shore of human nature , is still your fellow-man , though crushed out of his original form by individual errors , and the accumulative force of a combination of circumstances ? '
Parsing [sent. 16350 len. 24]: ` We have perfect confidence in you , Mr. Micawber , ' said I , ` and will do what you please . '
Parsing [sent. 16351 len. 22]: ` Mr. Copperfield , ' returned Mr. Micawber , ` your confidence is not , at the existing juncture , ill-bestowed .
Parsing [sent. 16352 len. 42]: I would beg to be allowed a start of five minutes by the clock ; and then to receive the present company , inquiring for Miss Wickfield , at the office of Wickfield and Heep , whose Stipendiary I am . '
Parsing [sent. 16353 len. 14]: My aunt and I looked at Traddles , who nodded his approval . '
Parsing [sent. 16354 len. 17]: I have no more , ' observed Mr. Micawber , ` to say at present . '
Parsing [sent. 16355 len. 32]: With which , to my infinite surprise , he included us all in a comprehensive bow , and disappeared ; his manner being extremely distant , and his face extremely pale .
Parsing [sent. 16356 len. 50]: Traddles only smiled , and shook his head -LRB- with his hair standing upright on the top of it -RRB- , when I looked to him for an explanation ; so I took out my watch , and , as a last resource , counted off the five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 16357 len. 15]: My aunt , with her own watch in her hand , did the like .
Parsing [sent. 16358 len. 31]: When the time was expired , Traddles gave her his arm ; and we all went out together to the old house , without saying one word on the way .
Parsing [sent. 16359 len. 27]: We found Mr. Micawber at his desk , in the turret office on the ground floor , either writing , or pretending to write , hard .
Parsing [sent. 16360 len. 36]: The large office-ruler was stuck into his waistcoat , and was not so well concealed but that a foot or more of that instrument protruded from his bosom , like a new kind of shirt-frill .
Parsing [sent. 16361 len. 26]: As it appeared to me that I was expected to speak , I said aloud : ` How do you do , Mr. Micawber ? '
Parsing [sent. 16362 len. 20]: ` Mr. Copperfield , ' said Mr. Micawber , gravely , ' I hope I see you well ? '
Parsing [sent. 16363 len. 8]: ` Is Miss Wickfield at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 16364 len. 39]: said I. ` Mr. Wickfield is unwell in bed , sir , of a rheumatic fever , ' he returned ; ` but Miss Wickfield , I have no doubt , will be happy to see old friends .
Parsing [sent. 16365 len. 8]: Will you walk in , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 16366 len. 53]: He preceded us to the dining-room -- the first room I had entered in that house -- and flinging open the door of Mr. Wickfield 's former office , said , in a sonorous voice : ` Miss Trotwood , Mr. David Copperfield , Mr. Thomas Traddles , and Mr. Dixon ! '
Parsing [sent. 16367 len. 13]: I had not seen Uriah Heep since the time of the blow .
Parsing [sent. 16368 len. 20]: Our visit astonished him , evidently ; not the less , I dare say , because it astonished ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 16369 len. 46]: He did not gather his eyebrows together , for he had none worth mentioning ; but he frowned to that degree that he almost closed his small eyes , while the hurried raising of his grisly hand to his chin betrayed some trepidation or surprise .
Parsing [sent. 16370 len. 28]: This was only when we were in the act of entering his room , and when I caught a glance at him over my aunt 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 16371 len. 14]: A moment afterwards , he was as fawning and as humble as ever .
Parsing [sent. 16372 len. 11]: ` Well , I am sure , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 16373 len. 8]: ` This is indeed an unexpected pleasure !
Parsing [sent. 16374 len. 23]: To have , as I may say , all friends round St. Paul 's at once , is a treat unlooked for !
Parsing [sent. 16375 len. 33]: Mr. Copperfield , I hope I see you well , and -- if I may umbly express myself so -- friendly towards them as is ever your friends , whether or not .
Parsing [sent. 16376 len. 12]: Mrs. Copperfield , sir , I hope she 's getting on .
Parsing [sent. 16377 len. 25]: We have been made quite uneasy by the poor accounts we have had of her state , lately , I do assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 16378 len. 21]: I felt ashamed to let him take my hand , but I did not know yet what else to do .
Parsing [sent. 16379 len. 28]: ` Things are changed in this office , Miss Trotwood , since I was an umble clerk , and held your pony ; ai n't they ? '
Parsing [sent. 16380 len. 8]: said Uriah , with his sickliest smile .
Parsing [sent. 16381 len. 11]: ` But I am not changed , Miss Trotwood . '
Parsing [sent. 16382 len. 39]: ` Well , sir , ' returned my aunt , ` to tell you the truth , I think you are pretty constant to the promise of your youth ; if that 's any satisfaction to you . '
Parsing [sent. 16383 len. 23]: ` Thank you , Miss Trotwood , ' said Uriah , writhing in his ungainly manner , ` for your good opinion !
Parsing [sent. 16384 len. 13]: Micawber , tell 'em to let Miss Agnes know -- and mother .
Parsing [sent. 16385 len. 16]: Mother will be quite in a state , when she sees the present company ! '
Parsing [sent. 16386 len. 6]: said Uriah , setting chairs .
Parsing [sent. 16387 len. 10]: ` You are not busy , Mr. Heep ? '
Parsing [sent. 16388 len. 21]: said Traddles , whose eye the cunning red eye accidentally caught , as it at once scrutinized and evaded us .
Parsing [sent. 16389 len. 30]: ` No , Mr. Traddles , ' replied Uriah , resuming his official seat , and squeezing his bony hands , laid palm to palm between his bony knees .
Parsing [sent. 16390 len. 10]: ` Not so much so as I could wish .
Parsing [sent. 16391 len. 16]: But lawyers , sharks , and leeches , are not easily satisfied , you know !
Parsing [sent. 16392 len. 30]: Not but what myself and Micawber have our hands pretty full , in general , on account of Mr. Wickfield 's being hardly fit for any occupation , sir .
Parsing [sent. 16393 len. 20]: But it 's a pleasure as well as a duty , I am sure , to work for him .
Parsing [sent. 16394 len. 15]: You 've not been intimate with Mr. Wickfield , I think , Mr. Traddles ?
Parsing [sent. 16395 len. 15]: I believe I 've only had the honour of seeing you once myself ? '
Parsing [sent. 16396 len. 32]: ` No , I have not been intimate with Mr. Wickfield , ' returned Traddles ; ` or I might perhaps have waited on you long ago , Mr. Heep . '
Parsing [sent. 16397 len. 27]: There was something in the tone of this reply , which made Uriah look at the speaker again , with a very sinister and suspicious expression .
Parsing [sent. 16398 len. 49]: But , seeing only Traddles , with his good-natured face , simple manner , and hair on end , he dismissed it as he replied , with a jerk of his whole body , but especially his throat : ' I am sorry for that , Mr. Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 16399 len. 12]: You would have admired him as much as we all do .
Parsing [sent. 16400 len. 13]: His little failings would only have endeared him to you the more .
Parsing [sent. 16401 len. 20]: But if you would like to hear my fellow-partner eloquently spoken of , I should refer you to Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 16402 len. 18]: The family is a subject he 's very strong upon , if you never heard him . '
Parsing [sent. 16403 len. 33]: I was prevented from disclaiming the compliment -LRB- if I should have done so , in any case -RRB- , by the entrance of Agnes , now ushered in by Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 16404 len. 20]: She was not quite so self-possessed as usual , I thought ; and had evidently undergone anxiety and fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 16405 len. 18]: But her earnest cordiality , and her quiet beauty , shone with the gentler lustre for it .
Parsing [sent. 16406 len. 25]: I saw Uriah watch her while she greeted us ; and he reminded me of an ugly and rebellious genie watching a good spirit .
Parsing [sent. 16407 len. 25]: In the meanwhile , some slight sign passed between Mr. Micawber and Traddles ; and Traddles , unobserved except by me , went out .
Parsing [sent. 16408 len. 11]: ` Do n't wait , Micawber , ' said Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 16409 len. 33]: Mr. Micawber , with his hand upon the ruler in his breast , stood erect before the door , most unmistakably contemplating one of his fellow-men , and that man his employer .
Parsing [sent. 16410 len. 8]: ` What are you waiting for ? '
Parsing [sent. 16411 len. 3]: said Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 16412 len. 3]: ` Micawber !
Parsing [sent. 16413 len. 11]: did you hear me tell you not to wait ? '
Parsing [sent. 16414 len. 4]: ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 16415 len. 6]: replied the immovable Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 16416 len. 8]: ` Then why DO you wait ? '
Parsing [sent. 16417 len. 3]: said Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 16418 len. 18]: ` Because I -- in short , choose , ' replied Mr. Micawber , with a burst .
Parsing [sent. 16419 len. 22]: Uriah 's cheeks lost colour , and an unwholesome paleness , still faintly tinged by his pervading red , overspread them .
Parsing [sent. 16420 len. 19]: He looked at Mr. Micawber attentively , with his whole face breathing short and quick in every feature .
Parsing [sent. 16421 len. 39]: ` You are a dissipated fellow , as all the world knows , ' he said , with an effort at a smile , ` and I am afraid you 'll oblige me to get rid of you .
Parsing [sent. 16422 len. 3]: Go along !
Parsing [sent. 16423 len. 8]: I 'll talk to you presently . '
Parsing [sent. 16424 len. 43]: ` If there is a scoundrel on this earth , ' said Mr. Micawber , suddenly breaking out again with the utmost vehemence , ` with whom I have already talked too much , that scoundrel 's name is -- HEEP ! '
Parsing [sent. 16425 len. 13]: Uriah fell back , as if he had been struck or stung .
Parsing [sent. 16426 len. 28]: Looking slowly round upon us with the darkest and wickedest expression that his face could wear , he said , in a lower voice : ` Oho !
Parsing [sent. 16427 len. 5]: This is a conspiracy !
Parsing [sent. 16428 len. 7]: You have met here by appointment !
Parsing [sent. 16429 len. 13]: You are playing Booty with my clerk , are you , Copperfield ?
Parsing [sent. 16430 len. 5]: Now , take care .
Parsing [sent. 16431 len. 7]: You 'll make nothing of this .
Parsing [sent. 16432 len. 9]: We understand each other , you and me .
Parsing [sent. 16433 len. 7]: There 's no love between us .
Parsing [sent. 16434 len. 26]: You were always a puppy with a proud stomach , from your first coming here ; and you envy me my rise , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 16435 len. 12]: None of your plots against me ; I 'll counterplot you !
Parsing [sent. 16436 len. 6]: Micawber , you be off .
Parsing [sent. 16437 len. 8]: I 'll talk to you presently . '
Parsing [sent. 16438 len. 18]: ` Mr. Micawber , ' said I , ` there is a sudden change in this fellow .
Parsing [sent. 16439 len. 26]: in more respects than the extraordinary one of his speaking the truth in one particular , which assures me that he is brought to bay .
Parsing [sent. 16440 len. 8]: Deal with him as he deserves ! '
Parsing [sent. 16441 len. 14]: ` You are a precious set of people , ai n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 16442 len. 72]: said Uriah , in the same low voice , and breaking out into a clammy heat , which he wiped from his forehead , with his long lean hand , ` to buy over my clerk , who is the very scum of society , -- as you yourself were , Copperfield , you know it , before anyone had charity on you , -- to defame me with his lies ?
Parsing [sent. 16443 len. 23]: Miss Trotwood , you had better stop this ; or I 'll stop your husband shorter than will be pleasant to you .
Parsing [sent. 16444 len. 14]: I wo n't know your story professionally , for nothing , old lady !
Parsing [sent. 16445 len. 20]: Miss Wickfield , if you have any love for your father , you had better not join that gang .
Parsing [sent. 16446 len. 9]: I 'll ruin him , if you do .
Parsing [sent. 16447 len. 4]: Now , come !
Parsing [sent. 16448 len. 10]: I have got some of you under the harrow .
Parsing [sent. 16449 len. 9]: Think twice , before it goes over you .
Parsing [sent. 16450 len. 16]: Think twice , you , Micawber , if you do n't want to be crushed .
Parsing [sent. 16451 len. 17]: I recommend you to take yourself off , and be talked to presently , you fool !
Parsing [sent. 16452 len. 7]: while there 's time to retreat .
Parsing [sent. 16453 len. 5]: Where 's mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 16454 len. 22]: he said , suddenly appearing to notice , with alarm , the absence of Traddles , and pulling down the bell-rope .
Parsing [sent. 16455 len. 11]: ` Fine doings in a person 's own house ! '
Parsing [sent. 16456 len. 23]: ` Mrs. Heep is here , sir , ' said Traddles , returning with that worthy mother of a worthy son . '
Parsing [sent. 16457 len. 13]: I have taken the liberty of making myself known to her . '
Parsing [sent. 16458 len. 10]: ` Who are you to make yourself known ? '
Parsing [sent. 16459 len. 3]: retorted Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 16460 len. 10]: ` And what do you want here ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 16461 len. 23]: I am the agent and friend of Mr. Wickfield , sir , ' said Traddles , in a composed and business-like way .
Parsing [sent. 16462 len. 23]: ` And I have a power of attorney from him in my pocket , to act for him in all matters . '
Parsing [sent. 16463 len. 34]: ` The old ass has drunk himself into a state of dotage , ' said Uriah , turning uglier than before , ` and it has been got from him by fraud ! '
Parsing [sent. 16464 len. 27]: ` Something has been got from him by fraud , I know , ' returned Traddles quietly ; ` and so do you , Mr. Heep .
Parsing [sent. 16465 len. 15]: We will refer that question , if you please , to Mr. Micawber . '
Parsing [sent. 16466 len. 5]: ` Ury -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 16467 len. 9]: Mrs. Heep began , with an anxious gesture .
Parsing [sent. 16468 len. 20]: ` YOU hold your tongue , mother , ' he returned ; ` least said , soonest mended . '
Parsing [sent. 16469 len. 23]: ` But , my Ury -- ' ` Will you hold your tongue , mother , and leave it to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 16470 len. 42]: Though I had long known that his servility was false , and all his pretences knavish and hollow , I had had no adequate conception of the extent of his hypocrisy , until I now saw him with his mask off .
Parsing [sent. 16471 len. 103]: The suddenness with which he dropped it , when he perceived that it was useless to him ; the malice , insolence , and hatred , he revealed ; the leer with which he exulted , even at this moment , in the evil he had done -- all this time being desperate too , and at his wits ' end for the means of getting the better of us -- though perfectly consistent with the experience I had of him , at first took even me by surprise , who had known him so long , and disliked him so heartily .
Parsing [sent. 16472 len. 43]: I say nothing of the look he conferred on me , as he stood eyeing us , one after another ; for I had always understood that he hated me , and I remembered the marks of my hand upon his cheek .
Parsing [sent. 16473 len. 77]: But when his eyes passed on to Agnes , and I saw the rage with which he felt his power over her slipping away , and the exhibition , in their disappointment , of the odious passions that had led him to aspire to one whose virtues he could never appreciate or care for , I was shocked by the mere thought of her having lived , an hour , within sight of such a man .
Parsing [sent. 16474 len. 41]: After some rubbing of the lower part of his face , and some looking at us with those bad eyes , over his grisly fingers , he made one more address to me , half whining , and half abusive .
Parsing [sent. 16475 len. 38]: ` You think it justifiable , do you , Copperfield , you who pride yourself so much on your honour and all the rest of it , to sneak about my place , eaves-dropping with my clerk ?
Parsing [sent. 16476 len. 44]: If it had been ME , I should n't have wondered ; for I do n't make myself out a gentleman -LRB- though I never was in the streets either , as you were , according to Micawber -RRB- , but being you !
Parsing [sent. 16477 len. 12]: -- And you 're not afraid of doing this , either ?
Parsing [sent. 16478 len. 27]: You do n't think at all of what I shall do , in return ; or of getting yourself into trouble for conspiracy and so forth ?
Parsing [sent. 16479 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 16480 len. 4]: We shall see !
Parsing [sent. 16481 len. 16]: Mr. What 's - your-name , you were going to refer some question to Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 16482 len. 5]: There 's your referee .
Parsing [sent. 16483 len. 8]: Why do n't you make him speak ?
Parsing [sent. 16484 len. 10]: He has learnt his lesson , I see . '
Parsing [sent. 16485 len. 49]: Seeing that what he said had no effect on me or any of us , he sat on the edge of his table with his hands in his pockets , and one of his splay feet twisted round the other leg , waiting doggedly for what might follow .
Parsing [sent. 16486 len. 27]: Mr. Micawber , whose impetuosity I had restrained thus far with the greatest difficulty , and who had repeatedly interposed with the first syllable Of SCOUN-drel !
Parsing [sent. 16487 len. 42]: without getting to the second , now burst forward , drew the ruler from his breast -LRB- apparently as a defensive weapon -RRB- , and produced from his pocket a foolscap document , folded in the form of a large letter .
Parsing [sent. 16488 len. 53]: Opening this packet , with his old flourish , and glancing at the contents , as if he cherished an artistic admiration of their style of composition , he began to read as follows : ' `` Dear Miss Trotwood and gentlemen -- '' ' ` Bless and save the man ! '
Parsing [sent. 16489 len. 8]: exclaimed my aunt in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 16490 len. 17]: ` He 'd write letters by the ream , if it was a capital offence ! '
Parsing [sent. 16491 len. 11]: Mr. Micawber , without hearing her , went on . '
Parsing [sent. 16492 len. 50]: `` In appearing before you to denounce probably the most consummate Villain that has ever existed , '' ' Mr. Micawber , without looking off the letter , pointed the ruler , like a ghostly truncheon , at Uriah Heep , ' `` I ask no consideration for myself .
Parsing [sent. 16493 len. 31]: The victim , from my cradle , of pecuniary liabilities to which I have been unable to respond , I have ever been the sport and toy of debasing circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 16494 len. 24]: Ignominy , Want , Despair , and Madness , have , collectively or separately , been the attendants of my career . '' '
Parsing [sent. 16495 len. 60]: The relish with which Mr. Micawber described himself as a prey to these dismal calamities , was only to be equalled by the emphasis with which he read his letter ; and the kind of homage he rendered to it with a roll of his head , when he thought he had hit a sentence very hard indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 16496 len. 59]: `` In an accumulation of Ignominy , Want , Despair , and Madness , I entered the office -- or , as our lively neighbour the Gaul would term it , the Bureau -- of the Firm , nominally conducted under the appellation of Wickfield and -- HEEP , but in reality , wielded by -- HEEP alone .
Parsing [sent. 16497 len. 13]: HEEP , and only HEEP , is the mainspring of that machine .
Parsing [sent. 16498 len. 15]: HEEP , and only HEEP , is the Forger and the Cheat . '' '
Parsing [sent. 16499 len. 25]: Uriah , more blue than white at these words , made a dart at the letter , as if to tear it in pieces .
Parsing [sent. 16500 len. 26]: Mr. Micawber , with a perfect miracle of dexterity or luck , caught his advancing knuckles with the ruler , and disabled his right hand .
Parsing [sent. 16501 len. 12]: It dropped at the wrist , as if it were broken .
Parsing [sent. 16502 len. 11]: The blow sounded as if it had fallen on wood .
Parsing [sent. 16503 len. 7]: ` The Devil take you ! '
Parsing [sent. 16504 len. 11]: said Uriah , writhing in a new way with pain .
Parsing [sent. 16505 len. 9]: ` I 'll be even with you . '
Parsing [sent. 16506 len. 32]: ` Approach me again , you -- you -- you HEEP of infamy , ' gasped Mr. Micawber , ` and if your head is human , I 'll break it .
Parsing [sent. 16507 len. 7]: Come on , come on ! '
Parsing [sent. 16508 len. 38]: I think I never saw anything more ridiculous -- I was sensible of it , even at the time -- than Mr. Micawber making broad-sword guards with the ruler , and crying , ` Come on ! '
Parsing [sent. 16509 len. 29]: while Traddles and I pushed him back into a corner , from which , as often as we got him into it , he persisted in emerging again .
Parsing [sent. 16510 len. 45]: His enemy , muttering to himself , after wringing his wounded hand for sometime , slowly drew off his neck-kerchief and bound it up ; then held it in his other hand , and sat upon his table with his sullen face looking down .
Parsing [sent. 16511 len. 15]: Mr. Micawber , when he was sufficiently cool , proceeded with his letter . '
Parsing [sent. 16512 len. 48]: `` The stipendiary emoluments in consideration of which I entered into the service of -- HEEP , '' ' always pausing before that word and uttering it with astonishing vigour , ' `` were not defined , beyond the pittance of twenty-two shillings and six per week .
Parsing [sent. 16513 len. 54]: The rest was left contingent on the value of my professional exertions ; in other and more expressive words , on the baseness of my nature , the cupidity of my motives , the poverty of my family , the general moral -LRB- or rather immoral -RRB- resemblance between myself and -- HEEP .
Parsing [sent. 16514 len. 33]: Need I say , that it soon became necessary for me to solicit from -- HEEP -- pecuniary advances towards the support of Mrs. Micawber , and our blighted but rising family ?
Parsing [sent. 16515 len. 13]: Need I say that this necessity had been foreseen by -- HEEP ?
Parsing [sent. 16516 len. 22]: That those advances were secured by I.O.U. 's and other similar acknowledgements , known to the legal institutions of this country ?
Parsing [sent. 16517 len. 18]: And that I thus became immeshed in the web he had spun for my reception ? '' '
Parsing [sent. 16518 len. 33]: Mr. Micawber 's enjoyment of his epistolary powers , in describing this unfortunate state of things , really seemed to outweigh any pain or anxiety that the reality could have caused him .
Parsing [sent. 16519 len. 36]: He read on : ' `` Then it was that -- HEEP -- began to favour me with just so much of his confidence , as was necessary to the discharge of his infernal business .
Parsing [sent. 16520 len. 23]: Then it was that I began , if I may so Shakespearianly express myself , to dwindle , peak , and pine .
Parsing [sent. 16521 len. 30]: I found that my services were constantly called into requisition for the falsification of business , and the mystification of an individual whom I will designate as Mr. W .
Parsing [sent. 16522 len. 46]: That Mr. W. was imposed upon , kept in ignorance , and deluded , in every possible way ; yet , that all this while , the ruffian -- HEEP -- was professing unbounded gratitude to , and unbounded friendship for , that much-abused gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 16523 len. 33]: This was bad enough ; but , as the philosophic Dane observes , with that universal applicability which distinguishes the illustrious ornament of the Elizabethan Era , worse remains behind ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 16524 len. 41]: Mr. Micawber was so very much struck by this happy rounding off with a quotation , that he indulged himself , and us , with a second reading of the sentence , under pretence of having lost his place . '
Parsing [sent. 16525 len. 67]: `` It is not my intention , '' ' he continued reading on , ' `` to enter on a detailed list , within the compass of the present epistle -LRB- though it is ready elsewhere -RRB- , of the various malpractices of a minor nature , affecting the individual whom I have denominated Mr. W. , to which I have been a tacitly consenting party .
Parsing [sent. 16526 len. 54]: My object , when the contest within myself between stipend and no stipend , baker and no baker , existence and non-existence , ceased , was to take advantage of my opportunities to discover and expose the major malpractices committed , to that gentleman 's grievous wrong and injury , by -- HEEP .
Parsing [sent. 16527 len. 65]: Stimulated by the silent monitor within , and by a no less touching and appealing monitor without -- to whom I will briefly refer as Miss W. -- I entered on a not unlaborious task of clandestine investigation , protracted -- now , to the best of my knowledge , information , and belief , over a period exceeding twelve calendar months . '' '
Parsing [sent. 16528 len. 26]: He read this passage as if it were from an Act of Parliament ; and appeared majestically refreshed by the sound of the words . '
Parsing [sent. 16529 len. 43]: `` My charges against -- HEEP , '' ' he read on , glancing at him , and drawing the ruler into a convenient position under his left arm , in case of need , ' `` are as follows . '' '
Parsing [sent. 16530 len. 9]: We all held our breath , I think .
Parsing [sent. 16531 len. 8]: I am sure Uriah held his . '
Parsing [sent. 16532 len. 55]: `` First , '' ' said Mr. Micawber , ' `` When Mr. W. 's faculties and memory for business became , through causes into which it is not necessary or expedient for me to enter , weakened and confused , -- HEEP -- designedly perplexed and complicated the whole of the official transactions .
Parsing [sent. 16533 len. 25]: When Mr. W. was least fit to enter on business , -- HEEP was always at hand to force him to enter on it .
Parsing [sent. 16534 len. 24]: He obtained Mr. W. 's signature under such circumstances to documents of importance , representing them to be other documents of no importance .
Parsing [sent. 16535 len. 52]: He induced Mr. W. to empower him to draw out , thus , one particular sum of trust-money , amounting to twelve six fourteen , two and nine , and employed it to meet pretended business charges and deficiencies which were either already provided for , or had never really existed .
Parsing [sent. 16536 len. 49]: He gave this proceeding , throughout , the appearance of having originated in Mr. W. 's own dishonest intention , and of having been accomplished by Mr. W. 's own dishonest act ; and has used it , ever since , to torture and constrain him . '' '
Parsing [sent. 16537 len. 10]: ` You shall prove this , you Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 16538 len. 11]: said Uriah , with a threatening shake of the head .
Parsing [sent. 16539 len. 7]: ` All in good time ! '
Parsing [sent. 16540 len. 32]: ` Ask -- HEEP -- Mr. Traddles , who lived in his house after him , ' said Mr. Micawber , breaking off from the letter ; ` will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 16541 len. 16]: ` The fool himself - and lives there now , ' said Uriah , disdainfully .
Parsing [sent. 16542 len. 25]: ` Ask -- HEEP -- if he ever kept a pocket-book in that house , ' said Mr. Micawber ; ` will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 16543 len. 17]: I saw Uriah 's lank hand stop , involuntarily , in the scraping of his chin .
Parsing [sent. 16544 len. 18]: ` Or ask him , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` if he ever burnt one there .
Parsing [sent. 16545 len. 33]: If he says yes , and asks you where the ashes are , refer him to Wilkins Micawber , and he will hear of something not at all to his advantage ! '
Parsing [sent. 16546 len. 35]: The triumphant flourish with which Mr. Micawber delivered himself of these words , had a powerful effect in alarming the mother ; who cried out , in much agitation : ` Ury , Ury !
Parsing [sent. 16547 len. 11]: Be umble , and make terms , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 16548 len. 4]: ` Mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 16549 len. 9]: he retorted , ` will you keep quiet ?
Parsing [sent. 16550 len. 16]: You 're in a fright , and do n't know what you say or mean .
Parsing [sent. 16551 len. 3]: Umble ! '
Parsing [sent. 16552 len. 31]: he repeated , looking at me , with a snarl ; ` I 've umbled some of 'em for a pretty long time back , umble as I was ! '
Parsing [sent. 16553 len. 18]: Mr. Micawber , genteelly adjusting his chin in his cravat , presently proceeded with his composition . '
Parsing [sent. 16554 len. 3]: `` Second .
Parsing [sent. 16555 len. 34]: HEEP has , on several occasions , to the best of my knowledge , information , and belief -- '' ' ` But that wo n't do , ' muttered Uriah , relieved .
Parsing [sent. 16556 len. 8]: ` Mother , you keep quiet . '
Parsing [sent. 16557 len. 28]: ` We will endeavour to provide something that WILL do , and do for you finally , sir , very shortly , ' replied Mr. Micawber . '
Parsing [sent. 16558 len. 3]: `` Second .
Parsing [sent. 16559 len. 52]: HEEP has , on several occasions , to the best of my knowledge , information , and belief , systematically forged , to various entries , books , and documents , the signature of Mr. W. ; and has distinctly done so in one instance , capable of proof by me .
Parsing [sent. 16560 len. 51]: To wit , in manner following , that is to say : '' ' Again , Mr. Micawber had a relish in this formal piling up of words , which , however ludicrously displayed in his case , was , I must say , not at all peculiar to him .
Parsing [sent. 16561 len. 17]: I have observed it , in the course of my life , in numbers of men .
Parsing [sent. 16562 len. 10]: It seems to me to be a general rule .
Parsing [sent. 16563 len. 61]: In the taking of legal oaths , for instance , deponents seem to enjoy themselves mightily when they come to several good words in succession , for the expression of one idea ; as , that they utterly detest , abominate , and abjure , or so forth ; and the old anathemas were made relishing on the same principle .
Parsing [sent. 16564 len. 46]: We talk about the tyranny of words , but we like to tyrannize over them too ; we are fond of having a large superfluous establishment of words to wait upon us on great occasions ; we think it looks important , and sounds well .
Parsing [sent. 16565 len. 48]: As we are not particular about the meaning of our liveries on state occasions , if they be but fine and numerous enough , so , the meaning or necessity of our words is a secondary consideration , if there be but a great parade of them .
Parsing [sent. 16566 len. 60]: And as individuals get into trouble by making too great a show of liveries , or as slaves when they are too numerous rise against their masters , so I think I could mention a nation that has got into many great difficulties , and will get into many greater , from maintaining too large a retinue of words .
Parsing [sent. 16567 len. 24]: Mr. Micawber read on , almost smacking his lips : ' `` To wit , in manner following , that is to say .
Parsing [sent. 16568 len. 146]: Mr. W. being infirm , and it being within the bounds of probability that his decease might lead to some discoveries , and to the downfall of -- HEEP 'S -- power over the W. family , -- as I , Wilkins Micawber , the undersigned , assume -- unless the filial affection of his daughter could be secretly influenced from allowing any investigation of the partnership affairs to be ever made , the said -- HEEP -- deemed it expedient to have a bond ready by him , as from Mr. W. , for the before-mentioned sum of twelve six fourteen , two and nine , with interest , stated therein to have been advanced by -- HEEP -- to Mr. W. to save Mr. W. from dishonour ; though really the sum was never advanced by him , and has long been replaced .
Parsing [sent. 16569 len. 24]: The signatures to this instrument purporting to be executed by Mr. W. and attested by Wilkins Micawber , are forgeries by -- HEEP .
Parsing [sent. 16570 len. 34]: I have , in my possession , in his hand and pocket-book , several similar imitations of Mr. W. 's signature , here and there defaced by fire , but legible to anyone .
Parsing [sent. 16571 len. 7]: I never attested any such document .
Parsing [sent. 16572 len. 13]: And I have the document itself , in my possession . '' '
Parsing [sent. 16573 len. 46]: Uriah Heep , with a start , took out of his pocket a bunch of keys , and opened a certain drawer ; then , suddenly bethought himself of what he was about , and turned again towards us , without looking in it . '
Parsing [sent. 16574 len. 61]: `` And I have the document , '' ' Mr. Micawber read again , looking about as if it were the text of a sermon , ' `` in my possession , -- that is to say , I had , early this morning , when this was written , but have since relinquished it to Mr. Traddles . '' '
Parsing [sent. 16575 len. 10]: ` It is quite true , ' assented Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 16576 len. 6]: ` Ury , Ury ! '
Parsing [sent. 16577 len. 11]: cried the mother , ` be umble and make terms .
Parsing [sent. 16578 len. 19]: I know my son will be umble , gentlemen , if you 'll give him time to think .
Parsing [sent. 16579 len. 18]: Mr. Copperfield , I 'm sure you know that he was always very umble , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 16580 len. 24]: It was singular to see how the mother still held to the old trick , when the son had abandoned it as useless .
Parsing [sent. 16581 len. 35]: ` Mother , ' he said , with an impatient bite at the handkerchief in which his hand was wrapped , ` you had better take and fire a loaded gun at me . '
Parsing [sent. 16582 len. 13]: ` But I love you , Ury , ' cried Mrs. Heep .
Parsing [sent. 16583 len. 32]: And I have no doubt she did ; or that he loved her , however strange it may appear ; though , to be sure , they were a congenial couple .
Parsing [sent. 16584 len. 19]: ` And I ca n't bear to hear you provoking the gentlemen , and endangering of yourself more .
Parsing [sent. 16585 len. 31]: I told the gentleman at first , when he told me upstairs it was come to light , that I would answer for your being umble , and making amends .
Parsing [sent. 16586 len. 17]: Oh , see how umble I am , gentlemen , and do n't mind him ! '
Parsing [sent. 16587 len. 67]: ` Why , there 's Copperfield , mother , ' he angrily retorted , pointing his lean finger at me , against whom all his animosity was levelled , as the prime mover in the discovery ; and I did not undeceive him ; ` there 's Copperfield , would have given you a hundred pound to say less than you 've blurted out ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 16588 len. 14]: I ca n't help it , Ury , ' cried his mother . '
Parsing [sent. 16589 len. 16]: I ca n't see you running into danger , through carrying your head so high .
Parsing [sent. 16590 len. 10]: Better be umble , as you always was . '
Parsing [sent. 16591 len. 29]: He remained for a little , biting the handkerchief , and then said to me with a scowl : ` What more have you got to bring forward ?
Parsing [sent. 16592 len. 8]: If anything , go on with it .
Parsing [sent. 16593 len. 9]: What do you look at me for ? '
Parsing [sent. 16594 len. 22]: Mr. Micawber promptly resumed his letter , glad to revert to a performance with which he was so highly satisfied . '
Parsing [sent. 16595 len. 3]: `` Third .
Parsing [sent. 16596 len. 3]: And last .
Parsing [sent. 16597 len. 122]: I am now in a condition to show , by -- HEEP 'S - false books , and -- HEEP 'S -- real memoranda , beginning with the partially destroyed pocket-book -LRB- which I was unable to comprehend , at the time of its accidental discovery by Mrs. Micawber , on our taking possession of our present abode , in the locker or bin devoted to the reception of the ashes calcined on our domestic hearth -RRB- , that the weaknesses , the faults , the very virtues , the parental affections , and the sense of honour , of the unhappy Mr. W. have been for years acted on by , and warped to the base purposes of - HEEP .
Parsing [sent. 16598 len. 31]: That Mr. W. has been for years deluded and plundered , in every conceivable manner , to the pecuniary aggrandisement of the avaricious , false , and grasping -- HEEP .
Parsing [sent. 16599 len. 38]: That the engrossing object of - HEEP -- was , next to gain , to subdue Mr. and Miss W. -LRB- of his ulterior views in reference to the latter I say nothing -RRB- entirely to himself .
Parsing [sent. 16600 len. 70]: That his last act , completed but a few months since , was to induce Mr. W. to execute a relinquishment of his share in the partnership , and even a bill of sale on the very furniture of his house , in consideration of a certain annuity , to be well and truly paid by -- HEEP -- on the four common quarter-days in each and every year .
Parsing [sent. 16601 len. 117]: That these meshes ; beginning with alarming and falsified accounts of the estate of which Mr. W. is the receiver , at a period when Mr. W. had launched into imprudent and ill-judged speculations , and may not have had the money , for which he was morally and legally responsible , in hand ; going on with pretended borrowings of money at enormous interest , really coming from -- HEEP - and by -- HEEP -- fraudulently obtained or withheld from Mr. W. himself , on pretence of such speculations or otherwise ; perpetuated by a miscellaneous catalogue of unscrupulous chicaneries -- gradually thickened , until the unhappy Mr. W. could see no world beyond .
Parsing [sent. 16602 len. 68]: Bankrupt , as he believed , alike in circumstances , in all other hope , and in honour , his sole reliance was upon the monster in the garb of man , '' ' -- Mr. Micawber made a good deal of this , as a new turn of expression , -- ' `` who , by making himself necessary to him , had achieved his destruction .
Parsing [sent. 16603 len. 7]: All this I undertake to show .
Parsing [sent. 16604 len. 6]: Probably much more ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 16605 len. 37]: I whispered a few words to Agnes , who was weeping , half joyfully , half sorrowfully , at my side ; and there was a movement among us , as if Mr. Micawber had finished .
Parsing [sent. 16606 len. 36]: He said , with exceeding gravity , ` Pardon me , ' and proceeded , with a mixture of the lowest spirits and the most intense enjoyment , to the peroration of his letter . '
Parsing [sent. 16607 len. 6]: `` I have now concluded .
Parsing [sent. 16608 len. 32]: It merely remains for me to substantiate these accusations ; and then , with my ill-starred family , to disappear from the landscape on which we appear to be an encumbrance .
Parsing [sent. 16609 len. 5]: That is soon done .
Parsing [sent. 16610 len. 33]: It may be reasonably inferred that our baby will first expire of inanition , as being the frailest member of our circle ; and that our twins will follow next in order .
Parsing [sent. 16611 len. 4]: So be it !
Parsing [sent. 16612 len. 23]: For myself , my Canterbury Pilgrimage has done much ; imprisonment on civil process , and want , will soon do more .
Parsing [sent. 16613 len. 99]: I trust that the labour and hazard of an investigation -- of which the smallest results have been slowly pieced together , in the pressure of arduous avocations , under grinding penurious apprehensions , at rise of morn , at dewy eve , in the shadows of night , under the watchful eye of one whom it were superfluous to call Demon -- combined with the struggle of parental Poverty to turn it , when completed , to the right account , may be as the sprinkling of a few drops of sweet water on my funeral pyre .
Parsing [sent. 16614 len. 5]: I ask no more .
Parsing [sent. 16615 len. 56]: Let it be , in justice , merely said of me , as of a gallant and eminent naval Hero , with whom I have no pretensions to cope , that what I have done , I did , in despite of mercenary and selfish objects , For England , home , and Beauty . '
Parsing [sent. 16616 len. 14]: `` Remaining always , & c. & c. , WILKINS MICAWBER . '' '
Parsing [sent. 16617 len. 34]: Much affected , but still intensely enjoying himself , Mr. Micawber folded up his letter , and handed it with a bow to my aunt , as something she might like to keep .
Parsing [sent. 16618 len. 21]: There was , as I had noticed on my first visit long ago , an iron safe in the room .
Parsing [sent. 16619 len. 6]: The key was in it .
Parsing [sent. 16620 len. 29]: A hasty suspicion seemed to strike Uriah ; and , with a glance at Mr. Micawber , he went to it , and threw the doors clanking open .
Parsing [sent. 16621 len. 4]: It was empty .
Parsing [sent. 16622 len. 7]: ` Where are the books ? '
Parsing [sent. 16623 len. 8]: he cried , with a frightful face .
Parsing [sent. 16624 len. 9]: ` Some thief has stolen the books ! '
Parsing [sent. 16625 len. 9]: Mr. Micawber tapped himself with the ruler . '
Parsing [sent. 16626 len. 25]: I did , when I got the key from you as usual -- but a little earlier -- and opened it this morning . '
Parsing [sent. 16627 len. 10]: ` Do n't be uneasy , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 16628 len. 8]: ` They have come into my possession .
Parsing [sent. 16629 len. 14]: I will take care of them , under the authority I mentioned . '
Parsing [sent. 16630 len. 10]: ` You receive stolen goods , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 16631 len. 3]: cried Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 16632 len. 13]: ` Under such circumstances , ' answered Traddles , ` yes . '
Parsing [sent. 16633 len. 35]: What was my astonishment when I beheld my aunt , who had been profoundly quiet and attentive , make a dart at Uriah Heep , and seize him by the collar with both hands !
Parsing [sent. 16634 len. 8]: ` You know what I want ? '
Parsing [sent. 16635 len. 5]: said my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 16636 len. 7]: A strait-waistcoat , ' said he .
Parsing [sent. 16637 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 16638 len. 4]: My property ! '
Parsing [sent. 16639 len. 4]: returned my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 16640 len. 55]: ` Agnes , my dear , as long as I believed it had been really made away with by your father , I would n't -- and , my dear , I did n't , even to Trot , as he knows -- breathe a syllable of its having been placed here for investment .
Parsing [sent. 16641 len. 18]: But , now I know this fellow 's answerable for it , and I 'll have it !
Parsing [sent. 16642 len. 11]: Trot , come and take it away from him ! '
Parsing [sent. 16643 len. 38]: Whether my aunt supposed , for the moment , that he kept her property in his neck-kerchief , I am sure I do n't know ; but she certainly pulled at it as if she thought so .
Parsing [sent. 16644 len. 32]: I hastened to put myself between them , and to assure her that we would all take care that he should make the utmost restitution of everything he had wrongly got .
Parsing [sent. 16645 len. 42]: This , and a few moments ' reflection , pacified her ; but she was not at all disconcerted by what she had done -LRB- though I can not say as much for her bonnet -RRB- and resumed her seat composedly .
Parsing [sent. 16646 len. 41]: During the last few minutes , Mrs. Heep had been clamouring to her son to be ` umble ' ; and had been going down on her knees to all of us in succession , and making the wildest promises .
Parsing [sent. 16647 len. 45]: Her son sat her down in his chair ; and , standing sulkily by her , holding her arm with his hand , but not rudely , said to me , with a ferocious look : ` What do you want done ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 16648 len. 13]: I will tell you what must be done , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 16649 len. 8]: ` Has that Copperfield no tongue ? '
Parsing [sent. 16650 len. 29]: muttered Uriah , ' I would do a good deal for you if you could tell me , without lying , that somebody had cut it out . '
Parsing [sent. 16651 len. 9]: ` My Uriah means to be umble ! '
Parsing [sent. 16652 len. 4]: cried his mother .
Parsing [sent. 16653 len. 12]: ` Do n't mind what he says , good gentlemen ! '
Parsing [sent. 16654 len. 14]: ` What must be done , ' said Traddles , ` is this .
Parsing [sent. 16655 len. 24]: First , the deed of relinquishment , that we have heard of , must be given over to me now - here . '
Parsing [sent. 16656 len. 12]: ` Suppose I have n't got it , ' he interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 16657 len. 22]: ` But you have , ' said Traddles ; ` therefore , you know , we wo n't suppose so . '
Parsing [sent. 16658 len. 38]: And I can not help avowing that this was the first occasion on which I really did justice to the clear head , and the plain , patient , practical good sense , of my old schoolfellow .
Parsing [sent. 16659 len. 31]: ` Then , ' said Traddles , ` you must prepare to disgorge all that your rapacity has become possessed of , and to make restoration to the last farthing .
Parsing [sent. 16660 len. 28]: All the partnership books and papers must remain in our possession ; all your books and papers ; all money accounts and securities , of both kinds .
Parsing [sent. 16661 len. 7]: In short , everything here . '
Parsing [sent. 16662 len. 4]: ` Must it ?
Parsing [sent. 16663 len. 11]: I do n't know that , ' said Uriah . '
Parsing [sent. 16664 len. 10]: I must have time to think about that . '
Parsing [sent. 16665 len. 57]: ` Certainly , ' replied Traddles ; ` but , in the meanwhile , and until everything is done to our satisfaction , we shall maintain possession of these things ; and beg you -- in short , compel you -- to keep to your own room , and hold no communication with anyone . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16666 len. 7]: I wo n't do it ! '
Parsing [sent. 16667 len. 7]: said Uriah , with an oath .
Parsing [sent. 16668 len. 49]: ` Maidstone jail is a safer place of detention , ' observed Traddles ; ` and though the law may be longer in righting us , and may not be able to right us so completely as you can , there is no doubt of its punishing YOU .
Parsing [sent. 16669 len. 12]: Dear me , you know that quite as well as I !
Parsing [sent. 16670 len. 18]: Copperfield , will you go round to the Guildhall , and bring a couple of officers ? '
Parsing [sent. 16671 len. 63]: Here , Mrs. Heep broke out again , crying on her knees to Agnes to interfere in their behalf , exclaiming that he was very humble , and it was all true , and if he did n't do what we wanted , she would , and much more to the same purpose ; being half frantic with fears for her darling .
Parsing [sent. 16672 len. 35]: To inquire what he might have done , if he had had any boldness , would be like inquiring what a mongrel cur might do , if it had the spirit of a tiger .
Parsing [sent. 16673 len. 32]: He was a coward , from head to foot ; and showed his dastardly nature through his sullenness and mortification , as much as at any time of his mean life .
Parsing [sent. 16674 len. 4]: ` Stop ! '
Parsing [sent. 16675 len. 14]: he growled to me ; and wiped his hot face with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 16676 len. 7]: ` Mother , hold your noise .
Parsing [sent. 16677 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 16678 len. 6]: Let 'em have that deed .
Parsing [sent. 16679 len. 6]: Go and fetch it ! '
Parsing [sent. 16680 len. 19]: ` Do you help her , Mr. Dick , ' said Traddles , ` if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 16681 len. 23]: Proud of his commission , and understanding it , Mr. Dick accompanied her as a shepherd 's dog might accompany a sheep .
Parsing [sent. 16682 len. 43]: But , Mrs. Heep gave him little trouble ; for she not only returned with the deed , but with the box in which it was , where we found a banker 's book and some other papers that were afterwards serviceable .
Parsing [sent. 16683 len. 4]: ` Good ! '
Parsing [sent. 16684 len. 8]: said Traddles , when this was brought .
Parsing [sent. 16685 len. 60]: ` Now , Mr. Heep , you can retire to think : particularly observing , if you please , that I declare to you , on the part of all present , that there is only one thing to be done ; that it is what I have explained ; and that it must be done without delay . '
Parsing [sent. 16686 len. 38]: Uriah , without lifting his eyes from the ground , shuffled across the room with his hand to his chin , and pausing at the door , said : ` Copperfield , I have always hated you .
Parsing [sent. 16687 len. 16]: You 've always been an upstart , and you 've always been against me . '
Parsing [sent. 16688 len. 33]: ` As I think I told you once before , ' said I , ` it is you who have been , in your greed and cunning , against all the world .
Parsing [sent. 16689 len. 35]: It may be profitable to you to reflect , in future , that there never were greed and cunning in the world yet , that did not do too much , and overreach themselves .
Parsing [sent. 16690 len. 8]: It is as certain as death . '
Parsing [sent. 16691 len. 67]: ` Or as certain as they used to teach at school -LRB- the same school where I picked up so much umbleness -RRB- , from nine o'clock to eleven , that labour was a curse ; and from eleven o'clock to one , that it was a blessing and a cheerfulness , and a dignity , and I do n't know what all , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 16692 len. 6]: said he with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 16693 len. 11]: ` You preach , about as consistent as they did .
Parsing [sent. 16694 len. 6]: Wo n't umbleness go down ?
Parsing [sent. 16695 len. 15]: I should n't have got round my gentleman fellow-partner without it , I think .
Parsing [sent. 16696 len. 13]: -- Micawber , you old bully , I 'll pay YOU ! '
Parsing [sent. 16697 len. 55]: Mr. Micawber , supremely defiant of him and his extended finger , and making a great deal of his chest until he had slunk out at the door , then addressed himself to me , and proffered me the satisfaction of ` witnessing the re-establishment of mutual confidence between himself and Mrs. Micawber ' .
Parsing [sent. 16698 len. 16]: After which , he invited the company generally to the contemplation of that affecting spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 16699 len. 44]: ` The veil that has long been interposed between Mrs. Micawber and myself , is now withdrawn , ' said Mr. Micawber ; ` and my children and the Author of their Being can once more come in contact on equal terms . '
Parsing [sent. 16700 len. 76]: As we were all very grateful to him , and all desirous to show that we were , as well as the hurry and disorder of our spirits would permit , I dare say we should all have gone , but that it was necessary for Agnes to return to her father , as yet unable to bear more than the dawn of hope ; and for someone else to hold Uriah in safe keeping .
Parsing [sent. 16701 len. 33]: So , Traddles remained for the latter purpose , to be presently relieved by Mr. Dick ; and Mr. Dick , my aunt , and I , went home with Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 16702 len. 56]: As I parted hurriedly from the dear girl to whom I owed so much , and thought from what she had been saved , perhaps , that morning -- her better resolution notwithstanding -- I felt devoutly thankful for the miseries of my younger days which had brought me to the knowledge of Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 16703 len. 40]: His house was not far off ; and as the street door opened into the sitting-room , and he bolted in with a precipitation quite his own , we found ourselves at once in the bosom of the family .
Parsing [sent. 16704 len. 7]: Mr. Micawber exclaiming , 'Em ma !
Parsing [sent. 16705 len. 4]: my life ! '
Parsing [sent. 16706 len. 7]: rushed into Mrs. Micawber 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 16707 len. 12]: Mrs. Micawber shrieked , and folded Mr. Micawber in her embrace .
Parsing [sent. 16708 len. 20]: Miss Micawber , nursing the unconscious stranger of Mrs. Micawber 's last letter to me , was sensibly affected .
Parsing [sent. 16709 len. 4]: The stranger leaped .
Parsing [sent. 16710 len. 12]: The twins testified their joy by several inconvenient but innocent demonstrations .
Parsing [sent. 16711 len. 30]: Master Micawber , whose disposition appeared to have been soured by early disappointment , and whose aspect had become morose , yielded to his better feelings , and blubbered .
Parsing [sent. 16712 len. 4]: 'Em ma ! '
Parsing [sent. 16713 len. 4]: said Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 16714 len. 9]: ` The cloud is past from my mind .
Parsing [sent. 16715 len. 19]: Mutual confidence , so long preserved between us once , is restored , to know no further interruption .
Parsing [sent. 16716 len. 6]: Now , welcome poverty ! '
Parsing [sent. 16717 len. 7]: cried Mr. Micawber , shedding tears .
Parsing [sent. 16718 len. 17]: ` Welcome misery , welcome houselessness , welcome hunger , rags , tempest , and beggary !
Parsing [sent. 16719 len. 10]: Mutual confidence will sustain us to the end ! '
Parsing [sent. 16720 len. 68]: With these expressions , Mr. Micawber placed Mrs. Micawber in a chair , and embraced the family all round ; welcoming a variety of bleak prospects , which appeared , to the best of my judgement , to be anything but welcome to them ; and calling upon them to come out into Canterbury and sing a chorus , as nothing else was left for their support .
Parsing [sent. 16721 len. 36]: But Mrs. Micawber having , in the strength of her emotions , fainted away , the first thing to be done , even before the chorus could be considered complete , was to recover her .
Parsing [sent. 16722 len. 21]: This my aunt and Mr. Micawber did ; and then my aunt was introduced , and Mrs. Micawber recognized me .
Parsing [sent. 16723 len. 47]: ` Excuse me , dear Mr. Copperfield , ' said the poor lady , giving me her hand , ` but I am not strong ; and the removal of the late misunderstanding between Mr. Micawber and myself was at first too much for me . '
Parsing [sent. 16724 len. 10]: ` Is this all your family , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 16725 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 16726 len. 13]: ` There are no more at present , ' returned Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 16727 len. 18]: ` Good gracious , I did n't mean that , ma'am , ' said my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 16728 len. 9]: I mean , are all these yours ? '
Parsing [sent. 16729 len. 16]: ` Madam , ' replied Mr. Micawber , ` it is a true bill . '
Parsing [sent. 16730 len. 26]: ` And that eldest young gentleman , now , ' said my aunt , musing , ` what has he been brought up to ? '
Parsing [sent. 16731 len. 40]: ` It was my hope when I came here , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` to have got Wilkins into the Church : or perhaps I shall express my meaning more strictly , if I say the Choir .
Parsing [sent. 16732 len. 45]: But there was no vacancy for a tenor in the venerable Pile for which this city is so justly eminent ; and he has -- in short , he has contracted a habit of singing in public-houses , rather than in sacred edifices . '
Parsing [sent. 16733 len. 14]: ` But he means well , ' said Mrs. Micawber , tenderly . '
Parsing [sent. 16734 len. 39]: I dare say , my love , ' rejoined Mr. Micawber , ` that he means particularly well ; but I have not yet found that he carries out his meaning , in any given direction whatsoever . '
Parsing [sent. 16735 len. 25]: Master Micawber 's moroseness of aspect returned upon him again , and he demanded , with some temper , what he was to do ?
Parsing [sent. 16736 len. 22]: Whether he had been born a carpenter , or a coach-painter , any more than he had been born a bird ?
Parsing [sent. 16737 len. 16]: Whether he could go into the next street , and open a chemist 's shop ?
Parsing [sent. 16738 len. 15]: Whether he could rush to the next assizes , and proclaim himself a lawyer ?
Parsing [sent. 16739 len. 16]: Whether he could come out by force at the opera , and succeed by violence ?
Parsing [sent. 16740 len. 13]: Whether he could do anything , without being brought up to something ?
Parsing [sent. 16741 len. 27]: My aunt mused a little while , and then said : ` Mr. Micawber , I wonder you have never turned your thoughts to emigration . '
Parsing [sent. 16742 len. 27]: ` Madam , ' returned Mr. Micawber , ` it was the dream of my youth , and the fallacious aspiration of my riper years . '
Parsing [sent. 16743 len. 20]: I am thoroughly persuaded , by the by , that he had never thought of it in his life .
Parsing [sent. 16744 len. 4]: ` Aye ? '
Parsing [sent. 16745 len. 10]: said my aunt , with a glance at me .
Parsing [sent. 16746 len. 28]: ` Why , what a thing it would be for yourselves and your family , Mr. and Mrs. Micawber , if you were to emigrate now . '
Parsing [sent. 16747 len. 14]: ` Capital , madam , capital , ' urged Mr. Micawber , gloomily .
Parsing [sent. 16748 len. 23]: ` That is the principal , I may say the only difficulty , my dear Mr. Copperfield , ' assented his wife .
Parsing [sent. 16749 len. 4]: ` Capital ? '
Parsing [sent. 16750 len. 4]: cried my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 16751 len. 53]: ` But you are doing us a great service -- have done us a great service , I may say , for surely much will come out of the fire -- and what could we do for you , that would be half so good as to find the capital ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 16752 len. 76]: I could not receive it as a gift , ' said Mr. Micawber , full of fire and animation , ` but if a sufficient sum could be advanced , say at five per cent interest , per annum , upon my personal liability -- say my notes of hand , at twelve , eighteen , and twenty-four months , respectively , to allow time for something to turn up -- ' ` Could be ?
Parsing [sent. 16753 len. 23]: Can be and shall be , on your own terms , ' returned my aunt , ` if you say the word .
Parsing [sent. 16754 len. 9]: Think of this now , both of you .
Parsing [sent. 16755 len. 13]: Here are some people David knows , going out to Australia shortly .
Parsing [sent. 16756 len. 16]: If you decide to go , why should n't you go in the same ship ?
Parsing [sent. 16757 len. 6]: You may help each other .
Parsing [sent. 16758 len. 10]: Think of this now , Mr. and Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 16759 len. 10]: Take your time , and weigh it well . '
Parsing [sent. 16760 len. 22]: ` There is but one question , my dear ma'am , I could wish to ask , ' said Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 16761 len. 11]: ` The climate , I believe , is healthy ? '
Parsing [sent. 16762 len. 7]: ` Finest in the world ! '
Parsing [sent. 16763 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 16764 len. 9]: ` Just so , ' returned Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 16765 len. 6]: ` Then my question arises .
Parsing [sent. 16766 len. 30]: Now , are the circumstances of the country such , that a man of Mr. Micawber 's abilities would have a fair chance of rising in the social scale ?
Parsing [sent. 16767 len. 48]: I will not say , at present , might he aspire to be Governor , or anything of that sort ; but would there be a reasonable opening for his talents to develop themselves -- that would be amply sufficient -- and find their own expansion ? '
Parsing [sent. 16768 len. 25]: ` No better opening anywhere , ' said my aunt , ` for a man who conducts himself well , and is industrious . '
Parsing [sent. 16769 len. 25]: ` For a man who conducts himself well , ' repeated Mrs. Micawber , with her clearest business manner , ` and is industrious .
Parsing [sent. 16770 len. 2]: Precisely .
Parsing [sent. 16771 len. 19]: It is evident to me that Australia is the legitimate sphere of action for Mr. Micawber ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 16772 len. 49]: I entertain the conviction , my dear madam , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` that it is , under existing circumstances , the land , the only land , for myself and family ; and that something of an extraordinary nature will turn up on that shore .
Parsing [sent. 16773 len. 32]: It is no distance -- comparatively speaking ; and though consideration is due to the kindness of your proposal , I assure you that is a mere matter of form . '
Parsing [sent. 16774 len. 36]: Shall I ever forget how , in a moment , he was the most sanguine of men , looking on to fortune ; or how Mrs. Micawber presently discoursed about the habits of the kangaroo !
Parsing [sent. 16775 len. 63]: Shall I ever recall that street of Canterbury on a market-day , without recalling him , as he walked back with us ; expressing , in the hardy roving manner he assumed , the unsettled habits of a temporary sojourner in the land ; and looking at the bullocks , as they came by , with the eye of an Australian farmer !
Parsing [sent. 16776 len. 11]: Chapter 53 Another Retrospect I must pause yet once again .
Parsing [sent. 16777 len. 51]: O , my child-wife , there is a figure in the moving crowd before my memory , quiet and still , saying in its innocent love and childish beauty , Stop to think of me -- turn to look upon the Little Blossom , as it flutters to the ground !
Parsing [sent. 16778 len. 3]: I do .
Parsing [sent. 16779 len. 9]: All else grows dim , and fades away .
Parsing [sent. 16780 len. 10]: I am again with Dora , in our cottage .
Parsing [sent. 16781 len. 11]: I do not know how long she has been ill .
Parsing [sent. 16782 len. 17]: I am so used to it in feeling , that I can not count the time .
Parsing [sent. 16783 len. 27]: It is not really long , in weeks or months ; but , in my usage and experience , it is a weary , weary while .
Parsing [sent. 16784 len. 15]: They have left off telling me to ` wait a few days more ' .
Parsing [sent. 16785 len. 31]: I have begun to fear , remotely , that the day may never shine , when I shall see my child-wife running in the sunlight with her old friend Jip .
Parsing [sent. 16786 len. 12]: He is , as it were suddenly , grown very old .
Parsing [sent. 16787 len. 72]: It may be that he misses in his mistress , something that enlivened him and made him younger ; but he mopes , and his sight is weak , and his limbs are feeble , and my aunt is sorry that he objects to her no more , but creeps near her as he lies on Dora 's bed -- she sitting at the bedside -- and mildly licks her hand .
Parsing [sent. 16788 len. 18]: Dora lies smiling on us , and is beautiful , and utters no hasty or complaining word .
Parsing [sent. 16789 len. 41]: She says that we are very good to her ; that her dear old careful boy is tiring himself out , she knows ; that my aunt has no sleep , yet is always wakeful , active , and kind .
Parsing [sent. 16790 len. 25]: Sometimes , the little bird-like ladies come to see her ; and then we talk about our wedding-day , and all that happy time .
Parsing [sent. 16791 len. 56]: What a strange rest and pause in my life there seems to be -- and in all life , within doors and without -- when I sit in the quiet , shaded , orderly room , with the blue eyes of my child-wife turned towards me , and her little fingers twining round my hand !
Parsing [sent. 16792 len. 25]: Many and many an hour I sit thus ; but , of all those times , three times come the freshest on my mind .
Parsing [sent. 16793 len. 52]: It is morning ; and Dora , made so trim by my aunt 's hands , shows me how her pretty hair will curl upon the pillow yet , an how long and bright it is , and how she likes to have it loosely gathered in that net she wears .
Parsing [sent. 16794 len. 71]: ` Not that I am vain of it , now , you mocking boy , ' she says , when I smile ; ` but because you used to say you thought it so beautiful ; and because , when I first began to think about you , I used to peep in the glass , and wonder whether you would like very much to have a lock of it .
Parsing [sent. 16795 len. 17]: Oh what a foolish fellow you were , Doady , when I gave you one ! '
Parsing [sent. 16796 len. 32]: ` That was on the day when you were painting the flowers I had given you , Dora , and when I told you how much in love I was . '
Parsing [sent. 16797 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 16798 len. 31]: but I did n't like to tell you , ' says Dora , ` then , how I had cried over them , because I believed you really liked me !
Parsing [sent. 16799 len. 32]: When I can run about again as I used to do , Doady , let us go and see those places where we were such a silly couple , shall we ?
Parsing [sent. 16800 len. 8]: And take some of the old walks ?
Parsing [sent. 16801 len. 7]: And not forget poor papa ? '
Parsing [sent. 16802 len. 12]: ` Yes , we will , and have some happy days .
Parsing [sent. 16803 len. 13]: So you must make haste to get well , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 16804 len. 9]: ` Oh , I shall soon do that !
Parsing [sent. 16805 len. 12]: I am so much better , you do n't know ! '
Parsing [sent. 16806 len. 25]: It is evening ; and I sit in the same chair , by the same bed , with the same face turned towards me .
Parsing [sent. 16807 len. 14]: We have been silent , and there is a smile upon her face .
Parsing [sent. 16808 len. 14]: I have ceased to carry my light burden up and down stairs now .
Parsing [sent. 16809 len. 7]: She lies here all the day .
Parsing [sent. 16810 len. 4]: ` Doady ! '
Parsing [sent. 16811 len. 6]: ` My dear Dora ! '
Parsing [sent. 16812 len. 34]: ` You wo n't think what I am going to say , unreasonable , after what you told me , such a little while ago , of Mr. Wickfield 's not being well ?
Parsing [sent. 16813 len. 6]: I want to see Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 16814 len. 10]: Very much I want to see her . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16815 len. 10]: I will write to her , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 16816 len. 5]: ` Will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 16817 len. 4]: ` Directly . '
Parsing [sent. 16818 len. 8]: ` What a good , kind boy !
Parsing [sent. 16819 len. 8]: Doady , take me on your arm .
Parsing [sent. 16820 len. 11]: Indeed , my dear , it 's not a whim .
Parsing [sent. 16821 len. 7]: It 's not a foolish fancy .
Parsing [sent. 16822 len. 13]: I want , very much indeed , to see her ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 16823 len. 6]: I am certain of it .
Parsing [sent. 16824 len. 16]: I have only to tell her so , and she is sure to come . '
Parsing [sent. 16825 len. 13]: ` You are very lonely when you go downstairs , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 16826 len. 10]: Dora whispers , with her arm about my neck .
Parsing [sent. 16827 len. 19]: ` How can I be otherwise , my own love , when I see your empty chair ? '
Parsing [sent. 16828 len. 6]: ` My empty chair ! '
Parsing [sent. 16829 len. 12]: She clings to me for a little while , in silence .
Parsing [sent. 16830 len. 10]: ` And you really miss me , Doady ? '
Parsing [sent. 16831 len. 7]: looking up , and brightly smiling .
Parsing [sent. 16832 len. 10]: ` Even poor , giddy , stupid me ? '
Parsing [sent. 16833 len. 17]: ` My heart , who is there upon earth that I could miss so much ? '
Parsing [sent. 16834 len. 5]: ` Oh , husband !
Parsing [sent. 16835 len. 10]: I am so glad , yet so sorry ! '
Parsing [sent. 16836 len. 13]: creeping closer to me , and folding me in both her arms .
Parsing [sent. 16837 len. 14]: She laughs and sobs , and then is quiet , and quite happy .
Parsing [sent. 16838 len. 4]: ` Quite ! '
Parsing [sent. 16839 len. 3]: she says .
Parsing [sent. 16840 len. 33]: ` Only give Agnes my dear love , and tell her that I want very , very , much to see her ; and I have nothing left to wish for . '
Parsing [sent. 16841 len. 10]: ` Except to get well again , Dora . '
Parsing [sent. 16842 len. 5]: ` Ah , Doady !
Parsing [sent. 16843 len. 14]: Sometimes I think -- you know I always was a silly little thing !
Parsing [sent. 16844 len. 8]: -- that that will never be ! '
Parsing [sent. 16845 len. 8]: ` Do n't say so , Dora !
Parsing [sent. 16846 len. 10]: Dearest love , do n't think so ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 16847 len. 12]: I wo n't , if I can help it , Doady .
Parsing [sent. 16848 len. 24]: But I am very happy ; though my dear boy is so lonely by himself , before his child-wife 's empty chair ! '
Parsing [sent. 16849 len. 11]: It is night ; and I am with her still .
Parsing [sent. 16850 len. 16]: Agnes has arrived ; has been among us for a whole day and an evening .
Parsing [sent. 16851 len. 19]: She , my aunt , and I , have sat with Dora since the morning , all together .
Parsing [sent. 16852 len. 15]: We have not talked much , but Dora has been perfectly contented and cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 16853 len. 5]: We are now alone .
Parsing [sent. 16854 len. 14]: Do I know , now , that my child-wife will soon leave me ?
Parsing [sent. 16855 len. 31]: They have told me so ; they have told me nothing new to my thoughts - but I am far from sure that I have taken that truth to heart .
Parsing [sent. 16856 len. 6]: I can not master it .
Parsing [sent. 16857 len. 13]: I have withdrawn by myself , many times today , to weep .
Parsing [sent. 16858 len. 15]: I have remembered Who wept for a parting between the living and the dead .
Parsing [sent. 16859 len. 12]: I have bethought me of all that gracious and compassionate history .
Parsing [sent. 16860 len. 43]: I have tried to resign myself , and to console myself ; and that , I hope , I may have done imperfectly ; but what I can not firmly settle in my mind is , that the end will absolutely come .
Parsing [sent. 16861 len. 27]: I hold her hand in mine , I hold her heart in mine , I see her love for me , alive in all its strength .
Parsing [sent. 16862 len. 18]: I can not shut out a pale lingering shadow of belief that she will be spared . '
Parsing [sent. 16863 len. 10]: I am going to speak to you , Doady .
Parsing [sent. 16864 len. 15]: I am going to say something I have often thought of saying , lately .
Parsing [sent. 16865 len. 6]: You wo n't mind ? '
Parsing [sent. 16866 len. 5]: with a gentle look .
Parsing [sent. 16867 len. 7]: ` Mind , my darling ? '
Parsing [sent. 16868 len. 19]: ` Because I do n't know what you will think , or what you may have thought sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 16869 len. 8]: Perhaps you have often thought the same .
Parsing [sent. 16870 len. 13]: Doady , dear , I am afraid I was too young . '
Parsing [sent. 16871 len. 22]: I lay my face upon the pillow by her , and she looks into my eyes , and speaks very softly .
Parsing [sent. 16872 len. 25]: Gradually , as she goes on , I feel , with a stricken heart , that she is speaking of herself as past . '
Parsing [sent. 16873 len. 11]: I am afraid , dear , I was too young .
Parsing [sent. 16874 len. 18]: I do n't mean in years only , but in experience , and thoughts , and everything .
Parsing [sent. 16875 len. 8]: I was such a silly little creature !
Parsing [sent. 16876 len. 26]: I am afraid it would have been better , if we had only loved each other as a boy and girl , and forgotten it .
Parsing [sent. 16877 len. 15]: I have begun to think I was not fit to be a wife . '
Parsing [sent. 16878 len. 29]: I try to stay my tears , and to reply , ` Oh , Dora , love , as fit as I to be a husband ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 16879 len. 14]: I do n't know , ' with the old shake of her curls .
Parsing [sent. 16880 len. 3]: ` Perhaps !
Parsing [sent. 16881 len. 20]: But if I had been more fit to be married I might have made you more so , too .
Parsing [sent. 16882 len. 13]: Besides , you are very clever , and I never was . '
Parsing [sent. 16883 len. 13]: ` We have been very happy , my sweet Dora . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16884 len. 7]: I was very happy , very .
Parsing [sent. 16885 len. 17]: But , as years went on , my dear boy would have wearied of his child-wife .
Parsing [sent. 16886 len. 12]: She would have been less and less a companion for him .
Parsing [sent. 16887 len. 16]: He would have been more and more sensible of what was wanting in his home .
Parsing [sent. 16888 len. 6]: She would n't have improved .
Parsing [sent. 16889 len. 8]: It is better as it is . '
Parsing [sent. 16890 len. 16]: ` Oh , Dora , dearest , dearest , do not speak to me so .
Parsing [sent. 16891 len. 7]: Every word seems a reproach ! '
Parsing [sent. 16892 len. 8]: ` No , not a syllable ! '
Parsing [sent. 16893 len. 6]: she answers , kissing me .
Parsing [sent. 16894 len. 47]: ` Oh , my dear , you never deserved it , and I loved you far too well to say a reproachful word to you , in earnest -- it was all the merit I had , except being pretty -- or you thought me so .
Parsing [sent. 16895 len. 11]: Is it lonely , down - stairs , Doady ? '
Parsing [sent. 16896 len. 3]: ` Very !
Parsing [sent. 16897 len. 3]: Very ! '
Parsing [sent. 16898 len. 5]: ` Do n't cry !
Parsing [sent. 16899 len. 6]: Is my chair there ? '
Parsing [sent. 16900 len. 7]: ` In its old place . '
Parsing [sent. 16901 len. 9]: ` Oh , how my poor boy cries !
Parsing [sent. 16902 len. 4]: Hush , hush !
Parsing [sent. 16903 len. 7]: Now , make me one promise .
Parsing [sent. 16904 len. 7]: I want to speak to Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 16905 len. 32]: When you go downstairs , tell Agnes so , and send her up to me ; and while I speak to her , let no one come -- not even aunt .
Parsing [sent. 16906 len. 9]: I want to speak to Agnes by herself .
Parsing [sent. 16907 len. 11]: I want to speak to Agnes , quite alone . '
Parsing [sent. 16908 len. 20]: I promise that she shall , immediately ; but I can not leave her , for my grief . '
Parsing [sent. 16909 len. 11]: I said that it was better as it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 16910 len. 11]: she whispers , as she holds me in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 16911 len. 50]: ` Oh , Doady , after more years , you never could have loved your child-wife better than you do ; and , after more years , she would so have tried and disappointed you , that you might not have been able to love her half so well !
Parsing [sent. 16912 len. 9]: I know I was too young and foolish .
Parsing [sent. 16913 len. 9]: It is much better as it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 16914 len. 18]: Agnes is downstairs , when I go into the parlour ; and I give her the message .
Parsing [sent. 16915 len. 9]: She disappears , leaving me alone with Jip .
Parsing [sent. 16916 len. 25]: His Chinese house is by the fire ; and he lies within it , on his bed of flannel , querulously trying to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 16917 len. 8]: The bright moon is high and clear .
Parsing [sent. 16918 len. 23]: As I look out on the night , my tears fall fast , and my undisciplined heart is chastened heavily -- heavily .
Parsing [sent. 16919 len. 24]: I sit down by the fire , thinking with a blind remorse of all those secret feelings I have nourished since my marriage .
Parsing [sent. 16920 len. 24]: I think of every little trifle between me and Dora , and feel the truth , that trifles make the sum of life .
Parsing [sent. 16921 len. 42]: Ever rising from the sea of my remembrance , is the image of the dear child as I knew her first , graced by my young love , and by her own , with every fascination wherein such love is rich .
Parsing [sent. 16922 len. 25]: Would it , indeed , have been better if we had loved each other as a boy and a girl , and forgotten it ?
Parsing [sent. 16923 len. 5]: Undisciplined heart , reply !
Parsing [sent. 16924 len. 20]: How the time wears , I know not ; until I am recalled by my child-wife 's old companion .
Parsing [sent. 16925 len. 30]: More restless than he was , he crawls out of his house , and looks at me , and wanders to the door , and whines to go upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 16926 len. 6]: ` Not tonight , Jip !
Parsing [sent. 16927 len. 4]: Not tonight ! '
Parsing [sent. 16928 len. 21]: He comes very slowly back to me , licks my hand , and lifts his dim eyes to my face .
Parsing [sent. 16929 len. 5]: ` Oh , Jip !
Parsing [sent. 16930 len. 8]: It may be , never again ! '
Parsing [sent. 16931 len. 24]: He lies down at my feet , stretches himself out as if to sleep , and with a plaintive cry , is dead .
Parsing [sent. 16932 len. 5]: ` Oh , Agnes !
Parsing [sent. 16933 len. 7]: Look , look , here ! '
Parsing [sent. 16934 len. 32]: - That face , so full of pity , and of grief , that rain of tears , that awful mute appeal to me , that solemn hand upraised towards Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 16935 len. 4]: ` Agnes ? '
Parsing [sent. 16936 len. 4]: It is over .
Parsing [sent. 16937 len. 21]: Darkness comes before my eyes ; and , for a time , all things are blotted out of my remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 16938 len. 29]: Chapter 54 Mr. Micawber 's Transactions This is not the time at which I am to enter on the state of my mind beneath its load of sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 16939 len. 38]: I came to think that the Future was walled up before me , that the energy and action of my life were at an end , that I never could find any refuge but in the grave .
Parsing [sent. 16940 len. 19]: I came to think so , I say , but not in the first shock of my grief .
Parsing [sent. 16941 len. 6]: It slowly grew to that .
Parsing [sent. 16942 len. 53]: If the events I go on to relate , had not thickened around me , in the beginning to confuse , and in the end to augment , my affliction , it is possible -LRB- though I think not probable -RRB- , that I might have fallen at once into this condition .
Parsing [sent. 16943 len. 58]: As it was , an interval occurred before I fully knew my own distress ; an interval , in which I even supposed that its sharpest pangs were past ; and when my mind could soothe itself by resting on all that was most innocent and beautiful , in the tender story that was closed for ever .
Parsing [sent. 16944 len. 45]: When it was first proposed that I should go abroad , or how it came to be agreed among us that I was to seek the restoration of my peace in change and travel , I do not , even now , distinctly know .
Parsing [sent. 16945 len. 34]: The spirit of Agnes so pervaded all we thought , and said , and did , in that time of sorrow , that I assume I may refer the project to her influence .
Parsing [sent. 16946 len. 12]: But her influence was so quiet that I know no more .
Parsing [sent. 16947 len. 56]: And now , indeed , I began to think that in my old association of her with the stained-glass window in the church , a prophetic foreshadowing of what she would be to me , in the calamity that was to happen in the fullness of time , had found a way into my mind .
Parsing [sent. 16948 len. 35]: In all that sorrow , from the moment , never to be forgotten , when she stood before me with her upraised hand , she was like a sacred presence in my lonely house .
Parsing [sent. 16949 len. 33]: When the Angel of Death alighted there , my child-wife fell asleep -- they told me so when I could bear to hear it -- on her bosom , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 16950 len. 45]: From my swoon , I first awoke to a consciousness of her compassionate tears , her words of hope and peace , her gentle face bending down as from a purer region nearer Heaven , over my undisciplined heart , and softening its pain .
Parsing [sent. 16951 len. 5]: Let me go on .
Parsing [sent. 16952 len. 6]: I was to go abroad .
Parsing [sent. 16953 len. 12]: That seemed to have been determined among us from the first .
Parsing [sent. 16954 len. 37]: The ground now covering all that could perish of my departed wife , I waited only for what Mr. Micawber called the ` final pulverization of Heep ' ; and for the departure of the emigrants .
Parsing [sent. 16955 len. 31]: At the request of Traddles , most affectionate and devoted of friends in my trouble , we returned to Canterbury : I mean my aunt , Agnes , and I .
Parsing [sent. 16956 len. 30]: We proceeded by appointment straight to Mr. Micawber 's house ; where , and at Mr. Wickfield 's , my friend had been labouring ever since our explosive meeting .
Parsing [sent. 16957 len. 19]: When poor Mrs. Micawber saw me come in , in my black clothes , she was sensibly affected .
Parsing [sent. 16958 len. 27]: There was a great deal of good in Mrs. Micawber 's heart , which had not been dunned out of it in all those many years .
Parsing [sent. 16959 len. 20]: ` Well , Mr. and Mrs. Micawber , ' was my aunt 's first salutation after we were seated .
Parsing [sent. 16960 len. 14]: ` Pray , have you thought about that emigration proposal of mine ? '
Parsing [sent. 16961 len. 70]: ` My dear madam , ' returned Mr. Micawber , ` perhaps I can not better express the conclusion at which Mrs. Micawber , your humble servant , and I may add our children , have jointly and severally arrived , than by borrowing the language of an illustrious poet , to reply that our Boat is on the shore , and our Bark is on the sea . '
Parsing [sent. 16962 len. 11]: ` That 's right , ' said my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 16963 len. 12]: I augur all sort of good from your sensible decision . '
Parsing [sent. 16964 len. 16]: ` Madam , you do us a great deal of honour , ' he rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 16965 len. 7]: He then referred to a memorandum .
Parsing [sent. 16966 len. 72]: ` With respect to the pecuniary assistance enabling us to launch our frail canoe on the ocean of enterprise , I have reconsidered that important business-point ; and would beg to propose my notes of hand -- drawn , it is needless to stipulate , on stamps of the amounts respectively required by the various Acts of Parliament applying to such securities -- at eighteen , twenty-four , and thirty months .
Parsing [sent. 16967 len. 39]: The proposition I originally submitted , was twelve , eighteen , and twenty-four ; but I am apprehensive that such an arrangement might not allow sufficient time for the requisite amount of -- Something -- to turn up .
Parsing [sent. 16968 len. 50]: We might not , ' said Mr. Micawber , looking round the room as if it represented several hundred acres of highly cultivated land , ` on the first responsibility becoming due , have been successful in our harvest , or we might not have got our harvest in .
Parsing [sent. 16969 len. 31]: Labour , I believe , is sometimes difficult to obtain in that portion of our colonial possessions where it will be our lot to combat with the teeming soil . '
Parsing [sent. 16970 len. 16]: ` Arrange it in any way you please , sir , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 16971 len. 26]: ` Madam , ' he replied , ` Mrs. Micawber and myself are deeply sensible of the very considerate kindness of our friends and patrons .
Parsing [sent. 16972 len. 14]: What I wish is , to be perfectly business-like , and perfectly punctual .
Parsing [sent. 16973 len. 69]: Turning over , as we are about to turn over , an entirely new leaf ; and falling back , as we are now in the act of falling back , for a Spring of no common magnitude ; it is important to my sense of self-respect , besides being an example to my son , that these arrangements should be concluded as between man and man . '
Parsing [sent. 16974 len. 52]: I do n't know that Mr. Micawber attached any meaning to this last phrase ; I do n't know that anybody ever does , or did ; but he appeared to relish it uncommonly , and repeated , with an impressive cough , ` as between man and man ' . '
Parsing [sent. 16975 len. 56]: I propose , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` Bills -- a convenience to the mercantile world , for which , I believe , we are originally indebted to the Jews , who appear to me to have had a devilish deal too much to do with them ever since -- because they are negotiable .
Parsing [sent. 16976 len. 26]: But if a Bond , or any other description of security , would be preferred , I should be happy to execute any such instrument .
Parsing [sent. 16977 len. 7]: As between man and man . '
Parsing [sent. 16978 len. 33]: My aunt observed , that in a case where both parties were willing to agree to anything , she took it for granted there would be no difficulty in settling this point .
Parsing [sent. 16979 len. 7]: Mr. Micawber was of her opinion .
Parsing [sent. 16980 len. 40]: ` In reference to our domestic preparations , madam , ' said Mr. Micawber , with some pride , ` for meeting the destiny to which we are now understood to be self-devoted , I beg to report them .
Parsing [sent. 16981 len. 29]: My eldest daughter attends at five every morning in a neighbouring establishment , to acquire the process -- if process it may be called - of milking cows .
Parsing [sent. 16982 len. 54]: My younger children are instructed to observe , as closely as circumstances will permit , the habits of the pigs and poultry maintained in the poorer parts of this city : a pursuit from which they have , on two occasions , been brought home , within an inch of being run over .
Parsing [sent. 16983 len. 83]: I have myself directed some attention , during the past week , to the art of baking ; and my son Wilkins has issued forth with a walking-stick and driven cattle , when permitted , by the rugged hirelings who had them in charge , to render any voluntary service in that direction -- which I regret to say , for the credit of our nature , was not often ; he being generally warned , with imprecations , to desist . '
Parsing [sent. 16984 len. 13]: ` All very right indeed , ' said my aunt , encouragingly .
Parsing [sent. 16985 len. 15]: ` Mrs. Micawber has been busy , too , I have no doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 16986 len. 16]: ` My dear madam , ' returned Mrs. Micawber , with her business-like air . '
Parsing [sent. 16987 len. 36]: I am free to confess that I have not been actively engaged in pursuits immediately connected with cultivation or with stock , though well aware that both will claim my attention on a foreign shore .
Parsing [sent. 16988 len. 26]: Such opportunities as I have been enabled to alienate from my domestic duties , I have devoted to corresponding at some length with my family .
Parsing [sent. 16989 len. 100]: For I own it seems to me , my dear Mr. Copperfield , ' said Mrs. Micawber , who always fell back on me , I suppose from old habit , to whomsoever else she might address her discourse at starting , ` that the time is come when the past should be buried in oblivion ; when my family should take Mr. Micawber by the hand , and Mr. Micawber should take my family by the hand ; when the lion should lie down with the lamb , and my family be on terms with Mr. Micawber . '
Parsing [sent. 16990 len. 7]: I said I thought so too .
Parsing [sent. 16991 len. 28]: ` This , at least , is the light , my dear Mr. Copperfield , ' pursued Mrs. Micawber , ` in which I view the subject .
Parsing [sent. 16992 len. 41]: When I lived at home with my papa and mama , my papa was accustomed to ask , when any point was under discussion in our limited circle , `` In what light does my Emma view the subject ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16993 len. 45]: That my papa was too partial , I know ; still , on such a point as the frigid coldness which has ever subsisted between Mr. Micawber and my family , I necessarily have formed an opinion , delusive though it may be . '
Parsing [sent. 16994 len. 4]: ` No doubt .
Parsing [sent. 16995 len. 12]: Of course you have , ma'am , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 16996 len. 9]: ` Precisely so , ' assented Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 16997 len. 56]: ` Now , I may be wrong in my conclusions ; it is very likely that I am , but my individual impression is , that the gulf between my family and Mr. Micawber may be traced to an apprehension , on the part of my family , that Mr. Micawber would require pecuniary accommodation .
Parsing [sent. 16998 len. 40]: I can not help thinking , ' said Mrs. Micawber , with an air of deep sagacity , ` that there are members of my family who have been apprehensive that Mr. Micawber would solicit them for their names .
Parsing [sent. 16999 len. 31]: -- I do not mean to be conferred in Baptism upon our children , but to be inscribed on Bills of Exchange , and negotiated in the Money Market . '
Parsing [sent. 17000 len. 53]: The look of penetration with which Mrs. Micawber announced this discovery , as if no one had ever thought of it before , seemed rather to astonish my aunt ; who abruptly replied , ` Well , ma'am , upon the whole , I should n't wonder if you were right ! '
Parsing [sent. 17001 len. 80]: ` Mr. Micawber being now on the eve of casting off the pecuniary shackles that have so long enthralled him , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` and of commencing a new career in a country where there is sufficient range for his abilities , -- which , in my opinion , is exceedingly important ; Mr. Micawber 's abilities peculiarly requiring space , -- it seems to me that my family should signalize the occasion by coming forward .
Parsing [sent. 17002 len. 61]: What I could wish to see , would be a meeting between Mr. Micawber and my family at a festive entertainment , to be given at my family 's expense ; where Mr. Micawber 's health and prosperity being proposed , by some leading member of my family , Mr. Micawber might have an opportunity of developing his views . '
Parsing [sent. 17003 len. 74]: ` My dear , ' said Mr. Micawber , with some heat , ` it may be better for me to state distinctly , at once , that if I were to develop my views to that assembled group , they would possibly be found of an offensive nature : my impression being that your family are , in the aggregate , impertinent Snobs ; and , in detail , unmitigated Ruffians . '
Parsing [sent. 17004 len. 15]: ` Micawber , ' said Mrs. Micawber , shaking her head , ` no !
Parsing [sent. 17005 len. 14]: You have never understood them , and they have never understood you . '
Parsing [sent. 17006 len. 4]: Mr. Micawber coughed .
Parsing [sent. 17007 len. 14]: ` They have never understood you , Micawber , ' said his wife .
Parsing [sent. 17008 len. 8]: ` They may be incapable of it .
Parsing [sent. 17009 len. 8]: If so , that is their misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 17010 len. 8]: I can pity their misfortune . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17011 len. 38]: I am extremely sorry , my dear Emma , ' said Mr. Micawber , relenting , ` to have been betrayed into any expressions that might , even remotely , have the appearance of being strong expressions .
Parsing [sent. 17012 len. 62]: All I would say is , that I can go abroad without your family coming forward to favour me , -- in short , with a parting Shove of their cold shoulders ; and that , upon the whole , I would rather leave England with such impetus as I possess , than derive any acceleration of it from that quarter .
Parsing [sent. 17013 len. 40]: At the same time , my dear , if they should condescend to reply to your communications -- which our joint experience renders most improbable -- far be it from me to be a barrier to your wishes . '
Parsing [sent. 17014 len. 44]: The matter being thus amicably settled , Mr. Micawber gave Mrs. Micawber his arm , and glancing at the heap of books and papers lying before Traddles on the table , said they would leave us to ourselves ; which they ceremoniously did .
Parsing [sent. 17015 len. 70]: ` My dear Copperfield , ' said Traddles , leaning back in his chair when they were gone , and looking at me with an affection that made his eyes red , and his hair all kinds of shapes , ' I do n't make any excuse for troubling you with business , because I know you are deeply interested in it , and it may divert your thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 17016 len. 14]: My dear boy , I hope you are not worn out ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17017 len. 13]: I am quite myself , ' said I , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 17018 len. 14]: ` We have more cause to think of my aunt than of anyone .
Parsing [sent. 17019 len. 9]: You know how much she has done . '
Parsing [sent. 17020 len. 9]: ` Surely , surely , ' answered Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 17021 len. 7]: ` Who can forget it ! '
Parsing [sent. 17022 len. 36]: ` But even that is not all , ' said I. ` During the last fortnight , some new trouble has vexed her ; and she has been in and out of London every day .
Parsing [sent. 17023 len. 14]: Several times she has gone out early , and been absent until evening .
Parsing [sent. 17024 len. 20]: Last night , Traddles , with this journey before her , it was almost midnight before she came home .
Parsing [sent. 17025 len. 9]: You know what her consideration for others is .
Parsing [sent. 17026 len. 13]: She will not tell me what has happened to distress her . '
Parsing [sent. 17027 len. 40]: My aunt , very pale , and with deep lines in her face , sat immovable until I had finished ; when some stray tears found their way to her cheeks , and she put her hand on mine .
Parsing [sent. 17028 len. 11]: ` It 's nothing , Trot ; it 's nothing .
Parsing [sent. 17029 len. 8]: There will be no more of it .
Parsing [sent. 17030 len. 7]: You shall know by and by .
Parsing [sent. 17031 len. 15]: Now Agnes , my dear , let us attend to these affairs . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17032 len. 44]: I must do Mr. Micawber the justice to say , ' Traddles began , ` that although he would appear not to have worked to any good account for himself , he is a most untiring man when he works for other people .
Parsing [sent. 17033 len. 7]: I never saw such a fellow .
Parsing [sent. 17034 len. 25]: If he always goes on in the same way , he must be , virtually , about two hundred years old , at present .
Parsing [sent. 17035 len. 79]: The heat into which he has been continually putting himself ; and the distracted and impetuous manner in which he has been diving , day and night , among papers and books ; to say nothing of the immense number of letters he has written me between this house and Mr. Wickfield 's , and often across the table when he has been sitting opposite , and might much more easily have spoken ; is quite extraordinary . '
Parsing [sent. 17036 len. 4]: ` Letters ! '
Parsing [sent. 17037 len. 5]: cried my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 17038 len. 8]: I believe he dreams in letters ! '
Parsing [sent. 17039 len. 18]: ` There 's Mr. Dick , too , ' said Traddles , ` has been doing wonders !
Parsing [sent. 17040 len. 32]: As soon as he was released from overlooking Uriah Heep , whom he kept in such charge as I never saw exceeded , he began to devote himself to Mr. Wickfield .
Parsing [sent. 17041 len. 40]: And really his anxiety to be of use in the investigations we have been making , and his real usefulness in extracting , and copying , and fetching , and carrying , have been quite stimulating to us . '
Parsing [sent. 17042 len. 21]: ` Dick is a very remarkable man , ' exclaimed my aunt ; ` and I always said he was .
Parsing [sent. 17043 len. 8]: Trot , you know it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17044 len. 34]: I am happy to say , Miss Wickfield , ' pursued Traddles , at once with great delicacy and with great earnestness , ` that in your absence Mr. Wickfield has considerably improved .
Parsing [sent. 17045 len. 33]: Relieved of the incubus that had fastened upon him for so long a time , and of the dreadful apprehensions under which he had lived , he is hardly the same person .
Parsing [sent. 17046 len. 55]: At times , even his impaired power of concentrating his memory and attention on particular points of business , has recovered itself very much ; and he has been able to assist us in making some things clear , that we should have found very difficult indeed , if not hopeless , without him .
Parsing [sent. 17047 len. 37]: But what I have to do is to come to results ; which are short enough ; not to gossip on all the hopeful circumstances I have observed , or I shall never have done . '
Parsing [sent. 17048 len. 43]: His natural manner and agreeable simplicity made it transparent that he said this to put us in good heart , and to enable Agnes to hear her father mentioned with greater confidence ; but it was not the less pleasant for that .
Parsing [sent. 17049 len. 19]: ` Now , let me see , ' said Traddles , looking among the papers on the table .
Parsing [sent. 17050 len. 60]: ` Having counted our funds , and reduced to order a great mass of unintentional confusion in the first place , and of wilful confusion and falsification in the second , we take it to be clear that Mr. Wickfield might now wind up his business , and his agency-trust , and exhibit no deficiency or defalcation whatever . '
Parsing [sent. 17051 len. 7]: ` Oh , thank Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 17052 len. 5]: cried Agnes , fervently .
Parsing [sent. 17053 len. 80]: ` But , ' said Traddles , ` the surplus that would be left as his means of support -- and I suppose the house to be sold , even in saying this -- would be so small , not exceeding in all probability some hundreds of pounds , that perhaps , Miss Wickfield , it would be best to consider whether he might not retain his agency of the estate to which he has so long been receiver .
Parsing [sent. 17054 len. 14]: His friends might advise him , you know ; now he is free .
Parsing [sent. 17055 len. 64]: You yourself , Miss Wickfield -- Copperfield -- I -- ' ' I have considered it , Trotwood , ' said Agnes , looking to me , ` and I feel that it ought not to be , and must not be ; even on the recommendation of a friend to whom I am so grateful , and owe so much . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17056 len. 14]: I will not say that I recommend it , ' observed Traddles . '
Parsing [sent. 17057 len. 8]: I think it right to suggest it .
Parsing [sent. 17058 len. 5]: No more . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17059 len. 30]: I am happy to hear you say so , ' answered Agnes , steadily , ` for it gives me hope , almost assurance , that we think alike .
Parsing [sent. 17060 len. 19]: Dear Mr. Traddles and dear Trotwood , papa once free with honour , what could I wish for !
Parsing [sent. 17061 len. 43]: I have always aspired , if I could have released him from the toils in which he was held , to render back some little portion of the love and care I owe him , and to devote my life to him .
Parsing [sent. 17062 len. 14]: It has been , for years , the utmost height of my hopes .
Parsing [sent. 17063 len. 31]: To take our future on myself , will be the next great happiness -- the next to his release from all trust and responsibility -- that I can know . '
Parsing [sent. 17064 len. 9]: ` Have you thought how , Agnes ? '
Parsing [sent. 17065 len. 3]: ` Often !
Parsing [sent. 17066 len. 8]: I am not afraid , dear Trotwood .
Parsing [sent. 17067 len. 6]: I am certain of success .
Parsing [sent. 17068 len. 18]: So many people know me here , and think kindly of me , that I am certain .
Parsing [sent. 17069 len. 5]: Do n't mistrust me .
Parsing [sent. 17070 len. 6]: Our wants are not many .
Parsing [sent. 17071 len. 21]: If I rent the dear old house , and keep a school , I shall be useful and happy . '
Parsing [sent. 17072 len. 34]: The calm fervour of her cheerful voice brought back so vividly , first the dear old house itself , and then my solitary home , that my heart was too full for speech .
Parsing [sent. 17073 len. 14]: Traddles pretended for a little while to be busily looking among the papers .
Parsing [sent. 17074 len. 17]: ` Next , Miss Trotwood , ' said Traddles , ` that property of yours . '
Parsing [sent. 17075 len. 10]: ` Well , sir , ' sighed my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17076 len. 39]: ` All I have got to say about it is , that if it 's gone , I can bear it ; and if it 's not gone , I shall be glad to get it back . '
Parsing [sent. 17077 len. 15]: ` It was originally , I think , eight thousand pounds , Consols ? '
Parsing [sent. 17078 len. 3]: said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 17079 len. 4]: ` Right ! '
Parsing [sent. 17080 len. 5]: replied my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 17081 len. 20]: I ca n't account for more than five , ' said Traddles , with an air of perplexity . '
Parsing [sent. 17082 len. 8]: - thousand , do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 17083 len. 13]: inquired my aunt , with uncommon composure , ` or pounds ? '
Parsing [sent. 17084 len. 9]: ` Five thousand pounds , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 17085 len. 13]: ` It was all there was , ' returned my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 17086 len. 6]: I sold three , myself .
Parsing [sent. 17087 len. 22]: One , I paid for your articles , Trot , my dear ; and the other two I have by me .
Parsing [sent. 17088 len. 27]: When I lost the rest , I thought it wise to say nothing about that sum , but to keep it secretly for a rainy day .
Parsing [sent. 17089 len. 27]: I wanted to see how you would come out of the trial , Trot ; and you came out nobly -- persevering , self-reliant , self-denying !
Parsing [sent. 17090 len. 4]: So did Dick .
Parsing [sent. 17091 len. 16]: Do n't speak to me , for I find my nerves a little shaken ! '
Parsing [sent. 17092 len. 23]: Nobody would have thought so , to see her sitting upright , with her arms folded ; but she had wonderful self-command .
Parsing [sent. 17093 len. 26]: ` Then I am delighted to say , ' cried Traddles , beaming with joy , ` that we have recovered the whole money ! '
Parsing [sent. 17094 len. 9]: ` Do n't congratulate me , anybody ! '
Parsing [sent. 17095 len. 4]: exclaimed my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17096 len. 7]: ` How so , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 17097 len. 12]: ` You believed it had been misappropriated by Mr. Wickfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 17098 len. 3]: said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 17099 len. 18]: ` Of course I did , ' said my aunt , ` and was therefore easily silenced .
Parsing [sent. 17100 len. 7]: Agnes , not a word ! '
Parsing [sent. 17101 len. 40]: ` And indeed , ' said Traddles , ` it was sold , by virtue of the power of management he held from you ; but I need n't say by whom sold , or on whose actual signature .
Parsing [sent. 17102 len. 48]: It was afterwards pretended to Mr. Wickfield , by that rascal , -- and proved , too , by figures , -- that he had possessed himself of the money -LRB- on general instructions , he said -RRB- to keep other deficiencies and difficulties from the light .
Parsing [sent. 17103 len. 45]: Mr. Wickfield , being so weak and helpless in his hands as to pay you , afterwards , several sums of interest on a pretended principal which he knew did not exist , made himself , unhappily , a party to the fraud . '
Parsing [sent. 17104 len. 33]: ` And at last took the blame upon himself , ' added my aunt ; ` and wrote me a mad letter , charging himself with robbery , and wrong unheard of .
Parsing [sent. 17105 len. 53]: Upon which I paid him a visit early one morning , called for a candle , burnt the letter , and told him if he ever could right me and himself , to do it ; and if he could n't , to keep his own counsel for his daughter 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 17106 len. 14]: -- If anybody speaks to me , I 'll leave the house ! '
Parsing [sent. 17107 len. 10]: We all remained quiet ; Agnes covering her face .
Parsing [sent. 17108 len. 29]: ` Well , my dear friend , ' said my aunt , after a pause , ` and you have really extorted the money back from him ? '
Parsing [sent. 17109 len. 44]: ` Why , the fact is , ' returned Traddles , ` Mr. Micawber had so completely hemmed him in , and was always ready with so many new points if an old one failed , that he could not escape from us .
Parsing [sent. 17110 len. 39]: A most remarkable circumstance is , that I really do n't think he grasped this sum even so much for the gratification of his avarice , which was inordinate , as in the hatred he felt for Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 17111 len. 8]: He said so to me , plainly .
Parsing [sent. 17112 len. 17]: He said he would even have spent as much , to baulk or injure Copperfield . '
Parsing [sent. 17113 len. 4]: ` Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 17114 len. 14]: said my aunt , knitting her brows thoughtfully , and glancing at Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 17115 len. 10]: ` And what 's become of him ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17116 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 17117 len. 28]: He left here , ' said Traddles , ` with his mother , who had been clamouring , and beseeching , and disclosing , the whole time .
Parsing [sent. 17118 len. 30]: They went away by one of the London night coaches , and I know no more about him ; except that his malevolence to me at parting was audacious .
Parsing [sent. 17119 len. 30]: He seemed to consider himself hardly less indebted to me , than to Mr. Micawber ; which I consider -LRB- as I told him -RRB- quite a compliment . '
Parsing [sent. 17120 len. 12]: ` Do you suppose he has any money , Traddles ? '
Parsing [sent. 17121 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 17122 len. 22]: ` Oh dear , yes , I should think so , ' he replied , shaking his head , seriously . '
Parsing [sent. 17123 len. 17]: I should say he must have pocketed a good deal , in one way or other .
Parsing [sent. 17124 len. 31]: But , I think you would find , Copperfield , if you had an opportunity of observing his course , that money would never keep that man out of mischief .
Parsing [sent. 17125 len. 18]: He is such an incarnate hypocrite , that whatever object he pursues , he must pursue crookedly .
Parsing [sent. 17126 len. 14]: It 's his only compensation for the outward restraints he puts upon himself .
Parsing [sent. 17127 len. 43]: Always creeping along the ground to some small end or other , he will always magnify every object in the way ; and consequently will hate and suspect everybody that comes , in the most innocent manner , between him and it .
Parsing [sent. 17128 len. 21]: So the crooked courses will become crookeder , at any moment , for the least reason , or for none .
Parsing [sent. 17129 len. 20]: It 's only necessary to consider his history here , ' said Traddles , ` to know that . '
Parsing [sent. 17130 len. 9]: ` He 's a monster of meanness ! '
Parsing [sent. 17131 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17132 len. 14]: ` Really I do n't know about that , ' observed Traddles thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 17133 len. 17]: ` Many people can be very mean , when they give their minds to it . '
Parsing [sent. 17134 len. 13]: ` And now , touching Mr. Micawber , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17135 len. 24]: ` Well , really , ' said Traddles , cheerfully , ' I must , once more , give Mr. Micawber high praise .
Parsing [sent. 17136 len. 27]: But for his having been so patient and persevering for so long a time , we never could have hoped to do anything worth speaking of .
Parsing [sent. 17137 len. 38]: And I think we ought to consider that Mr. Micawber did right , for right 's sake , when we reflect what terms he might have made with Uriah Heep himself , for his silence . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17138 len. 18]: I think so too , ' said I. ` Now , what would you give him ? '
Parsing [sent. 17139 len. 4]: inquired my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17140 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 17141 len. 58]: Before you come to that , ' said Traddles , a little disconcerted , ' I am afraid I thought it discreet to omit -LRB- not being able to carry everything before me -RRB- two points , in making this lawless adjustment -- for it 's perfectly lawless from beginning to end -- of a difficult affair .
Parsing [sent. 17142 len. 23]: Those I.O.U. 's , and so forth , which Mr. Micawber gave him for the advances he had -- ' ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 17143 len. 10]: They must be paid , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17144 len. 55]: ` Yes , but I do n't know when they may be proceeded on , or where they are , ' rejoined Traddles , opening his eyes ; ` and I anticipate , that , between this time and his departure , Mr. Micawber will be constantly arrested , or taken in execution . '
Parsing [sent. 17145 len. 21]: ` Then he must be constantly set free again , and taken out of execution , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17146 len. 8]: ` What 's the amount altogether ? '
Parsing [sent. 17147 len. 44]: ` Why , Mr. Micawber has entered the transactions -- he calls them transactions -- with great form , in a book , ' rejoined Traddles , smiling ; ` and he makes the amount a hundred and three pounds , five . '
Parsing [sent. 17148 len. 14]: ` Now , what shall we give him , that sum included ? '
Parsing [sent. 17149 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17150 len. 17]: ` Agnes , my dear , you and I can talk about division of it afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 17151 len. 5]: What should it be ?
Parsing [sent. 17152 len. 5]: Five hundred pounds ? '
Parsing [sent. 17153 len. 12]: Upon this , Traddles and I both struck in at once .
Parsing [sent. 17154 len. 28]: We both recommended a small sum in money , and the payment , without stipulation to Mr. Micawber , of the Uriah claims as they came in .
Parsing [sent. 17155 len. 50]: We proposed that the family should have their passage and their outfit , and a hundred pounds ; and that Mr. Micawber 's arrangement for the repayment of the advances should be gravely entered into , as it might be wholesome for him to suppose himself under that responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 17156 len. 47]: To this , I added the suggestion , that I should give some explanation of his character and history to Mr. Peggotty , who I knew could be relied on ; and that to Mr. Peggotty should be quietly entrusted the discretion of advancing another hundred .
Parsing [sent. 17157 len. 54]: I further proposed to interest Mr. Micawber in Mr. Peggotty , by confiding so much of Mr. Peggotty 's story to him as I might feel justified in relating , or might think expedient ; and to endeavour to bring each of them to bear upon the other , for the common advantage .
Parsing [sent. 17158 len. 32]: We all entered warmly into these views ; and I may mention at once , that the principals themselves did so , shortly afterwards , with perfect good will and harmony .
Parsing [sent. 17159 len. 26]: Seeing that Traddles now glanced anxiously at my aunt again , I reminded him of the second and last point to which he had adverted .
Parsing [sent. 17160 len. 45]: ` You and your aunt will excuse me , Copperfield , if I touch upon a painful theme , as I greatly fear I shall , ' said Traddles , hesitating ; ` but I think it necessary to bring it to your recollection .
Parsing [sent. 17161 len. 25]: On the day of Mr. Micawber 's memorable denunciation a threatening allusion was made by Uriah Heep to your aunt 's -- husband . '
Parsing [sent. 17162 len. 17]: My aunt , retaining her stiff position , and apparent composure , assented with a nod .
Parsing [sent. 17163 len. 15]: ` Perhaps , ' observed Traddles , ` it was mere purposeless impertinence ? '
Parsing [sent. 17164 len. 8]: ` No , ' returned my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17165 len. 20]: ` There was -- pardon me -- really such a person , and at all in his power ? '
Parsing [sent. 17166 len. 3]: hinted Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 17167 len. 12]: ` Yes , my good friend , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17168 len. 80]: Traddles , with a perceptible lengthening of his face , explained that he had not been able to approach this subject ; that it had shared the fate of Mr. Micawber 's liabilities , in not being comprehended in the terms he had made ; that we were no longer of any authority with Uriah Heep ; and that if he could do us , or any of us , any injury or annoyance , no doubt he would .
Parsing [sent. 17169 len. 17]: My aunt remained quiet ; until again some stray tears found their way to her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 17170 len. 10]: ` You are quite right , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 17171 len. 10]: ` It was very thoughtful to mention it . '
Parsing [sent. 17172 len. 11]: ` Can I -- or Copperfield -- do anything ? '
Parsing [sent. 17173 len. 5]: asked Traddles , gently .
Parsing [sent. 17174 len. 9]: ` Nothing , ' said my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 17175 len. 6]: I thank you many times .
Parsing [sent. 17176 len. 9]: Trot , my dear , a vain threat !
Parsing [sent. 17177 len. 9]: Let us have Mr. and Mrs. Micawber back .
Parsing [sent. 17178 len. 11]: And do n't any of you speak to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 17179 len. 20]: With that she smoothed her dress , and sat , with her upright carriage , looking at the door .
Parsing [sent. 17180 len. 9]: ` Well , Mr. and Mrs. Micawber ! '
Parsing [sent. 17181 len. 8]: said my aunt , when they entered .
Parsing [sent. 17182 len. 34]: ` We have been discussing your emigration , with many apologies to you for keeping you out of the room so long ; and I 'll tell you what arrangements we propose . '
Parsing [sent. 17183 len. 67]: These she explained to the unbounded satisfaction of the family , -- children and all being then present , -- and so much to the awakening of Mr. Micawber 's punctual habits in the opening stage of all bill transactions , that he could not be dissuaded from immediately rushing out , in the highest spirits , to buy the stamps for his notes of hand .
Parsing [sent. 17184 len. 39]: But , his joy received a sudden check ; for within five minutes , he returned in the custody of a sheriff 's officer , informing us , in a flood of tears , that all was lost .
Parsing [sent. 17185 len. 71]: We , being quite prepared for this event , which was of course a proceeding of Uriah Heep 's , soon paid the money ; and in five minutes more Mr. Micawber was seated at the table , filling up the stamps with an expression of perfect joy , which only that congenial employment , or the making of punch , could impart in full completeness to his shining face .
Parsing [sent. 17186 len. 57]: To see him at work on the stamps , with the relish of an artist , touching them like pictures , looking at them sideways , taking weighty notes of dates and amounts in his pocket-book , and contemplating them when finished , with a high sense of their precious value , was a sight indeed .
Parsing [sent. 17187 len. 41]: ` Now , the best thing you can do , sir , if you 'll allow me to advise you , ' said my aunt , after silently observing him , ` is to abjure that occupation for evermore . '
Parsing [sent. 17188 len. 26]: ` Madam , ' replied Mr. Micawber , ` it is my intention to register such a vow on the virgin page of the future .
Parsing [sent. 17189 len. 6]: Mrs. Micawber will attest it .
Parsing [sent. 17190 len. 51]: I trust , ' said Mr. Micawber , solemnly , ` that my son Wilkins will ever bear in mind , that he had infinitely better put his fist in the fire , than use it to handle the serpents that have poisoned the life-blood of his unhappy parent ! '
Parsing [sent. 17191 len. 49]: Deeply affected , and changed in a moment to the image of despair , Mr. Micawber regarded the serpents with a look of gloomy abhorrence -LRB- in which his late admiration of them was not quite subdued -RRB- , folded them up and put them in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 17192 len. 8]: This closed the proceedings of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 17193 len. 22]: We were weary with sorrow and fatigue , and my aunt and I were to return to London on the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 17194 len. 57]: It was arranged that the Micawbers should follow us , after effecting a sale of their goods to a broker ; that Mr. Wickfield 's affairs should be brought to a settlement , with all convenient speed , under the direction of Traddles ; and that Agnes should also come to London , pending those arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 17195 len. 40]: We passed the night at the old house , which , freed from the presence of the Heeps , seemed purged of a disease ; and I lay in my old room , like a shipwrecked wanderer come home .
Parsing [sent. 17196 len. 54]: We went back next day to my aunt 's house -- not to mine - and when she and I sat alone , as of old , before going to bed , she said : ` Trot , do you really wish to know what I have had upon my mind lately ? '
Parsing [sent. 17197 len. 7]: ` Indeed I do , aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17198 len. 29]: If there ever was a time when I felt unwilling that you should have a sorrow or anxiety which I could not share , it is now . '
Parsing [sent. 17199 len. 25]: ` You have had sorrow enough , child , ' said my aunt , affectionately , ` without the addition of my little miseries .
Parsing [sent. 17200 len. 17]: I could have no other motive , Trot , in keeping anything from you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17201 len. 15]: I know that well , ' said I. ` But tell me now . '
Parsing [sent. 17202 len. 13]: ` Would you ride with me a little way tomorrow morning ? '
Parsing [sent. 17203 len. 4]: asked my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17204 len. 5]: ` Of course . '
Parsing [sent. 17205 len. 8]: ` At nine , ' said she .
Parsing [sent. 17206 len. 11]: ` I 'll tell you then , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 17207 len. 18]: At nine , accordingly , we went out in a little chariot , and drove to London .
Parsing [sent. 17208 len. 19]: We drove a long way through the streets , until we came to one of the large hospitals .
Parsing [sent. 17209 len. 10]: Standing hard by the building was a plain hearse .
Parsing [sent. 17210 len. 27]: The driver recognized my aunt , and , in obedience to a motion of her hand at the window , drove slowly off ; we following .
Parsing [sent. 17211 len. 13]: ` You understand it now , Trot , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17212 len. 6]: ` He is gone ! '
Parsing [sent. 17213 len. 9]: ` Did he die in the hospital ? '
Parsing [sent. 17214 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 17215 len. 18]: She sat immovable beside me ; but , again I saw the stray tears on her face .
Parsing [sent. 17216 len. 13]: ` He was there once before , ' said my aunt presently .
Parsing [sent. 17217 len. 18]: ` He was ailing a long time -- a shattered , broken man , these many years .
Parsing [sent. 17218 len. 18]: When he knew his state in this last illness , he asked them to send for me .
Parsing [sent. 17219 len. 5]: He was sorry then .
Parsing [sent. 17220 len. 4]: Very sorry . '
Parsing [sent. 17221 len. 11]: ` You went , I know , aunt . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17222 len. 3]: I went .
Parsing [sent. 17223 len. 10]: I was with him a good deal afterwards . '
Parsing [sent. 17224 len. 12]: ` He died the night before we went to Canterbury ? '
Parsing [sent. 17225 len. 6]: said I. My aunt nodded .
Parsing [sent. 17226 len. 12]: ` No one can harm him now , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 17227 len. 8]: ` It was a vain threat . '
Parsing [sent. 17228 len. 14]: We drove away , out of town , to the churchyard at Hornsey .
Parsing [sent. 17229 len. 13]: ` Better here than in the streets , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17230 len. 7]: ` He was born here . '
Parsing [sent. 17231 len. 26]: We alighted ; and followed the plain coffin to a corner I remember well , where the service was read consigning it to the dust .
Parsing [sent. 17232 len. 29]: ` Six-and-thirty years ago , this day , my dear , ' said my aunt , as we walked back to the chariot , ' I was married .
Parsing [sent. 17233 len. 6]: God forgive us all ! '
Parsing [sent. 17234 len. 22]: We took our seats in silence ; and so she sat beside me for a long time , holding my hand .
Parsing [sent. 17235 len. 31]: At length she suddenly burst into tears , and said : ` He was a fine-looking man when I married him , Trot -- and he was sadly changed ! '
Parsing [sent. 17236 len. 6]: It did not last long .
Parsing [sent. 17237 len. 15]: After the relief of tears , she soon became composed , and even cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 17238 len. 20]: Her nerves were a little shaken , she said , or she would not have given way to it .
Parsing [sent. 17239 len. 5]: God forgive us all !
Parsing [sent. 17240 len. 37]: So we rode back to her little cottage at Highgate , where we found the following short note , which had arrived by that morning 's post from Mr. Micawber : ` Canterbury , ` Friday .
Parsing [sent. 17241 len. 42]: ` My dear Madam , and Copperfield , ` The fair land of promise lately looming on the horizon is again enveloped in impenetrable mists , and for ever withdrawn from the eyes of a drifting wretch whose Doom is sealed !
Parsing [sent. 17242 len. 48]: ` Another writ has been issued -LRB- in His Majesty 's High Court of King 's Bench at Westminster -RRB- , in another cause of HEEP V. MICAWBER , and the defendant in that cause is the prey of the sheriff having legal jurisdiction in this bailiwick .
Parsing [sent. 17243 len. 30]: ` Now 's the day , and now 's the hour , See the front of battle lower , See approach proud EDWARD 'S power -- Chains and slavery !
Parsing [sent. 17244 len. 37]: ` Consigned to which , and to a speedy end -LRB- for mental torture is not supportable beyond a certain point , and that point I feel I have attained -RRB- , my course is run .
Parsing [sent. 17245 len. 6]: Bless you , bless you !
Parsing [sent. 17246 len. 121]: Some future traveller , visiting , from motives of curiosity , not unmingled , let us hope , with sympathy , the place of confinement allotted to debtors in this city , may , and I trust will , Ponder , as he traces on its wall , inscribed with a rusty nail , ` The obscure initials , ` W. M. ` P.S. I re-open this to say that our common friend , Mr. Thomas Traddles -LRB- who has not yet left us , and is looking extremely well -RRB- , has paid the debt and costs , in the noble name of Miss Trotwood ; and that myself and family are at the height of earthly bliss . '
Parsing [sent. 17247 len. 80]: Chapter 55 Tempest I now approach an event in my life , so indelible , so awful , so bound by an infinite variety of ties to all that has preceded it , in these pages , that , from the beginning of my narrative , I have seen it growing larger and larger as I advanced , like a great tower in a plain , and throwing its fore-cast shadow even on the incidents of my childish days .
Parsing [sent. 17248 len. 12]: For years after it occurred , I dreamed of it often .
Parsing [sent. 17249 len. 27]: I have started up so vividly impressed by it , that its fury has yet seemed raging in my quiet room , in the still night .
Parsing [sent. 17250 len. 17]: I dream of it sometimes , though at lengthened and uncertain intervals , to this hour .
Parsing [sent. 17251 len. 30]: I have an association between it and a stormy wind , or the lightest mention of a sea-shore , as strong as any of which my mind is conscious .
Parsing [sent. 17252 len. 16]: As plainly as I behold what happened , I will try to write it down .
Parsing [sent. 17253 len. 18]: I do not recall it , but see it done ; for it happens again before me .
Parsing [sent. 17254 len. 32]: The time drawing on rapidly for the sailing of the emigrant-ship , my good old nurse -LRB- almost broken-hearted for me , when we first met -RRB- came up to London .
Parsing [sent. 17255 len. 27]: I was constantly with her , and her brother , and the Micawbers -LRB- they being very much together -RRB- ; but Emily I never saw .
Parsing [sent. 17256 len. 19]: One evening when the time was close at hand , I was alone with Peggotty and her brother .
Parsing [sent. 17257 len. 6]: Our conversation turned on Ham .
Parsing [sent. 17258 len. 23]: She described to us how tenderly he had taken leave of her , and how manfully and quietly he had borne himself .
Parsing [sent. 17259 len. 15]: Most of all , of late , when she believed he was most tried .
Parsing [sent. 17260 len. 42]: It was a subject of which the affectionate creature never tired ; and our interest in hearing the many examples which she , who was so much with him , had to relate , was equal to hers in relating them .
Parsing [sent. 17261 len. 31]: My aunt and I were at that time vacating the two cottages at Highgate ; I intending to go abroad , and she to return to her house at Dover .
Parsing [sent. 17262 len. 9]: We had a temporary lodging in Covent Garden .
Parsing [sent. 17263 len. 70]: As I walked home to it , after this evening 's conversation , reflecting on what had passed between Ham and myself when I was last at Yarmouth , I wavered in the original purpose I had formed , of leaving a letter for Emily when I should take leave of her uncle on board the ship , and thought it would be better to write to her now .
Parsing [sent. 17264 len. 24]: She might desire , I thought , after receiving my communication , to send some parting word by me to her unhappy lover .
Parsing [sent. 17265 len. 8]: I ought to give her the opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 17266 len. 18]: I therefore sat down in my room , before going to bed , and wrote to her .
Parsing [sent. 17267 len. 30]: I told her that I had seen him , and that he had requested me to tell her what I have already written in its place in these sheets .
Parsing [sent. 17268 len. 5]: I faithfully repeated it .
Parsing [sent. 17269 len. 16]: I had no need to enlarge upon it , if I had had the right .
Parsing [sent. 17270 len. 16]: Its deep fidelity and goodness were not to be adorned by me or any man .
Parsing [sent. 17271 len. 35]: I left it out , to be sent round in the morning ; with a line to Mr. Peggotty , requesting him to give it to her ; and went to bed at daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 17272 len. 28]: I was weaker than I knew then ; and , not falling asleep until the sun was up , lay late , and unrefreshed , next day .
Parsing [sent. 17273 len. 14]: I was roused by the silent presence of my aunt at my bedside .
Parsing [sent. 17274 len. 17]: I felt it in my sleep , as I suppose we all do feel such things .
Parsing [sent. 17275 len. 28]: ` Trot , my dear , ' she said , when I opened my eyes , ' I could n't make up my mind to disturb you .
Parsing [sent. 17276 len. 11]: Mr. Peggotty is here ; shall he come up ? '
Parsing [sent. 17277 len. 9]: I replied yes , and he soon appeared .
Parsing [sent. 17278 len. 65]: ` Mas ' r Davy , ' he said , when we had shaken hands , ' I giv Em ` ly your letter , sir , and she writ this heer ; and begged of me fur to ask you to read it , and if you see no hurt i n't , to be so kind as take charge o n't . '
Parsing [sent. 17279 len. 7]: ` Have you read it ? '
Parsing [sent. 17280 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 17281 len. 4]: He nodded sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 17282 len. 16]: I opened it , and read as follows : ' I have got your message .
Parsing [sent. 17283 len. 20]: Oh , what can I write , to thank you for your good and blessed kindness to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 17284 len. 10]: I have put the words close to my heart .
Parsing [sent. 17285 len. 8]: I shall keep them till I die .
Parsing [sent. 17286 len. 11]: They are sharp thorns , but they are such comfort .
Parsing [sent. 17287 len. 14]: I have prayed over them , oh , I have prayed so much .
Parsing [sent. 17288 len. 25]: When I find what you are , and what uncle is , I think what God must be , and can cry to him .
Parsing [sent. 17289 len. 5]: ` Good-bye for ever .
Parsing [sent. 17290 len. 15]: Now , my dear , my friend , good-bye for ever in this world .
Parsing [sent. 17291 len. 19]: In another world , if I am forgiven , I may wake a child and come to you .
Parsing [sent. 17292 len. 5]: All thanks and blessings .
Parsing [sent. 17293 len. 5]: Farewell , evermore . '
Parsing [sent. 17294 len. 10]: This , blotted with tears , was the letter .
Parsing [sent. 17295 len. 34]: ` May I tell her as you doe n't see no hurt i n't , and as you 'll be so kind as take charge o n't , Mas ' r Davy ? '
Parsing [sent. 17296 len. 10]: said Mr. Peggotty , when I had read it .
Parsing [sent. 17297 len. 24]: ` Unquestionably , ' said I -- ` but I am thinking -- ' ` Yes , Mas ' r Davy ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17298 len. 18]: I am thinking , ' said I , ` that I 'll go down again to Yarmouth .
Parsing [sent. 17299 len. 20]: There 's time , and to spare , for me to go and come back before the ship sails .
Parsing [sent. 17300 len. 55]: My mind is constantly running on him , in his solitude ; to put this letter of her writing in his hand at this time , and to enable you to tell her , in the moment of parting , that he has got it , will be a kindness to both of them .
Parsing [sent. 17301 len. 18]: I solemnly accepted his commission , dear good fellow , and can not discharge it too completely .
Parsing [sent. 17302 len. 7]: The journey is nothing to me .
Parsing [sent. 17303 len. 11]: I am restless , and shall be better in motion .
Parsing [sent. 17304 len. 7]: I 'll go down tonight . '
Parsing [sent. 17305 len. 37]: Though he anxiously endeavoured to dissuade me , I saw that he was of my mind ; and this , if I had required to be confirmed in my intention , would have had the effect .
Parsing [sent. 17306 len. 22]: He went round to the coach office , at my request , and took the box-seat for me on the mail .
Parsing [sent. 17307 len. 21]: In the evening I started , by that conveyance , down the road I had traversed under so many vicissitudes .
Parsing [sent. 17308 len. 27]: ` Do n't you think that , ' I asked the coachman , in the first stage out of London , ' a very remarkable sky ?
Parsing [sent. 17309 len. 12]: I do n't remember to have seen one like it . '
Parsing [sent. 17310 len. 13]: ` Nor I -- not equal to it , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 17311 len. 7]: ` That 's wind , sir .
Parsing [sent. 17312 len. 15]: There 'll be mischief done at sea , I expect , before long . '
Parsing [sent. 17313 len. 89]: It was a murky confusion -- here and there blotted with a colour like the colour of the smoke from damp fuel -- of flying clouds , tossed up into most remarkable heaps , suggesting greater heights in the clouds than there were depths below them to the bottom of the deepest hollows in the earth , through which the wild moon seemed to plunge headlong , as if , in a dread disturbance of the laws of nature , she had lost her way and were frightened .
Parsing [sent. 17314 len. 20]: There had been a wind all day ; and it was rising then , with an extraordinary great sound .
Parsing [sent. 17315 len. 19]: In another hour it had much increased , and the sky was more overcast , and blew hard .
Parsing [sent. 17316 len. 32]: But , as the night advanced , the clouds closing in and densely over-spreading the whole sky , then very dark , it came on to blow , harder and harder .
Parsing [sent. 17317 len. 13]: It still increased , until our horses could scarcely face the wind .
Parsing [sent. 17318 len. 53]: Many times , in the dark part of the night -LRB- it was then late in September , when the nights were not short -RRB- , the leaders turned about , or came to a dead stop ; and we were often in serious apprehension that the coach would be blown over .
Parsing [sent. 17319 len. 50]: Sweeping gusts of rain came up before this storm , like showers of steel ; and , at those times , when there was any shelter of trees or lee walls to be got , we were fain to stop , in a sheer impossibility of continuing the struggle .
Parsing [sent. 17320 len. 11]: When the day broke , it blew harder and harder .
Parsing [sent. 17321 len. 30]: I had been in Yarmouth when the seamen said it blew great guns , but I had never known the like of this , or anything approaching to it .
Parsing [sent. 17322 len. 50]: We came to Ipswich -- very late , having had to fight every inch of ground since we were ten miles out of London ; and found a cluster of people in the market-place , who had risen from their beds in the night , fearful of falling chimneys .
Parsing [sent. 17323 len. 40]: Some of these , congregating about the inn-yard while we changed horses , told us of great sheets of lead having been ripped off a high church-tower , and flung into a by-street , which they then blocked up .
Parsing [sent. 17324 len. 36]: Others had to tell of country people , coming in from neighbouring villages , who had seen great trees lying torn out of the earth , and whole ricks scattered about the roads and fields .
Parsing [sent. 17325 len. 15]: Still , there was no abatement in the storm , but it blew harder .
Parsing [sent. 17326 len. 31]: As we struggled on , nearer and nearer to the sea , from which this mighty wind was blowing dead on shore , its force became more and more terrific .
Parsing [sent. 17327 len. 21]: Long before we saw the sea , its spray was on our lips , and showered salt rain upon us .
Parsing [sent. 17328 len. 38]: The water was out , over miles and miles of the flat country adjacent to Yarmouth ; and every sheet and puddle lashed its banks , and had its stress of little breakers setting heavily towards us .
Parsing [sent. 17329 len. 34]: When we came within sight of the sea , the waves on the horizon , caught at intervals above the rolling abyss , were like glimpses of another shore with towers and buildings .
Parsing [sent. 17330 len. 39]: When at last we got into the town , the people came out to their doors , all aslant , and with streaming hair , making a wonder of the mail that had come through such a night .
Parsing [sent. 17331 len. 55]: I put up at the old inn , and went down to look at the sea ; staggering along the street , which was strewn with sand and seaweed , and with flying blotches of sea-foam ; afraid of falling slates and tiles ; and holding by people I met , at angry corners .
Parsing [sent. 17332 len. 56]: Coming near the beach , I saw , not only the boatmen , but half the people of the town , lurking behind buildings ; some , now and then braving the fury of the storm to look away to sea , and blown sheer out of their course in trying to get zigzag back .
Parsing [sent. 17333 len. 38]: joining these groups , I found bewailing women whose husbands were away in herring or oyster boats , which there was too much reason to think might have foundered before they could run in anywhere for safety .
Parsing [sent. 17334 len. 71]: Grizzled old sailors were among the people , shaking their heads , as they looked from water to sky , and muttering to one another ; ship-owners , excited and uneasy ; children , huddling together , and peering into older faces ; even stout mariners , disturbed and anxious , levelling their glasses at the sea from behind places of shelter , as if they were surveying an enemy .
Parsing [sent. 17335 len. 38]: The tremendous sea itself , when I could find sufficient pause to look at it , in the agitation of the blinding wind , the flying stones and sand , and the awful noise , confounded me .
Parsing [sent. 17336 len. 30]: As the high watery walls came rolling in , and , at their highest , tumbled into surf , they looked as if the least would engulf the town .
Parsing [sent. 17337 len. 32]: As the receding wave swept back with a hoarse roar , it seemed to scoop out deep caves in the beach , as if its purpose were to undermine the earth .
Parsing [sent. 17338 len. 45]: When some white-headed billows thundered on , and dashed themselves to pieces before they reached the land , every fragment of the late whole seemed possessed by the full might of its wrath , rushing to be gathered to the composition of another monster .
Parsing [sent. 17339 len. 100]: Undulating hills were changed to valleys , undulating valleys -LRB- with a solitary storm-bird sometimes skimming through them -RRB- were lifted up to hills ; masses of water shivered and shook the beach with a booming sound ; every shape tumultuously rolled on , as soon as made , to change its shape and place , and beat another shape and place away ; the ideal shore on the horizon , with its towers and buildings , rose and fell ; the clouds fell fast and thick ; I seemed to see a rending and upheaving of all nature .
Parsing [sent. 17340 len. 42]: Not finding Ham among the people whom this memorable wind -- for it is still remembered down there , as the greatest ever known to blow upon that coast -- had brought together , I made my way to his house .
Parsing [sent. 17341 len. 29]: It was shut ; and as no one answered to my knocking , I went , by back ways and by-lanes , to the yard where he worked .
Parsing [sent. 17342 len. 39]: I learned , there , that he had gone to Lowestoft , to meet some sudden exigency of ship-repairing in which his skill was required ; but that he would be back tomorrow morning , in good time .
Parsing [sent. 17343 len. 32]: I went back to the inn ; and when I had washed and dressed , and tried to sleep , but in vain , it was five o'clock in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 17344 len. 70]: I had not sat five minutes by the coffee-room fire , when the waiter , coming to stir it , as an excuse for talking , told me that two colliers had gone down , with all hands , a few miles away ; and that some other ships had been seen labouring hard in the Roads , and trying , in great distress , to keep off shore .
Parsing [sent. 17345 len. 22]: Mercy on them , and on all poor sailors , said he , if we had another night like the last !
Parsing [sent. 17346 len. 27]: I was very much depressed in spirits ; very solitary ; and felt an uneasiness in Ham 's not being there , disproportionate to the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 17347 len. 26]: I was seriously affected , without knowing how much , by late events ; and my long exposure to the fierce wind had confused me .
Parsing [sent. 17348 len. 22]: There was that jumble in my thoughts and recollections , that I had lost the clear arrangement of time and distance .
Parsing [sent. 17349 len. 33]: Thus , if I had gone out into the town , I should not have been surprised , I think , to encounter someone who I knew must be then in London .
Parsing [sent. 17350 len. 16]: So to speak , there was in these respects a curious inattention in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 17351 len. 24]: Yet it was busy , too , with all the remembrances the place naturally awakened ; and they were particularly distinct and vivid .
Parsing [sent. 17352 len. 29]: In this state , the waiter 's dismal intelligence about the ships immediately connected itself , without any effort of my volition , with my uneasiness about Ham .
Parsing [sent. 17353 len. 20]: I was persuaded that I had an apprehension of his returning from Lowestoft by sea , and being lost .
Parsing [sent. 17354 len. 39]: This grew so strong with me , that I resolved to go back to the yard before I took my dinner , and ask the boat-builder if he thought his attempting to return by sea at all likely ?
Parsing [sent. 17355 len. 26]: If he gave me the least reason to think so , I would go over to Lowestoft and prevent it by bringing him with me .
Parsing [sent. 17356 len. 13]: I hastily ordered my dinner , and went back to the yard .
Parsing [sent. 17357 len. 22]: I was none too soon ; for the boat-builder , with a lantern in his hand , was locking the yard-gate .
Parsing [sent. 17358 len. 51]: He quite laughed when I asked him the question , and said there was no fear ; no man in his senses , or out of them , would put off in such a gale of wind , least of all Ham Peggotty , who had been born to seafaring .
Parsing [sent. 17359 len. 30]: So sensible of this , beforehand , that I had really felt ashamed of doing what I was nevertheless impelled to do , I went back to the inn .
Parsing [sent. 17360 len. 13]: If such a wind could rise , I think it was rising .
Parsing [sent. 17361 len. 46]: The howl and roar , the rattling of the doors and windows , the rumbling in the chimneys , the apparent rocking of the very house that sheltered me , and the prodigious tumult of the sea , were more fearful than in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 17362 len. 22]: But there was now a great darkness besides ; and that invested the storm with new terrors , real and fanciful .
Parsing [sent. 17363 len. 19]: I could not eat , I could not sit still , I could not continue steadfast to anything .
Parsing [sent. 17364 len. 25]: Something within me , faintly answering to the storm without , tossed up the depths of my memory and made a tumult in them .
Parsing [sent. 17365 len. 32]: Yet , in all the hurry of my thoughts , wild running with the thundering sea , -- the storm , and my uneasiness regarding Ham were always in the fore-ground .
Parsing [sent. 17366 len. 21]: My dinner went away almost untasted , and I tried to refresh myself with a glass or two of wine .
Parsing [sent. 17367 len. 3]: In vain .
Parsing [sent. 17368 len. 32]: I fell into a dull slumber before the fire , without losing my consciousness , either of the uproar out of doors , or of the place in which I was .
Parsing [sent. 17369 len. 40]: Both became overshadowed by a new and indefinable horror ; and when I awoke -- or rather when I shook off the lethargy that bound me in my chair - my whole frame thrilled with objectless and unintelligible fear .
Parsing [sent. 17370 len. 31]: I walked to and fro , tried to read an old gazetteer , listened to the awful noises : looked at faces , scenes , and figures in the fire .
Parsing [sent. 17371 len. 26]: At length , the steady ticking of the undisturbed clock on the wall tormented me to that degree that I resolved to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 17372 len. 26]: It was reassuring , on such a night , to be told that some of the inn-servants had agreed together to sit up until morning .
Parsing [sent. 17373 len. 38]: I went to bed , exceedingly weary and heavy ; but , on my lying down , all such sensations vanished , as if by magic , and I was broad awake , with every sense refined .
Parsing [sent. 17374 len. 48]: For hours I lay there , listening to the wind and water ; imagining , now , that I heard shrieks out at sea ; now , that I distinctly heard the firing of signal guns ; and now , the fall of houses in the town .
Parsing [sent. 17375 len. 46]: I got up , several times , and looked out ; but could see nothing , except the reflection in the window-panes of the faint candle I had left burning , and of my own haggard face looking in at me from the black void .
Parsing [sent. 17376 len. 22]: At length , my restlessness attained to such a pitch , that I hurried on my clothes , and went downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 17377 len. 47]: In the large kitchen , where I dimly saw bacon and ropes of onions hanging from the beams , the watchers were clustered together , in various attitudes , about a table , purposely moved away from the great chimney , and brought near the door .
Parsing [sent. 17378 len. 51]: A pretty girl , who had her ears stopped with her apron , and her eyes upon the door , screamed when I appeared , supposing me to be a spirit ; but the others had more presence of mind , and were glad of an addition to their company .
Parsing [sent. 17379 len. 33]: One man , referring to the topic they had been discussing , asked me whether I thought the souls of the collier-crews who had gone down , were out in the storm ?
Parsing [sent. 17380 len. 11]: I remained there , I dare say , two hours .
Parsing [sent. 17381 len. 14]: Once , I opened the yard-gate , and looked into the empty street .
Parsing [sent. 17382 len. 40]: The sand , the sea-weed , and the flakes of foam , were driving by ; and I was obliged to call for assistance before I could shut the gate again , and make it fast against the wind .
Parsing [sent. 17383 len. 47]: There was a dark gloom in my solitary chamber , when I at length returned to it ; but I was tired now , and , getting into bed again , fell -- off a tower and down a precipice -- into the depths of sleep .
Parsing [sent. 17384 len. 31]: I have an impression that for a long time , though I dreamed of being elsewhere and in a variety of scenes , it was always blowing in my dream .
Parsing [sent. 17385 len. 40]: At length , I lost that feeble hold upon reality , and was engaged with two dear friends , but who they were I do n't know , at the siege of some town in a roar of cannonading .
Parsing [sent. 17386 len. 32]: The thunder of the cannon was so loud and incessant , that I could not hear something I much desired to hear , until I made a great exertion and awoke .
Parsing [sent. 17387 len. 29]: It was broad day -- eight or nine o'clock ; the storm raging , in lieu of the batteries ; and someone knocking and calling at my door .
Parsing [sent. 17388 len. 7]: ` What is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 17389 len. 4]: I cried . '
Parsing [sent. 17390 len. 3]: A wreck !
Parsing [sent. 17391 len. 4]: Close by ! '
Parsing [sent. 17392 len. 13]: I sprung out of bed , and asked , what wreck ? '
Parsing [sent. 17393 len. 14]: A schooner , from Spain or Portugal , laden with fruit and wine .
Parsing [sent. 17394 len. 12]: Make haste , sir , if you want to see her !
Parsing [sent. 17395 len. 18]: It 's thought , down on the beach , she 'll go to pieces every moment . '
Parsing [sent. 17396 len. 28]: The excited voice went clamouring along the staircase ; and I wrapped myself in my clothes as quickly as I could , and ran into the street .
Parsing [sent. 17397 len. 18]: Numbers of people were there before me , all running in one direction , to the beach .
Parsing [sent. 17398 len. 19]: I ran the same way , outstripping a good many , and soon came facing the wild sea .
Parsing [sent. 17399 len. 37]: The wind might by this time have lulled a little , though not more sensibly than if the cannonading I had dreamed of , had been diminished by the silencing of half-a-dozen guns out of hundreds .
Parsing [sent. 17400 len. 27]: But the sea , having upon it the additional agitation of the whole night , was infinitely more terrific than when I had seen it last .
Parsing [sent. 17401 len. 47]: Every appearance it had then presented , bore the expression of being swelled ; and the height to which the breakers rose , and , looking over one another , bore one another down , and rolled in , in interminable hosts , was most appalling .
Parsing [sent. 17402 len. 58]: In the difficulty of hearing anything but wind and waves , and in the crowd , and the unspeakable confusion , and my first breathless efforts to stand against the weather , I was so confused that I looked out to sea for the wreck , and saw nothing but the foaming heads of the great waves .
Parsing [sent. 17403 len. 31]: A half-dressed boatman , standing next me , pointed with his bare arm -LRB- a tattoo 'd arrow on it , pointing in the same direction -RRB- to the left .
Parsing [sent. 17404 len. 15]: Then , O great Heaven , I saw it , close in upon us !
Parsing [sent. 17405 len. 69]: One mast was broken short off , six or eight feet from the deck , and lay over the side , entangled in a maze of sail and rigging ; and all that ruin , as the ship rolled and beat -- which she did without a moment 's pause , and with a violence quite inconceivable -- beat the side as if it would stave it in .
Parsing [sent. 17406 len. 59]: Some efforts were even then being made , to cut this portion of the wreck away ; for , as the ship , which was broadside on , turned towards us in her rolling , I plainly descried her people at work with axes , especially one active figure with long curling hair , conspicuous among the rest .
Parsing [sent. 17407 len. 59]: But a great cry , which was audible even above the wind and water , rose from the shore at this moment ; the sea , sweeping over the rolling wreck , made a clean breach , and carried men , spars , casks , planks , bulwarks , heaps of such toys , into the boiling surge .
Parsing [sent. 17408 len. 27]: The second mast was yet standing , with the rags of a rent sail , and a wild confusion of broken cordage flapping to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 17409 len. 23]: The ship had struck once , the same boatman hoarsely said in my ear , and then lifted in and struck again .
Parsing [sent. 17410 len. 34]: I understood him to add that she was parting amidships , and I could readily suppose so , for the rolling and beating were too tremendous for any human work to suffer long .
Parsing [sent. 17411 len. 45]: As he spoke , there was another great cry of pity from the beach ; four men arose with the wreck out of the deep , clinging to the rigging of the remaining mast ; uppermost , the active figure with the curling hair .
Parsing [sent. 17412 len. 82]: There was a bell on board ; and as the ship rolled and dashed , like a desperate creature driven mad , now showing us the whole sweep of her deck , as she turned on her beam-ends towards the shore , now nothing but her keel , as she sprung wildly over and turned towards the sea , the bell rang ; and its sound , the knell of those unhappy men , was borne towards us on the wind .
Parsing [sent. 17413 len. 10]: Again we lost her , and again she rose .
Parsing [sent. 17414 len. 5]: Two men were gone .
Parsing [sent. 17415 len. 7]: The agony on the shore increased .
Parsing [sent. 17416 len. 17]: Men groaned , and clasped their hands ; women shrieked , and turned away their faces .
Parsing [sent. 17417 len. 19]: Some ran wildly up and down along the beach , crying for help where no help could be .
Parsing [sent. 17418 len. 29]: I found myself one of these , frantically imploring a knot of sailors whom I knew , not to let those two lost creatures perish before our eyes .
Parsing [sent. 17419 len. 111]: They were making out to me , in an agitated way -- I do n't know how , for the little I could hear I was scarcely composed enough to understand -- that the lifeboat had been bravely manned an hour ago , and could do nothing ; and that as no man would be so desperate as to attempt to wade off with a rope , and establish a communication with the shore , there was nothing left to try ; when I noticed that some new sensation moved the people on the beach , and saw them part , and Ham come breaking through them to the front .
Parsing [sent. 17420 len. 18]: I ran to him -- as well as I know , to repeat my appeal for help .
Parsing [sent. 17421 len. 56]: But , distracted though I was , by a sight so new to me and terrible , the determination in his face , and his look out to sea -- exactly the same look as I remembered in connexion with the morning after Emily 's flight -- awoke me to a knowledge of his danger .
Parsing [sent. 17422 len. 40]: I held him back with both arms ; and implored the men with whom I had been speaking , not to listen to him , not to do murder , not to let him stir from off that sand !
Parsing [sent. 17423 len. 47]: Another cry arose on shore ; and looking to the wreck , we saw the cruel sail , with blow on blow , beat off the lower of the two men , and fly up in triumph round the active figure left alone upon the mast .
Parsing [sent. 17424 len. 36]: Against such a sight , and against such determination as that of the calmly desperate man who was already accustomed to lead half the people present , I might as hopefully have entreated the wind .
Parsing [sent. 17425 len. 28]: ` Mas ' r Davy , ' he said , cheerily grasping me by both hands , ` if my time is come , 't is come .
Parsing [sent. 17426 len. 10]: If ` ta n't , I 'll bide it .
Parsing [sent. 17427 len. 9]: Lord above bless you , and bless all !
Parsing [sent. 17428 len. 6]: Mates , make me ready !
Parsing [sent. 17429 len. 6]: I 'm a-going off ! '
Parsing [sent. 17430 len. 59]: I was swept away , but not unkindly , to some distance , where the people around me made me stay ; urging , as I confusedly perceived , that he was bent on going , with help or without , and that I should endanger the precautions for his safety by troubling those with whom they rested .
Parsing [sent. 17431 len. 46]: I do n't know what I answered , or what they rejoined ; but I saw hurry on the beach , and men running with ropes from a capstan that was there , and penetrating into a circle of figures that hid him from me .
Parsing [sent. 17432 len. 65]: Then , I saw him standing alone , in a seaman 's frock and trousers : a rope in his hand , or slung to his wrist : another round his body : and several of the best men holding , at a little distance , to the latter , which he laid out himself , slack upon the shore , at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 17433 len. 13]: The wreck , even to my unpractised eye , was breaking up .
Parsing [sent. 17434 len. 26]: I saw that she was parting in the middle , and that the life of the solitary man upon the mast hung by a thread .
Parsing [sent. 17435 len. 7]: Still , he clung to it .
Parsing [sent. 17436 len. 53]: He had a singular red cap on , -- not like a sailor 's cap , but of a finer colour ; and as the few yielding planks between him and destruction rolled and bulged , and his anticipative death-knell rung , he was seen by all of us to wave it .
Parsing [sent. 17437 len. 30]: I saw him do it now , and thought I was going distracted , when his action brought an old remembrance to my mind of a once dear friend .
Parsing [sent. 17438 len. 87]: Ham watched the sea , standing alone , with the silence of suspended breath behind him , and the storm before , until there was a great retiring wave , when , with a backward glance at those who held the rope which was made fast round his body , he dashed in after it , and in a moment was buffeting with the water ; rising with the hills , falling with the valleys , lost beneath the foam ; then drawn again to land .
Parsing [sent. 17439 len. 5]: They hauled in hastily .
Parsing [sent. 17440 len. 4]: He was hurt .
Parsing [sent. 17441 len. 20]: I saw blood on his face , from where I stood ; but he took no thought of that .
Parsing [sent. 17442 len. 31]: He seemed hurriedly to give them some directions for leaving him more free -- or so I judged from the motion of his arm -- and was gone as before .
Parsing [sent. 17443 len. 41]: And now he made for the wreck , rising with the hills , falling with the valleys , lost beneath the rugged foam , borne in towards the shore , borne on towards the ship , striving hard and valiantly .
Parsing [sent. 17444 len. 18]: The distance was nothing , but the power of the sea and wind made the strife deadly .
Parsing [sent. 17445 len. 7]: At length he neared the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 17446 len. 59]: He was so near , that with one more of his vigorous strokes he would be clinging to it , -- when a high , green , vast hill-side of water , moving on shoreward , from beyond the ship , he seemed to leap up into it with a mighty bound , and the ship was gone !
Parsing [sent. 17447 len. 29]: Some eddying fragments I saw in the sea , as if a mere cask had been broken , in running to the spot where they were hauling in .
Parsing [sent. 17448 len. 6]: Consternation was in every face .
Parsing [sent. 17449 len. 12]: They drew him to my very feet -- insensible -- dead .
Parsing [sent. 17450 len. 52]: He was carried to the nearest house ; and , no one preventing me now , I remained near him , busy , while every means of restoration were tried ; but he had been beaten to death by the great wave , and his generous heart was stilled for ever .
Parsing [sent. 17451 len. 41]: As I sat beside the bed , when hope was abandoned and all was done , a fisherman , who had known me when Emily and I were children , and ever since , whispered my name at the door .
Parsing [sent. 17452 len. 34]: ` Sir , ' said he , with tears starting to his weather-beaten face , which , with his trembling lips , was ashy pale , ` will you come over yonder ? '
Parsing [sent. 17453 len. 15]: The old remembrance that had been recalled to me , was in his look .
Parsing [sent. 17454 len. 25]: I asked him , terror-stricken , leaning on the arm he held out to support me : ` Has a body come ashore ? '
Parsing [sent. 17455 len. 7]: He said , ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 17456 len. 7]: ` Do I know it ? '
Parsing [sent. 17457 len. 4]: I asked then .
Parsing [sent. 17458 len. 4]: He answered nothing .
Parsing [sent. 17459 len. 8]: But he led me to the shore .
Parsing [sent. 17460 len. 75]: And on that part of it where she and I had looked for shells , two children -- on that part of it where some lighter fragments of the old boat , blown down last night , had been scattered by the wind -- among the ruins of the home he had wronged -- I saw him lying with his head upon his arm , as I had often seen him lie at school .
Parsing [sent. 17461 len. 53]: Chapter 56 The New Wound , and the Old No need , O Steerforth , to have said , when we last spoke together , in that hour which I so little deemed to be our parting-hour -- no need to have said , ` Think of me at my best ! '
Parsing [sent. 17462 len. 17]: I had done that ever ; and could I change now , looking on this sight !
Parsing [sent. 17463 len. 30]: They brought a hand-bier , and laid him on it , and covered him with a flag , and took him up and bore him on towards the houses .
Parsing [sent. 17464 len. 23]: All the men who carried him had known him , and gone sailing with him , and seen him merry and bold .
Parsing [sent. 17465 len. 29]: They carried him through the wild roar , a hush in the midst of all the tumult ; and took him to the cottage where Death was already .
Parsing [sent. 17466 len. 24]: But when they set the bier down on the threshold , they looked at one another , and at me , and whispered .
Parsing [sent. 17467 len. 4]: I knew why .
Parsing [sent. 17468 len. 18]: They felt as if it were not right to lay him down in the same quiet room .
Parsing [sent. 17469 len. 14]: We went into the town , and took our burden to the inn .
Parsing [sent. 17470 len. 36]: So soon as I could at all collect my thoughts , I sent for Joram , and begged him to provide me a conveyance in which it could be got to London in the night .
Parsing [sent. 17471 len. 40]: I knew that the care of it , and the hard duty of preparing his mother to receive it , could only rest with me ; and I was anxious to discharge that duty as faithfully as I could .
Parsing [sent. 17472 len. 20]: I chose the night for the journey , that there might be less curiosity when I left the town .
Parsing [sent. 17473 len. 32]: But , although it was nearly midnight when I came out of the yard in a chaise , followed by what I had in charge , there were many people waiting .
Parsing [sent. 17474 len. 44]: At intervals , along the town , and even a little way out upon the road , I saw more : but at length only the bleak night and the open country were around me , and the ashes of my youthful friendship .
Parsing [sent. 17475 len. 51]: Upon a mellow autumn day , about noon , when the ground was perfumed by fallen leaves , and many more , in beautiful tints of yellow , red , and brown , yet hung upon the trees , through which the sun was shining , I arrived at Highgate .
Parsing [sent. 17476 len. 36]: I walked the last mile , thinking as I went along of what I had to do ; and left the carriage that had followed me all through the night , awaiting orders to advance .
Parsing [sent. 17477 len. 15]: The house , when I came up to it , looked just the same .
Parsing [sent. 17478 len. 27]: Not a blind was raised ; no sign of life was in the dull paved court , with its covered way leading to the disused door .
Parsing [sent. 17479 len. 11]: The wind had quite gone down , and nothing moved .
Parsing [sent. 17480 len. 37]: I had not , at first , the courage to ring at the gate ; and when I did ring , my errand seemed to me to be expressed in the very sound of the bell .
Parsing [sent. 17481 len. 34]: The little parlour-maid came out , with the key in her hand ; and looking earnestly at me as she unlocked the gate , said : ' I beg your pardon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 17482 len. 6]: Are you ill ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17483 len. 11]: I have been much agitated , and am fatigued . '
Parsing [sent. 17484 len. 8]: ` Is anything the matter , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 17485 len. 4]: -- Mr. James ?
Parsing [sent. 17486 len. 6]: -- ' ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 17487 len. 18]: said I. ` Yes , something has happened , that I have to break to Mrs. Steerforth .
Parsing [sent. 17488 len. 6]: She is at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 17489 len. 35]: The girl anxiously replied that her mistress was very seldom out now , even in a carriage ; that she kept her room ; that she saw no company , but would see me .
Parsing [sent. 17490 len. 15]: Her mistress was up , she said , and Miss Dartle was with her .
Parsing [sent. 17491 len. 7]: What message should she take upstairs ?
Parsing [sent. 17492 len. 43]: Giving her a strict charge to be careful of her manner , and only to carry in my card and say I waited , I sat down in the drawing-room -LRB- which we had now reached -RRB- until she should come back .
Parsing [sent. 17493 len. 16]: Its former pleasant air of occupation was gone , and the shutters were half closed .
Parsing [sent. 17494 len. 13]: The harp had not been used for many and many a day .
Parsing [sent. 17495 len. 10]: His picture , as a boy , was there .
Parsing [sent. 17496 len. 13]: The cabinet in which his mother had kept his letters was there .
Parsing [sent. 17497 len. 17]: I wondered if she ever read them now ; if she would ever read them more !
Parsing [sent. 17498 len. 15]: The house was so still that I heard the girl 's light step upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 17499 len. 44]: On her return , she brought a message , to the effect that Mrs. Steerforth was an invalid and could not come down ; but that if I would excuse her being in her chamber , she would be glad to see me .
Parsing [sent. 17500 len. 9]: In a few moments I stood before her .
Parsing [sent. 17501 len. 11]: She was in his room ; not in her own .
Parsing [sent. 17502 len. 52]: I felt , of course , that she had taken to occupy it , in remembrance of him ; and that the many tokens of his old sports and accomplishments , by which she was surrounded , remained there , just as he had left them , for the same reason .
Parsing [sent. 17503 len. 42]: She murmured , however , even in her reception of me , that she was out of her own chamber because its aspect was unsuited to her infirmity ; and with her stately look repelled the least suspicion of the truth .
Parsing [sent. 17504 len. 11]: At her chair , as usual , was Rosa Dartle .
Parsing [sent. 17505 len. 24]: From the first moment of her dark eyes resting on me , I saw she knew I was the bearer of evil tidings .
Parsing [sent. 17506 len. 8]: The scar sprung into view that instant .
Parsing [sent. 17507 len. 36]: She withdrew herself a step behind the chair , to keep her own face out of Mrs. Steerforth 's observation ; and scrutinized me with a piercing gaze that never faltered , never shrunk . '
Parsing [sent. 17508 len. 18]: I am sorry to observe you are in mourning , sir , ' said Mrs. Steerforth . '
Parsing [sent. 17509 len. 26]: I am unhappily a widower , ' said I. ` You are very young to know so great a loss , ' she returned . '
Parsing [sent. 17510 len. 7]: I am grieved to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 17511 len. 7]: I am grieved to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 17512 len. 11]: I hope Time will be good to you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17513 len. 21]: I hope Time , ' said I , looking at her , ` will be good to all of us .
Parsing [sent. 17514 len. 17]: Dear Mrs. Steerforth , we must all trust to that , in our heaviest misfortunes . '
Parsing [sent. 17515 len. 16]: The earnestness of my manner , and the tears in my eyes , alarmed her .
Parsing [sent. 17516 len. 13]: The whole course of her thoughts appeared to stop , and change .
Parsing [sent. 17517 len. 16]: I tried to command my voice in gently saying his name , but it trembled .
Parsing [sent. 17518 len. 16]: She repeated it to herself , two or three times , in a low tone .
Parsing [sent. 17519 len. 19]: Then , addressing me , she said , with enforced calmness : ` My son is ill . '
Parsing [sent. 17520 len. 5]: ` Very ill . '
Parsing [sent. 17521 len. 8]: ` You have seen him ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17522 len. 4]: I have . '
Parsing [sent. 17523 len. 6]: ` Are you reconciled ? '
Parsing [sent. 17524 len. 12]: I could not say Yes , I could not say No .
Parsing [sent. 17525 len. 39]: She slightly turned her head towards the spot where Rosa Dartle had been standing at her elbow , and in that moment I said , by the motion of my lips , to Rosa , ` Dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 17526 len. 61]: That Mrs. Steerforth might not be induced to look behind her , and read , plainly written , what she was not yet prepared to know , I met her look quickly ; but I had seen Rosa Dartle throw her hands up in the air with vehemence of despair and horror , and then clasp them on her face .
Parsing [sent. 17527 len. 11]: The handsome lady -- so like , oh so like !
Parsing [sent. 17528 len. 16]: -- regarded me with a fixed look , and put her hand to her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 17529 len. 36]: I besought her to be calm , and prepare herself to bear what I had to tell ; but I should rather have entreated her to weep , for she sat like a stone figure .
Parsing [sent. 17530 len. 23]: ` When I was last here , ' I faltered , ` Miss Dartle told me he was sailing here and there .
Parsing [sent. 17531 len. 11]: The night before last was a dreadful one at sea .
Parsing [sent. 17532 len. 40]: If he were at sea that night , and near a dangerous coast , as it is said he was ; and if the vessel that was seen should really be the ship which -- ' ` Rosa ! '
Parsing [sent. 17533 len. 10]: said Mrs. Steerforth , ` come to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 17534 len. 10]: She came , but with no sympathy or gentleness .
Parsing [sent. 17535 len. 18]: Her eyes gleamed like fire as she confronted his mother , and broke into a frightful laugh .
Parsing [sent. 17536 len. 16]: ` Now , ' she said , ` is your pride appeased , you madwoman ?
Parsing [sent. 17537 len. 12]: Now has he made atonement to you -- with his life !
Parsing [sent. 17538 len. 4]: Do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 17539 len. 5]: -- His life ! '
Parsing [sent. 17540 len. 28]: Mrs. Steerforth , fallen back stiffly in her chair , and making no sound but a moan , cast her eyes upon her with a wide stare .
Parsing [sent. 17541 len. 4]: ` Aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 17542 len. 15]: cried Rosa , smiting herself passionately on the breast , ` look at me !
Parsing [sent. 17543 len. 10]: Moan , and groan , and look at me !
Parsing [sent. 17544 len. 4]: Look here ! '
Parsing [sent. 17545 len. 13]: striking the scar , ` at your dead child 's handiwork ! '
Parsing [sent. 17546 len. 16]: The moan the mother uttered , from time to time , went to My heart .
Parsing [sent. 17547 len. 4]: Always the same .
Parsing [sent. 17548 len. 5]: Always inarticulate and stifled .
Parsing [sent. 17549 len. 17]: Always accompanied with an incapable motion of the head , but with no change of face .
Parsing [sent. 17550 len. 24]: Always proceeding from a rigid mouth and closed teeth , as if the jaw were locked and the face frozen up in pain .
Parsing [sent. 17551 len. 10]: ` Do you remember when he did this ? '
Parsing [sent. 17552 len. 3]: she proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 17553 len. 33]: ` Do you remember when , in his inheritance of your nature , and in your pampering of his pride and passion , he did this , and disfigured me for life ?
Parsing [sent. 17554 len. 24]: Look at me , marked until I die with his high displeasure ; and moan and groan for what you made him ! '
Parsing [sent. 17555 len. 9]: ` Miss Dartle , ' I entreated her .
Parsing [sent. 17556 len. 13]: ` For Heaven 's sake -- ' ' I WILL speak ! '
Parsing [sent. 17557 len. 11]: she said , turning on me with her lightning eyes .
Parsing [sent. 17558 len. 6]: ` Be silent , you !
Parsing [sent. 17559 len. 16]: Look at me , I say , proud mother of a proud , false son !
Parsing [sent. 17560 len. 26]: Moan for your nurture of him , moan for your corruption of him , moan for your loss of him , moan for mine ! '
Parsing [sent. 17561 len. 24]: She clenched her hand , and trembled through her spare , worn figure , as if her passion were killing her by inches .
Parsing [sent. 17562 len. 8]: ` You , resent his self-will ! '
Parsing [sent. 17563 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 17564 len. 9]: ` You , injured by his haughty temper !
Parsing [sent. 17565 len. 24]: You , who opposed to both , when your hair was grey , the qualities which made both when you gave him birth !
Parsing [sent. 17566 len. 22]: YOU , who from his cradle reared him to be what he was , and stunted what he should have been !
Parsing [sent. 17567 len. 13]: Are you rewarded , now , for your years of trouble ? '
Parsing [sent. 17568 len. 8]: ` Oh , Miss Dartle , shame !
Parsing [sent. 17569 len. 5]: Oh cruel ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 17570 len. 15]: I tell you , ' she returned , ' I WILL speak to her .
Parsing [sent. 17571 len. 14]: No power on earth should stop me , while I was standing here !
Parsing [sent. 17572 len. 15]: Have I been silent all these years , and shall I not speak now ?
Parsing [sent. 17573 len. 11]: I loved him better than you ever loved him ! '
Parsing [sent. 17574 len. 6]: turning on her fiercely . '
Parsing [sent. 17575 len. 11]: I could have loved him , and asked no return .
Parsing [sent. 17576 len. 24]: If I had been his wife , I could have been the slave of his caprices for a word of love a year .
Parsing [sent. 17577 len. 5]: I should have been .
Parsing [sent. 17578 len. 7]: Who knows it better than I ?
Parsing [sent. 17579 len. 10]: You were exacting , proud , punctilious , selfish .
Parsing [sent. 17580 len. 17]: My love would have been devoted -- would have trod your paltry whimpering under foot ! '
Parsing [sent. 17581 len. 16]: With flashing eyes , she stamped upon the ground as if she actually did it .
Parsing [sent. 17582 len. 5]: ` Look here ! '
Parsing [sent. 17583 len. 13]: she said , striking the scar again , with a relentless hand .
Parsing [sent. 17584 len. 23]: ` When he grew into the better understanding of what he had done , he saw it , and repented of it !
Parsing [sent. 17585 len. 40]: I could sing to him , and talk to him , and show the ardour that I felt in all he did , and attain with labour to such knowledge as most interested him ; and I attracted him .
Parsing [sent. 17586 len. 11]: When he was freshest and truest , he loved me .
Parsing [sent. 17587 len. 5]: Yes , he did !
Parsing [sent. 17588 len. 23]: Many a time , when you were put off with a slight word , he has taken Me to his heart ! '
Parsing [sent. 17589 len. 43]: She said it with a taunting pride in the midst of her frenzy -- for it was little less -- yet with an eager remembrance of it , in which the smouldering embers of a gentler feeling kindled for the moment . '
Parsing [sent. 17590 len. 54]: I descended -- as I might have known I should , but that he fascinated me with his boyish courtship -- into a doll , a trifle for the occupation of an idle hour , to be dropped , and taken up , and trifled with , as the inconstant humour took him .
Parsing [sent. 17591 len. 9]: When he grew weary , I grew weary .
Parsing [sent. 17592 len. 36]: As his fancy died out , I would no more have tried to strengthen any power I had , than I would have married him on his being forced to take me for his wife .
Parsing [sent. 17593 len. 10]: We fell away from one another without a word .
Parsing [sent. 17594 len. 10]: Perhaps you saw it , and were not sorry .
Parsing [sent. 17595 len. 29]: Since then , I have been a mere disfigured piece of furniture between you both ; having no eyes , no ears , no feelings , no remembrances .
Parsing [sent. 17596 len. 2]: Moan ?
Parsing [sent. 17597 len. 12]: Moan for what you made him ; not for your love .
Parsing [sent. 17598 len. 19]: I tell you that the time was , when I loved him better than you ever did ! '
Parsing [sent. 17599 len. 37]: She stood with her bright angry eyes confronting the wide stare , and the set face ; and softened no more , when the moaning was repeated , than if the face had been a picture .
Parsing [sent. 17600 len. 32]: ` Miss Dartle , ' said I , ` if you can be so obdurate as not to feel for this afflicted mother -- ' ` Who feels for me ? '
Parsing [sent. 17601 len. 4]: she sharply retorted .
Parsing [sent. 17602 len. 6]: ` She has sown this .
Parsing [sent. 17603 len. 12]: Let her moan for the harvest that she reaps today ! '
Parsing [sent. 17604 len. 10]: ` And if his faults -- ' I began .
Parsing [sent. 17605 len. 4]: ` Faults ! '
Parsing [sent. 17606 len. 8]: she cried , bursting into passionate tears .
Parsing [sent. 17607 len. 6]: ` Who dares malign him ?
Parsing [sent. 17608 len. 15]: He had a soul worth millions of the friends to whom he stooped ! '
Parsing [sent. 17609 len. 25]: ` No one can have loved him better , no one can hold him in dearer remembrance than I , ' I replied . '
Parsing [sent. 17610 len. 48]: I meant to say , if you have no compassion for his mother ; or if his faults -- you have been bitter on them -- ' ` It 's false , ' she cried , tearing her black hair ; ' I loved him ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 17611 len. 45]: - if his faults can not , ' I went on , ` be banished from your remembrance , in such an hour ; look at that figure , even as one you have never seen before , and render it some help ! '
Parsing [sent. 17612 len. 13]: All this time , the figure was unchanged , and looked unchangeable .
Parsing [sent. 17613 len. 34]: Motionless , rigid , staring ; moaning in the same dumb way from time to time , with the same helpless motion of the head ; but giving no other sign of life .
Parsing [sent. 17614 len. 16]: Miss Dartle suddenly kneeled down before it , and began to loosen the dress . '
Parsing [sent. 17615 len. 6]: A curse upon you ! '
Parsing [sent. 17616 len. 17]: she said , looking round at me , with a mingled expression of rage and grief .
Parsing [sent. 17617 len. 13]: ` It was in an evil hour that you ever came here !
Parsing [sent. 17618 len. 5]: A curse upon you !
Parsing [sent. 17619 len. 3]: Go ! '
Parsing [sent. 17620 len. 22]: After passing out of the room , I hurried back to ring the bell , the sooner to alarm the servants .
Parsing [sent. 17621 len. 53]: She had then taken the impassive figure in her arms , and , still upon her knees , was weeping over it , kissing it , calling to it , rocking it to and fro upon her bosom like a child , and trying every tender means to rouse the dormant senses .
Parsing [sent. 17622 len. 22]: No longer afraid of leaving her , I noiselessly turned back again ; and alarmed the house as I went out .
Parsing [sent. 17623 len. 18]: Later in the day , I returned , and we laid him in his mother 's room .
Parsing [sent. 17624 len. 43]: She was just the same , they told me ; Miss Dartle never left her ; doctors were in attendance , many things had been tried ; but she lay like a statue , except for the low sound now and then .
Parsing [sent. 17625 len. 12]: I went through the dreary house , and darkened the windows .
Parsing [sent. 17626 len. 13]: The windows of the chamber where he lay , I darkened last .
Parsing [sent. 17627 len. 31]: I lifted up the leaden hand , and held it to my heart ; and all the world seemed death and silence , broken only by his mother 's moaning .
Parsing [sent. 17628 len. 23]: Chapter 57 The Emigrants One thing more , I had to do , before yielding myself to the shock of these emotions .
Parsing [sent. 17629 len. 27]: It was , to conceal what had occurred , from those who were going away ; and to dismiss them on their voyage in happy ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 17630 len. 10]: In this , no time was to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 17631 len. 27]: I took Mr. Micawber aside that same night , and confided to him the task of standing between Mr. Peggotty and intelligence of the late catastrophe .
Parsing [sent. 17632 len. 24]: He zealously undertook to do so , and to intercept any newspaper through which it might , without such precautions , reach him .
Parsing [sent. 17633 len. 30]: ` If it penetrates to him , sir , ' said Mr. Micawber , striking himself on the breast , ` it shall first pass through this body ! '
Parsing [sent. 17634 len. 35]: Mr. Micawber , I must observe , in his adaptation of himself to a new state of society , had acquired a bold buccaneering air , not absolutely lawless , but defensive and prompt .
Parsing [sent. 17635 len. 31]: One might have supposed him a child of the wilderness , long accustomed to live out of the confines of civilization , and about to return to his native wilds .
Parsing [sent. 17636 len. 33]: He had provided himself , among other things , with a complete suit of oilskin , and a straw hat with a very low crown , pitched or caulked on the outside .
Parsing [sent. 17637 len. 48]: In this rough clothing , with a common mariner 's telescope under his arm , and a shrewd trick of casting up his eye at the sky as looking out for dirty weather , he was far more nautical , after his manner , than Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 17638 len. 16]: His whole family , if I may so express it , were cleared for action .
Parsing [sent. 17639 len. 59]: I found Mrs. Micawber in the closest and most uncompromising of bonnets , made fast under the chin ; and in a shawl which tied her up -LRB- as I had been tied up , when my aunt first received me -RRB- like a bundle , and was secured behind at the waist , in a strong knot .
Parsing [sent. 17640 len. 21]: Miss Micawber I found made snug for stormy weather , in the same manner ; with nothing superfluous about her .
Parsing [sent. 17641 len. 35]: Master Micawber was hardly visible in a Guernsey shirt , and the shaggiest suit of slops I ever saw ; and the children were done up , like preserved meats , in impervious cases .
Parsing [sent. 17642 len. 47]: Both Mr. Micawber and his eldest son wore their sleeves loosely turned back at the wrists , as being ready to lend a hand in any direction , and to ` tumble up ' , or sing out , ` Yeo -- Heave -- Yeo ! '
Parsing [sent. 17643 len. 5]: on the shortest notice .
Parsing [sent. 17644 len. 37]: Thus Traddles and I found them at nightfall , assembled on the wooden steps , at that time known as Hungerford Stairs , watching the departure of a boat with some of their property on board .
Parsing [sent. 17645 len. 43]: I had told Traddles of the terrible event , and it had greatly shocked him ; but there could be no doubt of the kindness of keeping it a secret , and he had come to help me in this last service .
Parsing [sent. 17646 len. 15]: It was here that I took Mr. Micawber aside , and received his promise .
Parsing [sent. 17647 len. 33]: The Micawber family were lodged in a little , dirty , tumble-down public-house , which in those days was close to the stairs , and whose protruding wooden rooms overhung the river .
Parsing [sent. 17648 len. 32]: The family , as emigrants , being objects of some interest in and about Hungerford , attracted so many beholders , that we were glad to take refuge in their room .
Parsing [sent. 17649 len. 15]: It was one of the wooden chambers upstairs , with the tide flowing underneath .
Parsing [sent. 17650 len. 24]: My aunt and Agnes were there , busily making some little extra comforts , in the way of dress , for the children .
Parsing [sent. 17651 len. 27]: Peggotty was quietly assisting , with the old insensible work-box , yard-measure , and bit of wax-candle before her , that had now outlived so much .
Parsing [sent. 17652 len. 35]: It was not easy to answer her inquiries ; still less to whisper Mr. Peggotty , when Mr. Micawber brought him in , that I had given the letter , and all was well .
Parsing [sent. 17653 len. 10]: But I did both , and made them happy .
Parsing [sent. 17654 len. 20]: If I showed any trace of what I felt , my own sorrows were sufficient to account for it .
Parsing [sent. 17655 len. 12]: ` And when does the ship sail , Mr. Micawber ? '
Parsing [sent. 17656 len. 4]: asked my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17657 len. 27]: Mr. Micawber considered it necessary to prepare either my aunt or his wife , by degrees , and said , sooner than he had expected yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 17658 len. 11]: ` The boat brought you word , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 17659 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17660 len. 10]: ` It did , ma'am , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 17661 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 17662 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 17663 len. 30]: ` And she sails -- ' ` Madam , ' he replied , ' I am informed that we must positively be on board before seven tomorrow morning . '
Parsing [sent. 17664 len. 4]: ` Heyday ! '
Parsing [sent. 17665 len. 9]: said my aunt , ` that 's soon .
Parsing [sent. 17666 len. 11]: Is it a sea-going fact , Mr. Peggotty ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 17667 len. 5]: Tis so , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 17668 len. 11]: She 'll drop down the river with that theer tide .
Parsing [sent. 17669 len. 29]: If Mas ' r Davy and my sister comes aboard at Gravesen ' , arternoon o ' next day , they 'll see the last on us . '
Parsing [sent. 17670 len. 16]: ` And that we shall do , ' said I , ` be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 17671 len. 43]: ` Until then , and until we are at sea , ' observed Mr. Micawber , with a glance of intelligence at me , ` Mr. Peggotty and myself will constantly keep a double look-out together , on our goods and chattels .
Parsing [sent. 17672 len. 73]: Emma , my love , ' said Mr. Micawber , clearing his throat in his magnificent way , ` my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles is so obliging as to solicit , in my ear , that he should have the privilege of ordering the ingredients necessary to the composition of a moderate portion of that Beverage which is peculiarly associated , in our minds , with the Roast Beef of Old England .
Parsing [sent. 17673 len. 9]: I allude to -- in short , Punch .
Parsing [sent. 17674 len. 55]: Under ordinary circumstances , I should scruple to entreat the indulgence of Miss Trotwood and Miss Wickfield , but - ' ' I can only say for myself , ' said my aunt , ` that I will drink all happiness and success to you , Mr. Micawber , with the utmost pleasure . '
Parsing [sent. 17675 len. 6]: ` And I too ! '
Parsing [sent. 17676 len. 7]: said Agnes , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 17677 len. 27]: Mr. Micawber immediately descended to the bar , where he appeared to be quite at home ; and in due time returned with a steaming jug .
Parsing [sent. 17678 len. 51]: I could not but observe that he had been peeling the lemons with his own clasp-knife , which , as became the knife of a practical settler , was about a foot long ; and which he wiped , not wholly without ostentation , on the sleeve of his coat .
Parsing [sent. 17679 len. 38]: Mrs. Micawber and the two elder members of the family I now found to be provided with similar formidable instruments , while every child had its own wooden spoon attached to its body by a strong line .
Parsing [sent. 17680 len. 95]: In a similar anticipation of life afloat , and in the Bush , Mr. Micawber , instead of helping Mrs. Micawber and his eldest son and daughter to punch , in wine-glasses , which he might easily have done , for there was a shelf-full in the room , served it out to them in a series of villainous little tin pots ; and I never saw him enjoy anything so much as drinking out of his own particular pint pot , and putting it in his pocket at the close of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 17681 len. 25]: ` The luxuries of the old country , ' said Mr. Micawber , with an intense satisfaction in their renouncement , ` we abandon .
Parsing [sent. 17682 len. 25]: The denizens of the forest can not , of course , expect to participate in the refinements of the land of the Free . '
Parsing [sent. 17683 len. 16]: Here , a boy came in to say that Mr. Micawber was wanted downstairs . '
Parsing [sent. 17684 len. 27]: I have a presentiment , ' said Mrs. Micawber , setting down her tin pot , ` that it is a member of my family ! '
Parsing [sent. 17685 len. 60]: ` If so , my dear , ' observed Mr. Micawber , with his usual suddenness of warmth on that subject , ` as the member of your family -- whoever he , she , or it , may be -- has kept us waiting for a considerable period , perhaps the Member may now wait My convenience . '
Parsing [sent. 17686 len. 49]: ` Micawber , ' said his wife , in a low tone , ` at such a time as this -- ' ' `` It is not meet , '' ' said Mr. Micawber , rising , ' `` that every nice offence should bear its comment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17687 len. 7]: Emma , I stand reproved . '
Parsing [sent. 17688 len. 21]: ` The loss , Micawber , ' observed his wife , ` has been my family 's , not yours .
Parsing [sent. 17689 len. 41]: If my family are at length sensible of the deprivation to which their own conduct has , in the past , exposed them , and now desire to extend the hand of fellowship , let it not be repulsed . '
Parsing [sent. 17690 len. 14]: ` My dear , ' he returned , ` so be it ! '
Parsing [sent. 17691 len. 17]: ` If not for their sakes ; for mine , Micawber , ' said his wife .
Parsing [sent. 17692 len. 22]: 'Em ma , ' he returned , ` that view of the question is , at such a moment , irresistible .
Parsing [sent. 17693 len. 41]: I can not , even now , distinctly pledge myself to fall upon your family 's neck ; but the member of your family , who is now in attendance , shall have no genial warmth frozen by me . '
Parsing [sent. 17694 len. 36]: Mr. Micawber withdrew , and was absent some little time ; in the course of which Mrs. Micawber was not wholly free from an apprehension that words might have arisen between him and the Member .
Parsing [sent. 17695 len. 31]: At length the same boy reappeared , and presented me with a note written in pencil , and headed , in a legal manner , ` Heep v. Micawber ' .
Parsing [sent. 17696 len. 55]: From this document , I learned that Mr. Micawber being again arrested , ` Was in a final paroxysm of despair ; and that he begged me to send him his knife and pint pot , by bearer , as they might prove serviceable during the brief remainder of his existence , in jail .
Parsing [sent. 17697 len. 31]: He also requested , as a last act of friendship , that I would see his family to the Parish Workhouse , and forget that such a Being ever lived .
Parsing [sent. 17698 len. 40]: Of course I answered this note by going down with the boy to pay the money , where I found Mr. Micawber sitting in a corner , looking darkly at the Sheriff 's Officer who had effected the capture .
Parsing [sent. 17699 len. 43]: On his release , he embraced me with the utmost fervour ; and made an entry of the transaction in his pocket-book -- being very particular , I recollect , about a halfpenny I inadvertently omitted from my statement of the total .
Parsing [sent. 17700 len. 13]: This momentous pocket-book was a timely reminder to him of another transaction .
Parsing [sent. 17701 len. 55]: On our return to the room upstairs -LRB- where he accounted for his absence by saying that it had been occasioned by circumstances over which he had no control -RRB- , he took out of it a large sheet of paper , folded small , and quite covered with long sums , carefully worked .
Parsing [sent. 17702 len. 23]: From the glimpse I had of them , I should say that I never saw such sums out of a school ciphering-book .
Parsing [sent. 17703 len. 33]: These , it seemed , were calculations of compound interest on what he called ` the principal amount of forty-one , ten , eleven and a half ' , for various periods .
Parsing [sent. 17704 len. 48]: After a careful consideration of these , and an elaborate estimate of his resources , he had come to the conclusion to select that sum which represented the amount with compound interest to two years , fifteen calendar months , and fourteen days , from that date .
Parsing [sent. 17705 len. 41]: For this he had drawn a note-of-hand with great neatness , which he handed over to Traddles on the spot , a discharge of his debt in full -LRB- as between man and man -RRB- , with many acknowledgements . '
Parsing [sent. 17706 len. 31]: I have still a presentiment , ' said Mrs. Micawber , pensively shaking her head , ` that my family will appear on board , before we finally depart . '
Parsing [sent. 17707 len. 23]: Mr. Micawber evidently had his presentiment on the subject too , but he put it in his tin pot and swallowed it .
Parsing [sent. 17708 len. 36]: ` If you have any opportunity of sending letters home , on your passage , Mrs. Micawber , ' said my aunt , ` you must let us hear from you , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 17709 len. 27]: ` My dear Miss Trotwood , ' she replied , ' I shall only be too happy to think that anyone expects to hear from us .
Parsing [sent. 17710 len. 7]: I shall not fail to correspond .
Parsing [sent. 17711 len. 36]: Mr. Copperfield , I trust , as an old and familiar friend , will not object to receive occasional intelligence , himself , from one who knew him when the twins were yet unconscious ? '
Parsing [sent. 17712 len. 17]: I said that I should hope to hear , whenever she had an opportunity of writing .
Parsing [sent. 17713 len. 16]: ` Please Heaven , there will be many such opportunities , ' said Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 17714 len. 28]: ` The ocean , in these times , is a perfect fleet of ships ; and we can hardly fail to encounter many , in running over .
Parsing [sent. 17715 len. 19]: It is merely crossing , ' said Mr. Micawber , trifling with his eye-glass , ` merely crossing .
Parsing [sent. 17716 len. 7]: The distance is quite imaginary . '
Parsing [sent. 17717 len. 67]: I think , now , how odd it was , but how wonderfully like Mr. Micawber , that , when he went from London to Canterbury , he should have talked as if he were going to the farthest limits of the earth ; and , when he went from England to Australia , as if he were going for a little trip across the channel .
Parsing [sent. 17718 len. 40]: ` On the voyage , I shall endeavour , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` occasionally to spin them a yarn ; and the melody of my son Wilkins will , I trust , be acceptable at the galley-fire .
Parsing [sent. 17719 len. 34]: When Mrs. Micawber has her sea-legs on -- an expression in which I hope there is no conventional impropriety -- she will give them , I dare say , `` Little Tafflin '' .
Parsing [sent. 17720 len. 34]: Porpoises and dolphins , I believe , will be frequently observed athwart our Bows ; and , either on the starboard or the larboard quarter , objects of interest will be continually descried .
Parsing [sent. 17721 len. 43]: In short , ' said Mr. Micawber , with the old genteel air , ` the probability is , all will be found so exciting , alow and aloft , that when the lookout , stationed in the main-top , cries Land-oh !
Parsing [sent. 17722 len. 8]: we shall be very considerably astonished ! '
Parsing [sent. 17723 len. 34]: With that he flourished off the contents of his little tin pot , as if he had made the voyage , and had passed a first-class examination before the highest naval authorities . '
Parsing [sent. 17724 len. 34]: What I chiefly hope , my dear Mr. Copperfield , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` is , that in some branches of our family we may live again in the old country .
Parsing [sent. 17725 len. 6]: Do not frown , Micawber !
Parsing [sent. 17726 len. 17]: I do not now refer to my own family , but to our children 's children .
Parsing [sent. 17727 len. 48]: However vigorous the sapling , ' said Mrs. Micawber , shaking her head , ' I can not forget the parent-tree ; and when our race attains to eminence and fortune , I own I should wish that fortune to flow into the coffers of Britannia . '
Parsing [sent. 17728 len. 16]: ` My dear , ' said Mr. Micawber , ` Britannia must take her chance .
Parsing [sent. 17729 len. 26]: I am bound to say that she has never done much for me , and that I have no particular wish upon the subject . '
Parsing [sent. 17730 len. 15]: ` Micawber , ' returned Mrs. Micawber , ` there , you are wrong .
Parsing [sent. 17731 len. 27]: You are going out , Micawber , to this distant clime , to strengthen , not to weaken , the connexion between yourself and Albion . '
Parsing [sent. 17732 len. 45]: ` The connexion in question , my love , ' rejoined Mr. Micawber , ` has not laid me , I repeat , under that load of personal obligation , that I am at all sensitive as to the formation of another connexion . '
Parsing [sent. 17733 len. 8]: ` Micawber , ' returned Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 17734 len. 11]: ` There , I again say , you are wrong .
Parsing [sent. 17735 len. 9]: You do not know your power , Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 17736 len. 25]: It is that which will strengthen , even in this step you are about to take , the connexion between yourself and Albion . '
Parsing [sent. 17737 len. 33]: Mr. Micawber sat in his elbow-chair , with his eyebrows raised ; half receiving and half repudiating Mrs. Micawber 's views as they were stated , but very sensible of their foresight .
Parsing [sent. 17738 len. 21]: ` My dear Mr. Copperfield , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ' I wish Mr. Micawber to feel his position .
Parsing [sent. 17739 len. 22]: It appears to me highly important that Mr. Micawber should , from the hour of his embarkation , feel his position .
Parsing [sent. 17740 len. 26]: Your old knowledge of me , my dear Mr. Copperfield , will have told you that I have not the sanguine disposition of Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 17741 len. 13]: My disposition is , if I may say so , eminently practical .
Parsing [sent. 17742 len. 9]: I know that this is a long voyage .
Parsing [sent. 17743 len. 11]: I know that it will involve many privations and inconveniences .
Parsing [sent. 17744 len. 10]: I can not shut my eyes to those facts .
Parsing [sent. 17745 len. 9]: But I also know what Mr. Micawber is .
Parsing [sent. 17746 len. 9]: I know the latent power of Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 17747 len. 16]: And therefore I consider it vitally important that Mr. Micawber should feel his position . '
Parsing [sent. 17748 len. 34]: ` My love , ' he observed , ` perhaps you will allow me to remark that it is barely possible that I DO feel my position at the present moment . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17749 len. 10]: I think not , Micawber , ' she rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 17750 len. 4]: ` Not fully .
Parsing [sent. 17751 len. 14]: My dear Mr. Copperfield , Mr. Micawber 's is not a common case .
Parsing [sent. 17752 len. 24]: Mr. Micawber is going to a distant country expressly in order that he may be fully understood and appreciated for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 17753 len. 27]: I wish Mr. Micawber to take his stand upon that vessel 's prow , and firmly say , `` This country I am come to conquer !
Parsing [sent. 17754 len. 4]: Have you honours ?
Parsing [sent. 17755 len. 4]: Have you riches ?
Parsing [sent. 17756 len. 8]: Have you posts of profitable pecuniary emolument ?
Parsing [sent. 17757 len. 6]: Let them be brought forward .
Parsing [sent. 17758 len. 6]: They are mine ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 17759 len. 21]: Mr. Micawber , glancing at us all , seemed to think there was a good deal in this idea . '
Parsing [sent. 17760 len. 31]: I wish Mr. Micawber , if I make myself understood , ' said Mrs. Micawber , in her argumentative tone , ` to be the Caesar of his own fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 17761 len. 16]: That , my dear Mr. Copperfield , appears to me to be his true position .
Parsing [sent. 17762 len. 36]: From the first moment of this voyage , I wish Mr. Micawber to stand upon that vessel 's prow and say , `` Enough of delay : enough of disappointment : enough of limited means .
Parsing [sent. 17763 len. 7]: That was in the old country .
Parsing [sent. 17764 len. 5]: This is the new .
Parsing [sent. 17765 len. 4]: Produce your reparation .
Parsing [sent. 17766 len. 6]: Bring it forward ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 17767 len. 20]: Mr. Micawber folded his arms in a resolute manner , as if he were then stationed on the figure-head .
Parsing [sent. 17768 len. 37]: ` And doing that , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ' - feeling his position -- am I not right in saying that Mr. Micawber will strengthen , and not weaken , his connexion with Britain ?
Parsing [sent. 17769 len. 23]: An important public character arising in that hemisphere , shall I be told that its influence will not be felt at home ?
Parsing [sent. 17770 len. 29]: Can I be so weak as to imagine that Mr. Micawber , wielding the rod of talent and of power in Australia , will be nothing in England ?
Parsing [sent. 17771 len. 28]: I am but a woman ; but I should be unworthy of myself and of my papa , if I were guilty of such absurd weakness . '
Parsing [sent. 17772 len. 28]: Mrs. Micawber 's conviction that her arguments were unanswerable , gave a moral elevation to her tone which I think I had never heard in it before .
Parsing [sent. 17773 len. 34]: ` And therefore it is , ' said Mrs. Micawber , ` that I the more wish , that , at a future period , we may live again on the parent soil .
Parsing [sent. 17774 len. 49]: Mr. Micawber may be -- I can not disguise from myself that the probability is , Mr. Micawber will be -- a page of History ; and he ought then to be represented in the country which gave him birth , and did NOT give him employment ! '
Parsing [sent. 17775 len. 23]: ` My love , ' observed Mr. Micawber , ` it is impossible for me not to be touched by your affection .
Parsing [sent. 17776 len. 11]: I am always willing to defer to your good sense .
Parsing [sent. 17777 len. 7]: What will be -- will be .
Parsing [sent. 17778 len. 23]: Heaven forbid that I should grudge my native country any portion of the wealth that may be accumulated by our descendants ! '
Parsing [sent. 17779 len. 34]: ` That 's well , ' said my aunt , nodding towards Mr. Peggotty , ` and I drink my love to you all , and every blessing and success attend you ! '
Parsing [sent. 17780 len. 76]: Mr. Peggotty put down the two children he had been nursing , one on each knee , to join Mr. and Mrs. Micawber in drinking to all of us in return ; and when he and the Micawbers cordially shook hands as comrades , and his brown face brightened with a smile , I felt that he would make his way , establish a good name , and be beloved , go where he would .
Parsing [sent. 17781 len. 25]: Even the children were instructed , each to dip a wooden spoon into Mr. Micawber 's pot , and pledge us in its contents .
Parsing [sent. 17782 len. 17]: When this was done , my aunt and Agnes rose , and parted from the emigrants .
Parsing [sent. 17783 len. 6]: It was a sorrowful farewell .
Parsing [sent. 17784 len. 51]: They were all crying ; the children hung about Agnes to the last ; and we left poor Mrs. Micawber in a very distressed condition , sobbing and weeping by a dim candle , that must have made the room look , from the river , like a miserable light-house .
Parsing [sent. 17785 len. 13]: I went down again next morning to see that they were away .
Parsing [sent. 17786 len. 14]: They had departed , in a boat , as early as five o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 17787 len. 46]: It was a wonderful instance to me of the gap such partings make , that although my association of them with the tumble-down public-house and the wooden stairs dated only from last night , both seemed dreary and deserted , now that they were gone .
Parsing [sent. 17788 len. 18]: In the afternoon of the next day , my old nurse and I went down to Gravesend .
Parsing [sent. 17789 len. 28]: We found the ship in the river , surrounded by a crowd of boats ; a favourable wind blowing ; the signal for sailing at her mast-head .
Parsing [sent. 17790 len. 32]: I hired a boat directly , and we put off to her ; and getting through the little vortex of confusion of which she was the centre , went on board .
Parsing [sent. 17791 len. 9]: Mr. Peggotty was waiting for us on deck .
Parsing [sent. 17792 len. 50]: He told me that Mr. Micawber had just now been arrested again -LRB- and for the last time -RRB- at the suit of Heep , and that , in compliance with a request I had made to him , he had paid the money , which I repaid him .
Parsing [sent. 17793 len. 69]: He then took us down between decks ; and there , any lingering fears I had of his having heard any rumours of what had happened , were dispelled by Mr. Micawber 's coming out of the gloom , taking his arm with an air of friendship and protection , and telling me that they had scarcely been asunder for a moment , since the night before last .
Parsing [sent. 17794 len. 56]: It was such a strange scene to me , and so confined and dark , that , at first , I could make out hardly anything ; but , by degrees , it cleared , as my eyes became more accustomed to the gloom , and I seemed to stand in a picture by OSTADE .
Parsing [sent. 17795 len. 128]: Among the great beams , bulks , and ringbolts of the ship , and the emigrant-berths , and chests , and bundles , and barrels , and heaps of miscellaneous baggage -- ` lighted up , here and there , by dangling lanterns ; and elsewhere by the yellow daylight straying down a windsail or a hatchway -- were crowded groups of people , making new friendships , taking leave of one another , talking , laughing , crying , eating and drinking ; some , already settled down into the possession of their few feet of space , with their little households arranged , and tiny children established on stools , or in dwarf elbow-chairs ; others , despairing of a resting-place , and wandering disconsolately .
Parsing [sent. 17796 len. 79]: From babies who had but a week or two of life behind them , to crooked old men and women who seemed to have but a week or two of life before them ; and from ploughmen bodily carrying out soil of England on their boots , to smiths taking away samples of its soot and smoke upon their skins ; every age and occupation appeared to be crammed into the narrow compass of the ` tween decks .
Parsing [sent. 17797 len. 66]: As my eye glanced round this place , I thought I saw sitting , by an open port , with one of the Micawber children near her , a figure like Emily 's ; it first attracted my attention , by another figure parting from it with a kiss ; and as it glided calmly away through the disorder , reminding me of -- Agnes !
Parsing [sent. 17798 len. 74]: But in the rapid motion and confusion , and in the unsettlement of my own thoughts , I lost it again ; and only knew that the time was come when all visitors were being warned to leave the ship ; that my nurse was crying on a chest beside me ; and that Mrs. Gummidge , assisted by some younger stooping woman in black , was busily arranging Mr. Peggotty 's goods .
Parsing [sent. 17799 len. 13]: ` Is there any last wured , Mas ' r Davy ? '
Parsing [sent. 17800 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 17801 len. 12]: ` Is there any one forgotten thing afore we parts ? '
Parsing [sent. 17802 len. 5]: ` One thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 17803 len. 6]: said I. ` Martha ! '
Parsing [sent. 17804 len. 18]: He touched the younger woman I have mentioned on the shoulder , and Martha stood before me .
Parsing [sent. 17805 len. 10]: ` Heaven bless you , you good man ! '
Parsing [sent. 17806 len. 10]: cried I. ` You take her with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 17807 len. 11]: She answered for him , with a burst of tears .
Parsing [sent. 17808 len. 36]: I could speak no more at that time , but I wrung his hand ; and if ever I have loved and honoured any man , I loved and honoured that man in my soul .
Parsing [sent. 17809 len. 8]: The ship was clearing fast of strangers .
Parsing [sent. 17810 len. 9]: The greatest trial that I had , remained .
Parsing [sent. 17811 len. 21]: I told him what the noble spirit that was gone , had given me in charge to say at parting .
Parsing [sent. 17812 len. 5]: It moved him deeply .
Parsing [sent. 17813 len. 26]: But when he charged me , in return , with many messages of affection and regret for those deaf ears , he moved me more .
Parsing [sent. 17814 len. 5]: The time was come .
Parsing [sent. 17815 len. 16]: I embraced him , took my weeping nurse upon my arm , and hurried away .
Parsing [sent. 17816 len. 11]: On deck , I took leave of poor Mrs. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 17817 len. 28]: She was looking distractedly about for her family , even then ; and her last words to me were , that she never would desert Mr. Micawber .
Parsing [sent. 17818 len. 25]: We went over the side into our boat , and lay at a little distance , to see the ship wafted on her course .
Parsing [sent. 17819 len. 8]: It was then calm , radiant sunset .
Parsing [sent. 17820 len. 22]: She lay between us , and the red light ; and every taper line and spar was visible against the glow .
Parsing [sent. 17821 len. 56]: A sight at once so beautiful , so mournful , and so hopeful , as the glorious ship , lying , still , on the flushed water , with all the life on board her crowded at the bulwarks , and there clustering , for a moment , bare-headed and silent , I never saw .
Parsing [sent. 17822 len. 7]: Silent , only for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 17823 len. 43]: As the sails rose to the wind , and the ship began to move , there broke from all the boats three resounding cheers , which those on board took up , and echoed back , and which were echoed and re-echoed .
Parsing [sent. 17824 len. 26]: My heart burst out when I heard the sound , and beheld the waving of the hats and handkerchiefs -- and then I saw her !
Parsing [sent. 17825 len. 17]: Then I saw her , at her uncle 's side , and trembling on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 17826 len. 22]: He pointed to us with an eager hand ; and she saw us , and waved her last good-bye to me .
Parsing [sent. 17827 len. 36]: Aye , Emily , beautiful and drooping , cling to him with the utmost trust of thy bruised heart ; for he has clung to thee , with all the might of his great love !
Parsing [sent. 17828 len. 31]: Surrounded by the rosy light , and standing high upon the deck , apart together , she clinging to him , and he holding her , they solemnly passed away .
Parsing [sent. 17829 len. 20]: The night had fallen on the Kentish hills when we were rowed ashore -- and fallen darkly upon me .
Parsing [sent. 17830 len. 37]: Chapter 58 Absence It was a long and gloomy night that gathered on me , haunted by the ghosts of many hopes , of many dear remembrances , many errors , many unavailing sorrows and regrets .
Parsing [sent. 17831 len. 24]: I went away from England ; not knowing , even then , how great the shock was , that I had to bear .
Parsing [sent. 17832 len. 26]: I left all who were dear to me , and went away ; and believed that I had borne it , and it was past .
Parsing [sent. 17833 len. 48]: As a man upon a field of battle will receive a mortal hurt , and scarcely know that he is struck , so I , when I was left alone with my undisciplined heart , had no conception of the wound with which it had to strive .
Parsing [sent. 17834 len. 19]: The knowledge came upon me , not quickly , but little by little , and grain by grain .
Parsing [sent. 17835 len. 14]: The desolate feeling with which I went abroad , deepened and widened hourly .
Parsing [sent. 17836 len. 19]: At first it was a heavy sense of loss and sorrow , wherein I could distinguish little else .
Parsing [sent. 17837 len. 68]: By imperceptible degrees , it became a hopeless consciousness of all that I had lost -- love , friendship , interest ; of all that had been shattered -- my first trust , my first affection , the whole airy castle of my life ; of all that remained -- a ruined blank and waste , lying wide around me , unbroken , to the dark horizon .
Parsing [sent. 17838 len. 15]: If my grief were selfish , I did not know it to be so .
Parsing [sent. 17839 len. 15]: I mourned for my child-wife , taken from her blooming world , so young .
Parsing [sent. 17840 len. 23]: I mourned for him who might have won the love and admiration of thousands , as he had won mine long ago .
Parsing [sent. 17841 len. 39]: I mourned for the broken heart that had found rest in the stormy sea ; and for the wandering remnants of the simple home , where I had heard the night-wind blowing , when I was a child .
Parsing [sent. 17842 len. 20]: From the accumulated sadness into which I fell , I had at length no hope of ever issuing again .
Parsing [sent. 17843 len. 14]: I roamed from place to place , carrying my burden with me everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 17844 len. 26]: I felt its whole weight now ; and I drooped beneath it , and I said in my heart that it could never be lightened .
Parsing [sent. 17845 len. 15]: When this despondency was at its worst , I believed that I should die .
Parsing [sent. 17846 len. 28]: Sometimes , I thought that I would like to die at home ; and actually turned back on my road , that I might get there soon .
Parsing [sent. 17847 len. 32]: At other times , I passed on farther away , -- from city to city , seeking I know not what , and trying to leave I know not what behind .
Parsing [sent. 17848 len. 26]: It is not in my power to retrace , one by one , all the weary phases of distress of mind through which I passed .
Parsing [sent. 17849 len. 37]: There are some dreams that can only be imperfectly and vaguely described ; and when I oblige myself to look back on this time of my life , I seem to be recalling such a dream .
Parsing [sent. 17850 len. 60]: I see myself passing on among the novelties of foreign towns , palaces , cathedrals , temples , pictures , castles , tombs , fantastic streets -- the old abiding places of History and Fancy -- as a dreamer might ; bearing my painful load through all , and hardly conscious of the objects as they fade before me .
Parsing [sent. 17851 len. 18]: Listlessness to everything , but brooding sorrow , was the night that fell on my undisciplined heart .
Parsing [sent. 17852 len. 16]: Let me look up from it -- as at last I did , thank Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 17853 len. 14]: -- and from its long , sad , wretched dream , to dawn .
Parsing [sent. 17854 len. 13]: For many months I travelled with this ever-darkening cloud upon my mind .
Parsing [sent. 17855 len. 30]: Some blind reasons that I had for not returning home -- reasons then struggling within me , vainly , for more distinct expression -- kept me on my pilgrimage .
Parsing [sent. 17856 len. 24]: Sometimes , I had proceeded restlessly from place to place , stopping nowhere ; sometimes , I had lingered long in one spot .
Parsing [sent. 17857 len. 14]: I had had no purpose , no sustaining soul within me , anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 17858 len. 5]: I was in Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 17859 len. 31]: I had come out of Italy , over one of the great passes of the Alps , and had since wandered with a guide among the by-ways of the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 17860 len. 16]: If those awful solitudes had spoken to my heart , I did not know it .
Parsing [sent. 17861 len. 37]: I had found sublimity and wonder in the dread heights and precipices , in the roaring torrents , and the wastes of ice and snow ; but as yet , they had taught me nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 17862 len. 19]: I came , one evening before sunset , down into a valley , where I was to rest .
Parsing [sent. 17863 len. 50]: In the course of my descent to it , by the winding track along the mountain-side , from which I saw it shining far below , I think some long-unwonted sense of beauty and tranquillity , some softening influence awakened by its peace , moved faintly in my breast .
Parsing [sent. 17864 len. 20]: I remember pausing once , with a kind of sorrow that was not all oppressive , not quite despairing .
Parsing [sent. 17865 len. 13]: I remember almost hoping that some better change was possible within me .
Parsing [sent. 17866 len. 28]: I came into the valley , as the evening sun was shining on the remote heights of snow , that closed it in , like eternal clouds .
Parsing [sent. 17867 len. 44]: The bases of the mountains forming the gorge in which the little village lay , were richly green ; and high above this gentler vegetation , grew forests of dark fir , cleaving the wintry snow-drift , wedge-like , and stemming the avalanche .
Parsing [sent. 17868 len. 31]: Above these , were range upon range of craggy steeps , grey rock , bright ice , and smooth verdure-specks of pasture , all gradually blending with the crowning snow .
Parsing [sent. 17869 len. 36]: Dotted here and there on the mountain 's - side , each tiny dot a home , were lonely wooden cottages , so dwarfed by the towering heights that they appeared too small for toys .
Parsing [sent. 17870 len. 33]: So did even the clustered village in the valley , with its wooden bridge across the stream , where the stream tumbled over broken rocks , and roared away among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 17871 len. 48]: In the quiet air , there was a sound of distant singing -- shepherd voices ; but , as one bright evening cloud floated midway along the mountain 's - side , I could almost have believed it came from there , and was not earthly music .
Parsing [sent. 17872 len. 40]: All at once , in this serenity , great Nature spoke to me ; and soothed me to lay down my weary head upon the grass , and weep as I had not wept yet , since Dora died !
Parsing [sent. 17873 len. 32]: I had found a packet of letters awaiting me but a few minutes before , and had strolled out of the village to read them while my supper was making ready .
Parsing [sent. 17874 len. 16]: Other packets had missed me , and I had received none for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 17875 len. 37]: Beyond a line or two , to say that I was well , and had arrived at such a place , I had not had fortitude or constancy to write a letter since I left home .
Parsing [sent. 17876 len. 7]: The packet was in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 17877 len. 11]: I opened it , and read the writing of Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 17878 len. 13]: She was happy and useful , was prospering as she had hoped .
Parsing [sent. 17879 len. 9]: That was all she told me of herself .
Parsing [sent. 17880 len. 6]: The rest referred to me .
Parsing [sent. 17881 len. 31]: She gave me no advice ; she urged no duty on me ; she only told me , in her own fervent manner , what her trust in me was .
Parsing [sent. 17882 len. 18]: She knew -LRB- she said -RRB- how such a nature as mine would turn affliction to good .
Parsing [sent. 17883 len. 12]: She knew how trial and emotion would exalt and strengthen it .
Parsing [sent. 17884 len. 25]: She was sure that in my every purpose I should gain a firmer and a higher tendency , through the grief I had undergone .
Parsing [sent. 17885 len. 25]: She , who so gloried in my fame , and so looked forward to its augmentation , well knew that I would labour on .
Parsing [sent. 17886 len. 17]: She knew that in me , sorrow could not be weakness , but must be strength .
Parsing [sent. 17887 len. 48]: As the endurance of my childish days had done its part to make me what I was , so greater calamities would nerve me on , to be yet better than I was ; and so , as they had taught me , would I teach others .
Parsing [sent. 17888 len. 55]: She commended me to God , who had taken my innocent darling to His rest ; and in her sisterly affection cherished me always , and was always at my side go where I would ; proud of what I had done , but infinitely prouder yet of what I was reserved to do .
Parsing [sent. 17889 len. 18]: I put the letter in my breast , and thought what had I been an hour ago !
Parsing [sent. 17890 len. 82]: When I heard the voices die away , and saw the quiet evening cloud grow dim , and all the colours in the valley fade , and the golden snow upon the mountain-tops become a remote part of the pale night sky , yet felt that the night was passing from my mind , and all its shadows clearing , there was no name for the love I bore her , dearer to me , henceforward , than ever until then .
Parsing [sent. 17891 len. 7]: I read her letter many times .
Parsing [sent. 17892 len. 8]: I wrote to her before I slept .
Parsing [sent. 17893 len. 46]: I told her that I had been in sore need of her help ; that without her I was not , and I never had been , what she thought me ; but that she inspired me to be that , and I would try .
Parsing [sent. 17894 len. 4]: I did try .
Parsing [sent. 17895 len. 17]: In three months more , a year would have passed since the beginning of my sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 17896 len. 18]: I determined to make no resolutions until the expiration of those three months , but to try .
Parsing [sent. 17897 len. 14]: I lived in that valley , and its neighbourhood , all the time .
Parsing [sent. 17898 len. 47]: The three months gone , I resolved to remain away from home for some time longer ; to settle myself for the present in Switzerland , which was growing dear to me in the remembrance of that evening ; to resume my pen ; to work .
Parsing [sent. 17899 len. 34]: I resorted humbly whither Agnes had commended me ; I sought out Nature , never sought in vain ; and I admitted to my breast the human interest I had lately shrunk from .
Parsing [sent. 17900 len. 60]: It was not long , before I had almost as many friends in the valley as in Yarmouth : and when I left it , before the winter set in , for Geneva , and came back in the spring , their cordial greetings had a homely sound to me , although they were not conveyed in English words .
Parsing [sent. 17901 len. 10]: I worked early and late , patiently and hard .
Parsing [sent. 17902 len. 54]: I wrote a Story , with a purpose growing , not remotely , out of my experience , and sent it to Traddles , and he arranged for its publication very advantageously for me ; and the tidings of my growing reputation began to reach me from travellers whom I encountered by chance .
Parsing [sent. 17903 len. 29]: After some rest and change , I fell to work , in my old ardent way , on a new fancy , which took strong possession of me .
Parsing [sent. 17904 len. 27]: As I advanced in the execution of this task , I felt it more and more , and roused my utmost energies to do it well .
Parsing [sent. 17905 len. 8]: This was my third work of fiction .
Parsing [sent. 17906 len. 20]: It was not half written , when , in an interval of rest , I thought of returning home .
Parsing [sent. 17907 len. 19]: For a long time , though studying and working patiently , I had accustomed myself to robust exercise .
Parsing [sent. 17908 len. 14]: My health , severely impaired when I left England , was quite restored .
Parsing [sent. 17909 len. 5]: I had seen much .
Parsing [sent. 17910 len. 18]: I had been in many countries , and I hope I had improved my store of knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 17911 len. 24]: I have now recalled all that I think it needful to recall here , of this term of absence -- with one reservation .
Parsing [sent. 17912 len. 33]: I have made it , thus far , with no purpose of suppressing any of my thoughts ; for , as I have elsewhere said , this narrative is my written memory .
Parsing [sent. 17913 len. 19]: I have desired to keep the most secret current of my mind apart , and to the last .
Parsing [sent. 17914 len. 6]: I enter on it now .
Parsing [sent. 17915 len. 34]: I can not so completely penetrate the mystery of my own heart , as to know when I began to think that I might have set its earliest and brightest hopes on Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 17916 len. 35]: I can not say at what stage of my grief it first became associated with the reflection , that , in my wayward boyhood , I had thrown away the treasure of her love .
Parsing [sent. 17917 len. 34]: I believe I may have heard some whisper of that distant thought , in the old unhappy loss or want of something never to be realized , of which I had been sensible .
Parsing [sent. 17918 len. 27]: But the thought came into my mind as a new reproach and new regret , when I was left so sad and lonely in the world .
Parsing [sent. 17919 len. 27]: If , at that time , I had been much with her , I should , in the weakness of my desolation , have betrayed this .
Parsing [sent. 17920 len. 17]: It was what I remotely dreaded when I was first impelled to stay away from England .
Parsing [sent. 17921 len. 32]: I could not have borne to lose the smallest portion of her sisterly affection ; yet , in that betrayal , I should have set a constraint between us hitherto unknown .
Parsing [sent. 17922 len. 24]: I could not forget that the feeling with which she now regarded me had grown up in my own free choice and course .
Parsing [sent. 17923 len. 31]: That if she had ever loved me with another love -- and I sometimes thought the time was when she might have done so -- I had cast it away .
Parsing [sent. 17924 len. 34]: It was nothing , now , that I had accustomed myself to think of her , when we were both mere children , as one who was far removed from my wild fancies .
Parsing [sent. 17925 len. 39]: I had bestowed my passionate tenderness upon another object ; and what I might have done , I had not done ; and what Agnes was to me , I and her own noble heart had made her .
Parsing [sent. 17926 len. 61]: In the beginning of the change that gradually worked in me , when I tried to get a better understanding of myself and be a better man , I did glance , through some indefinite probation , to a period when I might possibly hope to cancel the mistaken past , and to be so blessed as to marry her .
Parsing [sent. 17927 len. 17]: But , as time wore on , this shadowy prospect faded , and departed from me .
Parsing [sent. 17928 len. 53]: If she had ever loved me , then , I should hold her the more sacred ; remembering the confidences I had reposed in her , her knowledge of my errant heart , the sacrifice she must have made to be my friend and sister , and the victory she had won .
Parsing [sent. 17929 len. 17]: If she had never loved me , could I believe that she would love me now ?
Parsing [sent. 17930 len. 24]: I had always felt my weakness , in comparison with her constancy and fortitude ; and now I felt it more and more .
Parsing [sent. 17931 len. 34]: Whatever I might have been to her , or she to me , if I had been more worthy of her long ago , I was not now , and she was not .
Parsing [sent. 17932 len. 5]: The time was past .
Parsing [sent. 17933 len. 13]: I had let it go by , and had deservedly lost her .
Parsing [sent. 17934 len. 93]: That I suffered much in these contentions , that they filled me with unhappiness and remorse , and yet that I had a sustaining sense that it was required of me , in right and honour , to keep away from myself , with shame , the thought of turning to the dear girl in the withering of my hopes , from whom I had frivolously turned when they were bright and fresh -- which consideration was at the root of every thought I had concerning her -- is all equally true .
Parsing [sent. 17935 len. 48]: I made no effort to conceal from myself , now , that I loved her , that I was devoted to her ; but I brought the assurance home to myself , that it was now too late , and that our long-subsisting relation must be undisturbed .
Parsing [sent. 17936 len. 60]: I had thought , much and often , of my Dora 's shadowing out to me what might have happened , in those years that were destined not to try us ; I had considered how the things that never happen , are often as much realities to us , in their effects , as those that are accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 17937 len. 37]: The very years she spoke of , were realities now , for my correction ; and would have been , one day , a little later perhaps , though we had parted in our earliest folly .
Parsing [sent. 17938 len. 36]: I endeavoured to convert what might have been between myself and Agnes , into a means of making me more self-denying , more resolved , more conscious of myself , and my defects and errors .
Parsing [sent. 17939 len. 22]: Thus , through the reflection that it might have been , I arrived at the conviction that it could never be .
Parsing [sent. 17940 len. 34]: These , with their perplexities and inconsistencies , were the shifting quicksands of my mind , from the time of my departure to the time of my return home , three years afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 17941 len. 57]: Three years had elapsed since the sailing of the emigrant ship ; when , at that same hour of sunset , and in the same place , I stood on the deck of the packet vessel that brought me home , looking on the rosy water where I had seen the image of that ship reflected .
Parsing [sent. 17942 len. 3]: Three years .
Parsing [sent. 17943 len. 12]: Long in the aggregate , though short as they went by .
Parsing [sent. 17944 len. 25]: And home was very dear to me , and Agnes too -- but she was not mine - she was never to be mine .
Parsing [sent. 17945 len. 10]: She might have been , but that was past !
Parsing [sent. 17946 len. 13]: Chapter 59 Return I landed in London on a wintry autumn evening .
Parsing [sent. 17947 len. 24]: It was dark and raining , and I saw more fog and mud in a minute than I had seen in a year .
Parsing [sent. 17948 len. 46]: I walked from the Custom House to the Monument before I found a coach ; and although the very house-fronts , looking on the swollen gutters , were like old friends to me , I could not but admit that they were very dingy friends .
Parsing [sent. 17949 len. 31]: I have often remarked -- I suppose everybody has -- that one 's going away from a familiar place , would seem to be the signal for change in it .
Parsing [sent. 17950 len. 73]: As I looked out of the coach window , and observed that an old house on Fish-street Hill , which had stood untouched by painter , carpenter , or bricklayer , for a century , had been pulled down in my absence ; and that a neighbouring street , of time-honoured insalubrity and inconvenience , was being drained and widened ; I half expected to find St. Paul 's Cathedral looking older .
Parsing [sent. 17951 len. 14]: For some changes in the fortunes of my friends , I was prepared .
Parsing [sent. 17952 len. 32]: My aunt had long been re-established at Dover , and Traddles had begun to get into some little practice at the Bar , in the very first term after my departure .
Parsing [sent. 17953 len. 38]: He had chambers in Gray 's Inn , now ; and had told me , in his last letters , that he was not without hopes of being soon united to the dearest girl in the world .
Parsing [sent. 17954 len. 17]: They expected me home before Christmas ; but had no idea of my returning so soon .
Parsing [sent. 17955 len. 18]: I had purposely misled them , that I might have the pleasure of taking them by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 17956 len. 30]: And yet , I was perverse enough to feel a chill and disappointment in receiving no welcome , and rattling , alone and silent , through the misty streets .
Parsing [sent. 17957 len. 36]: The well-known shops , however , with their cheerful lights , did something for me ; and when I alighted at the door of the Gray 's Inn Coffee-house , I had recovered my spirits .
Parsing [sent. 17958 len. 38]: It recalled , at first , that so-different time when I had put up at the Golden Cross , and reminded me of the changes that had come to pass since then ; but that was natural .
Parsing [sent. 17959 len. 13]: ` Do you know where Mr. Traddles lives in the Inn ? '
Parsing [sent. 17960 len. 14]: I asked the waiter , as I warmed myself by the coffee-room fire .
Parsing [sent. 17961 len. 6]: ` Holborn Court , sir .
Parsing [sent. 17962 len. 4]: Number two . '
Parsing [sent. 17963 len. 15]: ` Mr. Traddles has a rising reputation among the lawyers , I believe ? '
Parsing [sent. 17964 len. 29]: said I. ` Well , sir , ' returned the waiter , ` probably he has , sir ; but I am not aware of it myself . '
Parsing [sent. 17965 len. 76]: This waiter , who was middle-aged and spare , looked for help to a waiter of more authority -- a stout , potential old man , with a double chin , in black breeches and stockings , who came out of a place like a churchwarden 's pew , at the end of the coffee-room , where he kept company with a cash-box , a Directory , a Law-list , and other books and papers .
Parsing [sent. 17966 len. 10]: ` Mr. Traddles , ' said the spare waiter .
Parsing [sent. 17967 len. 8]: ` Number two in the Court . '
Parsing [sent. 17968 len. 16]: The potential waiter waved him away , and turned , gravely , to me . '
Parsing [sent. 17969 len. 30]: I was inquiring , ' said I , ` whether Mr. Traddles , at number two in the Court , has not a rising reputation among the lawyers ? '
Parsing [sent. 17970 len. 17]: ` Never heard his name , ' said the waiter , in a rich husky voice .
Parsing [sent. 17971 len. 7]: I felt quite apologetic for Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 17972 len. 10]: ` He 's a young man , sure ? '
Parsing [sent. 17973 len. 12]: said the portentous waiter , fixing his eyes severely on me .
Parsing [sent. 17974 len. 11]: ` How long has he been in the Inn ? '
Parsing [sent. 17975 len. 10]: ` Not above three years , ' said I .
Parsing [sent. 17976 len. 25]: The waiter , who I supposed had lived in his churchwarden 's pew for forty years , could not pursue such an insignificant subject .
Parsing [sent. 17977 len. 10]: He asked me what I would have for dinner ?
Parsing [sent. 17978 len. 19]: I felt I was in England again , and really was quite cast down on Traddles 's account .
Parsing [sent. 17979 len. 9]: There seemed to be no hope for him .
Parsing [sent. 17980 len. 21]: I meekly ordered a bit of fish and a steak , and stood before the fire musing on his obscurity .
Parsing [sent. 17981 len. 39]: As I followed the chief waiter with my eyes , I could not help thinking that the garden in which he had gradually blown to be the flower he was , was an arduous place to rise in .
Parsing [sent. 17982 len. 15]: It had such a prescriptive , stiff-necked , long-established , solemn , elderly air .
Parsing [sent. 17983 len. 147]: I glanced about the room , which had had its sanded floor sanded , no doubt , in exactly the same manner when the chief waiter was a boy - if he ever was a boy , which appeared improbable ; and at the shining tables , where I saw myself reflected , in unruffled depths of old mahogany ; and at the lamps , without a flaw in their trimming or cleaning ; and at the comfortable green curtains , with their pure brass rods , snugly enclosing the boxes ; and at the two large coal fires , brightly burning ; and at the rows of decanters , burly as if with the consciousness of pipes of expensive old port wine below ; and both England , and the law , appeared to me to be very difficult indeed to be taken by storm .
Parsing [sent. 17984 len. 75]: I went up to my bedroom to change my wet clothes ; and the vast extent of that old wainscoted apartment -LRB- which was over the archway leading to the Inn , I remember -RRB- , and the sedate immensity of the four-post bedstead , and the indomitable gravity of the chests of drawers , all seemed to unite in sternly frowning on the fortunes of Traddles , or on any such daring youth .
Parsing [sent. 17985 len. 60]: I came down again to my dinner ; and even the slow comfort of the meal , and the orderly silence of the place -- which was bare of guests , the Long Vacation not yet being over -- were eloquent on the audacity of Traddles , and his small hopes of a livelihood for twenty years to come .
Parsing [sent. 17986 len. 21]: I had seen nothing like this since I went away , and it quite dashed my hopes for my friend .
Parsing [sent. 17987 len. 9]: The chief waiter had had enough of me .
Parsing [sent. 17988 len. 44]: He came near me no more ; but devoted himself to an old gentleman in long gaiters , to meet whom a pint of special port seemed to come out of the cellar of its own accord , for he gave no order .
Parsing [sent. 17989 len. 85]: The second waiter informed me , in a whisper , that this old gentleman was a retired conveyancer living in the Square , and worth a mint of money , which it was expected he would leave to his laundress 's daughter ; likewise that it was rumoured that he had a service of plate in a bureau , all tarnished with lying by , though more than one spoon and a fork had never yet been beheld in his chambers by mortal vision .
Parsing [sent. 17990 len. 26]: By this time , I quite gave Traddles up for lost ; and settled in my own mind that there was no hope for him .
Parsing [sent. 17991 len. 43]: Being very anxious to see the dear old fellow , nevertheless , I dispatched my dinner , in a manner not at all calculated to raise me in the opinion of the chief waiter , and hurried out by the back way .
Parsing [sent. 17992 len. 35]: Number two in the Court was soon reached ; and an inscription on the door-post informing me that Mr. Traddles occupied a set of chambers on the top storey , I ascended the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 17993 len. 34]: A crazy old staircase I found it to be , feebly lighted on each landing by a club - headed little oil wick , dying away in a little dungeon of dirty glass .
Parsing [sent. 17994 len. 45]: In the course of my stumbling upstairs , I fancied I heard a pleasant sound of laughter ; and not the laughter of an attorney or barrister , or attorney 's clerk or barrister 's clerk , but of two or three merry girls .
Parsing [sent. 17995 len. 48]: Happening , however , as I stopped to listen , to put my foot in a hole where the Honourable Society of Gray 's Inn had left a plank deficient , I fell down with some noise , and when I recovered my footing all was silent .
Parsing [sent. 17996 len. 34]: Groping my way more carefully , for the rest of the journey , my heart beat high when I found the outer door , which had Mr. TRADDLES painted on it , open .
Parsing [sent. 17997 len. 3]: I knocked .
Parsing [sent. 17998 len. 10]: A considerable scuffling within ensued , but nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 17999 len. 5]: I therefore knocked again .
Parsing [sent. 18000 len. 35]: A small sharp-looking lad , half-footboy and half-clerk , who was very much out of breath , but who looked at me as if he defied me to prove it legally , presented himself .
Parsing [sent. 18001 len. 7]: ` Is Mr. Traddles within ? '
Parsing [sent. 18002 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 18003 len. 12]: ` Yes , sir , but he 's engaged . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18004 len. 7]: I want to see him . '
Parsing [sent. 18005 len. 73]: After a moment 's survey of me , the sharp-looking lad decided to let me in ; and opening the door wider for that purpose , admitted me , first , into a little closet of a hall , and next into a little sitting-room ; where I came into the presence of my old friend -LRB- also out of breath -RRB- , seated at a table , and bending over papers .
Parsing [sent. 18006 len. 5]: ` Good God ! '
Parsing [sent. 18007 len. 6]: cried Traddles , looking up .
Parsing [sent. 18008 len. 6]: ` It 's Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 18009 len. 12]: and rushed into my arms , where I held him tight .
Parsing [sent. 18010 len. 9]: ` All well , my dear Traddles ? '
Parsing [sent. 18011 len. 17]: ` All well , my dear , dear Copperfield , and nothing but good news ! '
Parsing [sent. 18012 len. 9]: We cried with pleasure , both of us .
Parsing [sent. 18013 len. 43]: ` My dear fellow , ' said Traddles , rumpling his hair in his excitement , which was a most unnecessary operation , ` my dearest Copperfield , my long-lost and most welcome friend , how glad I am to see you !
Parsing [sent. 18014 len. 5]: How brown you are !
Parsing [sent. 18015 len. 5]: How glad I am !
Parsing [sent. 18016 len. 19]: Upon my life and honour , I never was so rejoiced , my beloved Copperfield , never ! '
Parsing [sent. 18017 len. 11]: I was equally at a loss to express my emotions .
Parsing [sent. 18018 len. 10]: I was quite unable to speak , at first .
Parsing [sent. 18019 len. 6]: ` My dear fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 18020 len. 3]: said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 18021 len. 6]: ` And grown so famous !
Parsing [sent. 18022 len. 4]: My glorious Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 18023 len. 22]: Good gracious me , WHEN did you come , WHERE have you come from , WHAT have you been doing ? '
Parsing [sent. 18024 len. 53]: Never pausing for an answer to anything he said , Traddles , who had clapped me into an easy-chair by the fire , all this time impetuously stirred the fire with one hand , and pulled at my neck-kerchief with the other , under some wild delusion that it was a great-coat .
Parsing [sent. 18025 len. 40]: Without putting down the poker , he now hugged me again ; and I hugged him ; and , both laughing , and both wiping our eyes , we both sat down , and shook hands across the hearth .
Parsing [sent. 18026 len. 36]: ` To think , ' said Traddles , ` that you should have been so nearly coming home as you must have been , my dear old boy , and not at the ceremony ! '
Parsing [sent. 18027 len. 9]: ` What ceremony , my dear Traddles ? '
Parsing [sent. 18028 len. 6]: ` Good gracious me ! '
Parsing [sent. 18029 len. 11]: cried Traddles , opening his eyes in his old way .
Parsing [sent. 18030 len. 10]: ` Did n't you get my last letter ? '
Parsing [sent. 18031 len. 12]: ` Certainly not , if it referred to any ceremony . '
Parsing [sent. 18032 len. 34]: ` Why , my dear Copperfield , ' said Traddles , sticking his hair upright with both hands , and then putting his hands on my knees , ' I am married ! '
Parsing [sent. 18033 len. 4]: ` Married ! '
Parsing [sent. 18034 len. 4]: I cried joyfully .
Parsing [sent. 18035 len. 9]: ` Lord bless me , yes , ! '
Parsing [sent. 18036 len. 16]: said Traddles -- ` by the Reverend Horace -- to Sophy -- down in Devonshire .
Parsing [sent. 18037 len. 13]: Why , my dear boy , she 's behind the window curtain !
Parsing [sent. 18038 len. 4]: Look here ! '
Parsing [sent. 18039 len. 26]: To my amazement , the dearest girl in the world came at that same instant , laughing and blushing , from her place of concealment .
Parsing [sent. 18040 len. 32]: And a more cheerful , amiable , honest , happy , bright-looking bride , I believe -LRB- as I could not help saying on the spot -RRB- the world never saw .
Parsing [sent. 18041 len. 20]: I kissed her as an old acquaintance should , and wished them joy with all my might of heart .
Parsing [sent. 18042 len. 16]: ` Dear me , ' said Traddles , ` what a delightful re-union this is !
Parsing [sent. 18043 len. 10]: You are so extremely brown , my dear Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 18044 len. 11]: God bless my soul , how happy I am ! '
Parsing [sent. 18045 len. 18]: ` And so am I , ' said I. ` And I am sure I am ! '
Parsing [sent. 18046 len. 7]: said the blushing and laughing Sophy .
Parsing [sent. 18047 len. 10]: ` We are all as happy as possible ! '
Parsing [sent. 18048 len. 3]: said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 18049 len. 7]: ` Even the girls are happy .
Parsing [sent. 18050 len. 10]: Dear me , I declare I forgot them ! '
Parsing [sent. 18051 len. 4]: ` Forgot ? '
Parsing [sent. 18052 len. 10]: said I. ` The girls , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 18053 len. 5]: ` Sophy 's sisters .
Parsing [sent. 18054 len. 6]: They are staying with us .
Parsing [sent. 18055 len. 10]: They have come to have a peep at London .
Parsing [sent. 18056 len. 16]: The fact is , when -- was it you that tumbled upstairs , Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 18057 len. 10]: ` It was , ' said I , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 18058 len. 21]: ` Well then , when you tumbled upstairs , ' said Traddles , ' I was romping with the girls .
Parsing [sent. 18059 len. 14]: In point of fact , we were playing at Puss in the Corner .
Parsing [sent. 18060 len. 29]: But as that would n't do in Westminster Hall , and as it would n't look quite professional if they were seen by a client , they decamped .
Parsing [sent. 18061 len. 25]: And they are now -- listening , I have no doubt , ' said Traddles , glancing at the door of another room . '
Parsing [sent. 18062 len. 20]: I am sorry , ' said I , laughing afresh , ` to have occasioned such a dispersion . '
Parsing [sent. 18063 len. 59]: ` Upon my word , ' rejoined Traddles , greatly delighted , ` if you had seen them running away , and running back again , after you had knocked , to pick up the combs they had dropped out of their hair , and going on in the maddest manner , you would n't have said so .
Parsing [sent. 18064 len. 10]: My love , will you fetch the girls ? '
Parsing [sent. 18065 len. 19]: Sophy tripped away , and we heard her received in the adjoining room with a peal of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 18066 len. 13]: ` Really musical , is n't it , my dear Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 18067 len. 3]: said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 18068 len. 8]: ` It 's very agreeable to hear .
Parsing [sent. 18069 len. 8]: It quite lights up these old rooms .
Parsing [sent. 18070 len. 23]: To an unfortunate bachelor of a fellow who has lived alone all his life , you know , it 's positively delicious .
Parsing [sent. 18071 len. 4]: It 's charming .
Parsing [sent. 18072 len. 30]: Poor things , they have had a great loss in Sophy -- who , I do assure you , Copperfield is , and ever was , the dearest girl !
Parsing [sent. 18073 len. 15]: -- and it gratifies me beyond expression to find them in such good spirits .
Parsing [sent. 18074 len. 12]: The society of girls is a very delightful thing , Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 18075 len. 12]: It 's not professional , but it 's very delightful . '
Parsing [sent. 18076 len. 44]: Observing that he slightly faltered , and comprehending that in the goodness of his heart he was fearful of giving me some pain by what he had said , I expressed my concurrence with a heartiness that evidently relieved and pleased him greatly .
Parsing [sent. 18077 len. 27]: ` But then , ' said Traddles , ` our domestic arrangements are , to say the truth , quite unprofessional altogether , my dear Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 18078 len. 9]: Even Sophy 's being here , is unprofessional .
Parsing [sent. 18079 len. 9]: And we have no other place of abode .
Parsing [sent. 18080 len. 18]: We have put to sea in a cockboat , but we are quite prepared to rough it .
Parsing [sent. 18081 len. 7]: And Sophy 's an extraordinary manager !
Parsing [sent. 18082 len. 11]: You 'll be surprised how those girls are stowed away .
Parsing [sent. 18083 len. 12]: I am sure I hardly know how it 's done ! '
Parsing [sent. 18084 len. 11]: ` Are many of the young ladies with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 18085 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 18086 len. 22]: ` The eldest , the Beauty is here , ' said Traddles , in a low confidential voice , ` Caroline .
Parsing [sent. 18087 len. 23]: And Sarah 's here -- the one I mentioned to you as having something the matter with her spine , you know .
Parsing [sent. 18088 len. 3]: Immensely better !
Parsing [sent. 18089 len. 11]: And the two youngest that Sophy educated are with us .
Parsing [sent. 18090 len. 6]: And Louisa 's here . '
Parsing [sent. 18091 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 18092 len. 9]: cried I. ` Yes , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 18093 len. 36]: ` Now the whole set -- I mean the chambers -- is only three rooms ; but Sophy arranges for the girls in the most wonderful way , and they sleep as comfortably as possible .
Parsing [sent. 18094 len. 11]: Three in that room , ' said Traddles , pointing .
Parsing [sent. 18095 len. 6]: ` Two in that . '
Parsing [sent. 18096 len. 19]: I could not help glancing round , in search of the accommodation remaining for Mr. and Mrs. Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 18097 len. 4]: Traddles understood me .
Parsing [sent. 18098 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 18099 len. 31]: said Traddles , ` we are prepared to rough it , as I said just now , and we did improvise a bed last week , upon the floor here .
Parsing [sent. 18100 len. 38]: But there 's a little room in the roof -- a very nice room , when you 're up there -- which Sophy papered herself , to surprise me ; and that 's our room at present .
Parsing [sent. 18101 len. 10]: It 's a capital little gipsy sort of place .
Parsing [sent. 18102 len. 9]: There 's quite a view from it . '
Parsing [sent. 18103 len. 14]: ` And you are happily married at last , my dear Traddles ! '
Parsing [sent. 18104 len. 9]: said I. ` How rejoiced I am ! '
Parsing [sent. 18105 len. 19]: ` Thank you , my dear Copperfield , ' said Traddles , as we shook hands once more .
Parsing [sent. 18106 len. 14]: ` Yes , I am as happy as it 's possible to be .
Parsing [sent. 18107 len. 32]: There 's your old friend , you see , ' said Traddles , nodding triumphantly at the flower-pot and stand ; ` and there 's the table with the marble top !
Parsing [sent. 18108 len. 12]: All the other furniture is plain and serviceable , you perceive .
Parsing [sent. 18109 len. 19]: And as to plate , Lord bless you , we have n't so much as a tea-spoon . '
Parsing [sent. 18110 len. 7]: ` All to be earned ? '
Parsing [sent. 18111 len. 5]: said I , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 18112 len. 14]: ` Exactly so , ' replied Traddles , ` all to be earned .
Parsing [sent. 18113 len. 17]: Of course we have something in the shape of tea-spoons , because we stir our tea .
Parsing [sent. 18114 len. 7]: But they 're Britannia metal . ''
Parsing [sent. 18115 len. 22]: ` The silver will be the brighter when it comes , ' said I. ` The very thing we say ! '
Parsing [sent. 18116 len. 3]: cried Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 18117 len. 28]: ` You see , my dear Copperfield , ' falling again into the low confidential tone , ` after I had delivered my argument in DOE dem .
Parsing [sent. 18118 len. 31]: JIPES versus WIGZIELL , which did me great service with the profession , I went down into Devonshire , and had some serious conversation in private with the Reverend Horace .
Parsing [sent. 18119 len. 21]: I dwelt upon the fact that Sophy -- who I do assure you , Copperfield , is the dearest girl !
Parsing [sent. 18120 len. 10]: -- ' ' I am certain she is ! '
Parsing [sent. 18121 len. 9]: said I. ` She is , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 18122 len. 3]: rejoined Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 18123 len. 12]: ` But I am afraid I am wandering from the subject .
Parsing [sent. 18124 len. 8]: Did I mention the Reverend Horace ? '
Parsing [sent. 18125 len. 14]: ` You said that you dwelt upon the fact -- ' ` True !
Parsing [sent. 18126 len. 54]: Upon the fact that Sophy and I had been engaged for a long period , and that Sophy , with the permission of her parents , was more than content to take me -- in short , ' said Traddles , with his old frank smile , ` on our present Britannia-metal footing .
Parsing [sent. 18127 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 18128 len. 102]: I then proposed to the Reverend Horace -- who is a most excellent clergyman , Copperfield , and ought to be a Bishop ; or at least ought to have enough to live upon , without pinching himself - that if I could turn the corner , say of two hundred and fifty pounds , in one year ; and could see my way pretty clearly to that , or something better , next year ; and could plainly furnish a little place like this , besides ; then , and in that case , Sophy and I should be united .
Parsing [sent. 18129 len. 51]: I took the liberty of representing that we had been patient for a good many years ; and that the circumstance of Sophy 's being extraordinarily useful at home , ought not to operate with her affectionate parents , against her establishment in life -- do n't you see ? '
Parsing [sent. 18130 len. 54]: ` Certainly it ought not , ' said I. ' I am glad you think so , Copperfield , ' rejoined Traddles , ` because , without any imputation on the Reverend Horace , I do think parents , and brothers , and so forth , are sometimes rather selfish in such cases .
Parsing [sent. 18131 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 18132 len. 76]: I also pointed out , that my most earnest desire was , to be useful to the family ; and that if I got on in the world , and anything should happen to him -- I refer to the Reverend Horace -- ' ' I understand , ' said I. ' - Or to Mrs. Crewler -- it would be the utmost gratification of my wishes , to be a parent to the girls .
Parsing [sent. 18133 len. 27]: He replied in a most admirable manner , exceedingly flattering to my feelings , and undertook to obtain the consent of Mrs. Crewler to this arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 18134 len. 10]: They had a dreadful time of it with her .
Parsing [sent. 18135 len. 21]: It mounted from her legs into her chest , and then into her head -- ' ` What mounted ? '
Parsing [sent. 18136 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 18137 len. 13]: ` Her grief , ' replied Traddles , with a serious look .
Parsing [sent. 18138 len. 5]: ` Her feelings generally .
Parsing [sent. 18139 len. 24]: As I mentioned on a former occasion , she is a very superior woman , but has lost the use of her limbs .
Parsing [sent. 18140 len. 43]: Whatever occurs to harass her , usually settles in her legs ; but on this occasion it mounted to the chest , and then to the head , and , in short , pervaded the whole system in a most alarming manner .
Parsing [sent. 18141 len. 21]: However , they brought her through it by unremitting and affectionate attention ; and we were married yesterday six weeks .
Parsing [sent. 18142 len. 26]: You have no idea what a Monster I felt , Copperfield , when I saw the whole family crying and fainting away in every direction !
Parsing [sent. 18143 len. 37]: Mrs. Crewler could n't see me before we left -- could n't forgive me , then , for depriving her of her child -- but she is a good creature , and has done so since .
Parsing [sent. 18144 len. 13]: I had a delightful letter from her , only this morning . '
Parsing [sent. 18145 len. 25]: ` And in short , my dear friend , ' said I , ` you feel as blest as you deserve to feel ! '
Parsing [sent. 18146 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 18147 len. 6]: That 's your partiality ! '
Parsing [sent. 18148 len. 3]: laughed Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 18149 len. 13]: ` But , indeed , I am in a most enviable state .
Parsing [sent. 18150 len. 9]: I work hard , and read Law insatiably .
Parsing [sent. 18151 len. 16]: I get up at five every morning , and do n't mind it at all .
Parsing [sent. 18152 len. 17]: I hide the girls in the daytime , and make merry with them in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 18153 len. 28]: And I assure you I am quite sorry that they are going home on Tuesday , which is the day before the first day of Michaelmas Term .
Parsing [sent. 18154 len. 22]: But here , ' said Traddles , breaking off in his confidence , and speaking aloud , ` ARE the girls !
Parsing [sent. 18155 len. 17]: Mr. Copperfield , Miss Crewler -- Miss Sarah -- Miss Louisa -- Margaret and Lucy ! '
Parsing [sent. 18156 len. 15]: They were a perfect nest of roses ; they looked so wholesome and fresh .
Parsing [sent. 18157 len. 45]: They were all pretty , and Miss Caroline was very handsome ; but there was a loving , cheerful , fireside quality in Sophy 's bright looks , which was better than that , and which assured me that my friend had chosen well .
Parsing [sent. 18158 len. 36]: We all sat round the fire ; while the sharp boy , who I now divined had lost his breath in putting the papers out , cleared them away again , and produced the tea-things .
Parsing [sent. 18159 len. 19]: After that , he retired for the night , shutting the outer door upon us with a bang .
Parsing [sent. 18160 len. 34]: Mrs. Traddles , with perfect pleasure and composure beaming from her household eyes , having made the tea , then quietly made the toast as she sat in a corner by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 18161 len. 13]: She had seen Agnes , she told me while she was toasting .
Parsing [sent. 18162 len. 43]: ` Tom ' had taken her down into Kent for a wedding trip , and there she had seen my aunt , too ; and both my aunt and Agnes were well , and they had all talked of nothing but me .
Parsing [sent. 18163 len. 24]: ` Tom ' had never had me out of his thoughts , she really believed , all the time I had been away .
Parsing [sent. 18164 len. 9]: ` Tom ' was the authority for everything .
Parsing [sent. 18165 len. 44]: ` Tom ' was evidently the idol of her life ; never to be shaken on his pedestal by any commotion ; always to be believed in , and done homage to with the whole faith of her heart , come what might .
Parsing [sent. 18166 len. 17]: The deference which both she and Traddles showed towards the Beauty , pleased me very much .
Parsing [sent. 18167 len. 26]: I do n't know that I thought it very reasonable ; but I thought it very delightful , and essentially a part of their character .
Parsing [sent. 18168 len. 30]: If Traddles ever for an instant missed the tea-spoons that were still to be won , I have no doubt it was when he handed the Beauty her tea .
Parsing [sent. 18169 len. 29]: If his sweet-tempered wife could have got up any self-assertion against anyone , I am satisfied it could only have been because she was the Beauty 's sister .
Parsing [sent. 18170 len. 36]: A few slight indications of a rather petted and capricious manner , which I observed in the Beauty , were manifestly considered , by Traddles and his wife , as her birthright and natural endowment .
Parsing [sent. 18171 len. 24]: If she had been born a Queen Bee , and they labouring Bees , they could not have been more satisfied of that .
Parsing [sent. 18172 len. 6]: But their self-forgetfulness charmed me .
Parsing [sent. 18173 len. 32]: Their pride in these girls , and their submission of themselves to all their whims , was the pleasantest little testimony to their own worth I could have desired to see .
Parsing [sent. 18174 len. 69]: If Traddles were addressed as ' a darling ' , once in the course of that evening ; and besought to bring something here , or carry something there , or take something up , or put something down , or find something , or fetch something , he was so addressed , by one or other of his sisters-in-law , at least twelve times in an hour .
Parsing [sent. 18175 len. 8]: Neither could they do anything without Sophy .
Parsing [sent. 18176 len. 15]: Somebody 's hair fell down , and nobody but Sophy could put it up .
Parsing [sent. 18177 len. 18]: Somebody forgot how a particular tune went , and nobody but Sophy could hum that tune right .
Parsing [sent. 18178 len. 18]: Somebody wanted to recall the name of a place in Devonshire , and only Sophy knew it .
Parsing [sent. 18179 len. 22]: Something was wanted to be written home , and Sophy alone could be trusted to write before breakfast in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 18180 len. 25]: Somebody broke down in a piece of knitting , and no one but Sophy was able to put the defaulter in the right direction .
Parsing [sent. 18181 len. 16]: They were entire mistresses of the place , and Sophy and Traddles waited on them .
Parsing [sent. 18182 len. 86]: How many children Sophy could have taken care of in her time , I ca n't imagine ; but she seemed to be famous for knowing every sort of song that ever was addressed to a child in the English tongue ; and she sang dozens to order with the clearest little voice in the world , one after another -LRB- every sister issuing directions for a different tune , and the Beauty generally striking in last -RRB- , so that I was quite fascinated .
Parsing [sent. 18183 len. 30]: The best of all was , that , in the midst of their exactions , all the sisters had a great tenderness and respect both for Sophy and Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 18184 len. 51]: I am sure , when I took my leave , and Traddles was coming out to walk with me to the coffee-house , I thought I had never seen an obstinate head of hair , or any other head of hair , rolling about in such a shower of kisses .
Parsing [sent. 18185 len. 30]: Altogether , it was a scene I could not help dwelling on with pleasure , for a long time after I got back and had wished Traddles good night .
Parsing [sent. 18186 len. 32]: If I had beheld a thousand roses blowing in a top set of chambers , in that withered Gray 's Inn , they could not have brightened it half so much .
Parsing [sent. 18187 len. 108]: The idea of those Devonshire girls , among the dry law-stationers and the attorneys ' offices ; and of the tea and toast , and children 's songs , in that grim atmosphere of pounce and parchment , red-tape , dusty wafers , ink-jars , brief and draft paper , law reports , writs , declarations , and bills of costs ; seemed almost as pleasantly fanciful as if I had dreamed that the Sultan 's famous family had been admitted on the roll of attorneys , and had brought the talking bird , the singing tree , and the golden water into Gray 's Inn Hall .
Parsing [sent. 18188 len. 32]: Somehow , I found that I had taken leave of Traddles for the night , and come back to the coffee-house , with a great change in my despondency about him .
Parsing [sent. 18189 len. 22]: I began to think he would get on , in spite of all the many orders of chief waiters in England .
Parsing [sent. 18190 len. 55]: Drawing a chair before one of the coffee-room fires to think about him at my leisure , I gradually fell from the consideration of his happiness to tracing prospects in the live-coals , and to thinking , as they broke and changed , of the principal vicissitudes and separations that had marked my life .
Parsing [sent. 18191 len. 59]: I had not seen a coal fire , since I had left England three years ago : though many a wood fire had I watched , as it crumbled into hoary ashes , and mingled with the feathery heap upon the hearth , which not inaptly figured to me , in my despondency , my own dead hopes .
Parsing [sent. 18192 len. 24]: I could think of the past now , gravely , but not bitterly ; and could contemplate the future in a brave spirit .
Parsing [sent. 18193 len. 13]: Home , in its best sense , was for me no more .
Parsing [sent. 18194 len. 19]: She in whom I might have inspired a dearer love , I had taught to be my sister .
Parsing [sent. 18195 len. 33]: She would marry , and would have new claimants on her tenderness ; and in doing it , would never know the love for her that had grown up in my heart .
Parsing [sent. 18196 len. 14]: It was right that I should pay the forfeit of my headlong passion .
Parsing [sent. 18197 len. 8]: What I reaped , I had sown .
Parsing [sent. 18198 len. 4]: I was thinking .
Parsing [sent. 18199 len. 60]: And had I truly disciplined my heart to this , and could I resolutely bear it , and calmly hold the place in her home which she had calmly held in mine , -- when I found my eyes resting on a countenance that might have arisen out of the fire , in its association with my early remembrances .
Parsing [sent. 18200 len. 34]: Little Mr. Chillip the Doctor , to whose good offices I was indebted in the very first chapter of this history , sat reading a newspaper in the shadow of an opposite corner .
Parsing [sent. 18201 len. 55]: He was tolerably stricken in years by this time ; but , being a mild , meek , calm little man , had worn so easily , that I thought he looked at that moment just as he might have looked when he sat in our parlour , waiting for me to be born .
Parsing [sent. 18202 len. 19]: Mr. Chillip had left Blunderstone six or seven years ago , and I had never seen him since .
Parsing [sent. 18203 len. 26]: He sat placidly perusing the newspaper , with his little head on one side , and a glass of warm sherry negus at his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 18204 len. 25]: He was so extremely conciliatory in his manner that he seemed to apologize to the very newspaper for taking the liberty of reading it .
Parsing [sent. 18205 len. 22]: I walked up to where he was sitting , and said , ` How do you do , Mr. Chillip ? '
Parsing [sent. 18206 len. 32]: He was greatly fluttered by this unexpected address from a stranger , and replied , in his slow way , ' I thank you , sir , you are very good .
Parsing [sent. 18207 len. 5]: Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 18208 len. 7]: I hope YOU are well . '
Parsing [sent. 18209 len. 8]: ` You do n't remember me ? '
Parsing [sent. 18210 len. 59]: said I. ` Well , sir , ' returned Mr. Chillip , smiling very meekly , and shaking his head as he surveyed me , ' I have a kind of an impression that something in your countenance is familiar to me , sir ; but I could n't lay my hand upon your name , really . '
Parsing [sent. 18211 len. 18]: ` And yet you knew it , long before I knew it myself , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 18212 len. 8]: ` Did I indeed , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 18213 len. 4]: said Mr. Chillip .
Parsing [sent. 18214 len. 18]: ` Is it possible that I had the honour , sir , of officiating when -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 18215 len. 11]: ` Yes , ' said I. ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 18216 len. 4]: cried Mr. Chillip .
Parsing [sent. 18217 len. 16]: ` But no doubt you are a good deal changed since then , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 18218 len. 37]: ` Probably , ' said I. ` Well , sir , ' observed Mr. Chillip , ' I hope you 'll excuse me , if I am compelled to ask the favour of your name ? '
Parsing [sent. 18219 len. 12]: On my telling him my name , he was really moved .
Parsing [sent. 18220 len. 47]: He quite shook hands with me -- which was a violent proceeding for him , his usual course being to slide a tepid little fish-slice , an inch or two in advance of his hip , and evince the greatest discomposure when anybody grappled with it .
Parsing [sent. 18221 len. 29]: Even now , he put his hand in his coat-pocket as soon as he could disengage it , and seemed relieved when he had got it safe back .
Parsing [sent. 18222 len. 7]: ` Dear me , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 18223 len. 13]: said Mr. Chillip , surveying me with his head on one side .
Parsing [sent. 18224 len. 10]: ` And it 's Mr. Copperfield , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 18225 len. 25]: Well , sir , I think I should have known you , if I had taken the liberty of looking more closely at you .
Parsing [sent. 18226 len. 16]: There 's a strong resemblance between you and your poor father , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18227 len. 14]: I never had the happiness of seeing my father , ' I observed .
Parsing [sent. 18228 len. 16]: ` Very true , sir , ' said Mr. Chillip , in a soothing tone .
Parsing [sent. 18229 len. 14]: ` And very much to be deplored it was , on all accounts !
Parsing [sent. 18230 len. 32]: We are not ignorant , sir , ' said Mr. Chillip , slowly shaking his little head again , ` down in our part of the country , of your fame .
Parsing [sent. 18231 len. 23]: There must be great excitement here , sir , ' said Mr. Chillip , tapping himself on the forehead with his forefinger .
Parsing [sent. 18232 len. 12]: ` You must find it a trying occupation , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 18233 len. 11]: ` What is your part of the country now ? '
Parsing [sent. 18234 len. 9]: I asked , seating myself near him . '
Parsing [sent. 18235 len. 20]: I am established within a few miles of Bury St. Edmund 's , sir , ' said Mr. Chillip .
Parsing [sent. 18236 len. 39]: ` Mrs. Chillip , coming into a little property in that neighbourhood , under her father 's will , I bought a practice down there , in which you will be glad to hear I am doing well .
Parsing [sent. 18237 len. 25]: My daughter is growing quite a tall lass now , sir , ' said Mr. Chillip , giving his little head another little shake .
Parsing [sent. 18238 len. 14]: ` Her mother let down two tucks in her frocks only last week .
Parsing [sent. 18239 len. 10]: Such is time , you see , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 18240 len. 37]: As the little man put his now empty glass to his lips , when he made this reflection , I proposed to him to have it refilled , and I would keep him company with another .
Parsing [sent. 18241 len. 36]: ` Well , sir , ' he returned , in his slow way , ` it 's more than I am accustomed to ; but I ca n't deny myself the pleasure of your conversation .
Parsing [sent. 18242 len. 16]: It seems but yesterday that I had the honour of attending you in the measles .
Parsing [sent. 18243 len. 9]: You came through them charmingly , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 18244 len. 15]: I acknowledged this compliment , and ordered the negus , which was soon produced .
Parsing [sent. 18245 len. 7]: ` Quite an uncommon dissipation ! '
Parsing [sent. 18246 len. 18]: said Mr. Chillip , stirring it , ` but I ca n't resist so extraordinary an occasion .
Parsing [sent. 18247 len. 8]: You have no family , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 18248 len. 6]: I shook my head . '
Parsing [sent. 18249 len. 21]: I was aware that you sustained a bereavement , sir , some time ago , ' said Mr. Chillip . '
Parsing [sent. 18250 len. 9]: I heard it from your father-in-law 's sister .
Parsing [sent. 18251 len. 8]: Very decided character there , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 18252 len. 13]: ` Why , yes , ' said I , ` decided enough .
Parsing [sent. 18253 len. 10]: Where did you see her , Mr. Chillip ? '
Parsing [sent. 18254 len. 30]: ` Are you not aware , sir , ' returned Mr. Chillip , with his placidest smile , ` that your father-in-law is again a neighbour of mine ? '
Parsing [sent. 18255 len. 14]: ` No , ' said I. ` He is indeed , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 18256 len. 4]: said Mr. Chillip .
Parsing [sent. 18257 len. 19]: ` Married a young lady of that part , with a very good little property , poor thing .
Parsing [sent. 18258 len. 11]: -- And this action of the brain now , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 18259 len. 9]: Do n't you find it fatigue you ? '
Parsing [sent. 18260 len. 12]: said Mr. Chillip , looking at me like an admiring Robin .
Parsing [sent. 18261 len. 12]: I waived that question , and returned to the Murdstones . '
Parsing [sent. 18262 len. 9]: I was aware of his being married again .
Parsing [sent. 18263 len. 7]: Do you attend the family ? '
Parsing [sent. 18264 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 18265 len. 4]: ` Not regularly .
Parsing [sent. 18266 len. 10]: I have been called in , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 18267 len. 20]: ` Strong phrenological developments of the organ of firmness , in Mr. Murdstone and his sister , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 18268 len. 39]: I replied with such an expressive look , that Mr. Chillip was emboldened by that , and the negus together , to give his head several short shakes , and thoughtfully exclaim , ` Ah , dear me !
Parsing [sent. 18269 len. 9]: We remember old times , Mr. Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 18270 len. 16]: ` And the brother and sister are pursuing their old course , are they ? '
Parsing [sent. 18271 len. 36]: said I. ` Well , sir , ' replied Mr. Chillip , ' a medical man , being so much in families , ought to have neither eyes nor ears for anything but his profession .
Parsing [sent. 18272 len. 23]: Still , I must say , they are very severe , sir : both as to this life and the next . '
Parsing [sent. 18273 len. 30]: ` The next will be regulated without much reference to them , I dare say , ' I returned : ` what are they doing as to this ? '
Parsing [sent. 18274 len. 14]: Mr. Chillip shook his head , stirred his negus , and sipped it .
Parsing [sent. 18275 len. 10]: ` She was a charming woman , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 18276 len. 7]: he observed in a plaintive manner .
Parsing [sent. 18277 len. 7]: ` The present Mrs. Murdstone ? '
Parsing [sent. 18278 len. 27]: A charming woman indeed , sir , ' said Mr. Chillip ; ` as amiable , I am sure , as it was possible to be !
Parsing [sent. 18279 len. 26]: Mrs. Chillip 's opinion is , that her spirit has been entirely broken since her marriage , and that she is all but melancholy mad .
Parsing [sent. 18280 len. 20]: And the ladies , ' observed Mr. Chillip , timorously , ` are great observers , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18281 len. 19]: I suppose she was to be subdued and broken to their detestable mould , Heaven help her ! '
Parsing [sent. 18282 len. 9]: said I. ` And she has been . '
Parsing [sent. 18283 len. 30]: ` Well , sir , there were violent quarrels at first , I assure you , ' said Mr. Chillip ; ` but she is quite a shadow now .
Parsing [sent. 18284 len. 43]: Would it be considered forward if I was to say to you , sir , in confidence , that since the sister came to help , the brother and sister between them have nearly reduced her to a state of imbecility ? '
Parsing [sent. 18285 len. 10]: I told him I could easily believe it . '
Parsing [sent. 18286 len. 50]: I have no hesitation in saying , ' said Mr. Chillip , fortifying himself with another sip of negus , ` between you and me , sir , that her mother died of it -- or that tyranny , gloom , and worry have made Mrs. Murdstone nearly imbecile .
Parsing [sent. 18287 len. 20]: She was a lively young woman , sir , before marriage , and their gloom and austerity destroyed her .
Parsing [sent. 18288 len. 18]: They go about with her , now , more like her keepers than her husband and sister-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 18289 len. 13]: That was Mrs. Chillip 's remark to me , only last week .
Parsing [sent. 18290 len. 13]: And I assure you , sir , the ladies are great observers .
Parsing [sent. 18291 len. 9]: Mrs. Chillip herself is a great observer ! '
Parsing [sent. 18292 len. 23]: ` Does he gloomily profess to be -LRB- I am ashamed to use the word in such association -RRB- religious still ? '
Parsing [sent. 18293 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 18294 len. 26]: ` You anticipate , sir , ' said Mr. Chillip , his eyelids getting quite red with the unwonted stimulus in which he was indulging .
Parsing [sent. 18295 len. 10]: ` One of Mrs. Chillip 's most impressive remarks .
Parsing [sent. 18296 len. 39]: Mrs. Chillip , ' he proceeded , in the calmest and slowest manner , ` quite electrified me , by pointing out that Mr. Murdstone sets up an image of himself , and calls it the Divine Nature .
Parsing [sent. 18297 len. 32]: You might have knocked me down on the flat of my back , sir , with the feather of a pen , I assure you , when Mrs. Chillip said so .
Parsing [sent. 18298 len. 9]: The ladies are great observers , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 18299 len. 13]: ` Intuitively , ' said I , to his extreme delight . '
Parsing [sent. 18300 len. 18]: I am very happy to receive such support in my opinion , sir , ' he rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 18301 len. 18]: ` It is not often that I venture to give a non-medical opinion , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 18302 len. 44]: Mr. Murdstone delivers public addresses sometimes , and it is said , -- in short , sir , it is said by Mrs. Chillip , -- that the darker tyrant he has lately been , the more ferocious is his doctrine . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18303 len. 53]: I believe Mrs. Chillip to be perfectly right , ' said I. ` Mrs. Chillip does go so far as to say , ' pursued the meekest of little men , much encouraged , ` that what such people miscall their religion , is a vent for their bad humours and arrogance .
Parsing [sent. 18304 len. 41]: And do you know I must say , sir , ' he continued , mildly laying his head on one side , ` that I DO N'T find authority for Mr. and Miss Murdstone in the New Testament ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18305 len. 7]: I never found it either ! '
Parsing [sent. 18306 len. 49]: said I. ` In the meantime , sir , ' said Mr. Chillip , ` they are much disliked ; and as they are very free in consigning everybody who dislikes them to perdition , we really have a good deal of perdition going on in our neighbourhood !
Parsing [sent. 18307 len. 37]: However , as Mrs. Chillip says , sir , they undergo a continual punishment ; for they are turned inward , to feed upon their own hearts , and their own hearts are very bad feeding .
Parsing [sent. 18308 len. 19]: Now , sir , about that brain of yours , if you 'll excuse my returning to it .
Parsing [sent. 18309 len. 15]: Do n't you expose it to a good deal of excitement , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 18310 len. 95]: I found it not difficult , in the excitement of Mr. Chillip 's own brain , under his potations of negus , to divert his attention from this topic to his own affairs , on which , for the next half-hour , he was quite loquacious ; giving me to understand , among other pieces of information , that he was then at the Gray 's Inn Coffee-house to lay his professional evidence before a Commission of Lunacy , touching the state of mind of a patient who had become deranged from excessive drinking .
Parsing [sent. 18311 len. 21]: ` And I assure you , sir , ' he said , ' I am extremely nervous on such occasions .
Parsing [sent. 18312 len. 12]: I could not support being what is called Bullied , sir .
Parsing [sent. 18313 len. 6]: It would quite unman me .
Parsing [sent. 18314 len. 28]: Do you know it was some time before I recovered the conduct of that alarming lady , on the night of your birth , Mr. Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 18315 len. 49]: I told him that I was going down to my aunt , the Dragon of that night , early in the morning ; and that she was one of the most tender-hearted and excellent of women , as he would know full well if he knew her better .
Parsing [sent. 18316 len. 18]: The mere notion of the possibility of his ever seeing her again , appeared to terrify him .
Parsing [sent. 18317 len. 17]: He replied with a small pale smile , ` Is she so , indeed , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 18318 len. 3]: Really ? '
Parsing [sent. 18319 len. 23]: and almost immediately called for a candle , and went to bed , as if he were not quite safe anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 18320 len. 52]: He did not actually stagger under the negus ; but I should think his placid little pulse must have made two or three more beats in a minute , than it had done since the great night of my aunt 's disappointment , when she struck at him with her bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 18321 len. 71]: Thoroughly tired , I went to bed too , at midnight ; passed the next day on the Dover coach ; burst safe and sound into my aunt 's old parlour while she was at tea -LRB- she wore spectacles now -RRB- ; and was received by her , and Mr. Dick , and dear old Peggotty , who acted as housekeeper , with open arms and tears of joy .
Parsing [sent. 18322 len. 89]: My aunt was mightily amused , when we began to talk composedly , by my account of my meeting with Mr. Chillip , and of his holding her in such dread remembrance ; and both she and Peggotty had a great deal to say about my poor mother 's second husband , and ` that murdering woman of a sister ' , -- on whom I think no pain or penalty would have induced my aunt to bestow any Christian or Proper Name , or any other designation .
Parsing [sent. 18323 len. 20]: Chapter 60 Agnes My aunt and I , when we were left alone , talked far into the night .
Parsing [sent. 18324 len. 131]: How the emigrants never wrote home , otherwise than cheerfully and hopefully ; how Mr. Micawber had actually remitted divers small sums of money , on account of those ` pecuniary liabilities ' , in reference to which he had been so business-like as between man and man ; how Janet , returning into my aunt 's service when she came back to Dover , had finally carried out her renunciation of mankind by entering into wedlock with a thriving tavern-keeper ; and how my aunt had finally set her seal on the same great principle , by aiding and abetting the bride , and crowning the marriage-ceremony with her presence ; were among our topics -- already more or less familiar to me through the letters I had had .
Parsing [sent. 18325 len. 10]: Mr. Dick , as usual , was not forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 18326 len. 82]: My aunt informed me how he incessantly occupied himself in copying everything he could lay his hands on , and kept King Charles the First at a respectful distance by that semblance of employment ; how it was one of the main joys and rewards of her life that he was free and happy , instead of pining in monotonous restraint ; and how -LRB- as a novel general conclusion -RRB- nobody but she could ever fully know what he was .
Parsing [sent. 18327 len. 40]: ` And when , Trot , ' said my aunt , patting the back of my hand , as we sat in our old way before the fire , ` when are you going over to Canterbury ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18328 len. 22]: I shall get a horse , and ride over tomorrow morning , aunt , unless you will go with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 18329 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 18330 len. 11]: said my aunt , in her short abrupt way . '
Parsing [sent. 18331 len. 9]: I mean to stay where I am . '
Parsing [sent. 18332 len. 9]: Then , I should ride , I said .
Parsing [sent. 18333 len. 21]: I could not have come through Canterbury today without stopping , if I had been coming to anyone but her .
Parsing [sent. 18334 len. 22]: She was pleased , but answered , ` Tut , Trot ; My old bones would have kept till tomorrow ! '
Parsing [sent. 18335 len. 16]: and softly patted my hand again , as I sat looking thoughtfully at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 18336 len. 31]: Thoughtfully , for I could not be here once more , and so near Agnes , without the revival of those regrets with which I had so long been occupied .
Parsing [sent. 18337 len. 29]: Softened regrets they might be , teaching me what I had failed to learn when my younger life was all before me , but not the less regrets .
Parsing [sent. 18338 len. 31]: ` Oh , Trot , ' I seemed to hear my aunt say once more ; and I understood her better now -- ` Blind , blind , blind ! '
Parsing [sent. 18339 len. 8]: We both kept silence for some minutes .
Parsing [sent. 18340 len. 16]: When I raised my eyes , I found that she was steadily observant of me .
Parsing [sent. 18341 len. 29]: Perhaps she had followed the current of my mind ; for it seemed to me an easy one to track now , wilful as it had been once .
Parsing [sent. 18342 len. 30]: ` You will find her father a white-haired old man , ' said my aunt , ` though a better man in all other respects -- a reclaimed man .
Parsing [sent. 18343 len. 24]: Neither will you find him measuring all human interests , and joys , and sorrows , with his one poor little inch-rule now .
Parsing [sent. 18344 len. 23]: Trust me , child , such things must shrink very much , before they can be measured off in that way . '
Parsing [sent. 18345 len. 38]: ` Indeed they must , ' said I. ` You will find her , ' pursued my aunt , ` as good , as beautiful , as earnest , as disinterested , as she has always been .
Parsing [sent. 18346 len. 16]: If I knew higher praise , Trot , I would bestow it on her . '
Parsing [sent. 18347 len. 14]: There was no higher praise for her ; no higher reproach for me .
Parsing [sent. 18348 len. 10]: Oh , how had I strayed so far away !
Parsing [sent. 18349 len. 45]: ` If she trains the young girls whom she has about her , to be like herself , ' said my aunt , earnest even to the filling of her eyes with tears , ` Heaven knows , her life will be well employed !
Parsing [sent. 18350 len. 10]: Useful and happy , as she said that day !
Parsing [sent. 18351 len. 11]: How could she be otherwise than useful and happy ! '
Parsing [sent. 18352 len. 15]: ` Has Agnes any -- ' I was thinking aloud , rather than speaking .
Parsing [sent. 18353 len. 3]: ` Well ?
Parsing [sent. 18354 len. 2]: Hey ?
Parsing [sent. 18355 len. 4]: Any what ? '
Parsing [sent. 18356 len. 6]: said my aunt , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 18357 len. 23]: ` Any lover , ' said I. ' A score , ' cried my aunt , with a kind of indignant pride .
Parsing [sent. 18358 len. 18]: ` She might have married twenty times , my dear , since you have been gone ! '
Parsing [sent. 18359 len. 11]: ` No doubt , ' said I. ` No doubt .
Parsing [sent. 18360 len. 11]: But has she any lover who is worthy of her ?
Parsing [sent. 18361 len. 8]: Agnes could care for no other . '
Parsing [sent. 18362 len. 16]: My aunt sat musing for a little while , with her chin upon her hand .
Parsing [sent. 18363 len. 22]: Slowly raising her eyes to mine , she said : ' I suspect she has an attachment , Trot . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18364 len. 5]: A prosperous one ? '
Parsing [sent. 18365 len. 17]: said I. ` Trot , ' returned my aunt gravely , ' I ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 18366 len. 11]: I have no right to tell you even so much .
Parsing [sent. 18367 len. 14]: She has never confided it to me , but I suspect it . '
Parsing [sent. 18368 len. 33]: She looked so attentively and anxiously at me -LRB- I even saw her tremble -RRB- , that I felt now , more than ever , that she had followed my late thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 18369 len. 26]: I summoned all the resolutions I had made , in all those many days and nights , and all those many conflicts of my heart .
Parsing [sent. 18370 len. 34]: ` If it should be so , ' I began , ` and I hope it is - ' ' I do n't know that it is , ' said my aunt curtly .
Parsing [sent. 18371 len. 10]: ` You must not be ruled by my suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 18372 len. 6]: You must keep them secret .
Parsing [sent. 18373 len. 7]: They are very slight , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 18374 len. 8]: I have no right to speak . '
Parsing [sent. 18375 len. 22]: ` If it should be so , ' I repeated , ` Agnes will tell me at her own good time .
Parsing [sent. 18376 len. 22]: A sister to whom I have confided so much , aunt , will not be reluctant to confide in me . '
Parsing [sent. 18377 len. 26]: My aunt withdrew her eyes from mine , as slowly as she had turned them upon me ; and covered them thoughtfully with her hand .
Parsing [sent. 18378 len. 35]: By and by she put her other hand on my shoulder ; and so we both sat , looking into the past , without saying another word , until we parted for the night .
Parsing [sent. 18379 len. 17]: I rode away , early in the morning , for the scene of my old school-days .
Parsing [sent. 18380 len. 36]: I can not say that I was yet quite happy , in the hope that I was gaining a victory over myself ; even in the prospect of so soon looking on her face again .
Parsing [sent. 18381 len. 26]: The well-remembered ground was soon traversed , and I came into the quiet streets , where every stone was a boy 's book to me .
Parsing [sent. 18382 len. 20]: I went on foot to the old house , and went away with a heart too full to enter .
Parsing [sent. 18383 len. 49]: I returned ; and looking , as I passed , through the low window of the turret-room where first Uriah Heep , and afterwards Mr. Micawber , had been wont to sit , saw that it was a little parlour now , and that there was no office .
Parsing [sent. 18384 len. 26]: Otherwise the staid old house was , as to its cleanliness and order , still just as it had been when I first saw it .
Parsing [sent. 18385 len. 53]: I requested the new maid who admitted me , to tell Miss Wickfield that a gentleman who waited on her from a friend abroad , was there ; and I was shown up the grave old staircase -LRB- cautioned of the steps I knew so well -RRB- , into the unchanged drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 18386 len. 41]: The books that Agnes and I had read together , were on their shelves ; and the desk where I had laboured at my lessons , many a night , stood yet at the same old corner of the table .
Parsing [sent. 18387 len. 18]: All the little changes that had crept in when the Heeps were there , were changed again .
Parsing [sent. 18388 len. 13]: Everything was as it used to be , in the happy time .
Parsing [sent. 18389 len. 96]: I stood in a window , and looked across the ancient street at the opposite houses , recalling how I had watched them on wet afternoons , when I first came there ; and how I had used to speculate about the people who appeared at any of the windows , and had followed them with my eyes up and down stairs , while women went clicking along the pavement in pattens , and the dull rain fell in slanting lines , and poured out of the water-spout yonder , and flowed into the road .
Parsing [sent. 18390 len. 83]: The feeling with which I used to watch the tramps , as they came into the town on those wet evenings , at dusk , and limped past , with their bundles drooping over their shoulders at the ends of sticks , came freshly back to me ; fraught , as then , with the smell of damp earth , and wet leaves and briar , and the sensation of the very airs that blew upon me in my own toilsome journey .
Parsing [sent. 18391 len. 16]: The opening of the little door in the panelled wall made me start and turn .
Parsing [sent. 18392 len. 12]: Her beautiful serene eyes met mine as she came towards me .
Parsing [sent. 18393 len. 18]: She stopped and laid her hand upon her bosom , and I caught her in my arms .
Parsing [sent. 18394 len. 3]: ` Agnes !
Parsing [sent. 18395 len. 4]: my dear girl !
Parsing [sent. 18396 len. 9]: I have come too suddenly upon you . '
Parsing [sent. 18397 len. 5]: ` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 18398 len. 11]: I am so rejoiced to see you , Trotwood ! '
Parsing [sent. 18399 len. 18]: ` Dear Agnes , the happiness it is to me , to see you once again ! '
Parsing [sent. 18400 len. 19]: I folded her to my heart , and , for a little while , we were both silent .
Parsing [sent. 18401 len. 32]: Presently we sat down , side by side ; and her angel-face was turned upon me with the welcome I had dreamed of , waking and sleeping , for whole years .
Parsing [sent. 18402 len. 41]: She was so true , she was so beautiful , she was so good , -- I owed her so much gratitude , she was so dear to me , that I could find no utterance for what I felt .
Parsing [sent. 18403 len. 40]: I tried to bless her , tried to thank her , tried to tell her -LRB- as I had often done in letters -RRB- what an influence she had upon me ; but all my efforts were in vain .
Parsing [sent. 18404 len. 7]: My love and joy were dumb .
Parsing [sent. 18405 len. 47]: With her own sweet tranquillity , she calmed my agitation ; led me back to the time of our parting ; spoke to me of Emily , whom she had visited , in secret , many times ; spoke to me tenderly of Dora 's grave .
Parsing [sent. 18406 len. 47]: With the unerring instinct of her noble heart , she touched the chords of my memory so softly and harmoniously , that not one jarred within me ; I could listen to the sorrowful , distant music , and desire to shrink from nothing it awoke .
Parsing [sent. 18407 len. 23]: How could I , when , blended with it all , was her dear self , the better angel of my life ?
Parsing [sent. 18408 len. 14]: ` And you , Agnes , ' I said , by and by .
Parsing [sent. 18409 len. 6]: ` Tell me of yourself .
Parsing [sent. 18410 len. 19]: You have hardly ever told me of your own life , in all this lapse of time ! '
Parsing [sent. 18411 len. 7]: ` What should I tell ? '
Parsing [sent. 18412 len. 8]: she answered , with her radiant smile .
Parsing [sent. 18413 len. 5]: ` Papa is well .
Parsing [sent. 18414 len. 35]: You see us here , quiet in our own home ; our anxieties set at rest , our home restored to us ; and knowing that , dear Trotwood , you know all . '
Parsing [sent. 18415 len. 6]: ` All , Agnes ? '
Parsing [sent. 18416 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 18417 len. 13]: She looked at me , with some fluttering wonder in her face .
Parsing [sent. 18418 len. 9]: ` Is there nothing else , Sister ? '
Parsing [sent. 18419 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 18420 len. 15]: Her colour , which had just now faded , returned , and faded again .
Parsing [sent. 18421 len. 16]: She smiled ; with a quiet sadness , I thought ; and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 18422 len. 43]: I had sought to lead her to what my aunt had hinted at ; for , sharply painful to me as it must be to receive that confidence , I was to discipline my heart , and do my duty to her .
Parsing [sent. 18423 len. 16]: I saw , however , that she was uneasy , and I let it pass .
Parsing [sent. 18424 len. 11]: ` You have much to do , dear Agnes ? '
Parsing [sent. 18425 len. 6]: ` With my school ? '
Parsing [sent. 18426 len. 13]: said she , looking up again , in all her bright composure .
Parsing [sent. 18427 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 18428 len. 9]: It is laborious , is it not ? '
Parsing [sent. 18429 len. 27]: ` The labour is so pleasant , ' she returned , ` that it is scarcely grateful in me to call it by that name . '
Parsing [sent. 18430 len. 12]: ` Nothing good is difficult to you , ' said I .
Parsing [sent. 18431 len. 25]: Her colour came and went once more ; and once more , as she bent her head , I saw the same sad smile .
Parsing [sent. 18432 len. 22]: ` You will wait and see papa , ' said Agnes , cheerfully , ` and pass the day with us ?
Parsing [sent. 18433 len. 9]: Perhaps you will sleep in your own room ?
Parsing [sent. 18434 len. 7]: We always call it yours . '
Parsing [sent. 18435 len. 29]: I could not do that , having promised to ride back to my aunt 's at night ; but I would pass the day there , joyfully . '
Parsing [sent. 18436 len. 30]: I must be a prisoner for a little while , ' said Agnes , ` but here are the old books , Trotwood , and the old music . '
Parsing [sent. 18437 len. 23]: ` Even the old flowers are here , ' said I , looking round ; ` or the old kinds . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18438 len. 32]: I have found a pleasure , ' returned Agnes , smiling , ` while you have been absent , in keeping everything as it used to be when we were children .
Parsing [sent. 18439 len. 11]: For we were very happy then , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 18440 len. 7]: ` Heaven knows we were ! '
Parsing [sent. 18441 len. 35]: said I. ` And every little thing that has reminded me of my brother , ' said Agnes , with her cordial eyes turned cheerfully upon me , ` has been a welcome companion .
Parsing [sent. 18442 len. 30]: Even this , ' showing me the basket-trifle , full of keys , still hanging at her side , ` seems to jingle a kind of old tune ! '
Parsing [sent. 18443 len. 16]: She smiled again , and went out at the door by which she had come .
Parsing [sent. 18444 len. 13]: It was for me to guard this sisterly affection with religious care .
Parsing [sent. 18445 len. 15]: It was all that I had left myself , and it was a treasure .
Parsing [sent. 18446 len. 33]: If I once shook the foundations of the sacred confidence and usage , in virtue of which it was given to me , it was lost , and could never be recovered .
Parsing [sent. 18447 len. 7]: I set this steadily before myself .
Parsing [sent. 18448 len. 16]: The better I loved her , the more it behoved me never to forget it .
Parsing [sent. 18449 len. 70]: I walked through the streets ; and , once more seeing my old adversary the butcher -- now a constable , with his staff hanging up in the shop -- went down to look at the place where I had fought him ; and there meditated on Miss Shepherd and the eldest Miss Larkins , and all the idle loves and likings , and dislikings , of that time .
Parsing [sent. 18450 len. 24]: Nothing seemed to have survived that time but Agnes ; and she , ever a star above me , was brighter and higher .
Parsing [sent. 18451 len. 35]: When I returned , Mr. Wickfield had come home , from a garden he had , a couple of miles or so out of town , where he now employed himself almost every day .
Parsing [sent. 18452 len. 10]: I found him as my aunt had described him .
Parsing [sent. 18453 len. 26]: We sat down to dinner , with some half-dozen little girls ; and he seemed but the shadow of his handsome picture on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 18454 len. 21]: The tranquillity and peace belonging , of old , to that quiet ground in my memory , pervaded it again .
Parsing [sent. 18455 len. 33]: When dinner was done , Mr. Wickfield taking no wine , and I desiring none , we went up-stairs ; where Agnes and her little charges sang and played , and worked .
Parsing [sent. 18456 len. 19]: After tea the children left us ; and we three sat together , talking of the bygone days .
Parsing [sent. 18457 len. 37]: ` My part in them , ' said Mr. Wickfield , shaking his white head , ` has much matter for regret -- for deep regret , and deep contrition , Trotwood , you well know .
Parsing [sent. 18458 len. 15]: But I would not cancel it , if it were in my power . '
Parsing [sent. 18459 len. 14]: I could readily believe that , looking at the face beside him . '
Parsing [sent. 18460 len. 33]: I should cancel with it , ' he pursued , ` such patience and devotion , such fidelity , such a child 's love , as I must not forget , no !
Parsing [sent. 18461 len. 7]: even to forget myself . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18462 len. 12]: I understand you , sir , ' I softly said . '
Parsing [sent. 18463 len. 14]: I hold it -- I have always held it -- in veneration . '
Parsing [sent. 18464 len. 33]: ` But no one knows , not even you , ' he returned , ` how much she has done , how much she has undergone , how hard she has striven .
Parsing [sent. 18465 len. 4]: Dear Agnes ! '
Parsing [sent. 18466 len. 21]: She had put her hand entreatingly on his arm , to stop him ; and was very , very pale .
Parsing [sent. 18467 len. 6]: ` Well , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 18468 len. 35]: he said with a sigh , dismissing , as I then saw , some trial she had borne , or was yet to bear , in connexion with what my aunt had told me .
Parsing [sent. 18469 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 18470 len. 12]: I have never told you , Trotwood , of her mother .
Parsing [sent. 18471 len. 4]: Has anyone ? '
Parsing [sent. 18472 len. 6]: ` Never , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 18473 len. 13]: ` It 's not much -- though it was much to suffer .
Parsing [sent. 18474 len. 16]: She married me in opposition to her father 's wish , and he renounced her .
Parsing [sent. 18475 len. 15]: She prayed him to forgive her , before my Agnes came into this world .
Parsing [sent. 18476 len. 15]: He was a very hard man , and her mother had long been dead .
Parsing [sent. 18477 len. 4]: He repulsed her .
Parsing [sent. 18478 len. 6]: He broke her heart . '
Parsing [sent. 18479 len. 14]: Agnes leaned upon his shoulder , and stole her arm about his neck .
Parsing [sent. 18480 len. 19]: ` She had an affectionate and gentle heart , ' he said ; ` and it was broken .
Parsing [sent. 18481 len. 8]: I knew its tender nature very well .
Parsing [sent. 18482 len. 9]: No one could , if I did not .
Parsing [sent. 18483 len. 10]: She loved me dearly , but was never happy .
Parsing [sent. 18484 len. 40]: She was always labouring , in secret , under this distress ; and being delicate and downcast at the time of his last repulse -- for it was not the first , by many -- pined away and died .
Parsing [sent. 18485 len. 25]: She left me Agnes , two weeks old ; and the grey hair that you recollect me with , when you first came . '
Parsing [sent. 18486 len. 7]: He kissed Agnes on her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 18487 len. 20]: ` My love for my dear child was a diseased love , but my mind was all unhealthy then .
Parsing [sent. 18488 len. 7]: I say no more of that .
Parsing [sent. 18489 len. 18]: I am not speaking of myself , Trotwood , but of her mother , and of her .
Parsing [sent. 18490 len. 26]: If I give you any clue to what I am , or to what I have been , you will unravel it , I know .
Parsing [sent. 18491 len. 9]: What Agnes is , I need not say .
Parsing [sent. 18492 len. 36]: I have always read something of her poor mother 's story , in her character ; and so I tell it you tonight , when we three are again together , after such great changes .
Parsing [sent. 18493 len. 7]: I have told it all . '
Parsing [sent. 18494 len. 24]: His bowed head , and her angel-face and filial duty , derived a more pathetic meaning from it than they had had before .
Parsing [sent. 18495 len. 23]: If I had wanted anything by which to mark this night of our re-union , I should have found it in this .
Parsing [sent. 18496 len. 35]: Agnes rose up from her father 's side , before long ; and going softly to her piano , played some of the old airs to which we had often listened in that place .
Parsing [sent. 18497 len. 11]: ` Have you any intention of going away again ? '
Parsing [sent. 18498 len. 10]: Agnes asked me , as I was standing by .
Parsing [sent. 18499 len. 11]: ` What does my sister say to that ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18500 len. 5]: I hope not . '
Parsing [sent. 18501 len. 12]: ` Then I have no such intention , Agnes . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18502 len. 19]: I think you ought not , Trotwood , since you ask me , ' she said , mildly .
Parsing [sent. 18503 len. 36]: ` Your growing reputation and success enlarge your power of doing good ; and if I could spare my brother , ' with her eyes upon me , ` perhaps the time could not . '
Parsing [sent. 18504 len. 12]: ` What I am , you have made me , Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 18505 len. 7]: You should know best . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18506 len. 7]: I made you , Trotwood ? '
Parsing [sent. 18507 len. 3]: ` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 18508 len. 7]: Agnes , my dear girl ! '
Parsing [sent. 18509 len. 8]: I said , bending over her . '
Parsing [sent. 18510 len. 22]: I tried to tell you , when we met today , something that has been in my thoughts since Dora died .
Parsing [sent. 18511 len. 20]: You remember , when you came down to me in our little room -- pointing upward , Agnes ? '
Parsing [sent. 18512 len. 6]: ` Oh , Trotwood ! '
Parsing [sent. 18513 len. 9]: she returned , her eyes filled with tears .
Parsing [sent. 18514 len. 11]: ` So loving , so confiding , and so young !
Parsing [sent. 18515 len. 6]: Can I ever forget ? '
Parsing [sent. 18516 len. 22]: ` As you were then , my sister , I have often thought since , you have ever been to me .
Parsing [sent. 18517 len. 21]: Ever pointing upward , Agnes ; ever leading me to something better ; ever directing me to higher things ! '
Parsing [sent. 18518 len. 17]: She only shook her head ; through her tears I saw the same sad quiet smile .
Parsing [sent. 18519 len. 30]: ` And I am so grateful to you for it , Agnes , so bound to you , that there is no name for the affection of my heart .
Parsing [sent. 18520 len. 44]: I want you to know , yet do n't know how to tell you , that all my life long I shall look up to you , and be guided by you , as I have been through the darkness that is past .
Parsing [sent. 18521 len. 38]: Whatever betides , whatever new ties you may form , whatever changes may come between us , I shall always look to you , and love you , as I do now , and have always done .
Parsing [sent. 18522 len. 15]: You will always be my solace and resource , as you have always been .
Parsing [sent. 18523 len. 20]: Until I die , my dearest sister , I shall see you always before me , pointing upward ! '
Parsing [sent. 18524 len. 32]: She put her hand in mine , and told me she was proud of me , and of what I said ; although I praised her very far beyond her worth .
Parsing [sent. 18525 len. 15]: Then she went on softly playing , but without removing her eyes from me .
Parsing [sent. 18526 len. 49]: ` Do you know , what I have heard tonight , Agnes , ' said I , strangely seems to be a part of the feeling with which I regarded you when I saw you first -- with which I sat beside you in my rough school-days ? '
Parsing [sent. 18527 len. 23]: ` You knew I had no mother , ' she replied with a smile , ` and felt kindly towards me . '
Parsing [sent. 18528 len. 58]: ` More than that , Agnes , I knew , almost as if I had known this story , that there was something inexplicably gentle and softened , surrounding you ; something that might have been sorrowful in someone else -LRB- as I can now understand it was -RRB- , but was not so in you . '
Parsing [sent. 18529 len. 10]: She softly played on , looking at me still .
Parsing [sent. 18530 len. 13]: ` Will you laugh at my cherishing such fancies , Agnes ? '
Parsing [sent. 18531 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 18532 len. 38]: ` Or at my saying that I really believe I felt , even then , that you could be faithfully affectionate against all discouragement , and never cease to be so , until you ceased to live ?
Parsing [sent. 18533 len. 10]: -- Will you laugh at such a dream ? '
Parsing [sent. 18534 len. 5]: ` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 18535 len. 5]: Oh , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 18536 len. 41]: For an instant , a distressful shadow crossed her face ; but , even in the start it gave me , it was gone ; and she was playing on , and looking at me with her own calm smile .
Parsing [sent. 18537 len. 31]: As I rode back in the lonely night , the wind going by me like a restless memory , I thought of this , and feared she was not happy .
Parsing [sent. 18538 len. 76]: I was not happy ; but , thus far , I had faithfully set the seal upon the Past , and , thinking of her , pointing upward , thought of her as pointing to that sky above me , where , in the mystery to come , I might yet love her with a love unknown on earth , and tell her what the strife had been within me when I loved her here .
Parsing [sent. 18539 len. 78]: Chapter 61 I Am Shown Two Interesting Penitents For a time -- at all events until my book should be completed , which would be the work of several months -- I took up my abode in my aunt 's house at Dover ; and there , sitting in the window from which I had looked out at the moon upon the sea , when that roof first gave me shelter , I quietly pursued my task .
Parsing [sent. 18540 len. 45]: In pursuance of my intention of referring to my own fictions only when their course should incidentally connect itself with the progress of my story , I do not enter on the aspirations , the delights , anxieties , and triumphs of my art .
Parsing [sent. 18541 len. 27]: That I truly devoted myself to it with my strongest earnestness , and bestowed upon it every energy of my soul , I have already said .
Parsing [sent. 18542 len. 17]: If the books I have written be of any worth , they will supply the rest .
Parsing [sent. 18543 len. 20]: I shall otherwise have written to poor purpose , and the rest will be of interest to no one .
Parsing [sent. 18544 len. 27]: Occasionally , I went to London ; to lose myself in the swarm of life there , or to consult with Traddles on some business point .
Parsing [sent. 18545 len. 22]: He had managed for me , in my absence , with the soundest judgement ; and my worldly affairs were prospering .
Parsing [sent. 18546 len. 46]: As my notoriety began to bring upon me an enormous quantity of letters from people of whom I had no knowledge -- chiefly about nothing , and extremely difficult to answer -- I agreed with Traddles to have my name painted up on his door .
Parsing [sent. 18547 len. 36]: There , the devoted postman on that beat delivered bushels of letters for me ; and there , at intervals , I laboured through them , like a Home Secretary of State without the salary .
Parsing [sent. 18548 len. 61]: Among this correspondence , there dropped in , every now and then , an obliging proposal from one of the numerous outsiders always lurking about the Commons , to practise under cover of my name -LRB- if I would take the necessary steps remaining to make a proctor of myself -RRB- , and pay me a percentage on the profits .
Parsing [sent. 18549 len. 37]: But I declined these offers ; being already aware that there were plenty of such covert practitioners in existence , and considering the Commons quite bad enough , without my doing anything to make it worse .
Parsing [sent. 18550 len. 60]: The girls had gone home , when my name burst into bloom on Traddles 's door ; and the sharp boy looked , all day , as if he had never heard of Sophy , shut up in a back room , glancing down from her work into a sooty little strip of garden with a pump in it .
Parsing [sent. 18551 len. 39]: But there I always found her , the same bright housewife ; often humming her Devonshire ballads when no strange foot was coming up the stairs , and blunting the sharp boy in his official closet with melody .
Parsing [sent. 18552 len. 35]: I wondered , at first , why I so often found Sophy writing in a copy-book ; and why she always shut it up when I appeared , and hurried it into the table-drawer .
Parsing [sent. 18553 len. 7]: But the secret soon came out .
Parsing [sent. 18554 len. 35]: One day , Traddles -LRB- who had just come home through the drizzling sleet from Court -RRB- took a paper out of his desk , and asked me what I thought of that handwriting ?
Parsing [sent. 18555 len. 9]: ` Oh , DO N'T , Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 18556 len. 12]: cried Sophy , who was warming his slippers before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 18557 len. 17]: ` My dear , ' returned Tom , in a delighted state , ` why not ?
Parsing [sent. 18558 len. 11]: What do you say to that writing , Copperfield ? '
Parsing [sent. 18559 len. 25]: ` It 's extraordinarily legal and formal , ' said I. ' I do n't think I ever saw such a stiff hand . '
Parsing [sent. 18560 len. 12]: ` Not like a lady 's hand , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 18561 len. 4]: said Traddles . '
Parsing [sent. 18562 len. 5]: A lady 's ! '
Parsing [sent. 18563 len. 3]: I repeated .
Parsing [sent. 18564 len. 13]: ` Bricks and mortar are more like a lady 's hand ! '
Parsing [sent. 18565 len. 62]: Traddles broke into a rapturous laugh , and informed me that it was Sophy 's writing ; that Sophy had vowed and declared he would need a copying-clerk soon , and she would be that clerk ; that she had acquired this hand from a pattern ; and that she could throw off -- I forget how many folios an hour .
Parsing [sent. 18566 len. 33]: Sophy was very much confused by my being told all this , and said that when ` Tom ' was made a judge he would n't be so ready to proclaim it .
Parsing [sent. 18567 len. 21]: Which ` Tom ' denied ; averring that he should always be equally proud of it , under all circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 18568 len. 16]: ` What a thoroughly good and charming wife she is , my dear Traddles ! '
Parsing [sent. 18569 len. 11]: said I , when she had gone away , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 18570 len. 21]: ` My dear Copperfield , ' returned Traddles , ` she is , without any exception , the dearest girl !
Parsing [sent. 18571 len. 24]: The way she manages this place ; her punctuality , domestic knowledge , economy , and order ; her cheerfulness , Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 18572 len. 11]: ` Indeed , you have reason to commend her ! '
Parsing [sent. 18573 len. 3]: I returned .
Parsing [sent. 18574 len. 7]: ` You are a happy fellow .
Parsing [sent. 18575 len. 21]: I believe you make yourselves , and each other , two of the happiest people in the world . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18576 len. 16]: I am sure we ARE two of the happiest people , ' returned Traddles . '
Parsing [sent. 18577 len. 8]: I admit that , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 18578 len. 107]: Bless my soul , when I see her getting up by candle-light on these dark mornings , busying herself in the day 's arrangements , going out to market before the clerks come into the Inn , caring for no weather , devising the most capital little dinners out of the plainest materials , making puddings and pies , keeping everything in its right place , always so neat and ornamental herself , sitting up at night with me if it 's ever so late , sweet-tempered and encouraging always , and all for me , I positively sometimes ca n't believe it , Copperfield ! '
Parsing [sent. 18579 len. 28]: He was tender of the very slippers she had been warming , as he put them on , and stretched his feet enjoyingly upon the fender . '
Parsing [sent. 18580 len. 12]: I positively sometimes ca n't believe it , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 18581 len. 5]: ` Then our pleasures !
Parsing [sent. 18582 len. 13]: Dear me , they are inexpensive , but they are quite wonderful !
Parsing [sent. 18583 len. 33]: When we are at home here , of an evening , and shut the outer door , and draw those curtains -- which she made -- where could we be more snug ?
Parsing [sent. 18584 len. 24]: When it 's fine , and we go out for a walk in the evening , the streets abound in enjoyment for us .
Parsing [sent. 18585 len. 122]: We look into the glittering windows of the jewellers ' shops ; and I show Sophy which of the diamond-eyed serpents , coiled up on white satin rising grounds , I would give her if I could afford it ; and Sophy shows me which of the gold watches that are capped and jewelled and engine-turned , and possessed of the horizontal lever - escape-movement , and all sorts of things , she would buy for me if she could afford it ; and we pick out the spoons and forks , fish-slices , butter-knives , and sugar-tongs , we should both prefer if we could both afford it ; and really we go away as if we had got them !
Parsing [sent. 18586 len. 42]: Then , when we stroll into the squares , and great streets , and see a house to let , sometimes we look up at it , and say , how would THAT do , if I was made a judge ?
Parsing [sent. 18587 len. 45]: And we parcel it out -- such a room for us , such rooms for the girls , and so forth ; until we settle to our satisfaction that it would do , or it would n't do , as the case may be .
Parsing [sent. 18588 len. 49]: Sometimes , we go at half-price to the pit of the theatre - the very smell of which is cheap , in my opinion , at the money -- and there we thoroughly enjoy the play : which Sophy believes every word of , and so do I .
Parsing [sent. 18589 len. 45]: In walking home , perhaps we buy a little bit of something at a cook 's - shop , or a little lobster at the fishmongers , and bring it here , and make a splendid supper , chatting about what we have seen .
Parsing [sent. 18590 len. 20]: Now , you know , Copperfield , if I was Lord Chancellor , we could n't do this ! '
Parsing [sent. 18591 len. 26]: ` You would do something , whatever you were , my dear Traddles , ' thought I , ` that would be pleasant and amiable .
Parsing [sent. 18592 len. 21]: And by the way , ' I said aloud , ' I suppose you never draw any skeletons now ? '
Parsing [sent. 18593 len. 26]: ` Really , ' replied Traddles , laughing , and reddening , ' I ca n't wholly deny that I do , my dear Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 18594 len. 39]: For being in one of the back rows of the King 's Bench the other day , with a pen in my hand , the fancy came into my head to try how I had preserved that accomplishment .
Parsing [sent. 18595 len. 21]: And I am afraid there 's a skeleton -- in a wig -- on the ledge of the desk . '
Parsing [sent. 18596 len. 33]: After we had both laughed heartily , Traddles wound up by looking with a smile at the fire , and saying , in his forgiving way , ` Old Creakle ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 18597 len. 43]: I have a letter from that old -- Rascal here , ' said I. For I never was less disposed to forgive him the way he used to batter Traddles , than when I saw Traddles so ready to forgive him himself .
Parsing [sent. 18598 len. 7]: ` From Creakle the schoolmaster ? '
Parsing [sent. 18599 len. 3]: exclaimed Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 18600 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 18601 len. 43]: ` Among the persons who are attracted to me in my rising fame and fortune , ' said I , looking over my letters , ` and who discover that they were always much attached to me , is the self-same Creakle .
Parsing [sent. 18602 len. 9]: He is not a schoolmaster now , Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 18603 len. 4]: He is retired .
Parsing [sent. 18604 len. 7]: He is a Middlesex Magistrate . '
Parsing [sent. 18605 len. 18]: I thought Traddles might be surprised to hear it , but he was not so at all .
Parsing [sent. 18606 len. 14]: ` How do you suppose he comes to be a Middlesex Magistrate ? '
Parsing [sent. 18607 len. 8]: said I. ` Oh dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 18608 len. 14]: replied Traddles , ` it would be very difficult to answer that question .
Parsing [sent. 18609 len. 46]: Perhaps he voted for somebody , or lent money to somebody , or bought something of somebody , or otherwise obliged somebody , or jobbed for somebody , who knew somebody who got the lieutenant of the county to nominate him for the commission . '
Parsing [sent. 18610 len. 65]: ` On the commission he is , at any rate , ' said I. ` And he writes to me here , that he will be glad to show me , in operation , the only true system of prison discipline ; the only unchallengeable way of making sincere and lasting converts and penitents -- which , you know , is by solitary confinement .
Parsing [sent. 18611 len. 6]: What do you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 18612 len. 6]: ` To the system ? '
Parsing [sent. 18613 len. 6]: inquired Traddles , looking grave .
Parsing [sent. 18614 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 18615 len. 14]: To my accepting the offer , and your going with me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18616 len. 9]: I do n't object , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 18617 len. 9]: ` Then I 'll write to say so .
Parsing [sent. 18618 len. 36]: You remember -LRB- to say nothing of our treatment -RRB- this same Creakle turning his son out of doors , I suppose , and the life he used to lead his wife and daughter ? '
Parsing [sent. 18619 len. 7]: ` Perfectly , ' said Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 18620 len. 52]: ` Yet , if you 'll read his letter , you 'll find he is the tenderest of men to prisoners convicted of the whole calendar of felonies , ' said I ; ` though I ca n't find that his tenderness extends to any other class of created beings . '
Parsing [sent. 18621 len. 12]: Traddles shrugged his shoulders , and was not at all surprised .
Parsing [sent. 18622 len. 27]: I had not expected him to be , and was not surprised myself ; or my observation of similar practical satires would have been but scanty .
Parsing [sent. 18623 len. 18]: We arranged the time of our visit , and I wrote accordingly to Mr. Creakle that evening .
Parsing [sent. 18624 len. 30]: On the appointed day -- I think it was the next day , but no matter - Traddles and I repaired to the prison where Mr. Creakle was powerful .
Parsing [sent. 18625 len. 14]: It was an immense and solid building , erected at a vast expense .
Parsing [sent. 18626 len. 60]: I could not help thinking , as we approached the gate , what an uproar would have been made in the country , if any deluded man had proposed to spend one half the money it had cost , on the erection of an industrial school for the young , or a house of refuge for the deserving old .
Parsing [sent. 18627 len. 56]: In an office that might have been on the ground-floor of the Tower of Babel , it was so massively constructed , we were presented to our old schoolmaster ; who was one of a group , composed of two or three of the busier sort of magistrates , and some visitors they had brought .
Parsing [sent. 18628 len. 23]: He received me , like a man who had formed my mind in bygone years , and had always loved me tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 18629 len. 33]: On my introducing Traddles , Mr. Creakle expressed , in like manner , but in an inferior degree , that he had always been Traddles 's guide , philosopher , and friend .
Parsing [sent. 18630 len. 15]: Our venerable instructor was a great deal older , and not improved in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 18631 len. 19]: His face was as fiery as ever ; his eyes were as small , and rather deeper set .
Parsing [sent. 18632 len. 34]: The scanty , wet-looking grey hair , by which I remembered him , was almost gone ; and the thick veins in his bald head were none the more agreeable to look at .
Parsing [sent. 18633 len. 54]: After some conversation among these gentlemen , from which I might have supposed that there was nothing in the world to be legitimately taken into account but the supreme comfort of prisoners , at any expense , and nothing on the wide earth to be done outside prison-doors , we began our inspection .
Parsing [sent. 18634 len. 47]: It being then just dinner-time , we went , first into the great kitchen , where every prisoner 's dinner was in course of being set out separately -LRB- to be handed to him in his cell -RRB- , with the regularity and precision of clock-work .
Parsing [sent. 18635 len. 72]: I said aside , to Traddles , that I wondered whether it occurred to anybody , that there was a striking contrast between these plentiful repasts of choice quality , and the dinners , not to say of paupers , but of soldiers , sailors , labourers , the great bulk of the honest , working community ; of whom not one man in five hundred ever dined half so well .
Parsing [sent. 18636 len. 55]: But I learned that the ` system ' required high living ; and , in short , to dispose of the system , once for all , I found that on that head and on all others , ` the system ' put an end to all doubts , and disposed of all anomalies .
Parsing [sent. 18637 len. 22]: Nobody appeared to have the least idea that there was any other system , but THE system , to be considered .
Parsing [sent. 18638 len. 35]: As we were going through some of the magnificent passages , I inquired of Mr. Creakle and his friends what were supposed to be the main advantages of this all-governing and universally over-riding system ?
Parsing [sent. 18639 len. 44]: I found them to be the perfect isolation of prisoners -- so that no one man in confinement there , knew anything about another ; and the reduction of prisoners to a wholesome state of mind , leading to sincere contrition and repentance .
Parsing [sent. 18640 len. 74]: Now , it struck me , when we began to visit individuals in their cells , and to traverse the passages in which those cells were , and to have the manner of the going to chapel and so forth , explained to us , that there was a strong probability of the prisoners knowing a good deal about each other , and of their carrying on a pretty complete system of intercourse .
Parsing [sent. 18641 len. 52]: This , at the time I write , has been proved , I believe , to be the case ; but , as it would have been flat blasphemy against the system to have hinted such a doubt then , I looked out for the penitence as diligently as I could .
Parsing [sent. 18642 len. 9]: And here again , I had great misgivings .
Parsing [sent. 18643 len. 35]: I found as prevalent a fashion in the form of the penitence , as I had left outside in the forms of the coats and waistcoats in the windows of the tailors ' shops .
Parsing [sent. 18644 len. 29]: I found a vast amount of profession , varying very little in character : varying very little -LRB- which I thought exceedingly suspicious -RRB- , even in words .
Parsing [sent. 18645 len. 31]: I found a great many foxes , disparaging whole vineyards of inaccessible grapes ; but I found very few foxes whom I would have trusted within reach of a bunch .
Parsing [sent. 18646 len. 66]: Above all , I found that the most professing men were the greatest objects of interest ; and that their conceit , their vanity , their want of excitement , and their love of deception -LRB- which many of them possessed to an almost incredible extent , as their histories showed -RRB- , all prompted to these professions , and were all gratified by them .
Parsing [sent. 18647 len. 53]: However , I heard so repeatedly , in the course of our goings to and fro , of a certain Number Twenty Seven , who was the Favourite , and who really appeared to be a Model Prisoner , that I resolved to suspend my judgement until I should see Twenty Seven .
Parsing [sent. 18648 len. 33]: Twenty Eight , I understood , was also a bright particular star ; but it was his misfortune to have his glory a little dimmed by the extraordinary lustre of Twenty Seven .
Parsing [sent. 18649 len. 50]: I heard so much of Twenty Seven , of his pious admonitions to everybody around him , and of the beautiful letters he constantly wrote to his mother -LRB- whom he seemed to consider in a very bad way -RRB- , that I became quite impatient to see him .
Parsing [sent. 18650 len. 22]: I had to restrain my impatience for some time , on account of Twenty Seven being reserved for a concluding effect .
Parsing [sent. 18651 len. 46]: But , at last , we came to the door of his cell ; and Mr. Creakle , looking through a little hole in it , reported to us , in a state of the greatest admiration , that he was reading a Hymn Book .
Parsing [sent. 18652 len. 33]: There was such a rush of heads immediately , to see Number Twenty Seven reading his Hymn Book , that the little hole was blocked up , six or seven heads deep .
Parsing [sent. 18653 len. 43]: To remedy this inconvenience , and give us an opportunity of conversing with Twenty Seven in all his purity , Mr. Creakle directed the door of the cell to be unlocked , and Twenty Seven to be invited out into the passage .
Parsing [sent. 18654 len. 28]: This was done ; and whom should Traddles and I then behold , to our amazement , in this converted Number Twenty Seven , but Uriah Heep !
Parsing [sent. 18655 len. 28]: He knew us directly ; and said , as he came out -- with the old writhe , -- ` How do you do , Mr. Copperfield ?
Parsing [sent. 18656 len. 9]: How do you do , Mr. Traddles ? '
Parsing [sent. 18657 len. 10]: This recognition caused a general admiration in the party .
Parsing [sent. 18658 len. 19]: I rather thought that everyone was struck by his not being proud , and taking notice of us .
Parsing [sent. 18659 len. 15]: ` Well , Twenty Seven , ' said Mr. Creakle , mournfully admiring him .
Parsing [sent. 18660 len. 10]: ` How do you find yourself today ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18661 len. 8]: I am very umble , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 18662 len. 4]: replied Uriah Heep .
Parsing [sent. 18663 len. 14]: ` You are always so , Twenty Seven , ' said Mr. Creakle .
Parsing [sent. 18664 len. 17]: Here , another gentleman asked , with extreme anxiety : ` Are you quite comfortable ? '
Parsing [sent. 18665 len. 10]: ` Yes , I thank you , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 18666 len. 9]: said Uriah Heep , looking in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 18667 len. 12]: ` Far more comfortable here , than ever I was outside .
Parsing [sent. 18668 len. 9]: I see my follies , now , sir .
Parsing [sent. 18669 len. 8]: That 's what makes me comfortable . '
Parsing [sent. 18670 len. 31]: Several gentlemen were much affected ; and a third questioner , forcing himself to the front , inquired with extreme feeling : ` How do you find the beef ? '
Parsing [sent. 18671 len. 37]: ` Thank you , sir , ' replied Uriah , glancing in the new direction of this voice , ` it was tougher yesterday than I could wish ; but it 's my duty to bear .
Parsing [sent. 18672 len. 30]: I have committed follies , gentlemen , ' said Uriah , looking round with a meek smile , ` and I ought to bear the consequences without repining . '
Parsing [sent. 18673 len. 71]: A murmur , partly of gratification at Twenty Seven 's celestial state of mind , and partly of indignation against the Contractor who had given him any cause of complaint -LRB- a note of which was immediately made by Mr. Creakle -RRB- , having subsided , Twenty Seven stood in the midst of us , as if he felt himself the principal object of merit in a highly meritorious museum .
Parsing [sent. 18674 len. 28]: That we , the neophytes , might have an excess of light shining upon us all at once , orders were given to let out Twenty Eight .
Parsing [sent. 18675 len. 28]: I had been so much astonished already , that I only felt a kind of resigned wonder when Mr. Littimer walked forth , reading a good book !
Parsing [sent. 18676 len. 31]: ` Twenty Eight , ' said a gentleman in spectacles , who had not yet spoken , ` you complained last week , my good fellow , of the cocoa .
Parsing [sent. 18677 len. 8]: How has it been since ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18678 len. 18]: I thank you , sir , ' said Mr. Littimer , ` it has been better made .
Parsing [sent. 18679 len. 61]: If I might take the liberty of saying so , sir , I do n't think the milk which is boiled with it is quite genuine ; but I am aware , sir , that there is a great adulteration of milk , in London , and that the article in a pure state is difficult to be obtained . '
Parsing [sent. 18680 len. 31]: It appeared to me that the gentleman in spectacles backed his Twenty Eight against Mr. Creakle 's Twenty Seven , for each of them took his own man in hand .
Parsing [sent. 18681 len. 12]: ` What is your state of mind , Twenty Eight ? '
Parsing [sent. 18682 len. 7]: said the questioner in spectacles . '
Parsing [sent. 18683 len. 20]: I thank you , sir , ' returned Mr. Littimer ; ' I see my follies now , sir .
Parsing [sent. 18684 len. 28]: I am a good deal troubled when I think of the sins of my former companions , sir ; but I trust they may find forgiveness . '
Parsing [sent. 18685 len. 8]: ` You are quite happy yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 18686 len. 8]: said the questioner , nodding encouragement . '
Parsing [sent. 18687 len. 14]: I am much obliged to you , sir , ' returned Mr. Littimer .
Parsing [sent. 18688 len. 5]: ` Perfectly so . '
Parsing [sent. 18689 len. 12]: ` Is there anything at all on your mind now ? '
Parsing [sent. 18690 len. 4]: said the questioner .
Parsing [sent. 18691 len. 11]: ` If so , mention it , Twenty Eight . '
Parsing [sent. 18692 len. 36]: ` Sir , ' said Mr. Littimer , without looking up , ` if my eyes have not deceived me , there is a gentleman present who was acquainted with me in my former life .
Parsing [sent. 18693 len. 55]: It may be profitable to that gentleman to know , sir , that I attribute my past follies , entirely to having lived a thoughtless life in the service of young men ; and to having allowed myself to be led by them into weaknesses , which I had not the strength to resist .
Parsing [sent. 18694 len. 19]: I hope that gentleman will take warning , sir , and will not be offended at my freedom .
Parsing [sent. 18695 len. 6]: It is for his good .
Parsing [sent. 18696 len. 9]: I am conscious of my own past follies .
Parsing [sent. 18697 len. 20]: I hope he may repent of all the wickedness and sin to which he has been a party . '
Parsing [sent. 18698 len. 24]: I observed that several gentlemen were shading their eyes , each with one hand , as if they had just come into church .
Parsing [sent. 18699 len. 15]: ` This does you credit , Twenty Eight , ' returned the questioner . '
Parsing [sent. 18700 len. 8]: I should have expected it of you .
Parsing [sent. 18701 len. 6]: Is there anything else ? '
Parsing [sent. 18702 len. 44]: ` Sir , ' returned Mr. Littimer , slightly lifting up his eyebrows , but not his eyes , ` there was a young woman who fell into dissolute courses , that I endeavoured to save , sir , but could not rescue .
Parsing [sent. 18703 len. 47]: I beg that gentleman , if he has it in his power , to inform that young woman from me that I forgive her her bad conduct towards myself , and that I call her to repentance -- if he will be so good . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18704 len. 36]: I have no doubt , Twenty Eight , ' returned the questioner , ` that the gentleman you refer to feels very strongly -- as we all must -- what you have so properly said .
Parsing [sent. 18705 len. 8]: We will not detain you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18706 len. 11]: I thank you , sir , ' said Mr. Littimer .
Parsing [sent. 18707 len. 26]: ` Gentlemen , I wish you a good day , and hoping you and your families will also see your wickedness , and amend ! '
Parsing [sent. 18708 len. 61]: With this , Number Twenty Eight retired , after a glance between him and Uriah ; as if they were not altogether unknown to each other , through some medium of communication ; and a murmur went round the group , as his door shut upon him , that he was a most respectable man , and a beautiful case .
Parsing [sent. 18709 len. 31]: ` Now , Twenty Seven , ' said Mr. Creakle , entering on a clear stage with his man , ` is there anything that anyone can do for you ?
Parsing [sent. 18710 len. 8]: If so , mention it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18711 len. 29]: I would umbly ask , sir , ' returned Uriah , with a jerk of his malevolent head , ` for leave to write again to mother . '
Parsing [sent. 18712 len. 12]: ` It shall certainly be granted , ' said Mr. Creakle .
Parsing [sent. 18713 len. 6]: ` Thank you , sir !
Parsing [sent. 18714 len. 6]: I am anxious about mother .
Parsing [sent. 18715 len. 9]: I am afraid she ai n't safe . '
Parsing [sent. 18716 len. 7]: Somebody incautiously asked , what from ?
Parsing [sent. 18717 len. 11]: But there was a scandalized whisper of ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 18718 len. 19]: ` Immortally safe , sir , ' returned Uriah , writhing in the direction of the voice . '
Parsing [sent. 18719 len. 11]: I should wish mother to be got into my state .
Parsing [sent. 18720 len. 17]: I never should have been got into my present state if I had n't come here .
Parsing [sent. 18721 len. 7]: I wish mother had come here .
Parsing [sent. 18722 len. 19]: It would be better for everybody , if they got took up , and was brought here . '
Parsing [sent. 18723 len. 19]: This sentiment gave unbounded satisfaction -- greater satisfaction , I think , than anything that had passed yet .
Parsing [sent. 18724 len. 50]: ` Before I come here , ' said Uriah , stealing a look at us , as if he would have blighted the outer world to which we belonged , if he could , ' I was given to follies ; but now I am sensible of my follies .
Parsing [sent. 18725 len. 8]: There 's a deal of sin outside .
Parsing [sent. 18726 len. 9]: There 's a deal of sin in mother .
Parsing [sent. 18727 len. 11]: There 's nothing but sin everywhere -- except here . '
Parsing [sent. 18728 len. 7]: ` You are quite changed ? '
Parsing [sent. 18729 len. 4]: said Mr. Creakle .
Parsing [sent. 18730 len. 9]: ` Oh dear , yes , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 18731 len. 5]: cried this hopeful penitent .
Parsing [sent. 18732 len. 13]: ` You would n't relapse , if you were going out ? '
Parsing [sent. 18733 len. 4]: asked somebody else .
Parsing [sent. 18734 len. 8]: ` Oh de-ar no , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 18735 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 18736 len. 10]: said Mr. Creakle , ` this is very gratifying .
Parsing [sent. 18737 len. 9]: You have addressed Mr. Copperfield , Twenty Seven .
Parsing [sent. 18738 len. 11]: Do you wish to say anything further to him ? '
Parsing [sent. 18739 len. 41]: ` You knew me , a long time before I came here and was changed , Mr. Copperfield , ' said Uriah , looking at me ; and a more villainous look I never saw , even on his visage .
Parsing [sent. 18740 len. 39]: ` You knew me when , in spite of my follies , I was umble among them that was proud , and meek among them that was violent -- you was violent to me yourself , Mr. Copperfield .
Parsing [sent. 18741 len. 15]: Once , you struck me a blow in the face , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 18742 len. 3]: General commiseration .
Parsing [sent. 18743 len. 7]: Several indignant glances directed at me .
Parsing [sent. 18744 len. 34]: ` But I forgive you , Mr. Copperfield , ' said Uriah , making his forgiving nature the subject of a most impious and awful parallel , which I shall not record . '
Parsing [sent. 18745 len. 4]: I forgive everybody .
Parsing [sent. 18746 len. 9]: It would ill become me to bear malice .
Parsing [sent. 18747 len. 16]: I freely forgive you , and I hope you 'll curb your passions in future .
Parsing [sent. 18748 len. 18]: I hope Mr. W. will repent , and Miss W. , and all of that sinful lot .
Parsing [sent. 18749 len. 24]: You 've been visited with affliction , and I hope it may do you good ; but you 'd better have come here .
Parsing [sent. 18750 len. 13]: Mr. W. had better have come here , and Miss W. too .
Parsing [sent. 18751 len. 30]: The best wish I could give you , Mr. Copperfield , and give all of you gentlemen , is , that you could be took up and brought here .
Parsing [sent. 18752 len. 23]: When I think of my past follies , and my present state , I am sure it would be best for you .
Parsing [sent. 18753 len. 10]: I pity all who ai n't brought here ! '
Parsing [sent. 18754 len. 29]: He sneaked back into his cell , amidst a little chorus of approbation ; and both Traddles and I experienced a great relief when he was locked in .
Parsing [sent. 18755 len. 28]: It was a characteristic feature in this repentance , that I was fain to ask what these two men had done , to be there at all .
Parsing [sent. 18756 len. 15]: That appeared to be the last thing about which they had anything to say .
Parsing [sent. 18757 len. 32]: I addressed myself to one of the two warders , who , I suspected from certain latent indications in their faces , knew pretty well what all this stir was worth .
Parsing [sent. 18758 len. 30]: ` Do you know , ' said I , as we walked along the passage , ` what felony was Number Twenty Seven 's last `` folly '' ? '
Parsing [sent. 18759 len. 11]: The answer was that it was a Bank case . '
Parsing [sent. 18760 len. 9]: A fraud on the Bank of England ? '
Parsing [sent. 18761 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 18762 len. 5]: ` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 18763 len. 7]: Fraud , forgery , and conspiracy .
Parsing [sent. 18764 len. 5]: He and some others .
Parsing [sent. 18765 len. 6]: He set the others on .
Parsing [sent. 18766 len. 10]: It was a deep plot for a large sum .
Parsing [sent. 18767 len. 6]: Sentence , transportation for life .
Parsing [sent. 18768 len. 22]: Twenty Seven was the knowingest bird of the lot , and had very nearly kept himself safe ; but not quite .
Parsing [sent. 18769 len. 17]: The Bank was just able to put salt upon his tail -- and only just . '
Parsing [sent. 18770 len. 10]: ` Do you know Twenty Eight 's offence ? '
Parsing [sent. 18771 len. 88]: ` Twenty Eight , ' returned my informant , speaking throughout in a low tone , and looking over his shoulder as we walked along the passage , to guard himself from being overheard , in such an unlawful reference to these Immaculates , by Creakle and the rest ; ` Twenty Eight -LRB- also transportation -RRB- got a place , and robbed a young master of a matter of two hundred and fifty pounds in money and valuables , the night before they were going abroad .
Parsing [sent. 18772 len. 16]: I particularly recollect his case , from his being took by a dwarf . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18773 len. 5]: A what ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18774 len. 4]: A little woman .
Parsing [sent. 18775 len. 7]: I have forgot her name ? '
Parsing [sent. 18776 len. 5]: ` Not Mowcher ? '
Parsing [sent. 18777 len. 5]: ` That 's it !
Parsing [sent. 18778 len. 78]: He had eluded pursuit , and was going to America in a flaxen wig , and whiskers , and such a complete disguise as never you see in all your born days ; when the little woman , being in Southampton , met him walking along the street -- picked him out with her sharp eye in a moment -- ran betwixt his legs to upset him -- and held on to him like grim Death . '
Parsing [sent. 18779 len. 6]: ` Excellent Miss Mowcher ! '
Parsing [sent. 18780 len. 35]: cried I. ` You 'd have said so , if you had seen her , standing on a chair in the witness-box at the trial , as I did , ' said my friend .
Parsing [sent. 18781 len. 34]: ` He cut her face right open , and pounded her in the most brutal manner , when she took him ; but she never loosed her hold till he was locked up .
Parsing [sent. 18782 len. 21]: She held so tight to him , in fact , that the officers were obliged to take 'em both together .
Parsing [sent. 18783 len. 25]: She gave her evidence in the gamest way , and was highly complimented by the Bench , and cheered right home to her lodgings .
Parsing [sent. 18784 len. 28]: She said in Court that she 'd have took him single-handed -LRB- on account of what she knew concerning him -RRB- , if he had been Samson .
Parsing [sent. 18785 len. 9]: And it 's my belief she would ! '
Parsing [sent. 18786 len. 14]: It was mine too , and I highly respected Miss Mowcher for it .
Parsing [sent. 18787 len. 10]: We had now seen all there was to see .
Parsing [sent. 18788 len. 106]: It would have been in vain to represent to such a man as the Worshipful Mr. Creakle , that Twenty Seven and Twenty Eight were perfectly consistent and unchanged ; that exactly what they were then , they had always been ; that the hypocritical knaves were just the subjects to make that sort of profession in such a place ; that they knew its market-value at least as well as we did , in the immediate service it would do them when they were expatriated ; in a word , that it was a rotten , hollow , painfully suggestive piece of business altogether .
Parsing [sent. 18789 len. 14]: We left them to their system and themselves , and went home wondering .
Parsing [sent. 18790 len. 34]: ` Perhaps it 's a good thing , Traddles , ' said I , ` to have an unsound Hobby ridden hard ; for it 's the sooner ridden to death . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18791 len. 8]: I hope so , ' replied Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 18792 len. 25]: Chapter 62 A Light Shines on My Way The year came round to Christmas-time , and I had been at home above two months .
Parsing [sent. 18793 len. 6]: I had seen Agnes frequently .
Parsing [sent. 18794 len. 38]: However loud the general voice might be in giving me encouragement , and however fervent the emotions and endeavours to which it roused me , I heard her lightest word of praise as I heard nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 18795 len. 20]: At least once a week , and sometimes oftener , I rode over there , and passed the evening .
Parsing [sent. 18796 len. 49]: I usually rode back at night ; for the old unhappy sense was always hovering about me now -- most sorrowfully when I left her -- and I was glad to be up and out , rather than wandering over the past in weary wakefulness or miserable dreams .
Parsing [sent. 18797 len. 33]: I wore away the longest part of many wild sad nights , in those rides ; reviving , as I went , the thoughts that had occupied me in my long absence .
Parsing [sent. 18798 len. 25]: Or , if I were to say rather that I listened to the echoes of those thoughts , I should better express the truth .
Parsing [sent. 18799 len. 8]: They spoke to me from afar off .
Parsing [sent. 18800 len. 14]: I had put them at a distance , and accepted my inevitable place .
Parsing [sent. 18801 len. 79]: When I read to Agnes what I wrote ; when I saw her listening face ; moved her to smiles or tears ; and heard her cordial voice so earnest on the shadowy events of that imaginative world in which I lived ; I thought what a fate mine might have been -- but only thought so , as I had thought after I was married to Dora , what I could have wished my wife to be .
Parsing [sent. 18802 len. 75]: My duty to Agnes , who loved me with a love , which , if I disquieted , I wronged most selfishly and poorly , and could never restore ; my matured assurance that I , who had worked out my own destiny , and won what I had impetuously set my heart on , had no right to murmur , and must bear ; comprised what I felt and what I had learned .
Parsing [sent. 18803 len. 64]: But I loved her : and now it even became some consolation to me , vaguely to conceive a distant day when I might blamelessly avow it ; when all this should be over ; when I could say ` Agnes , so it was when I came home ; and now I am old , and I never have loved since ! '
Parsing [sent. 18804 len. 11]: She did not once show me any change in herself .
Parsing [sent. 18805 len. 15]: What she always had been to me , she still was ; wholly unaltered .
Parsing [sent. 18806 len. 58]: Between my aunt and me there had been something , in this connexion , since the night of my return , which I can not call a restraint , or an avoidance of the subject , so much as an implied understanding that we thought of it together , but did not shape our thoughts into words .
Parsing [sent. 18807 len. 41]: When , according to our old custom , we sat before the fire at night , we often fell into this train ; as naturally , and as consciously to each other , as if we had unreservedly said so .
Parsing [sent. 18808 len. 7]: But we preserved an unbroken silence .
Parsing [sent. 18809 len. 30]: I believed that she had read , or partly read , my thoughts that night ; and that she fully comprehended why I gave mine no more distinct expression .
Parsing [sent. 18810 len. 57]: This Christmas-time being come , and Agnes having reposed no new confidence in me , a doubt that had several times arisen in my mind - whether she could have that perception of the true state of my breast , which restrained her with the apprehension of giving me pain -- began to oppress me heavily .
Parsing [sent. 18811 len. 31]: If that were so , my sacrifice was nothing ; my plainest obligation to her unfulfilled ; and every poor action I had shrunk from , I was hourly doing .
Parsing [sent. 18812 len. 30]: I resolved to set this right beyond all doubt ; -- if such a barrier were between us , to break it down at once with a determined hand .
Parsing [sent. 18813 len. 12]: It was -- what lasting reason have I to remember it !
Parsing [sent. 18814 len. 9]: -- a cold , harsh , winter day .
Parsing [sent. 18815 len. 22]: There had been snow , some hours before ; and it lay , not deep , but hard-frozen on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 18816 len. 16]: Out at sea , beyond my window , the wind blew ruggedly from the north .
Parsing [sent. 18817 len. 42]: I had been thinking of it , sweeping over those mountain wastes of snow in Switzerland , then inaccessible to any human foot ; and had been speculating which was the lonelier , those solitary regions , or a deserted ocean .
Parsing [sent. 18818 len. 7]: ` Riding today , Trot ? '
Parsing [sent. 18819 len. 12]: said my aunt , putting her head in at the door .
Parsing [sent. 18820 len. 15]: ` Yes , ' said I , ' I am going over to Canterbury .
Parsing [sent. 18821 len. 11]: It 's a good day for a ride . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18822 len. 43]: I hope your horse may think so too , ' said my aunt ; ` but at present he is holding down his head and his ears , standing before the door there , as if he thought his stable preferable . '
Parsing [sent. 18823 len. 25]: My aunt , I may observe , allowed my horse on the forbidden ground , but had not at all relented towards the donkeys .
Parsing [sent. 18824 len. 10]: ` He will be fresh enough , presently ! '
Parsing [sent. 18825 len. 28]: said I. ` The ride will do his master good , at all events , ' observed my aunt , glancing at the papers on my table .
Parsing [sent. 18826 len. 13]: ` Ah , child , you pass a good many hours here !
Parsing [sent. 18827 len. 20]: I never thought , when I used to read books , what work it was to write them . '
Parsing [sent. 18828 len. 15]: ` It 's work enough to read them , sometimes , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 18829 len. 15]: ` As to the writing , it has its own charms , aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 18830 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 18831 len. 4]: I see ! '
Parsing [sent. 18832 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 18833 len. 16]: ` Ambition , love of approbation , sympathy , and much more , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 18834 len. 8]: Well : go along with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 18835 len. 39]: ` Do you know anything more , ' said I , standing composedly before her - she had patted me on the shoulder , and sat down in my chair -- ` of that attachment of Agnes ? '
Parsing [sent. 18836 len. 22]: She looked up in my face a little while , before replying : ' I think I do , Trot . '
Parsing [sent. 18837 len. 9]: ` Are you confirmed in your impression ? '
Parsing [sent. 18838 len. 4]: I inquired . '
Parsing [sent. 18839 len. 8]: I think I am , Trot . '
Parsing [sent. 18840 len. 36]: She looked so steadfastly at me : with a kind of doubt , or pity , or suspense in her affection : that I summoned the stronger determination to show her a perfectly cheerful face .
Parsing [sent. 18841 len. 13]: ` And what is more , Trot -- ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 18842 len. 5]: ` Yes ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 18843 len. 10]: I think Agnes is going to be married . '
Parsing [sent. 18844 len. 6]: ` God bless her ! '
Parsing [sent. 18845 len. 5]: said I , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 18846 len. 6]: ` God bless her ! '
Parsing [sent. 18847 len. 11]: said my aunt , ` and her husband too ! '
Parsing [sent. 18848 len. 20]: I echoed it , parted from my aunt , and went lightly downstairs , mounted , and rode away .
Parsing [sent. 18849 len. 15]: There was greater reason than before to do what I had resolved to do .
Parsing [sent. 18850 len. 8]: How well I recollect the wintry ride !
Parsing [sent. 18851 len. 102]: The frozen particles of ice , brushed from the blades of grass by the wind , and borne across my face ; the hard clatter of the horse 's hoofs , beating a tune upon the ground ; the stiff-tilled soil ; the snowdrift , lightly eddying in the chalk-pit as the breeze ruffled it ; the smoking team with the waggon of old hay , stopping to breathe on the hill-top , and shaking their bells musically ; the whitened slopes and sweeps of Down-land lying against the dark sky , as if they were drawn on a huge slate !
Parsing [sent. 18852 len. 5]: I found Agnes alone .
Parsing [sent. 18853 len. 21]: The little girls had gone to their own homes now , and she was alone by the fire , reading .
Parsing [sent. 18854 len. 30]: She put down her book on seeing me come in ; and having welcomed me as usual , took her work-basket and sat in one of the old-fashioned windows .
Parsing [sent. 18855 len. 36]: I sat beside her on the window-seat , and we talked of what I was doing , and when it would be done , and of the progress I had made since my last visit .
Parsing [sent. 18856 len. 24]: Agnes was very cheerful ; and laughingly predicted that I should soon become too famous to be talked to , on such subjects .
Parsing [sent. 18857 len. 28]: ` So I make the most of the present time , you see , ' said Agnes , ` and talk to you while I may . '
Parsing [sent. 18858 len. 29]: As I looked at her beautiful face , observant of her work , she raised her mild clear eyes , and saw that I was looking at her .
Parsing [sent. 18859 len. 9]: ` You are thoughtful today , Trotwood ! '
Parsing [sent. 18860 len. 10]: ` Agnes , shall I tell you what about ?
Parsing [sent. 18861 len. 7]: I came to tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 18862 len. 26]: She put aside her work , as she was used to do when we were seriously discussing anything ; and gave me her whole attention .
Parsing [sent. 18863 len. 15]: ` My dear Agnes , do you doubt my being true to you ? '
Parsing [sent. 18864 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 18865 len. 9]: she answered , with a look of astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 18866 len. 15]: ` Do you doubt my being what I always have been to you ? '
Parsing [sent. 18867 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 18868 len. 6]: she answered , as before .
Parsing [sent. 18869 len. 38]: ` Do you remember that I tried to tell you , when I came home , what a debt of gratitude I owed you , dearest Agnes , and how fervently I felt towards you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18870 len. 15]: I remember it , ' she said , gently , ` very well . '
Parsing [sent. 18871 len. 18]: ` You have a secret , ' said I. ` Let me share it , Agnes . '
Parsing [sent. 18872 len. 10]: She cast down her eyes , and trembled . '
Parsing [sent. 18873 len. 42]: I could hardly fail to know , even if I had not heard -- but from other lips than yours , Agnes , which seems strange -- that there is someone upon whom you have bestowed the treasure of your love .
Parsing [sent. 18874 len. 13]: Do not shut me out of what concerns your happiness so nearly !
Parsing [sent. 18875 len. 37]: If you can trust me , as you say you can , and as I know you may , let me be your friend , your brother , in this matter , of all others ! '
Parsing [sent. 18876 len. 46]: With an appealing , almost a reproachful , glance , she rose from the window ; and hurrying across the room as if without knowing where , put her hands before her face , and burst into such tears as smote me to the heart .
Parsing [sent. 18877 len. 14]: And yet they awakened something in me , bringing promise to my heart .
Parsing [sent. 18878 len. 33]: Without my knowing why , these tears allied themselves with the quietly sad smile which was so fixed in my remembrance , and shook me more with hope than fear or sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 18879 len. 3]: ` Agnes !
Parsing [sent. 18880 len. 2]: Sister !
Parsing [sent. 18881 len. 2]: Dearest !
Parsing [sent. 18882 len. 6]: What have I done ? '
Parsing [sent. 18883 len. 8]: ` Let me go away , Trotwood .
Parsing [sent. 18884 len. 5]: I am not well .
Parsing [sent. 18885 len. 5]: I am not myself .
Parsing [sent. 18886 len. 12]: I will speak to you by and by -- another time .
Parsing [sent. 18887 len. 6]: I will write to you .
Parsing [sent. 18888 len. 7]: Do n't speak to me now .
Parsing [sent. 18889 len. 3]: Do n't !
Parsing [sent. 18890 len. 4]: do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 18891 len. 27]: I sought to recollect what she had said , when I had spoken to her on that former night , of her affection needing no return .
Parsing [sent. 18892 len. 14]: It seemed a very world that I must search through in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 18893 len. 21]: ` Agnes , I can not bear to see you so , and think that I have been the cause .
Parsing [sent. 18894 len. 23]: My dearest girl , dearer to me than anything in life , if you are unhappy , let me share your unhappiness .
Parsing [sent. 18895 len. 19]: If you are in need of help or counsel , let me try to give it to you .
Parsing [sent. 18896 len. 17]: If you have indeed a burden on your heart , let me try to lighten it .
Parsing [sent. 18897 len. 17]: For whom do I live now , Agnes , if it is not for you ! '
Parsing [sent. 18898 len. 6]: ` Oh , spare me !
Parsing [sent. 18899 len. 5]: I am not myself !
Parsing [sent. 18900 len. 4]: Another time ! '
Parsing [sent. 18901 len. 6]: was all I could distinguish .
Parsing [sent. 18902 len. 11]: Was it a selfish error that was leading me away ?
Parsing [sent. 18903 len. 25]: Or , having once a clue to hope , was there something opening to me that I had not dared to think of ? '
Parsing [sent. 18904 len. 5]: I must say more .
Parsing [sent. 18905 len. 9]: I can not let you leave me so !
Parsing [sent. 18906 len. 28]: For Heaven 's sake , Agnes , let us not mistake each other after all these years , and all that has come and gone with them !
Parsing [sent. 18907 len. 5]: I must speak plainly .
Parsing [sent. 18908 len. 60]: If you have any lingering thought that I could envy the happiness you will confer ; that I could not resign you to a dearer protector , of your own choosing ; that I could not , from my removed place , be a contented witness of your joy ; dismiss it , for I do n't deserve it !
Parsing [sent. 18909 len. 8]: I have not suffered quite in vain .
Parsing [sent. 18910 len. 9]: You have not taught me quite in vain .
Parsing [sent. 18911 len. 14]: There is no alloy of self in what I feel for you . '
Parsing [sent. 18912 len. 5]: She was quiet now .
Parsing [sent. 18913 len. 59]: In a little time , she turned her pale face towards me , and said in a low voice , broken here and there , but very clear : ' I owe it to your pure friendship for me , Trotwood -- which , indeed , I do not doubt -- to tell you , you are mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 18914 len. 6]: I can do no more .
Parsing [sent. 18915 len. 22]: If I have sometimes , in the course of years , wanted help and counsel , they have come to me .
Parsing [sent. 18916 len. 13]: If I have sometimes been unhappy , the feeling has passed away .
Parsing [sent. 18917 len. 18]: If I have ever had a burden on my heart , it has been lightened for me .
Parsing [sent. 18918 len. 21]: If I have any secret , it is - no new one ; and is -- not what you suppose .
Parsing [sent. 18919 len. 10]: I can not reveal it , or divide it .
Parsing [sent. 18920 len. 12]: It has long been mine , and must remain mine . '
Parsing [sent. 18921 len. 3]: ` Agnes !
Parsing [sent. 18922 len. 2]: Stay !
Parsing [sent. 18923 len. 4]: A moment ! '
Parsing [sent. 18924 len. 10]: She was going away , but I detained her .
Parsing [sent. 18925 len. 8]: I clasped my arm about her waist .
Parsing [sent. 18926 len. 8]: ` In the course of years ! '
Parsing [sent. 18927 len. 9]: ` It is not a new one ! '
Parsing [sent. 18928 len. 20]: New thoughts and hopes were whirling through my mind , and all the colours of my life were changing .
Parsing [sent. 18929 len. 4]: ` Dearest Agnes !
Parsing [sent. 18930 len. 13]: Whom I so respect and honour -- whom I so devotedly love !
Parsing [sent. 18931 len. 18]: When I came here today , I thought that nothing could have wrested this confession from me .
Parsing [sent. 18932 len. 19]: I thought I could have kept it in my bosom all our lives , till we were old .
Parsing [sent. 18933 len. 27]: But , Agnes , if I have indeed any new-born hope that I may ever call you something more than Sister , widely different from Sister !
Parsing [sent. 18934 len. 27]: -- ' Her tears fell fast ; but they were not like those she had lately shed , and I saw my hope brighten in them .
Parsing [sent. 18935 len. 3]: ` Agnes !
Parsing [sent. 18936 len. 8]: Ever my guide , and best support !
Parsing [sent. 18937 len. 33]: If you had been more mindful of yourself , and less of me , when we grew up here together , I think my heedless fancy never would have wandered from you .
Parsing [sent. 18938 len. 56]: But you were so much better than I , so necessary to me in every boyish hope and disappointment , that to have you to confide in , and rely upon in everything , became a second nature , supplanting for the time the first and greater one of loving you as I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 18939 len. 9]: Still weeping , but not sadly -- joyfully !
Parsing [sent. 18940 len. 21]: And clasped in my arms as she had never been , as I had thought she never was to be !
Parsing [sent. 18941 len. 19]: ` When I loved Dora -- fondly , Agnes , as you know -- ' ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 18942 len. 6]: she cried , earnestly . '
Parsing [sent. 18943 len. 8]: I am glad to know it ! '
Parsing [sent. 18944 len. 20]: ` When I loved her -- even then , my love would have been incomplete , without your sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 18945 len. 9]: I had it , and it was perfected .
Parsing [sent. 18946 len. 19]: And when I lost her , Agnes , what should I have been without you , still ! '
Parsing [sent. 18947 len. 29]: Closer in my arms , nearer to my heart , her trembling hand upon my shoulder , her sweet eyes shining through her tears , on mine ! '
Parsing [sent. 18948 len. 10]: I went away , dear Agnes , loving you .
Parsing [sent. 18949 len. 7]: I stayed away , loving you .
Parsing [sent. 18950 len. 8]: I returned home , loving you ! '
Parsing [sent. 18951 len. 23]: And now , I tried to tell her of the struggle I had had , and the conclusion I had come to .
Parsing [sent. 18952 len. 14]: I tried to lay my mind before her , truly , and entirely .
Parsing [sent. 18953 len. 51]: I tried to show her how I had hoped I had come into the better knowledge of myself and of her ; how I had resigned myself to what that better knowledge brought ; and how I had come there , even that day , in my fidelity to this .
Parsing [sent. 18954 len. 63]: If she did so love me -LRB- I said -RRB- that she could take me for her husband , she could do so , on no deserving of mine , except upon the truth of my love for her , and the trouble in which it had ripened to be what it was ; and hence it was that I revealed it .
Parsing [sent. 18955 len. 52]: And O , Agnes , even out of thy true eyes , in that same time , the spirit of my child-wife looked upon me , saying it was well ; and winning me , through thee , to tenderest recollections of the Blossom that had withered in its bloom ! '
Parsing [sent. 18956 len. 23]: I am so blest , Trotwood -- my heart is so overcharged -- but there is one thing I must say . '
Parsing [sent. 18957 len. 6]: ` Dearest , what ? '
Parsing [sent. 18958 len. 16]: She laid her gentle hands upon my shoulders , and looked calmly in my face .
Parsing [sent. 18959 len. 13]: ` Do you know , yet , what it is ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18960 len. 10]: I am afraid to speculate on what it is .
Parsing [sent. 18961 len. 8]: Tell me , my dear . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18962 len. 9]: I have loved you all my life ! '
Parsing [sent. 18963 len. 10]: O , we were happy , we were happy !
Parsing [sent. 18964 len. 37]: Our tears were not for the trials -LRB- hers so much the greater -RRB- through which we had come to be thus , but for the rapture of being thus , never to be divided more !
Parsing [sent. 18965 len. 27]: We walked , that winter evening , in the fields together ; and the blessed calm within us seemed to be partaken by the frosty air .
Parsing [sent. 18966 len. 30]: The early stars began to shine while we were lingering on , and looking up to them , we thanked our GOD for having guided us to this tranquillity .
Parsing [sent. 18967 len. 32]: We stood together in the same old-fashioned window at night , when the moon was shining ; Agnes with her quiet eyes raised up to it ; I following her glance .
Parsing [sent. 18968 len. 43]: Long miles of road then opened out before my mind ; and , toiling on , I saw a ragged way-worn boy , forsaken and neglected , who should come to call even the heart now beating against mine , his own .
Parsing [sent. 18969 len. 13]: It was nearly dinner-time next day when we appeared before my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 18970 len. 24]: She was up in my study , Peggotty said : which it was her pride to keep in readiness and order for me .
Parsing [sent. 18971 len. 13]: We found her , in her spectacles , sitting by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 18972 len. 5]: ` Goodness me ! '
Parsing [sent. 18973 len. 19]: said my aunt , peering through the dusk , ` who 's this you 're bringing home ? '
Parsing [sent. 18974 len. 7]: ` Agnes , ' said I .
Parsing [sent. 18975 len. 18]: As we had arranged to say nothing at first , my aunt was not a little discomfited .
Parsing [sent. 18976 len. 38]: She darted a hopeful glance at me , when I said ` Agnes ' ; but seeing that I looked as usual , she took off her spectacles in despair , and rubbed her nose with them .
Parsing [sent. 18977 len. 20]: She greeted Agnes heartily , nevertheless ; and we were soon in the lighted parlour downstairs , at dinner .
Parsing [sent. 18978 len. 34]: My aunt put on her spectacles twice or thrice , to take another look at me , but as often took them off again , disappointed , and rubbed her nose with them .
Parsing [sent. 18979 len. 17]: Much to the discomfiture of Mr. Dick , who knew this to be a bad symptom .
Parsing [sent. 18980 len. 28]: ` By the by , aunt , ' said I , after dinner ; ' I have been speaking to Agnes about what you told me . '
Parsing [sent. 18981 len. 24]: ` Then , Trot , ' said my aunt , turning scarlet , ` you did wrong , and broke your promise . '
Parsing [sent. 18982 len. 11]: ` You are not angry , aunt , I trust ?
Parsing [sent. 18983 len. 21]: I am sure you wo n't be , when you learn that Agnes is not unhappy in any attachment . '
Parsing [sent. 18984 len. 6]: ` Stuff and nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 18985 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 18986 len. 20]: As my aunt appeared to be annoyed , I thought the best way was to cut her annoyance short .
Parsing [sent. 18987 len. 20]: I took Agnes in my arm to the back of her chair , and we both leaned over her .
Parsing [sent. 18988 len. 35]: My aunt , with one clap of her hands , and one look through her spectacles , immediately went into hysterics , for the first and only time in all my knowledge of her .
Parsing [sent. 18989 len. 6]: The hysterics called up Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 18990 len. 27]: The moment my aunt was restored , she flew at Peggotty , and calling her a silly old creature , hugged her with all her might .
Parsing [sent. 18991 len. 28]: After that , she hugged Mr. Dick -LRB- who was highly honoured , but a good deal surprised -RRB- ; and after that , told them why .
Parsing [sent. 18992 len. 8]: Then , we were all happy together .
Parsing [sent. 18993 len. 33]: I could not discover whether my aunt , in her last short conversation with me , had fallen on a pious fraud , or had really mistaken the state of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 18994 len. 33]: It was quite enough , she said , that she had told me Agnes was going to be married ; and that I now knew better than anyone how true it was .
Parsing [sent. 18995 len. 7]: We were married within a fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 18996 len. 19]: Traddles and Sophy , and Doctor and Mrs. Strong , were the only guests at our quiet wedding .
Parsing [sent. 18997 len. 12]: We left them full of joy ; and drove away together .
Parsing [sent. 18998 len. 45]: Clasped in my embrace , I held the source of every worthy aspiration I had ever had ; the centre of myself , the circle of my life , my own , my wife ; my love of whom was founded on a rock !
Parsing [sent. 18999 len. 5]: ` Dearest husband ! '
Parsing [sent. 19000 len. 3]: said Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 19001 len. 21]: ` Now that I may call you by that name , I have one thing more to tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 19002 len. 9]: ` Let me hear it , love . '
Parsing [sent. 19003 len. 11]: ` It grows out of the night when Dora died .
Parsing [sent. 19004 len. 7]: She sent you for me . '
Parsing [sent. 19005 len. 5]: ` She did . '
Parsing [sent. 19006 len. 10]: ` She told me that she left me something .
Parsing [sent. 19007 len. 8]: Can you think what it was ? '
Parsing [sent. 19008 len. 5]: I believed I could .
Parsing [sent. 19009 len. 16]: I drew the wife who had so long loved me , closer to my side .
Parsing [sent. 19010 len. 21]: ` She told me that she made a last request to me , and left me a last charge . '
Parsing [sent. 19011 len. 17]: ` And it was -- ' ` That only I would occupy this vacant place . '
Parsing [sent. 19012 len. 24]: And Agnes laid her head upon my breast , and wept ; and I wept with her , though we were so happy .
Parsing [sent. 19013 len. 50]: Chapter 63 A Visitor What I have purposed to record is nearly finished ; but there is yet an incident conspicuous in my memory , on which it often rests with delight , and without which one thread in the web I have spun would have a ravelled end .
Parsing [sent. 19014 len. 22]: I had advanced in fame and fortune , my domestic joy was perfect , I had been married ten happy years .
Parsing [sent. 19015 len. 43]: Agnes and I were sitting by the fire , in our house in London , one night in spring , and three of our children were playing in the room , when I was told that a stranger wished to see me .
Parsing [sent. 19016 len. 32]: He had been asked if he came on business , and had answered No ; he had come for the pleasure of seeing me , and had come a long way .
Parsing [sent. 19017 len. 16]: He was an old man , my servant said , and looked like a farmer .
Parsing [sent. 19018 len. 45]: As this sounded mysterious to the children , and moreover was like the beginning of a favourite story Agnes used to tell them , introductory to the arrival of a wicked old Fairy in a cloak who hated everybody , it produced some commotion .
Parsing [sent. 19019 len. 58]: One of our boys laid his head in his mother 's lap to be out of harm 's way , and little Agnes -LRB- our eldest child -RRB- left her doll in a chair to represent her , and thrust out her little heap of golden curls from between the window-curtains , to see what happened next .
Parsing [sent. 19020 len. 8]: ` Let him come in here ! '
Parsing [sent. 19021 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 19022 len. 20]: There soon appeared , pausing in the dark doorway as he entered , a hale , grey-haired old man .
Parsing [sent. 19023 len. 50]: Little Agnes , attracted by his looks , had run to bring him in , and I had not yet clearly seen his face , when my wife , starting up , cried out to me , in a pleased and agitated voice , that it was Mr. Peggotty !
Parsing [sent. 19024 len. 5]: It WAS Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 19025 len. 16]: An old man now , but in a ruddy , hearty , strong old age .
Parsing [sent. 19026 len. 53]: When our first emotion was over , and he sat before the fire with the children on his knees , and the blaze shining on his face , he looked , to me , as vigorous and robust , withal as handsome , an old man , as ever I had seen .
Parsing [sent. 19027 len. 10]: ` Mas ' r Davy , ' said he .
Parsing [sent. 19028 len. 15]: And the old name in the old tone fell so naturally on my ear !
Parsing [sent. 19029 len. 29]: ` Mas ' r Davy , 't is a joyful hour as I see you , once more , ` long with your own trew wife ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 19030 len. 9]: A joyful hour indeed , old friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 19031 len. 14]: cried I. ` And these heer pretty ones , ' said Mr. Peggotty .
Parsing [sent. 19032 len. 8]: ` To look at these heer flowers !
Parsing [sent. 19033 len. 24]: Why , Mas ' r Davy , you was but the heighth of the littlest of these , when I first see you !
Parsing [sent. 19034 len. 19]: When Em ` ly war n't no bigger , and our poor lad were BUT a lad ! '
Parsing [sent. 19035 len. 65]: ` Time has changed me more than it has changed you since then , ' said I. ` But let these dear rogues go to bed ; and as no house in England but this must hold you , tell me where to send for your luggage -LRB- is the old black bag among it , that went so far , I wonder ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 19036 len. 21]: , and then , over a glass of Yarmouth grog , we will have the tidings of ten years ! '
Parsing [sent. 19037 len. 6]: ` Are you alone ? '
Parsing [sent. 19038 len. 3]: asked Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 19039 len. 18]: ` Yes , ma'am , ' he said , kissing her hand , ` quite alone . '
Parsing [sent. 19040 len. 45]: We sat him between us , not knowing how to give him welcome enough ; and as I began to listen to his old familiar voice , I could have fancied he was still pursuing his long journey in search of his darling niece .
Parsing [sent. 19041 len. 30]: ` It 's a mort of water , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` fur to come across , and on ' y stay a matter of fower weeks .
Parsing [sent. 19042 len. 27]: But water -LRB- ` specially when 't is salt -RRB- comes nat ` ral to me ; and friends is dear , and I am heer .
Parsing [sent. 19043 len. 25]: -- Which is verse , ' said Mr. Peggotty , surprised to find it out , ` though I had n't such intentions . '
Parsing [sent. 19044 len. 14]: ` Are you going back those many thousand miles , so soon ? '
Parsing [sent. 19045 len. 3]: asked Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 19046 len. 10]: ` Yes , ma'am , ' he returned . '
Parsing [sent. 19047 len. 14]: I giv the promise to Em ` ly , afore I come away .
Parsing [sent. 19048 len. 74]: You see , I doe n't grow younger as the years comes round , and if I had n't sailed as 't was , most like I should n't never have done ` t. And it 's allus been on my mind , as I must come and see Mas ' r Davy and your own sweet blooming self , in your wedded happiness , afore I got to be too old . '
Parsing [sent. 19049 len. 17]: He looked at us , as if he could never feast his eyes on us sufficiently .
Parsing [sent. 19050 len. 19]: Agnes laughingly put back some scattered locks of his grey hair , that he might see us better .
Parsing [sent. 19051 len. 18]: ` And now tell us , ' said I , ` everything relating to your fortunes . '
Parsing [sent. 19052 len. 18]: ` Our fortuns , Mas ' r Davy , ' he rejoined , ` is soon told .
Parsing [sent. 19053 len. 11]: We have n't fared nohows , but fared to thrive .
Parsing [sent. 19054 len. 5]: We 've allus thrived .
Parsing [sent. 19055 len. 28]: We 've worked as we ought to ` t , and maybe we lived a leetle hard at first or so , but we have allus thrived .
Parsing [sent. 19056 len. 33]: What with sheep-farming , and what with stock-farming , and what with one thing and what with t ` other , we are as well to do , as well could be .
Parsing [sent. 19057 len. 29]: Theer 's been kiender a blessing fell upon us , ' said Mr. Peggotty , reverentially inclining his head , ` and we 've done nowt but prosper .
Parsing [sent. 19058 len. 8]: That is , in the long run .
Parsing [sent. 19059 len. 8]: If not yesterday , why then today .
Parsing [sent. 19060 len. 9]: If not today , why then tomorrow . '
Parsing [sent. 19061 len. 5]: ` And Emily ? '
Parsing [sent. 19062 len. 8]: said Agnes and I , both together .
Parsing [sent. 19063 len. 107]: 'Em ` ly , ' said he , ` arter you left her , ma'am -- and I never heerd her saying of her prayers at night , t ` other side the canvas screen , when we was settled in the Bush , but what I heerd your name -- and arter she and me lost sight of Mas ' r Davy , that theer shining sundown -- was that low , at first , that , if she had know 'd then what Mas ' r Davy kep from us so kind and thowtful , 't is my opinion she 'd have drooped away .
Parsing [sent. 19064 len. 56]: But theer was some poor folks aboard as had illness among 'em , and she took care of them ; and theer was the children in our company , and she took care of them ; and so she got to be busy , and to be doing good , and that helped her . '
Parsing [sent. 19065 len. 10]: ` When did she first hear of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 19066 len. 4]: I asked . '
Parsing [sent. 19067 len. 24]: I kep it from her arter I heerd on ` t , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` going on nigh a year .
Parsing [sent. 19068 len. 26]: We was living then in a solitary place , but among the beautifullest trees , and with the roses a-covering our Beein to the roof .
Parsing [sent. 19069 len. 55]: Theer come along one day , when I was out a-working on the land , a traveller from our own Norfolk or Suffolk in England -LRB- I doe n't rightly mind which -RRB- , and of course we took him in , and giv him to eat and drink , and made him welcome .
Parsing [sent. 19070 len. 10]: We all do that , all the colony over .
Parsing [sent. 19071 len. 19]: He 'd got an old newspaper with him , and some other account in print of the storm .
Parsing [sent. 19072 len. 8]: That 's how she know 'd it .
Parsing [sent. 19073 len. 15]: When I came home at night , I found she know 'd it . '
Parsing [sent. 19074 len. 21]: He dropped his voice as he said these words , and the gravity I so well remembered overspread his face .
Parsing [sent. 19075 len. 8]: ` Did it change her much ? '
Parsing [sent. 19076 len. 3]: we asked .
Parsing [sent. 19077 len. 25]: ` Aye , for a good long time , ' he said , shaking his head ; ` if not to this present hour .
Parsing [sent. 19078 len. 9]: But I think the solitoode done her good .
Parsing [sent. 19079 len. 25]: And she had a deal to mind in the way of poultry and the like , and minded of it , and come through .
Parsing [sent. 19080 len. 31]: I wonder , ' he said thoughtfully , ` if you could see my Em ` ly now , Mas ' r Davy , whether you 'd know her ! '
Parsing [sent. 19081 len. 7]: ` Is she so altered ? '
Parsing [sent. 19082 len. 4]: I inquired . '
Parsing [sent. 19083 len. 5]: I doe n't know .
Parsing [sent. 19084 len. 20]: I see her ev'ry day , and doe n't know ; But , odd-times , I have thowt so .
Parsing [sent. 19085 len. 49]: A slight figure , ' said Mr. Peggotty , looking at the fire , ` kiender worn ; soft , sorrowful , blue eyes ; a delicate face ; a pritty head , leaning a little down ; a quiet voice and way -- timid a ` most .
Parsing [sent. 19086 len. 7]: That 's Em ` ly ! '
Parsing [sent. 19087 len. 14]: We silently observed him as he sat , still looking at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 19088 len. 26]: ` Some thinks , ' he said , ` as her affection was ill-bestowed ; some , as her marriage was broken off by death .
Parsing [sent. 19089 len. 7]: No one knows how 't is .
Parsing [sent. 19090 len. 30]: She might have married well , a mort of times , `` but , uncle , '' she says to me , `` that 's gone for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 19091 len. 82]: Cheerful along with me ; retired when others is by ; fond of going any distance fur to teach a child , or fur to tend a sick person , or fur to do some kindness tow ` rds a young girl 's wedding -LRB- and she 's done a many , but has never seen one -RRB- ; fondly loving of her uncle ; patient ; liked by young and old ; sowt out by all that has any trouble .
Parsing [sent. 19092 len. 7]: That 's Em ` ly ! '
Parsing [sent. 19093 len. 19]: He drew his hand across his face , and with a half-suppressed sigh looked up from the fire .
Parsing [sent. 19094 len. 8]: ` Is Martha with you yet ? '
Parsing [sent. 19095 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 19096 len. 21]: ` Martha , ' he replied , ` got married , Mas ' r Davy , in the second year .
Parsing [sent. 19097 len. 66]: A young man , a farm-labourer , as come by us on his way to market with his mas ` r 's drays -- a journey of over five hundred mile , theer and back -- made offers fur to take her fur his wife -LRB- wives is very scarce theer -RRB- , and then to set up fur their two selves in the Bush .
Parsing [sent. 19098 len. 12]: She spoke to me fur to tell him her trew story .
Parsing [sent. 19099 len. 3]: I did .
Parsing [sent. 19100 len. 23]: They was married , and they live fower hundred mile away from any voices but their own and the singing birds . '
Parsing [sent. 19101 len. 5]: ` Mrs. Gummidge ? '
Parsing [sent. 19102 len. 3]: I suggested .
Parsing [sent. 19103 len. 45]: It was a pleasant key to touch , for Mr. Peggotty suddenly burst into a roar of laughter , and rubbed his hands up and down his legs , as he had been accustomed to do when he enjoyed himself in the long-shipwrecked boat .
Parsing [sent. 19104 len. 7]: ` Would you believe it ! '
Parsing [sent. 19105 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 19106 len. 12]: ` Why , someun even made offer fur to marry her !
Parsing [sent. 19107 len. 40]: If a ship 's cook that was turning settler , Mas ' r Davy , did n't make offers fur to marry Missis Gummidge , I 'm Gormed - and I ca n't say no fairer than that ! '
Parsing [sent. 19108 len. 7]: I never saw Agnes laugh so .
Parsing [sent. 19109 len. 52]: This sudden ecstasy on the part of Mr. Peggotty was so delightful to her , that she could not leave off laughing ; and the more she laughed the more she made me laugh , and the greater Mr. Peggotty 's ecstasy became , and the more he rubbed his legs .
Parsing [sent. 19110 len. 9]: ` And what did Mrs. Gummidge say ? '
Parsing [sent. 19111 len. 9]: I asked , when I was grave enough .
Parsing [sent. 19112 len. 85]: ` If you 'll believe me , ' returned Mr. Peggotty , ` Missis Gummidge , ` stead of saying `` thank you , I 'm much obleeged to you , I ai n't a-going fur to change my condition at my time of life , '' up 'd with a bucket as was standing by , and laid it over that theer ship 's cook 's head 'till he sung out fur help , and I went in and reskied of him . '
Parsing [sent. 19113 len. 19]: Mr. Peggotty burst into a great roar of laughter , and Agnes and I both kept him company .
Parsing [sent. 19114 len. 42]: ` But I must say this , for the good creetur , ' he resumed , wiping his face , when we were quite exhausted ; ` she has been all she said she 'd be to us , and more .
Parsing [sent. 19115 len. 26]: She 's the willingest , the trewest , the honestest-helping woman , Mas ' r Davy , as ever draw 'd the breath of life .
Parsing [sent. 19116 len. 34]: I have never know 'd her to be lone and lorn , for a single minute , not even when the colony was all afore us , and we was new to it .
Parsing [sent. 19117 len. 25]: And thinking of the old ` un is a thing she never done , I do assure you , since she left England ! '
Parsing [sent. 19118 len. 51]: ` Now , last , not least , Mr. Micawber , ' said I. ` He has paid off every obligation he incurred here -- even to Traddles 's bill , you remember my dear Agnes -- and therefore we may take it for granted that he is doing well .
Parsing [sent. 19119 len. 10]: But what is the latest news of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 19120 len. 37]: Mr. Peggotty , with a smile , put his hand in his breast-pocket , and produced a flat-folded , paper parcel , from which he took out , with much care , a little odd-looking newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 19121 len. 52]: ` You are to understan ' , Mas ' r Davy , ' said he , ` as we have left the Bush now , being so well to do ; and have gone right away round to Port Middlebay Harbour , wheer theer 's what we call a town . '
Parsing [sent. 19122 len. 11]: ` Mr. Micawber was in the Bush near you ? '
Parsing [sent. 19123 len. 21]: said I. ` Bless you , yes , ' said Mr. Peggotty , ` and turned to with a will .
Parsing [sent. 19124 len. 17]: I never wish to meet a better gen ` l'man for turning to with a will .
Parsing [sent. 19125 len. 32]: I 've seen that theer bald head of his a perspiring in the sun , Mas ' r Davy , till I a ` most thowt it would have melted away .
Parsing [sent. 19126 len. 9]: And now he 's a Magistrate . ' '
Parsing [sent. 19127 len. 6]: A Magistrate , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 19128 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 19129 len. 62]: Mr. Peggotty pointed to a certain paragraph in the newspaper , where I read aloud as follows , from the Port Middlebay Times : ` The public dinner to our distinguished fellow-colonist and townsman , WILKINS MICAWBER , ESQUIRE , Port Middlebay District Magistrate , came off yesterday in the large room of the Hotel , which was crowded to suffocation .
Parsing [sent. 19130 len. 31]: It is estimated that not fewer than forty-seven persons must have been accommodated with dinner at one time , exclusive of the company in the passage and on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 19131 len. 30]: The beauty , fashion , and exclusiveness of Port Middlebay , flocked to do honour to one so deservedly esteemed , so highly talented , and so widely popular .
Parsing [sent. 19132 len. 23]: Doctor Mell -LRB- of Colonial Salem-House Grammar School , Port Middlebay -RRB- presided , and on his right sat the distinguished guest .
Parsing [sent. 19133 len. 56]: After the removal of the cloth , and the singing of Non Nobis -LRB- beautifully executed , and in which we were at no loss to distinguish the bell-like notes of that gifted amateur , WILKINS MICAWBER , ESQUIRE , JUNIOR -RRB- , the usual loyal and patriotic toasts were severally given and rapturously received .
Parsing [sent. 19134 len. 23]: Doctor Mell , in a speech replete with feeling , then proposed `` Our distinguished Guest , the ornament of our town .
Parsing [sent. 19135 len. 27]: May he never leave us but to better himself , and may his success among us be such as to render his bettering himself impossible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19136 len. 11]: The cheering with which the toast was received defies description .
Parsing [sent. 19137 len. 14]: Again and again it rose and fell , like the waves of ocean .
Parsing [sent. 19138 len. 18]: At length all was hushed , and WILKINS MICAWBER , ESQUIRE , presented himself to return thanks .
Parsing [sent. 19139 len. 37]: Far be it from us , in the present comparatively imperfect state of the resources of our establishment , to endeavour to follow our distinguished townsman through the smoothly-flowing periods of his polished and highly-ornate address !
Parsing [sent. 19140 len. 63]: Suffice it to observe , that it was a masterpiece of eloquence ; and that those passages in which he more particularly traced his own successful career to its source , and warned the younger portion of his auditory from the shoals of ever incurring pecuniary liabilities which they were unable to liquidate , brought a tear into the manliest eye present .
Parsing [sent. 19141 len. 118]: The remaining toasts were DOCTOR MELL ; Mrs. MICAWBER -LRB- who gracefully bowed her acknowledgements from the side-door , where a galaxy of beauty was elevated on chairs , at once to witness and adorn the gratifying scene -RRB- , Mrs. RIDGER BEGS -LRB- late Miss Micawber -RRB- ; Mrs. MELL ; WILKINS MICAWBER , ESQUIRE , JUNIOR -LRB- who convulsed the assembly by humorously remarking that he found himself unable to return thanks in a speech , but would do so , with their permission , in a song -RRB- ; Mrs. MICAWBER 'S FAMILY -LRB- well known , it is needless to remark , in the mother-country -RRB- , & c. & c. & c .
Parsing [sent. 19142 len. 17]: At the conclusion of the proceedings the tables were cleared as if by art-magic for dancing .
Parsing [sent. 19143 len. 42]: Among the votaries of TERPSICHORE , who disported themselves until Sol gave warning for departure , Wilkins Micawber , Esquire , Junior , and the lovely and accomplished Miss Helena , fourth daughter of Doctor Mell , were particularly remarkable . '
Parsing [sent. 19144 len. 69]: I was looking back to the name of Doctor Mell , pleased to have discovered , in these happier circumstances , Mr. Mell , formerly poor pinched usher to my Middlesex magistrate , when Mr. Peggotty pointing to another part of the paper , my eyes rested on my own name , and I read thus : ' TO DAVID COPPERFIELD , ESQUIRE , ` THE EMINENT AUTHOR .
Parsing [sent. 19145 len. 35]: ` My Dear Sir , ` Years have elapsed , since I had an opportunity of ocularly perusing the lineaments , now familiar to the imaginations of a considerable portion of the civilized world .
Parsing [sent. 19146 len. 46]: ` But , my dear Sir , though estranged -LRB- by the force of circumstances over which I have had no control -RRB- from the personal society of the friend and companion of my youth , I have not been unmindful of his soaring flight .
Parsing [sent. 19147 len. 31]: Nor have I been debarred , Though seas between us braid ha ' roared , -LRB- BURNS -RRB- from participating in the intellectual feasts he has spread before us . '
Parsing [sent. 19148 len. 73]: I can not , therefore , allow of the departure from this place of an individual whom we mutually respect and esteem , without , my dear Sir , taking this public opportunity of thanking you , on my own behalf , and , I may undertake to add , on that of the whole of the Inhabitants of Port Middlebay , for the gratification of which you are the ministering agent .
Parsing [sent. 19149 len. 8]: ` Go on , my dear Sir !
Parsing [sent. 19150 len. 11]: You are not unknown here , you are not unappreciated .
Parsing [sent. 19151 len. 26]: Though `` remote '' , we are neither `` unfriended '' , `` melancholy '' , nor -LRB- I may add -RRB- `` slow '' .
Parsing [sent. 19152 len. 12]: Go on , my dear Sir , in your Eagle course !
Parsing [sent. 19153 len. 22]: The inhabitants of Port Middlebay may at least aspire to watch it , with delight , with entertainment , with instruction !
Parsing [sent. 19154 len. 41]: ` Among the eyes elevated towards you from this portion of the globe , will ever be found , while it has light and life , ` The ` Eye ` Appertaining to ` WILKINS MICAWBER , ` Magistrate . '
Parsing [sent. 19155 len. 26]: I found , on glancing at the remaining contents of the newspaper , that Mr. Micawber was a diligent and esteemed correspondent of that journal .
Parsing [sent. 19156 len. 60]: There was another letter from him in the same paper , touching a bridge ; there was an advertisement of a collection of similar letters by him , to be shortly republished , in a neat volume , ` with considerable additions ' ; and , unless I am very much mistaken , the Leading Article was his also .
Parsing [sent. 19157 len. 18]: We talked much of Mr. Micawber , on many other evenings while Mr. Peggotty remained with us .
Parsing [sent. 19158 len. 39]: He lived with us during the whole term of his stay , -- which , I think , was something less than a month , -- and his sister and my aunt came to London to see him .
Parsing [sent. 19159 len. 24]: Agnes and I parted from him aboard-ship , when he sailed ; and we shall never part from him more , on earth .
Parsing [sent. 19160 len. 30]: But before he left , he went with me to Yarmouth , to see a little tablet I had put up in the churchyard to the memory of Ham .
Parsing [sent. 19161 len. 32]: While I was copying the plain inscription for him at his request , I saw him stoop , and gather a tuft of grass from the grave and a little earth .
Parsing [sent. 19162 len. 19]: ` For Em ` ly , ' he said , as he put it in his breast . '
Parsing [sent. 19163 len. 9]: I promised , Mas ' r Davy . '
Parsing [sent. 19164 len. 12]: Chapter 64 A Last Retrospect And now my written story ends .
Parsing [sent. 19165 len. 18]: I look back , once more -- for the last time -- before I close these leaves .
Parsing [sent. 19166 len. 17]: I see myself , with Agnes at my side , journeying along the road of life .
Parsing [sent. 19167 len. 28]: I see our children and our friends around us ; and I hear the roar of many voices , not indifferent to me as I travel on .
Parsing [sent. 19168 len. 13]: What faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd ?
Parsing [sent. 19169 len. 16]: Lo , these ; all turning to me as I ask my thoughts the question !
Parsing [sent. 19170 len. 36]: Here is my aunt , in stronger spectacles , an old woman of four-score years and more , but upright yet , and a steady walker of six miles at a stretch in winter weather .
Parsing [sent. 19171 len. 63]: Always with her , here comes Peggotty , my good old nurse , likewise in spectacles , accustomed to do needle-work at night very close to the lamp , but never sitting down to it without a bit of wax candle , a yard-measure in a little house , and a work-box with a picture of St. Paul 's upon the lid .
Parsing [sent. 19172 len. 112]: The cheeks and arms of Peggotty , so hard and red in my childish days , when I wondered why the birds did n't peck her in preference to apples , are shrivelled now ; and her eyes , that used to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face , are fainter -LRB- though they glitter still -RRB- ; but her rough forefinger , which I once associated with a pocket nutmeg-grater , is just the same , and when I see my least child catching at it as it totters from my aunt to her , I think of our little parlour at home , when I could scarcely walk .
Parsing [sent. 19173 len. 11]: My aunt 's old disappointment is set right , now .
Parsing [sent. 19174 len. 23]: She is godmother to a real living Betsey Trotwood ; and Dora -LRB- the next in order -RRB- says she spoils her .
Parsing [sent. 19175 len. 9]: There is something bulky in Peggotty 's pocket .
Parsing [sent. 19176 len. 42]: It is nothing smaller than the Crocodile Book , which is in rather a dilapidated condition by this time , with divers of the leaves torn and stitched across , but which Peggotty exhibits to the children as a precious relic .
Parsing [sent. 19177 len. 35]: I find it very curious to see my own infant face , looking up at me from the Crocodile stories ; and to be reminded by it of my old acquaintance Brooks of Sheffield .
Parsing [sent. 19178 len. 36]: Among my boys , this summer holiday time , I see an old man making giant kites , and gazing at them in the air , with a delight for which there are no words .
Parsing [sent. 19179 len. 53]: He greets me rapturously , and whispers , with many nods and winks , ` Trotwood , you will be glad to hear that I shall finish the Memorial when I have nothing else to do , and that your aunt 's the most extraordinary woman in the world , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 19180 len. 43]: Who is this bent lady , supporting herself by a stick , and showing me a countenance in which there are some traces of old pride and beauty , feebly contending with a querulous , imbecile , fretful wandering of the mind ?
Parsing [sent. 19181 len. 26]: She is in a garden ; and near her stands a sharp , dark , withered woman , with a white scar on her lip .
Parsing [sent. 19182 len. 7]: Let me hear what they say .
Parsing [sent. 19183 len. 12]: ` Rosa , I have forgotten this gentleman 's name . '
Parsing [sent. 19184 len. 16]: Rosa bends over her , and calls to her , ` Mr. Copperfield . ' '
Parsing [sent. 19185 len. 9]: I am glad to see you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 19186 len. 10]: I am sorry to observe you are in mourning .
Parsing [sent. 19187 len. 10]: I hope Time will be good to you . '
Parsing [sent. 19188 len. 24]: Her impatient attendant scolds her , tells her I am not in mourning , bids her look again , tries to rouse her .
Parsing [sent. 19189 len. 15]: ` You have seen my son , sir , ' says the elder lady .
Parsing [sent. 19190 len. 6]: ` Are you reconciled ? '
Parsing [sent. 19191 len. 16]: Looking fixedly at me , she puts her hand to her forehead , and moans .
Parsing [sent. 19192 len. 17]: Suddenly , she cries , in a terrible voice , ` Rosa , come to me .
Parsing [sent. 19193 len. 5]: He is dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 19194 len. 32]: Rosa kneeling at her feet , by turns caresses her , and quarrels with her ; now fiercely telling her , ' I loved him better than you ever did ! '
Parsing [sent. 19195 len. 15]: - now soothing her to sleep on her breast , like a sick child .
Parsing [sent. 19196 len. 23]: Thus I leave them ; thus I always find them ; thus they wear their time away , from year to year .
Parsing [sent. 19197 len. 28]: What ship comes sailing home from India , and what English lady is this , married to a growling old Scotch Croesus with great flaps of ears ?
Parsing [sent. 19198 len. 6]: Can this be Julia Mills ?
Parsing [sent. 19199 len. 49]: Indeed it is Julia Mills , peevish and fine , with a black man to carry cards and letters to her on a golden salver , and a copper-coloured woman in linen , with a bright handkerchief round her head , to serve her Tiffin in her dressing-room .
Parsing [sent. 19200 len. 35]: But Julia keeps no diary in these days ; never sings Affection 's Dirge ; eternally quarrels with the old Scotch Croesus , who is a sort of yellow bear with a tanned hide .
Parsing [sent. 19201 len. 17]: Julia is steeped in money to the throat , and talks and thinks of nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 19202 len. 10]: I liked her better in the Desert of Sahara .
Parsing [sent. 19203 len. 9]: Or perhaps this IS the Desert of Sahara !
Parsing [sent. 19204 len. 37]: For , though Julia has a stately house , and mighty company , and sumptuous dinners every day , I see no green growth near her ; nothing that can ever come to fruit or flower .
Parsing [sent. 19205 len. 44]: What Julia calls ` society ' , I see ; among it Mr. Jack Maldon , from his Patent Place , sneering at the hand that gave it him , and speaking to me of the Doctor as ` so charmingly antique ' .
Parsing [sent. 19206 len. 54]: But when society is the name for such hollow gentlemen and ladies , Julia , and when its breeding is professed indifference to everything that can advance or can retard mankind , I think we must have lost ourselves in that same Desert of Sahara , and had better find the way out .
Parsing [sent. 19207 len. 31]: And lo , the Doctor , always our good friend , labouring at his Dictionary -LRB- somewhere about the letter D -RRB- , and happy in his home and wife .
Parsing [sent. 19208 len. 23]: Also the Old Soldier , on a considerably reduced footing , and by no means so influential as in days of yore !
Parsing [sent. 19209 len. 53]: Working at his chambers in the Temple , with a busy aspect , and his hair -LRB- where he is not bald -RRB- made more rebellious than ever by the constant friction of his lawyer 's - wig , I come , in a later time , upon my dear old Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 19210 len. 39]: His table is covered with thick piles of papers ; and I say , as I look around me : ` If Sophy were your clerk , now , Traddles , she would have enough to do ! '
Parsing [sent. 19211 len. 10]: ` You may say that , my dear Copperfield !
Parsing [sent. 19212 len. 12]: But those were capital days , too , in Holborn Court !
Parsing [sent. 19213 len. 5]: Were they not ? '
Parsing [sent. 19214 len. 11]: ` When she told you you would be a judge ?
Parsing [sent. 19215 len. 10]: But it was not the town talk then ! '
Parsing [sent. 19216 len. 27]: ` At all events , ' says Traddles , ` if I ever am one -- ' ` Why , you know you will be . '
Parsing [sent. 19217 len. 25]: ` Well , my dear Copperfield , WHEN I am one , I shall tell the story , as I said I would . '
Parsing [sent. 19218 len. 8]: We walk away , arm in arm .
Parsing [sent. 19219 len. 11]: I am going to have a family dinner with Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 19220 len. 25]: It is Sophy 's birthday ; and , on our road , Traddles discourses to me of the good fortune he has enjoyed . '
Parsing [sent. 19221 len. 20]: I really have been able , my dear Copperfield , to do all that I had most at heart .
Parsing [sent. 19222 len. 80]: There 's the Reverend Horace promoted to that living at four hundred and fifty pounds a year ; there are our two boys receiving the very best education , and distinguishing themselves as steady scholars and good fellows ; there are three of the girls married very comfortably ; there are three more living with us ; there are three more keeping house for the Reverend Horace since Mrs. Crewler 's decease ; and all of them happy . '
Parsing [sent. 19223 len. 7]: ` Except -- ' I suggest .
Parsing [sent. 19224 len. 9]: ` Except the Beauty , ' says Traddles .
Parsing [sent. 19225 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 19226 len. 12]: It was very unfortunate that she should marry such a vagabond .
Parsing [sent. 19227 len. 14]: But there was a certain dash and glare about him that caught her .
Parsing [sent. 19228 len. 26]: However , now we have got her safe at our house , and got rid of him , we must cheer her up again . '
Parsing [sent. 19229 len. 31]: Traddles 's house is one of the very houses -- or it easily may have been -- which he and Sophy used to parcel out , in their evening walks .
Parsing [sent. 19230 len. 42]: It is a large house ; but Traddles keeps his papers in his dressing-room and his boots with his papers ; and he and Sophy squeeze themselves into upper rooms , reserving the best bedrooms for the Beauty and the girls .
Parsing [sent. 19231 len. 38]: There is no room to spare in the house ; for more of ` the girls ' are here , and always are here , by some accident or other , than I know how to count .
Parsing [sent. 19232 len. 34]: Here , when we go in , is a crowd of them , running down to the door , and handing Traddles about to be kissed , until he is out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 19233 len. 68]: Here , established in perpetuity , is the poor Beauty , a widow with a little girl ; here , at dinner on Sophy 's birthday , are the three married girls with their three husbands , and one of the husband 's brothers , and another husband 's cousin , and another husband 's sister , who appears to me to be engaged to the cousin .
Parsing [sent. 19234 len. 49]: Traddles , exactly the same simple , unaffected fellow as he ever was , sits at the foot of the large table like a Patriarch ; and Sophy beams upon him , from the head , across a cheerful space that is certainly not glittering with Britannia metal .
Parsing [sent. 19235 len. 21]: And now , as I close my task , subduing my desire to linger yet , these faces fade away .
Parsing [sent. 19236 len. 27]: But one face , shining on me like a Heavenly light by which I see all other objects , is above them and beyond them all .
Parsing [sent. 19237 len. 4]: And that remains .
Parsing [sent. 19238 len. 17]: I turn my head , and see it , in its beautiful serenity , beside me .
Parsing [sent. 19239 len. 29]: My lamp burns low , and I have written far into the night ; but the dear presence , without which I were nothing , bears me company .
Parsing [sent. 19240 len. 49]: O Agnes , O my soul , so may thy face be by me when I close my life indeed ; so may I , when realities are melting from me , like the shadows which I now dismiss , still find thee near me , pointing upward !
