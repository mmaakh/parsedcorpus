Parsing [sent. 1 len. 42]: A Houseful of Girls By Mrs George de Horne Vaizey Another book by Mrs de Horne Vaizey , also known as Jessie Mansergh , about the lives of five girls in one family , and their friends , in Edwardian times .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 32]: Of course every time there is a major event , such as an engagement , or the cancellation of one , the different girls all have different takes on the situation .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 14]: NH A HOUSEFUL OF GIRLS BY MRS GEORGE DE HORNE VAIZEY CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 5]: HALF A DOZEN DAUGHTERS .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 53]: There were six of them altogether -- six great big girls , -- and they lived in a great big house , in the middle of a long high road , one end of which loses itself in London town , while the other goes stretching away over the county of Hertford .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 54]: Years ago , John Gilpin had ridden his famous race down that very road , and Christabel loved to look out of her bedroom window and imagine that she saw him flying along , with his poor bald head bared to the _ breeze _ , and the bottles swinging on either side .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 63]: She had cut a picture of him out of a book and tacked it on her wall , for , as she explained to Agatha , her special sister , she felt it a duty to support `` local talent , '' and , so far as she could discover , Gilpin was the only celebrity who had ever patronised the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 55]: Christabel was the youngest of the family -- a position which , as every one knows , is only second in importance to that of the eldest , and , in this instance , Maud was so sweet and unassuming that the haughty young person of fourteen ruled her with a rod of iron .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 61]: Fair-haired Lilias was a full-fledged young lady , and Nan had had all her dresses let down , and was supposed to have her hair up ; but as a matter of fact it was more often down than not , for it was heavy and plentiful , and Nan 's ten thumbs could by no chance fasten it securely .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 88]: Hair-pins littered the schoolroom floor , hair-pins stood out aggressively against the white paint on the stairs , hair-pins nestled in the little creases of velvet chairs : there were hair-pins , hair-pins everywhere , except just where they should have been -- on Nan 's dressing - table ; and here there was such a dearth of these useful articles , that on one memorable occasion she had been compelled to effect a coiffure with the aid of a piece of string and a broken comb .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 57]: The effect was striking for a good ten minutes , and then came the inevitable collapse ; but , `` Dear me , '' as Nan observed , `` accidents will happen , and what is the use of making a fuss about a thing like that , when the world is full of suffering ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 101]: Elsie thanked her stars that she was only sixteen , and need not be `` grown-up '' for two long years to come ; but when her younger sisters grew obtrusive , she suddenly remembered that she would be seventeen in three months ' time , and would have them know that she was to be treated with respect ; and , in spite of daily discussions , feuds , and battles , the girls all loved each other dearly , and believed that such a charming and highly endowed family had never before existed in the annals of Christendom .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 38]: As a matter of fact , the Rendell girls had claim to one great distinction -- promiscuous accomplishments had been discarded in their case , and each had been brought up to do some one thing well .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 28]: Maud was musical , and practised scales two hours a day as a preliminary before settling down for another two or three hours of sonatas and fugues .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 28]: Elsie locked herself in her bedroom for a like period , and the wails of her violin came floating downstairs like the lament of a lost soul .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 53]: Nan appropriated a chilly attic , carved wood and her fingers at the same time , and clanged away at copper work , knocking her nails black and blue with ill-directed strokes of the hammer , as she manufactured the panels which were fitted into her oak carving with such artistic effect .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 64]: Lilias declared sweetly that she was too stupid to do anything , but privately reflected that at least she had mastered the art of looking charming ; and what did it matter if she _ were _ useless , since with her beauty she would certainly marry a duke on the first opportunity , and be spirited away to a life of luxury !
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 35]: As for Agatha and Christabel , they were supposed to devote themselves to the study of languages and the domestic arts , but in private conclave they had already decided on their future career .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 31]: They were to keep a select academy for young ladies , in which they would correct all those glaring errors of governess and mother under which they themselves had groaned .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 16]: `` I can bear it better when I feel it is for a good end .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 11]: Our girls shall never suffer as I am suffering ! ''
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 44]: said Chrissie , with an air of martyrdom , when she was ordered to bed at nine o'clock , and remorselessly roused from slumber at seven a.m. `` If grown-ups were sensible , they would allow a child to follow its own instinct .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 24]: Nature must surely know better than mothers ; and my nature tells me to sit up at nights and have breakfast in bed .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 19]: To be sent off as if one were a child in arms is really too horribly trying ! ''
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 9]: `` And when Mr Barr was there too !
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 3]: So degrading !
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 22]: Last night he was talking to me about books , and I 'm sure he thought I was quite grown up .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 17]: The table was between us , you know , so he could n't see my legs .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 32]: I was enjoying myself so much , and saying that I thought Thackeray much over - rated , when mother came up and said , ` Time for bed , Chickie !
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 4]: Run away ! '
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 12]: I assure you , I _ blushed _ with mortification . ''
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 4]: `` Piteous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 11]: said Christabel , bringing out her pet word with emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 8]: `` They never think of our feelings .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 21]: I shall make it a rule to study the characters of our young ladies , and avoid wounding their susceptibilities .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 7]: I know how it feels ! ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 45]: In spite of their many sufferings , however , the Rendells would one and all have been ready to declare that there never had been , might , could , would , or should be , such another father and mother as they possessed .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 110]: To have a son at college , and yourself carry off a prize at a tennis tournament , was surely a feat to be proud of on the part of a father ; and what joy to have a tiny little scrap of a mother , who could be petted like a child and lifted up in the arms of the youngest daughter -- a mother who had solved the problem of eternal youth , and looked so pretty and so meek , that it was a constant marvel where on earth she managed to stow that colossal will-power before which every member of the household bowed and trembled .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 20]: The Rendells ' house was at once the brightest , the airiest , and the noisiest in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 28]: As there were only six daughters , it can truthfully be asserted that there were never more than half a dozen girls talking at the same moment .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 60]: Strangers passing beneath the schoolroom window at a moment when the sisters were assembled together , had indeed been known to estimate the numbers present as from a dozen to twenty ; but such a statement was obviously false , and tended to that painful habit of exaggeration which it is the duty of all good folk to deplore .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 54]: They were girls of strong individuality , and each felt it a duty to state her own views on any given subject , which she proceeded to do , undaunted by the fact that her companions were too much engrossed in talking themselves to be able to listen to a word she said .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 61]: Maud talked , pouring out tea and dropping sugar into the cups with tragic emphasis ; Lilias prattled sweetly , waving her white hands to enforce a point which no one heard ; Nan banged the table and upset her cup in violence of denunciation ; Elsie squeaked away in melancholy treble ; and Agatha 's `` Too bad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 8]: and Christabel 's `` Horrid shame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 7]: were heard uninterruptedly in every pause .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 54]: When the door of the Grange opened to admit a stranger , the wail of a violin , the jingle of the piano , and the clang of Nan 's hammer greeted him on the threshold , and from morn till night the echo of laughter and of happy voices never died away .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 46]: There was only one occasion when the Rendell girls subsided into silence , and that was when Jim -- the brother , the typical man of the race -- came home on a visit and shed the lustre of his presence on his native village .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 36]: Then the Miss Rendells sat in rows at his feet , paying obeisance , and , meekly opening their mouths , swallowed all he said , not even Nan herself daring to raise a question .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 4]: A HAPPY THOUGHT .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 29]: Thurston House , the abode of the Rendell family , was one of those curiously-constructed houses which are only to be met with in old - fashioned neighbourhoods .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 39]: It stood directly on the high road , a big grey building which could boast of no architectural beauty , and which indeed presented a somewhat cheerless aspect , with its wire blinds and tall , straight windows .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 54]: A gaunt , town-like house -- such was the impression made upon the casual passer -- by ; but appearances are apt to be deceptive , and that same stranger would have speedily altered his impression , if he had been taken round the garden to view the other side of the house .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 12]: It was almost impossible to believe in such a different aspect !
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 102]: From one side a busy high road , strings of cyclists , _ char a bancs _ driving past , bearing parties of brawling trippers , clouds of dust , the echo of the drivers ' horns , and the continued whirl of wheels ; and on the other -- deep bay windows looking on to a lawn of softest green , winding paths shaded with grand old trees , and , beyond all , a meadow stretching down to the riverside , where punt and canoe stood waiting in happy proximity , and clumps of bamboos flourished in eastern luxuriance .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 53]: `` Our country house , '' the girls called the rooms facing south , `` Our town house , '' those at the front ; but though they adored the garden , and spent every available moment out of doors , the busy high road still held an attraction of its own .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 67]: Mrs Rendell had her own entertaining rooms at the back of the house , but the girls were faithful to the little porch chamber which had been their property since childhood -- a quaint little den built over the doorway , with a window at each of the three sides , through which an extended view was afforded of the comings and goings of the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 13]: `` I love this dear little bower , '' sighed Lilias sentimentally .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 11]: `` There 's something so quaint and old-world about it .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 17]: I feel like Elaine in her turret-chamber , looking out upon the great wide world . ''
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 46]: `` And it 's such sport watching the people pass , especially on rainy days when the wind is high , and they are trying to hold up their dresses , and carry an umbrella and half a dozen parcels at the same time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 6]: cried Nan with a relish .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 22]: `` Last Saturday was the very worst day of the year , and all the good housewives went past to shop .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 23]: Chrissie and Agatha and I offered a prize to go to the one who guessed rightly who would have the muddiest boots .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 6]: It was lovely watching them !
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 82]: Old Mrs Rowe , clutching her dress in front , and showing all her ankles , while at the back it was trailing on the ground ; Mrs Smith , stalking like a grenadier , with a skimpy skirt and snow-shoes a yard long ; dear , sweet little Mrs Bruce , as neat as ever , with not a single splash ; and Mrs Booth , splattered right up to her waist , with boots as white as that rag .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 20]: I had her name on my paper , so I got the prize , and spent it in caramels .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 18]: I 'm getting rather tired of caramels -- I 've had such a run on them lately .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 11]: I must turn to something else for a change . ''
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 17]: `` You are getting too old to eat sweets , Nan , '' said Lilias severely .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 11]: `` You ought to set the children a better example .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 25]: If all the money you spend at the confectioner 's was put together , you would be surprised to find how much it was .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 13]: And it 's bad for your teeth to eat so much sugar .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 17]: Why do n't you save up , and put it to some really good use ? ''
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 15]: `` Such as frilling , and ribbons , and combs for the hair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 38]: suggested Nan slily , rolling her eyes at the younger girls , who chuckled in the consciousness that Lilias had got her answer this time at least , since every one knew well how her pocket-money went !
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 12]: `` What is your idea of something useful , my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 29]: We 'd be pleased to take into consideration any scheme which you may have to propose , but in its present form the suggestion is somewhat vague . ''
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 20]: `` My dear child , you know as well as I do that there are a hundred different ways .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 8]: The only difficulty is to choose . ''
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 29]: Lilias stared out of the window , trying hard to cudgel up one idea out of the specified hundred , in case she should be pressed still further .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 18]: That was the worst of Nan , she always persisted on pushing a subject to the end .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 15]: `` You -- er -- you might help the poor of the parish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 6]: `` Just what we do !
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 20]: I heard the vicar say myself that Mrs Evans was a striving little woman who ought to be supported .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 15]: If we took away our custom -- '' `` I mean the really poor .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 25]: Mrs Evans would not shut up shop for the want of your threepenny-pieces , but the Mission at Sale is always short of funds .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 17]: If you had a collecting-box , you could send in a subscription at Christmas . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 24]: ` The Misses Margaret , Elsa , Agatha , and Christabel Rendell -- four and sixpence halfpenny , ' '' quoted Chrissie derisively .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 35]: She marched across the room and stationed herself with her back to the fire , her thin face looking forth from a cloud of hair , an expression of dignified disdain curling her lips .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 10]: `` How important it sounds , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 55]: It 's all very well talking about saving up , Lilias , but it 's not so easy to do with sixpence a week , and birthdays every month , and Christmas presents , and pencils and indiarubbers , and always seeing fresh things in the shop - windows that you want to buy .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 54]: It 's not that I would n't like to help : if I had a sovereign , I 'd give it at once , but I wo n't be put down in the list for eighteenpence , and that 's all I could save , if I tried , from now to Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 27]: I gave a threepenny-bit to old ` Chairs to mend ' only last Saturday , and one the week before to a woman who was begging .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 7]: I am most charitably disposed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 16]: `` So am I , '' agreed Agatha -- `` especially when it 's cold .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 18]: Rags would n't be so bad in summer , but they must be awfully draughty in winter .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 17]: And I spend less in sweets than any of the others , because my teeth ache .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 29]: I 've often wished we could do something for the Mission ; but I 'm so poor , and I sha 'n' t get any goose-money till autumn .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 16]: I wish we could think of some plan by which we could make some more .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 9]: Chrissie and I are always talking about it .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 14]: There seems so few ways in which girls of fourteen can make money .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 25]: We thought of writing and asking the editor of the employment column ; but mother laughed at us , and said it was nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 8]: It 's not nonsense to us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 16]: `` If we could only have a sale of work , '' said Lilias slowly .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 44]: She was still staring dreamily out of the window , and hardly realised what she was saying , but the other four girls turned sharply towards each other , and a flash of delight passed from one pair of eyes to the other .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 4]: `` Ah-ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 3]: sighed Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 4]: `` Splendiferous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 3]: cried Nan .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 6]: `` How simp-lay love-lay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 40]: drawled Christabel , with the languid elegance of manner for which she was distinguished ; and Agatha beamed broadly all over her good-humoured face , oblivious of the sufferings of the poor in the prospect of her own amusement .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 7]: `` What fun we should have !
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 11]: I 'd bake the cakes and manage the refreshment stall !
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 20]: Tea and coffee , threepence a cup ; lemonade , fourpence ; fruit salad , sixpence a plate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 27]: `` I 'd sell toffee in tins , and have a pin-cushion table , and make every single soul I know give me a contribution . ''
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 9]: `` I 'd give my new oak bracket .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 7]: No , it 's too big .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 21]: I could n't spare that ; but I 'd carve something else ; and make little brass trays and panels .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 9]: ` High art stall : Miss Margaret Rendell .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 21]: Objects of bigotry and virtue to be handed over to her , ' and do n't you forget it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 14]: `` I 'll take visitors out in the punt at threepence a head .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 54]: I 'm so stupid that I ca n't do any work , but the idea is mine , and that ought to count for something , '' said Lilias ; and a vision rose before her eyes of a slim white figure gracefully handling the pole as the punt glided down the stream .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 24]: Punting was a most becoming occupation ; on the whole she could not have hit on a pleasanter manner of helping the cause .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 13]: `` I daresay I shall make quite a lot of money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 25]: she added cheerfully ; and her sisters laughed with the half-indulgent , half-derisive laughter with which they were accustomed to greet Lilias 's sayings .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 38]: She was so sweetly unconscious of her own selfishness , and looked so pretty as she turned her big bewildered eyes from one to the other , that they had not the heart to disturb her equanimity .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 33]: `` The punt is a good idea , '' admitted Nan , `` for people are always pleased to go on the river , and we must turn our advantages to account .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 11]: A garden sale , that 's what we must have !
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 21]: Little tables dotted about the lawn beneath Japanese umbrellas ; tea in a tent , and seats under the trees .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 26]: We can use all the properties that mother keeps for her garden parties , and make it just as pretty and attractive as can be .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 21]: I should n't wonder if we made a lot of money , for we shall be so original and ingenious .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 8]: People are so stupid in this world .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 12]: I always feel I could do things so much better myself .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 14]: Who wants to go to a stuffy old bazaar in the Mission Room ?
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 4]: No one does !
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 8]: They go from a sense of duty .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 22]: Mother groans and says , ` Oh dear , if I could only give a subscription and be done with it !
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 5]: More cosies and chairbacks !
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 7]: I 've a drawerful already ! '
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 6]: And bazaar things are hideous !
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 34]: Father gave me ten shillings to spend at the Christmas sale , and I wandered round and round like a lost sheep , and could n't see a single thing that I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 12]: In the end I bought a cover for _ Bradshaw _ .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 25]: It was n't a bit useful , for I never have a _ Bradshaw _ ; but it was the nicest thing I saw .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 22]: Now , let us solemnly resolve not to have anything on our stalls that will not reflect credit on our judgment .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 16]: Nothing ugly , nothing useless , nothing vulgar -- '' `` Impossible , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 5]: Ca n't be managed .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 15]: It 's the law of Nature that the kindest-hearted people have the least taste .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 22]: I do n't know why it should be so , but it is , and I 'll prove it to you .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 28]: If we announced that we were going to have a sale of work and asked for contributions , who would be the first people to respond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 16]: Christabel thrust out her left hand and began checking off the fingers with dramatic emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 17]: `` Miss Ross , -- Mrs Hudson , -- Mary Field , -- old Jane Evans .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 39]: ` So pleased to hear that the dear children are interesting themselves in the welfare of their poor brothers and sisters , and I 've brought round a few wool mats as a little expression of sympathy ! '
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 6]: -- that 's Mrs Ross !
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 47]: Then Mary Ann would hobble up with a parcel wrapped up in a handkerchief , and kiss us all twice over , and say , ` I 've brought round a piece of my own fancy work , lovies , as a contribution for your sale .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 47]: My sight is not what it used to be , and it 's difficult to get the material one would like in this little place ; but shaded silks always look well , and I made the fringe myself out of odd pieces of wool . '
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 9]: And _ that 's _ not the worst !
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 20]: Mrs Hudson would paint bulrushes on cream-pots , and forget-me-nots on tambourines , and come round bristling with importance .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 25]: ` I always find fancy work is overdone at sales , so I thought a little of my hand - painting would be acceptable !
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 20]: No one needs more than a dozen cosies , but every one is glad of an extra tambourine ! '
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 22]: ... It 's easy to talk , my dear , but what could you do when it came to the point ?
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 14]: There 's nothing for it but to smile , and look pleased . ''
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 49]: `` I should say politely , but firmly , that I could not find it in my heart to deprive them of such treasures -- that with so many deserving objects craving support , it would be pure selfishness on our part to monopolise all the good things !
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 21]: Such munificence was far , far more than we deserved , and would they kindly send a little cake instead ?
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 27]: They would be delighted , for they are everlastingly giving to some mission or other , and are always in a rush to get work finished .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 13]: But I do n't propose to let things reach such a climax .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 12]: I would n't hurt their dear old feelings for the world .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 24]: So we will say at once that we want cake and fruit , and we shall get the very best of its kind .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 48]: We must fix our date for the strawberry season ; for the human heart is desperately wicked , and people will gladly pay sixpence to sit under trees and eat strawberries and cream , when wild horses would n't drag twopence out of them for a pen-wiper .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 12]: I expect we shall succeed best with punting and refreshments . ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 6]: `` If it 's fine !
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 12]: But it wo n't be fine -- it will pour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 29]: said Elsie gloomily , and wagged her head in the hopeless manner of one who has tasted deeply of the world , and knew its hollowness by heart .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 35]: If there was by chance a cheerful _ and _ a melancholy view to be taken on any subject , Elsie invariably chose the melancholy one , and gloated over it with ghoulish enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 41]: She was never so happy as when she was miserable , -- as an Irishman would have had it , -- and hugged the conviction that she was `` unappreciated '' by her family , and a victim of fate .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 29]: She shed tears over _ Misunderstood _ in the solitude of her chamber , and cultivated an expression of patient martyrdom , as most fitted for her condition .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 71]: Occasionally she forgot herself so far as to be cheery and playful ; but her feelings were so ultrasensitive that they were bound to be wounded by some thoughtlessness on the part of her sisters before many hours were over , when she would remember her own unhappiness , and roam away by herself to the other end of the garden to apostrophise the heavens and pity her hard lot .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 8]: `` It will be sure to pour !
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 12]: It always does pour when we want to do anything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 21]: she declared ; upon which Nan threw her book into the air and caught it again with a dexterous movement .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 3]: `` Fiddle-de-dee !
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 40]: It 's going to be a bright , glorious summer day , with just enough sun to be warm and not enough to be hot , and just enough wind to be cool and not enough to be cold .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 47]: And the grass is going to be dry and the strawberries ripe ; and all the pretty ladies and gentlemen are going to drive over from miles and miles around , and spend so much money that they will have none left to take them home .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 7]: What is the use of croaking ?
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 35]: If things go wrong , it 's bad enough to have to bear them at the time ; but until then imagination is our own , and we will make the most of it .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 20]: It will not pour , my dear Raven ; so do n't let me hear you say so again !
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 26]: Make up your mind that this sale is going to be a success , and try to bear it as well as you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 20]: Elsie looked up at the corner of the ceiling , and arched her eyebrows in resigned and submissive fashion .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 60]: When the rain did come , -- as of course it would , -- when all the fancy work was drenched and the pretty dresses spoiled , the girls would remember her prophecy , and be compelled to acknowledge its correctness ; but till then she would suffer in silence , and refuse to be drawn into vulgar argument .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 40]: So she determined , at least ; but a fiery temptation assailed her in the form of another objection , so unanswerable that it was not in human nature to resist hurling it at the heads of her companions .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 28]: `` I hope you are right , I am sure ; but , all the same , it is rather early in the day to make arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 7]: You are counting without your host .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 18]: How can you tell that mother will consent to let you have the sale at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 29]: And at that the listeners hung their heads and were silent , for it was indeed useless to build castles unless they were first assured of this foundation .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 4]: A NEW NEIGHBOUR .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 33]: After dinner that evening the six girls assembled in the drawing-room , and little Mrs Rendell sat in their midst on a low chair drawn up in the centre of the fireplace .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 45]: A grey silk dress fitted closely to the lines of her tiny figure , two minute little slippers were placed upon the fender , and the diamonds flashed on her fingers as she held up a fan to protect her face from the blaze .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 47]: She looked ridiculously young and pretty , to be the mother of those six big girls ; and a stranger looking in at the scene would have put her down as a helpless little creature , too meek and gentle to cope with such heavy responsibilities .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 8]: But the stranger would have been mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 38]: `` Mother darling , '' said Christabel insinuatingly , `` granting always that you are the kindest and most amiable of mothers , do you happen to feel in an extra specially angelic temper this evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 8]: `` An ` oh-certainly-my-darlings-do-whatever-you-please ' temper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 37]: chimed in Nan sweetly ; `` because if you do -- '' `` I hope I shall never be so forgetful of my duties as to say anything so indiscreet , '' replied Mrs Rendell firmly .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 10]: `` Margaret , your hair is tumbling down again !
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 14]: Kneel down , and let me fasten it for you at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 31]: Nan knelt down meekly , her roguish face on a level with her mother 's , and the brown coils were twisted and hair-pinned together with swift , decided fingers .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 12]: `` You must do it like this -- do you see !
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 9]: -- tighter , closer , more firmly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 6]: `` Yes , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 27]: `` It 's disgraceful that a big girl like you -- a girl nearly eighteen -- should not be able to do her own hair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 6]: `` Yes , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 35]: `` You would n't like to be known as the girl with the untidy hair , I suppose , or to have a collapse of this sort in church or in the street ? ''
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 6]: `` No , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 11]: `` Then pray , my dear , be more careful .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 10]: Do n't let me have to speak again . ''
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 7]: `` I 'll try , mother .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 9]: A rough head , but a loving heart !
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 27]: You might kiss me now and say you 're sorry , for you stuck two hair-pins right into my scalp , and I never winced ! ''
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 15]: Mrs Rendell smiled , and laid a gentle hand on the girl 's cheek .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 44]: For one moment her dignified airs seemed to vanish , and nothing but motherly tenderness shone in her eyes , but the next she drew herself up again , stiff as a little poker , and said lightly -- `` Nonsense , nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 11]: Get up , child , and do n't be ridiculous !
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 11]: Sit on that high chair , and do n't stoop !
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 14]: I ca n't endure to see a young girl lounging on a couch .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 15]: What is this new scheme that you wish to ask me about to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 13]: `` Mother dear , you know you like us to be charitable !
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 44]: You are always preaching -- er , I mean impressing upon us -- that we ought to remember the poah , '' said Christabel , standing up as stiff as a grenadier , and smiling at her mother in her most ingratiating manner .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 58]: Mrs Rendell would have died rather than acknowledge a special weakness towards any member of her flock ; but as a matter of fact her youngest-born possessed a power of wheedling favours which none of her sisters could boast , and was herself agreeably conscious of the fact , and fond of putting it to the test .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 21]: `` I am sure you will approve of our scheme , and feel pleased with us for thinking of it .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 6]: It 's for the Mission .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 20]: We thought of getting up a little sale among ourselves , and giving the proceeds towards the funds . ''
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 24]: `` It is so little that we can give ; but if we devote our time and strength '' -- murmured Lilias prettily .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 26]: `` It all adds up when you put it together , '' said practical Agatha ; `` and you can stick on such awful prices .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 24]: Chrissie and I thought we might have the refreshments and a pin-cushion stall , and set out little tables on the lawn . ''
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 6]: `` Such jolly fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 3]: gushed Nan .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 29]: `` Every one would come ; and we would have games , and sports , and sails in the boats , and something to pay wherever they went .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 32]: The young ones would stay , after the others had gone , to eat up the strawberries , and we would have pounds and pounds to give to the secretary . ''
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 5]: `` Of strawberries ? ''
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 5]: queried Mrs Rendell coldly .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 11]: `` Your English , Nan , is painful to hear .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 18]: I think I shall write down some of your sentences and give them to you to parse .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 9]: Then perhaps you may realise how they sound !
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 6]: A sale for the Mission !
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 6]: That is an ambitious idea .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 22]: How do you propose to get together enough work to fill a single stall , much less three or four ? ''
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 18]: `` There are five months before July , and we would work like niggers all the time .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 24]: Nan would carve , we would sew , all our friends would help , and we would make money by tea and refreshments .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 20]: Really and truly , we could do very well , if you would only say ` Yes ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 8]: `` And we should so enjoy it !
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 37]: It 's horrid having nothing to look forward to ; and if there was this in prospect , we should be busy and occupied , and the wet days would n't seem half so long ! ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 15]: `` Now , let us understand each other , '' said Mrs Rendell briskly .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 18]: `` Is this scheme proposed for your own amusement , or for the good of the Mission ?
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 35]: One says one thing , one another , and I ca n't make up my mind whether I am asked to consent to a charity or to a novel form of garden - party .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 14]: I should like to have that point settled before we go any further .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 10]: Are you thinking of yourselves or your neighbours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 2]: Silence .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 8]: The sisters looked at one another askance .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 31]: Elsie sighed and shook her head , Agatha flushed to the roots of her hair , only Nan retained her composure , and said daringly -- `` Both , mother .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 35]: We began by saying that we should like to give a contribution , but we had so little money that it seemed hardly worth while sending it ; and then the sale was suggested .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 24]: The first idea was to help the Mission , but we did think that it would be good fun for ourselves as well !
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 10]: There is no harm in that , is there ?
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 28]: You have said lots of times that you love cheerful givers , and it must be better to do a thing willingly than grumbling all the time .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 35]: Do people who get up bazaars never think of the fun , and the dresses , and the meeting with their friends , but only just of the charity for which they are working ?
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 11]: Oh , mother , I do n't believe they do !
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 15]: I 've heard you say yourself -- '' `` Nan , Nan , Nan !
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 6]: I object to be quoted !
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 27]: It is dreadful to have an audience of six girls swallowing every word , and bringing them up in judgment on the first convenient opportunity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 23]: Mrs Rendell showed her pretty teeth in a smile of amusement , and returned to the subject in hand with suspicious haste .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 55]: `` Well , you are honest , at any rate , and so long as you keep the idea of helping others to the fore , and do n't allow it to be crowded out by the thought of your own enjoyment , I do n't see anything to object to in your scheme .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 10]: No ; I do n't give my consent yet !
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 19]: You must think it over quietly for a week , and be quite sure of your own minds .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 34]: A sale would involve more work than you think ; for you will have to give up time and money and do the thing thoroughly , if you once take it in hand .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 41]: I will promise nothing to-night ; for I wonder how many times you have come to me brimming over with enthusiasm about some new plan , and how often it has collapsed like a bubble in a couple of days !
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 7]: You are such changeable children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 7]: `` Oh , Mummy , come !
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 11]: Call things by their nice names , '' pleaded Nan .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 25]: `` It 's not fickleness -- it 's fertility of imagination ; it 's not a collapse -- it 's only a fresh beginning !
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 19]: But we really mean it this time , and you mean to say ` Yes , ' too .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 21]: I know you do ; so nothing now remains but to talk it over with Kitty in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 5]: `` Ah , yes !
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 40]: Until Kitty has been consulted nothing can be called certain , '' said Mrs Rendell , smiling again ; and as she spoke she lifted her head in a listening gesture , and pushed her stool from the fire .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 57]: She had heard the opening of a door , and knew that her husband had finished his after-dinner cigar and was on his way to the drawing-room ; and the next moment he appeared on the threshold , looked round the group by the fire , and threw himself in a chair by Nan 's side .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 6]: `` Well , Mops ! ''
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 64]: The big hand descended on the girl 's head , and ruffled the locks which had been so carefully put in order , while she turned up her face with a beaming smile , for there was a special bond of union between herself and her father , and they aided and abetted each other in mischief like a couple of merry children .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 9]: `` Well , Mops , how goes it ?
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 10]: What pranks have you been up to to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 9]: `` Oh , father , none at all .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 13]: I 've behaved beautifully -- just like a real , grown-up lady !
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 25]: In the morning I pursued my avocations , and in the afternoon I went out calling , with light kid gloves and a card-case .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 23]: Every one was out but old Mrs Reed , and you would have loved it if you could have heard us talk !
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 9]: We discussed the weather in all its branches .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 21]: Cold -- dampy-cold -- dry cold ; warm -- close-warm -- breezy warm ; hot , thundery hot , scorching .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 50]: She told me which of each she liked best , and which her poor dear mother had liked best ; and I lingered on and on , hoping they would bring in tea , until at last I yawned so much that I was obliged to come away unfed .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 18]: Then I had cold tea and scraps in the schoolroom , and we discussed charitable agencies . ''
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 12]: `` Oh , Nan , Nan , this will never do !
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 7]: You are getting altogether too civilised .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 17]: I shall have no playmate left at this rate , '' cried her father , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 25]: `` Ca n't you be satisfied with two grown-up daughters , mother , and leave Mops to me for a few years longer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 41]: Mrs Rendell tried to look shocked , a task which she found somewhat difficult when her husband was the offender ; but if her eyes betrayed her , the elevated brows and pursed-up lips made a valiant show of disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 4]: `` At eighteen ?
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 7]: She is past eighteen , remember .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 23]: You do n't expect a girl of eighteen to run about in short skirts , with her hair down her back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 8]: `` She would look much nicer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 20]: sighed Mr Rendell , looking regretfully first at the long white skirt , and then at the coiled-up tresses .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 25]: `` They grow up so quickly , Edith ; I live in terror of having no children left -- nothing but fashionable young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 26]: One must give in to custom to a certain extent , I suppose , but I warn you frankly that Chrissie shall be the exception .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 12]: It would break my heart to see Chrissie properly grown up .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 11]: Chrissie shall always wear her hair down her back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 17]: Christabel screwed up her eyes at him across the fireplace with a smile of indulgent affection .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 10]: He was so young , this dear old father !
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 17]: so ridiculously young , that his vagaries could not be treated with the severity they deserved .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 17]: It was truest wisdom to take no notice , and lead the conversation to wiser topics .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 12]: `` Any news in the great world to-day , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 4]: she inquired airily .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 11]: `` Any nice little bits of gossip to tell us ?
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 20]: We look forward to hearing your news , you know , as part of the day 's excitement . ''
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 6]: `` My news , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 6]: Gossip , she calls it .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 27]: If you had to provide for half a dozen daughters , Miss Christabel , you would n't find much time to spend in ` gossip . '
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 24]: I go to town to work , and leave it to you at home to run round collecting the news of the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 4]: I know nothing .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 4]: I hear nothing .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 9]: Men do n't trouble themselves with gossip . ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 25]: Seven long-drawn gasps of incredulity greeted this utterance ; seven pairs of eyes rolled involuntarily to the ceiling ; seven heads wagged in accusation .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 7]: `` Oh , oh , oh !
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 12]: Who goes on ` Change and is told the latest jokes ?
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 15]: Who goes to a _ cafe _ after lunch and smokes with his cronies ?
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 9]: Who has afternoon tea , and talks again ?
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 35]: Who travels every day with the same men in the train , and hears everything , every -- single -- tiny -- weeny snap of news that has happened within ten miles around ? ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 9]: `` Do n't know , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 5]: I do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 5]: `` Oh , oh !
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 37]: Who told us about Evan Bruce , and about Mabel 's engagement , and the robbery at the Priory , and -- and -- '' `` For pity 's sake , stop talking all at once !
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 5]: Take it in turns .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 14]: Speak in pairs if you must , but not in a perfect orchestra .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 27]: I did n't know I had been the first to hear any of those thrilling incidents , but it was quite an exception if I did .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 9]: We generally read reviews , or talk business .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 13]: I 've no news for you to-night , at any rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 10]: `` You always say so at first , dear .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 5]: You 're so forgetful .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 3]: Think again .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 11]: Frank Brightwen , now -- he told you something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 10]: `` Gold Reef shares gone up two per cent .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 11]: Market closed firm , with a tendency to rise . ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 8]: `` I shall buy some at once .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 9]: I like things that are going to rise .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 25]: Be sensible now , for I shall have to go to bed in ten minutes , and I do so want to be amused .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 9]: Had Mr Keeling nothing interesting to relate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 8]: `` Bad cold , and feared influenza .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 6]: Details of his last attack .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 15]: Prescriptions from all the other fellows , with accounts of their own experiences . ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 7]: `` Deah me , how appalling !
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 5]: Worse than a tea-party !
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 10]: I had no ideah men could be so dull .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 3]: Nobody engaged ?
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 3]: Nobody married ?
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 7]: Nobody going to give a dance ?
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 11]: No new people coming to live in the neighbourhood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 17]: Mr Rendell struck an attitude of remembrance , at which the watching faces brightened with smiles .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 19]: `` Yes , now I come to think of it , there was one little item of news .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 15]: I forgot all about it ; but you will be interested , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 6]: The Grange is sold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 17]: The expression of curiosity on his daughters ' faces was exchanged for one of blank amazement .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 17]: Even his wife gave a start of surprise , and turned towards him with eager inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 3]: `` Let !
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 5]: Really let , Alfred ?
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 7]: You do n't mean it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 7]: `` So I am told . ''
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 13]: `` We 've been told so so often that one grows sceptical .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 12]: Is it really and truly sold , and the deeds signed ?
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 22]: I sha 'n' t believe it unless they are , for difficulties have cropped up so often at the last moment .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 8]: Are you quite sure this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 16]: `` As sure as it is possible to be about anything in this wicked world .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 9]: Braithwaite tells me it 's an accomplished fact .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 19]: The deeds are signed , and the workmen are to begin putting the house in order next week .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 17]: You may take it as settled this time , for the man really means to come .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 19]: He is a certain Ernest Vanburgh by name , and has been living abroad for some years . ''
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 23]: `` And is there a Mrs Vanburgh , and has he any children , and are they young or grown up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 29]: `` Is he a dull sort of man , or will he be hospitable , and give dinners and parties and help to make the place lively ? ''
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 24]: `` Is he musical , father , because there 's that lovely big room where we could have such charming musical evenings ? ''
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 11]: Mr Rendell shrugged his shoulders with an air of resignation .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 22]: `` How like a woman , or rather , I should say , how like half a dozen women put together !
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 19]: My dears , I know absolutely nothing about the man , except that he has bought the place .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 26]: He is in a hurry to get settled , so you will probably find out all about him for yourselves before many weeks are over .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 7]: It 's no use asking questions .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 18]: He was willing to pay down the money , and that was all that Braithwaite cared about .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 30]: He may be a bachelor or a second Bluebeard , for all I know ; but I suppose in either case he will still be better than nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 6]: `` Of course he will .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 6]: Blank windows are so dull .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 6]: Curtains are much more interesting .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 8]: There 's so much character in curtains .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 19]: I can tell the sort of woman who lives in a house merely by looking at her curtains .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 16]: It will be a new interest in life to have the Grange let again . ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 16]: `` And I have a Feeling that it will be an Epoch in our lives .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 19]: I have a Feeling that our Fate and that of the new tenants will be inextricably woven together .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 21]: It may be foolish , but these convictions are borne in upon me ; I can not help them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 31]: cried Elsie , clasping her hands and opening her blue eyes to the fullest capacity , as she turned a gaze of mysterious raptness upon the group by the fireplace .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 87]: `` Perhaps in years to come we may look back upon this evening as a milestone marking out the past from the future , and realise -- '' A burst of laughter put a stop to further sentimentalising , and Elsie retired within her shell , aggrieved and dignified ; but for once she was right in her surmises , for her own fate and that of her sisters was indeed destined to be permanently affected by the coming of the new tenant of the Grange .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 5]: CASTLES IN THE AIR .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 41]: The news that the Grange was sold was truly of great interest to the Rendell family , for the house faced their own on the opposite side of the road , and its uninhabited condition had been a standing grievance .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 78]: That one of the handsomest houses of the neighbourhood should remain empty was a serious matter in a small community , and the younger girls listened with bated breath to the accounts of the gorgeous entertainments which had been given by the last tenant , hoping against hope that the time would soon come when the house would once more be thrown open , and the great oak-panelled rooms re-echo to the sound of music and laughter .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 54]: Like their own house , a portion of the Grange abutted on to the high road , so that a row of windows lay immediately open to inspection ; but two great wings stretched back to right and left , and the house was surrounded on three sides by beautiful and extensive grounds .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 65]: The late owner had spent lavishly in beautifying the place , and had asked in return a sum so exorbitant , that though many would-be tenants had arrived to look over the house , one and all drew back when the nature of his demands was made known , and the Rendell girls were not the only people who had despaired of a settlement .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 25]: But now at last a delightful certainty had been gained , the deeds were signed , and the long waiting was at an end !
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 72]: The morning after the news had been received , Agatha and Christabel rushed to the porch-room directly after breakfast , and flattened their noses against the pane to watch for the first sign of their chosen companion , that same Kitty of whom mention has already been made , and who came daily to join the schoolroom party , instead of indulging in the luxury of a governess of her own .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 49]: She came at last , a tall lamp-post of a girl , with blue serge skirt blowing back from long brown legs , a plaid Tam O'Shanter perched on the top of chestnut locks , and a bundle of books tucked beneath the arm of a corduroy jacket .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 30]: Christabel banged an eager fist upon the window , and rushed downstairs in a whirl of excitement to meet her friend , and carry her off to the schoolroom .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 7]: `` My deah , such news !
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 5]: You 'll never guess !
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 5]: It 's perfectly charming !
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 10]: You 'll go wild when you hear it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 11]: Kitty sat down in a chair and gazed calmly around .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 34]: Whether she would `` go wild '' or not when the news was unfolded remained to be seen ; but in the meantime her composure showed not the slightest sign of being disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 4]: `` Um ! ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 22]: she ejaculated , and began to divest herself of her outdoor garments , as if nothing more important engrossed her attention .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 62]: She tugged at the fingers of her deerskin gloves , and let them fall indiscriminately at either side of her chair ; she sent her cap flying across the room , wriggled out of her jacket , kicked her overshoes beneath the table , then folded her arms and seemed to feel that she had no further responsibility in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 20]: The art of putting away outdoor clothes was one , indeed , which Miss Kitty seemed powerless to master .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 55]: In vain her mother exhausted herself in objurgation , and grew alternately pitiful and angry ; Kitty kissed her fervently and vowed amendment , but the next day there was the jacket as usual , hanging over a dining-room chair , and the other garments dropped in as many odd places about the house .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 60]: This method of procedure was , no doubt , a saving of trouble in the first instance , but retribution followed when it came to starting out again after lunch , when Miss Kitty might have been seen plunging wildly about the room in search of a missing glove or tie , while groans of despair attended every movement .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 8]: `` Where _ can _ it be ?
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 8]: Wish my things could be left alone !
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 7]: Always stuck out of the way !
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 11]: Shall be late again now , and get bad marks .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 4]: Not my fault .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 4]: Horrid old servants !
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 15]: Wish they 'd do their own work , and leave my things alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 61]: So on , and so on , until at last the missing article was found , folded up in a magazine , or thrust beneath a fern-pot , when Kitty would seize it resentfully , and stalk down the garden-path on her long brown legs , puffing and fuming , and feeling herself the most ill - used of mortals .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 71]: On the present occasion Elsie and Agatha entered the room as she finished undressing , and the former immediately set to work to gather together the scattered possessions and put them away , for she was tidier-in-general to the household , and could never by any possibility bring herself to sit down comfortably in a room where a picture hung awry , or a tablecloth dipped unevenly at the corner .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 24]: The while she moved about she cast a pensive glance at the newcomer , and exclaimed regretfully -- `` Kitty does n't approve .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 14]: I saw it in her face the moment I came into the room .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 17]: I knew she would n't , and I do n't know that I do , either .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 7]: It 's a great risk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 11]: `` I have n't heard anything to approve of yet .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 10]: Chrissie has been too excited to descend to details .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 8]: You seem to have been very busy !
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 13]: I never heard of any news when I was here yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 36]: There was a tinge of displeasure in the voice in which the last sentence was spoken , and Agatha , the tenderhearted , was quick to note it , and to explain away the misconception .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 7]: `` There was nothing to hear .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 4]: It happened later .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 11]: There are two things we want to tell you about .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 47]: One is a piece of news from the outside , and the other is our own special affair ; but of course it 's not really settled , for , as mother said , until you had been consulted , nothing definite could be decided . ''
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 7]: `` Think not , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 4]: said Kitty shortly .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 34]: She put her hand in her pocket and drew forth a pair of steel-rimmed spectacles , which she placed , not on the bridge , but on the extreme tip of her nose .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 51]: Her curly hair was roughened over her shoulders , the brown ribbon bow stood up erect at the top of her head ; her arms were folded in deliberate inelegance , and she gazed over the spectacles with an air of grandmotherly condescension , comically at variance with her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 27]: `` Let me hear about it at once , or Miss Phelps will arrive , and I shall burst with curiosity in the middle of lessons .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 10]: What is it that you want to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 37]: Elsie , Agatha , and Christabel immediately proceeded to explain the situation in characteristic Rendell fashion , all speaking together , and continuing to speak , without being in the least disconcerted by the babble evoked .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 44]: Elsie whined , Agatha gurgled , and Chrissie drawled , while the listener rolled her eyes from one to another , catching a phrase here , a phrase there , until at length some dawning of the situation began to make itself known .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 6]: `` A sale of work !
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 21]: We are to slave away making pin-cushions from now until July , and then sell them to some one else !
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 13]: I understand that ; but what is the idea of doing it ?
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 13]: Who is going to get the money when it is made ? ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 7]: `` The poor and needy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 6]: `` Thank you so much !
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 8]: Most considerate , I 'm sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 6]: `` Kittay , be quiet !
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 11]: The Mission , of course ; the Mission at Sale .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 25]: We thought we ought to help , as it is in debt , and we do no good with our money as it is .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 19]: We could collect enough to buy materials if we give up sweets for the next few months . ''
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 6]: Kitty 's face fell gloomily .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 39]: `` I 've only three and fourpence in the world , and it 's mother 's birthday next month , and Aunt May 's and granny 's the month after that , and Agatha 's next week . ''
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 6]: `` Do n't count me !
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 39]: I 'm as poor as Job myself , but my old yellow sash will wash and make into sachets , and I 'll cut the crushed parts out of hair ribbons , and use the ends for needlebooks .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 16]: If they are a tiny bit stained , I will embroider flowers over the spots .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 24]: We shall manage the work somehow , never fear ; and think of the tea and refreshments , and sails in the punts !
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 8]: We shall simply coin money over them .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 9]: Lilias is going to do the punting . ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 6]: `` Naturally she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 8]: Kitty 's eyes twinkled with humorous enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 5]: `` Easy and profitable !
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 8]: Just the sort of work Lilias likes .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 6]: Oh yes , I agree .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 21]: I 'd like to work and feel that I was reforming the world , and it will be great jokes .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 7]: I know what I 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 18]: I 'll take snap-shots at the company with my new Kodak , and take orders for copies .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 7]: There 's an idea for you !
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 20]: People are so vain that they always think they would like a photograph -- until they see a proof !
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 10]: If they refuse , I shall try another plan .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 33]: I will snap them unawares , and say , ` I have taken several photographs of you this afternoon at moments which , perhaps , you would prefer not to have immortalised .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 10]: The negative is yours for two and six . '
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 14]: How do you think that would work as a source of income ? ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 32]: `` Better not let mother hear you talk like that , my child , or the Kodak will be forbidden once for all , and it is really a lovely idea !
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 26]: You could take the punt with the different people on board , and groups eating refreshments , and talking to each other on the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 8]: My deah , you will amass fortunes !
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 6]: I 'm jealous of you .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 15]: I believe you will make far more than we shall with our tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 37]: `` But of course if it 's wet '' -- insinuated Elsie persistently , only to be frowned down by her companions , who were eager to impart the second and most exciting piece of intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 9]: `` It wo n't be wet , Croaky !
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 6]: Do n't say that again .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 14]: That 's one piece of news , then ; now for the other !
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 15]: Three guesses , Kitty , for a really convulsing piece of local gossip . ''
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 6]: `` Maud is engaged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 4]: `` Not yet !
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 8]: You can guess that again later on !
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 13]: This special piece of news is not about our family at all .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 4]: Some one else !
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 4]: Guess again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 8]: `` Some one I know well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 4]: `` Slightly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 6]: `` Not at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 20]: `` Then how on earth can I possibly -- '' `` It is n't necessary to know the person .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 11]: No one knows him yet , but we soon shall .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 12]: He is coming to -- to -- ca n't you guess ?
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 9]: Think of the empty houses near here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 5]: `` The Grange ! ''
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 10]: cried Kit , and clapped her hands with delight .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 8]: `` Some one has bought the Grange !
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 5]: How sweet of him !
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 9]: Now we shall have something to look at .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 13]: He is coming soon , you say -- oh , what fun !
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 12]: We can watch the furniture unload , and the family arrive .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 11]: Who are they , and how many may they be ?
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 33]: Lots of girls , I hope -- the right sort , with plenty of fun in them , and pony-carriages of their own , in which they can drive us about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 17]: `` We do n't know a single thing about them , and ca n't find out .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 33]: The man is called Vanburgh , which is all right so far as it goes , but whether he is married or a bachelor -- '' `` Of course he is married !
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 13]: A bachelor would never dare to take a house like the Grange .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 6]: It would be downright wicked !
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 21]: He is a married man , with a grey beard , and a fat wife , and four beauteous daughters .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 13]: I see them now before me , as in a mirror ! ''
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 34]: Kitty shut her eyes behind the spectacles , and screwed up her face into a grimace which was meant to be vague and visionary , but fell a long way short of success .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 21]: She was fond of indulging in flights of fancy , and her friends waited for her utterances with smiling delight .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 10]: `` Yes , yes , I see them all !
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 32]: Veronique , the eldest , is a stately beauty , tall and slender , with lustrous Spanish eyes , and locks -- '' `` Black as the raven 's wing . ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 34]: Chrissie 's murmur seemed a fitting climax to the description , but the Visionary objected to be interrupted , and turning scornful eyes upon her , said icily -- `` Quite the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 5]: Bright as pure gold !
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 24]: She knows not the meaning of fear , and rides an Arab charger , who knows every movement of her mistress 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 41]: She is betrothed to the scion of a noble house , and will shortly be led to the hymeneal altar , when we shall attend as maids of honour , clad in the sheen of satin and glimmer of pearls .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 51]: Gabriella , the second , is _ mignonne _ in stature , with a wee , winsome face -- '' But at this point in the description Agatha spluttered with laughter , and Christabel rose from her seat , and began banging down books on the table with disdainful emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 13]: `` I refuse to listen any longer to such uttah rubbish . ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 23]: -- `` Wee , winsome face , '' repeated Kitty loudly , determined to finish the sentence or perish in the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 16]: `` Eyes blue as the summer skies , and a skin of snow and roses .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 20]: She has a timorous , shrinking nature , and prefers a milk-white charger to her sister 's untamed steed .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 28]: Evangeline , the third , has tawny locks and a dimpling smile , and makes up by charm of manner for what she lacks in regular beauty .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 63]: Valentine , the fourth -- '' But the characteristics of Miss Vanburgh number four were fated to remain in obscurity , for at that moment a step was heard approaching the schoolroom door , and the historian made a dash forward to collect her books , and place them on the table , before the entrance of Miss Roberts , the governess .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 4]: AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 34]: During the next few weeks the workmen took possession of the Grange , and each morning as Kit made her appearance in the schoolroom Christabel had some fresh item of intelligence to unfold .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 29]: `` A blue paper is going up in the bedroom -- pale , pale blue , with loops of roses tied with lovers ' knots -- s-imply sweet !
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 24]: ... Nothing but brown paper in the little room over the door -- nasty , common brown paper like you use for parcels .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 2]: Hideous !
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 8]: What can they be thinking of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 22]: -- and the girls would stare together through the windows , watching every movement of painters and paperers with breathless interest .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 26]: Later on a still more exciting period was reached , when vanloads of furniture arrived , and their contents were spread about on the roadway .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 62]: Then the Rendell girls massed themselves in the porch-room , and while they manufactured needle-books , and scattered bran over the floor in the wholesale manufacture of pincushions , Lilias played the part of Sister Anne , sitting with idle hands , reporting progress to the workers , and sounding a bugle-note of warning when any object appeared which demanded attention .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 26]: The numberless packing-cases were baffling to feminine curiosity , but the furniture itself was so unique that the most prosaic articles assumed a surprising interest .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 25]: There were no modern designs to be seen here , no cream enamelled bedroom suites , no green wood chairs , nor cosy corners .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 19]: Everything belonging to the house was of a sombre grandeur which belonged to another country than our own .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 75]: Sideboards and cabinets of carved Indian wood blocked up the roadway , and made black patches against the oak-panelled walls ; overmantels of the same dusky hue stretched up to the ceilings , and Oriental rugs of priceless value , but distressing shabbiness , were spread over the floors , while the lower windows were covered with screens of carved wood , such as are to be seen over the windows of Turkish harems .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 43]: Lilias , the worldly wise , was pleased to pronounce the equipments of the house as in `` a style of quiet magnificence , '' but her sisters were less enthusiastic , and Nan screwed up her saucy nose in open disdain .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 19]: `` Very grand and antique-y , and all that sort of thing , but my , how dull !
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 27]: Fancy sitting in that oak-panelled room , with those black ghosts reared up against the walls , and the light shut out by those carved screens .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 8]: I should go stark , staring mad !
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 12]: Give me something bright and cheerful , and lots of sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 15]: What worries me is that there is so little that is feminine and frivolous .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 19]: I have n't seen a single thing as yet that looks suitable for a girl 's room . ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 7]: `` But think of the cases !
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 8]: All those dozens and dozens of cases .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 10]: You can never tell what may be inside them .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 15]: They may be stored with -- '' `` Treasures of buhl and ormolu ! ''
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 4]: sighed Kit softly .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 21]: `` That 's what they always say in books , though I have n't the slightest idea what it means .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 16]: Would n't it be a terrific blow if there were no girls after all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 11]: But such a possibility the Rendells absolutely refused to admit .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 55]: The prospect of finding friends of their own age in the deserted Grange had taken such firm hold of their imagination , that Veronique , Evangeline , and Ermyntrude had already become living companions who played a part in their lives , and whose tastes had to be seriously considered in arranging the future .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 65]: They longed for the time to come when doubt would be put at an end ; but the Vanburghs seemed in no hurry to appear , and meanwhile April was at hand , and , as was their custom , Mr and Mrs Rendell prepared to leave home on a short holiday , leaving the girls alone to battle with the terrors of spring-cleaning .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 26]: Mrs Rendell had strong ideas on the subject of domestic education , and would allow no extra help to be engaged for this yearly upheaval .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 33]: It was timed to take place in the Easter holidays , and each girl was expected to take a special task in hand , and to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 53]: She herself frankly confessed that she had come to a time of life when she was thankful to be spared fatigue and discomfort ; but her husband was not so willing to make the admission , and talked about his proposed absence in an impersonal fashion , which vastly amused his hearers .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 31]: `` Mother has had to bear the burden of housekeeping for over twenty years , and I think it quite time that some of you took it off her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 39]: It is good training for girls to learn everything that has to be done in connection with a house , so for your sakes as well as hers I feel it a duty to take her away . ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 31]: So he spoke , and Nan rolled her eyes at him in mischievous fashion , poking forward her head until her face was but a few inches from his own .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 10]: `` And -- er , what about your own ?
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 15]: You do not love the smell of soft soap , do you , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 13]: I remember last year -- '' Her father waved his arms helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 6]: `` Everything tasted of it !
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 31]: Soup , fish , puddings , everything one ate seemed saturated with soft soap ; and there is something peculiarly depressing about a house with no carpets on the floors .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 49]: I feel as if I were going to be sold up ; and if there is one thing more aggravating than another , it is to be obliged to sit in a fresh room every day , and have all one 's possessions stored carefully out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 34]: Now , remember , whoever dusts the books in the library is only to take out a few at a time , and put them back -- ex-actly where she found them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 6]: `` Yes , father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 8]: `` No servant is to touch them !
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 24]: I know what that means -- every book piled on the floor , and stuffed back into the shelves just as they come !
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 12]: You girls are responsible , and must dust them yourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 33]: `` Mine own fair hands shall do the deed -- in gloves , however , for I know those books of old , and shall smother myself in sheets before I begin .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 19]: I do n't object to a few days ' charing for a change , '' said Nan briskly .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 41]: `` I love rushing about in an apron , using my muscles instead of my brain , gathering all the ornaments together , and washing them in a nice soapy bath -- '' `` And watching the water get dirty !
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 6]: Is n't it lovely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 4]: gushed Agatha enthusiastically .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 16]: `` It is n't a bit interesting when they are only a little bit soiled .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 34]: I like figures and things with lots of creases where the dust gets in , and you have to scrub away with a nail-brush , and the water gets black -- perfectly black !
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 5]: It 's lovely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 44]: Every one laughed , even Mrs Rendell , though she felt in duty bound to protest at the idea of anything being `` black '' in her well-kept house ; and the girls proceeded to sing the joys of spring-cleaning with youthful fervour .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 14]: `` What I like best are the picnic meals , '' said Chrissie .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 27]: `` We always have the same things for lunch -- a round of cold salt beef and beetroot , and coffee , and bread and jam .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 34]: It is all put on the table at once , and we all carve for ourselves , and march about the room with aprons on , and behave as badly as we like .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 41]: Then we have tea about three , and cold meat again for dinner , and fruit instead of pudding , and are all so stiff that we can hardly move , and all fighting to have the first hot bath .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 23]: The water gets cold after the second , so it 's a great thing to be first , if you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 11]: `` And there are such amusing _ contretemps _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 6]: said Maud , the good-natured .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 23]: `` There seems to be a special imp of mischief abroad at these times , for something is bound to go wrong .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 39]: You ca n't guard against it , for it is always the last thing you could expect , and it happens at the worst moment , and in some extraordinary manner stops all the wheels of the machinery .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 17]: It is really excruciatingly funny -- '' `` You do n't think so at the time !
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 41]: When Agatha knocked a nail into the gas-pipe on Thursday afternoon , when the shops were closed , and all the men had gone off to a beanfeast , you did n't think it much of a joke then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 4]: said Elsie darkly .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 40]: `` We tried leaving the nail in and smearing the hole with soap , but the gas came out in gusts , and we had to turn it off , and there were only two candles in the house .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 29]: ... We sat all evening in the dark , and undressed together in one room , because we were obliged to give the servants one of the candles .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 17]: It was n't in the least funny , and you did n't think so either . ''
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 8]: `` Oh , I do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 20]: It gave us a rest , which we wanted badly , and it is amusing to think of afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 34]: I 've often thought of it , and laughed to myself , '' -- and Maud laughed again , the happy , kindly laugh which was the outward sign of a sweet-hearted nature .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 22]: Altogether it was a very cheerful little party of workers whom the parents left behind when the hour for departure arrived .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 41]: It was a bright , inspiriting spring morning , just one of the days when it is delightful to start off on the first holiday of the year , and Mr and Mrs Rendell looked fully appreciative of the fact .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 44]: He was attired in a new suit , while his wife , not to be outdone , had provided herself with a pretty blue coat and skirt , and a flowered toque which was perhaps a trifle more summery than the season justified .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 47]: After twenty-five years of married life , it was still a delight to this husband and wife to steal off for a holiday by themselves , and Mrs Rendell took the same delight in her husband 's approval as when she had first become his wife .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 32]: Every detail of her attire was daintily correct , and so pretty did she look , so trig and smart , that her six big daughters stared at her in admiration .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 5]: `` Perfectly s-weet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 27]: was Chrissie 's verdict ; then her eyes passed on to her handsome , stalwart father , and a twinkle of amusement showed in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 5]: `` They both do !
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 13]: And so spick and span -- everything new from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 16]: They might be a newly-married couple -- a trifle elderly , but ve-ry well preserved !
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 10]: I should n't wonder if people thought they were .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 11]: How would it be if we hid a little rice ?
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 6]: -- '' `` Happy thought !
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 5]: A most delicate attention .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 59]: Keep them talking for a few minutes while I pay a visit to the kitchen , '' cried Nan , deftly nipping up the roll of umbrellas , and disappearing from the hall , to return with the meekest of meek faces , and bid a fond adieu to the parents for whose confusion she had been planning .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 32]: When the carriage drove off , the conspiracy was divulged to the other girls , who fully appreciated the humour of the position , but were unanimously eager to disclaim responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 15]: `` I 'd give worlds to be there when they open the straps ! ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 3]: cried Agatha .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 8]: `` It will be too killingly funny .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 20]: They will both jump and get red in the face -- father from laughter , and mother from rage .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 15]: Oh-oh , it 's lovely ; but I did n't do it , remember !
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 12]: I had n't a suspicion of it until this minute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 23]: `` I could n't have allowed it , if you had consulted me , but I 'm glad you did n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 3]: Maud declared .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 11]: `` It will be exciting hearing how it comes off .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 31]: They wo n't need rugs or umbrellas in the train , but crossing the Channel mother is sure to feel chilly , as she will never sit in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 17]: Father will settle her comfortably in a chair on deck and proceed to unfasten the rugs .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 22]: Every one will look on , for there is nothing else to do on board ship but stare at your companions .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 19]: Then patter , patter , patter , down the rice will fall , and roll along the deck .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 6]: I can see it all !
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 28]: And the more they blush , the younger they will look ; and the angrier and more confused they are , the more natural it will seem .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 15]: Oh , I do hope and trust it comes off on the steamer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 11]: `` It would be even better in the train ! ''
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 4]: said Lilias wisely .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 43]: `` If they once get settled in the train to Paris , they would be stuck with the same people for five mortal hours , whether they liked it or not , and they would stare , and stare , and stare .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 21]: Whatever father and mother said , it would make no difference , for they would think they were only pretending .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 10]: Oh , Nan , I would n't be you !
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 6]: You will catch it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 6]: Nan shrugged her shoulders recklessly .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 5]: `` Time works wonders .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 37]: If they were coming home to-morrow I should tremble ; but after ten days ' galumptious holiday it would n't be in human nature to come home and be cross with a poor , hard-working Cinderella .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 8]: Besides , why should they be vexed ?
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 14]: When I 'm married you can use as much rice as you like .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 13]: I do n't mind if I scatter it broadcast wherever I go .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 19]: I shall just smile back in the people 's faces , and hang on to Adolphus for support .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 50]: If I can afford a little amusement to my fellow-creatures , I shall not be so selfish as to object ; and I must say that for my own part I do adore finding out a bride and bridegroom , and staring at them with all my eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 32]: `` I shall never marry ; but if I do I shall wear my oldest clothes on my honeymoon , and snap at my husband every time he opens his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 8]: That 's the way to manage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 16]: said Christabel with an air , and the two elder girls exchanged smiles of amusement .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 37]: Neither of them volunteered any information as to how she herself would behave in the circumstances , for the nearer such a possibility becomes , the less easy it is to discuss it in indifferent fashion .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 18]: Lilias dropped her lids in smiling modesty , and Maud 's eyes shone with a happy glow .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 27]: She was twenty-three now , and for the last four years a secret hope had dwelt in her heart , and invested the future with charm .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 58]: It had begun on a certain holiday time , when Jim for the second or third time had brought home his friend Ned Talbot for a visit , and Ned had caught his foot in a rabbit-hole , and sprained it so severely that he was a prisoner at Thurston House for weeks , instead of days .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 30]: Lilias and Nan were away at school at that time , but Maud had finished her education , and shared with her mother the task of amusing the invalid .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 63]: She read aloud to him ; played on the piano ; was demolished at Halma ; and , above all , talked to him on one topic after another , growing ever more and more intimate , until at the end of the visit it had seemed as if there was no secret which was held back from Ned Talbot 's knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 20]: He had not said so much in return , but there was no sense of chill in his reserve .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 18]: He was naturally silent , and a word from him meant more than many protestations from another .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 39]: Maud knew that he enjoyed her society by a hundred indefinable signs ; and when they bade each other good-bye , the glance of the dark eyes seemed to speak of a warmer interest than that of friendship .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 24]: Since then four years had passed by , and twice a year at least Ned had contrived to pay a visit to Waybourne .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 67]: Now that the other girls were at home there were no longer opportunities for uninterrupted converse , for , as the eldest daughter of a large household , Maud was often compelled to busy herself with household duties , leaving the charge of entertainment to the younger girls ; but she felt sure that Ned understood , and no trace of dissatisfaction clouded her gentle spirit .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 35]: She calculated happily that four months had passed since his last appearance , and felt her cheeks flush as she remembered Jim 's accounts of a recent prosperous change in his friend 's business .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 30]: A great step upward had been taken during the last year , and now , for the first time , Talbot was in a position to keep a wife !
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 12]: This being so , who could tell what might happen next ?
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 36]: The hour to which she had looked forward to so long , when Ned would give her a right to love him and to be his helpmeet in life , might be close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 12]: Oh , it was a good world , a beautiful world !
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 27]: Life was in its spring , and every opening bud and flower in the green world without seemed to typify the hope in her own heart !
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 11]: The next few days witnessed a perfect rush of industry .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 80]: It was no light task to complete the cleaning of so large a house in ten days ' time , but many hands make light work ; and while the servants scrubbed and scoured , the girls performed the lighter duties , washing ornaments , polishing pictures , turning faded draperies , sewing on new lengths of fringe , until old bottles were , if not exactly converted into new , at least assured a fresh lease of juvenility .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 43]: There was always a rush to get the work finished a day or two before the parents ' return , for the time that was over was legally the girls ' own , to be employed in whatsoever manner seemed most pleasing .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 97]: Christabel stayed in bed to breakfast ; Agatha ate apples and read novels all day long ; Elsie made copious entries in her diary , and wore her hair in the picturesque confusion which she considered becoming , and felt it cruel of her mother to forbid ; Nan worked in her studio , and came down to dinner in a flannel shirt ; Lilias wore her best clothes , and went up to town to see and be seen ; and Maud dreamt dreams at her ease , without the disturbing consciousness of work undone .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 65]: By the end of the week the carpets were cleaned and ready to put down , and it was decided that the drawing-room felting should be laid first of all , because in itself it was a more lengthy task than the mere laying of squares , and also because the after work of arranging pictures and china would be greater here than elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 39]: The three maids shut themselves in the room together for an hour or more , and at the end of the time adjourned in a body to the library , where the young mistresses were busy arranging books .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 21]: They looked flushed and discouraged , and each of the three had her own comments to make upon the situation .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 14]: Cook reported that `` that there felting would n't come right nohow . ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 41]: Mary put her hand to her heart , and said her inside ached with dragging the tiresome thing ; and bright-eyed Jane smiled cheerfully , and vowed that `` she did n't believe it never would meet no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 33]: The girls adjourned into the drawing-room to investigate the difficulty , and found the felting neatly fastened at three sides , but steadily refusing to come within inches of the fourth wall .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 36]: `` Seems as if it 's shrunk itself somehow in the cleaning , '' said cook dolefully ; but Maud only laughed , and went forward to the rescue in her cheery , capable manner .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 7]: `` Oh , nonsense , cook !
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 15]: If the cleaning did anything , it would stretch it and make it bigger .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 21]: It is purposely made rather a tight fit , or it would go into wrinkles , which would never do .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 7]: It only wants a little coaxing .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 30]: Nan and Agatha , you have the strongest arms , go over there and pull as hard as you can , while Elsie and I push towards you . ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 6]: No sooner said than done .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 38]: Maud and Elsie went down on their knees , and travelled slowly across the floor , pushing infinitesimal creases before them , while the others pulled and strained to make the most of the advantage thus given .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 70]: It was a lengthy business , and the crawling operation was repeated several times over before the first ring could be induced to catch over its nail ; but when this was done hope began to revive , and the pushing and tugging was carried on with such vigour that presently the last fastening was secured , and the workers rested from their labours , weary , yet triumphant .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 5]: `` My back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 16]: groaned Elsie , straightening herself with a groan ; `` it 's broken in two .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 12]: I feel as if I could never stand erect again . ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 5]: `` My hands ! ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 15]: groaned Agatha , stretching out her arms , and slowly uncurling ten cramped-up fingers .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 4]: `` They ache .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 2]: Whew !
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 9]: I never worked so hard in my life .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 27]: I shall be more careful about spilling crumbs on this carpet in the future , now that I know what it means to have it cleaned .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 11]: How you ever got it up I ca n't think .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 13]: It must have been even more difficult than putting it down . ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 13]: `` Broke every nail I ` ave , '' said cook concisely .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 14]: `` It 's not woman 's work , and that 's the truth .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 43]: We ` ad ought to ` ave ` ad a man to do it that ` ad proper tools ; but there , it 's done , thank goodness , for another year , and it 's the worst in the house .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 7]: Them squares is no trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 25]: `` No ; I think you can manage the squares yourselves ; but first of all we will have the furniture brought in here .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 56]: The house looks so forlorn with the hall blocked up , and if we get one room tidy , we shall feel that we are getting on , '' said Maud , who as yet had not risen from the floor , but sat with feet stretched out , gathering resolution to begin work afresh .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 50]: She stretched out her hands and drew herself slowly along towards the farther side of the room ; but scarcely had she moved a couple of feet when she gave an exclamation of dismay , and , stopping short , passed her hand over the surface of the felting .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 5]: `` Whatever is this ?
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 7]: Something sticking up through the felting !
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 8]: Sharp little points , here and there .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 6]: Dozens of them all about !
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 6]: What can they be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 37]: The others hastened to the spot , and gazed with horror-stricken eyes at a number of minute molehills showing distinctly in the felting , and each one presenting a sharp point when investigated by the touch .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 6]: `` It 's nails ! ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 14]: croaked Elsie deeply ; and at that cook gave a groan of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 7]: `` It is , for sure !
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 4]: Them dratted tacks !
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 25]: Your Mar said we was to put in a tack here and there between the rings , and there was a saucerful just there .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 17]: Somebody has knocked it over , I expect , and scattered them about the floor . ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 8]: Maud looked round with a despairing glance .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 50]: The accident had happened in the worst possible position , as such accidents are invariably supposed to do , the nails being spilt a couple of yards from the wall , in such a position that two sides of the carpet must be unfastened before they could be removed .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 17]: She stared at her sisters , and they stared back in a long , sullen silence .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 15]: `` We ca n't do it again , and we sha 'n' t ! ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 4]: said Nan recklessly .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 16]: `` Send for a man , and let him break his fingers for a change .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 8]: I need mine for another purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 7]: `` Thursday afternoon , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 14]: The shops are shut , and not a man to be had . ''
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 7]: `` Never saw anything like it .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 6]: It always is Thursday afternoon !
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 16]: Put a table over the place then , and leave the tacks where they are .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 7]: No one will see them . ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 19]: `` Oh , Nan , as if a table could stay in the same place for a year .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 33]: Besides , the nails are bound to come out ; if we do n't take them away , they 'll work little holes for themselves , and then what would mother say ?
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 7]: There 's no use shirking it .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 17]: The carpet has to come up again , and we shall have to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 6]: `` It 's too disgusting !
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 17]: All this time wasted , and now to find ourselves farther back than when we started .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 5]: I could cry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 13]: protested Elsie dolefully ; and Maud gave a little flop of impatience .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 33]: `` Oh , so could I -- howl , if that would do any good ; but it wo n't , so we might as well stop talking and set to work .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 21]: Begin at once , Jane , please ; we 'll push , and make it as easy as possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 32]: The workers crawled wearily back to their posts , while the audience , in the shape of Lilias and Christabel , stood in the doorway and cheered them with derisive comments .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 10]: `` Amusing _ contretemps _ , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 10]: Reminds one of Maud 's ecstasies the other evening .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 20]: Quite pleased , are n't you , Maudie , to have another illustration of the humours of house-cleaning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 9]: `` Never mind , darlings , keep cool !
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 12]: You 'll think it very funny in six months ' time .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 12]: If you work hard you 'll finish by to-morrow morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 43]: The glances cast upon the miscreants in reply to their witticisms were so threatening , that they ran back to the library to stifle their laughter ; but five minutes had not elapsed before they were back again , gasping in consternation .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 4]: `` A caller !
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 6]: Some one at the door !
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 11]: Ca n't see properly , but it 's a man !
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 12]: A young man in a frock coat and a tall hat .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 6]: What shall we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 8]: `` Send him away , of course .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 4]: Jane , quick !
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 18]: put on a clean apron , and tell the gentleman that Mrs Rendell is away from home .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 10]: If he asks for us -- we are engaged .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 14]: Sorry you ca n't ask him in , as the house is upset .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 23]: He 'll see that for himself , '' added Maud , in a resigned tone , as Jane hurried from the room .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 44]: `` The hall looks as if it were in the midst of a removal , and if he had had any sense he would have known from the look of the windows that we were not in a fit state to receive callers .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 11]: Anyhow , he will have to go away now . ''
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 68]: The visitor , however , refused to go away , for , to the consternation of the listeners , the parley at the front door was succeeded by the sound of footsteps picking their way through the piled-up furniture , and Jane 's suggestion of `` The library , sir , '' was apparently neglected , for the tramp came nearer and nearer to the drawing-room door .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 48]: Six pairs of hands were raised to smooth six ruffled heads , Maud twitched down her sleeves , Lilias stood in an attitude of graceful attention , and the next moment the door was thrown open , and Ned Talbot 's deep voice called out a greeting .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 6]: `` May I come in ?
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 10]: I refused to be turned away at the door .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 5]: How does everybody do ?
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 5]: You look very busy .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 10]: I am going to stay and help you . ''
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 4]: NAN PLAYS HELPER .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 4]: Alas for Maud !
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 31]: Had it been for this that she had lived in dreams since October last , planning afresh , and yet afresh , every detail of the next meeting with Ned ?
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 35]: Had it been for this that she had mentally arranged background , occasion , opportunity , sending abroad mother , and sisters five , and seating herself in solitude to await Ned 's arrival ?
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 51]: Had it been for this that she had cherished her dainty new blouse , refusing to crush it beneath cloak or shawl , and appearing over and over again in the pink of a bygone age , so that it might appear in its first beauty for Ned 's inspection ?
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 27]: Oh , it was hard to have planned so well , and then to be discovered with ruffled hair , flushed cheeks , and unbecoming attire !
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 48]: Lilias was only the more picturesque for her working attire , and was even now shaking hands with the visitor , and welcoming him in pretty , winsome fashion , as the other girls shook down skirts and aprons , and took furtive peeps in the looking-glass .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 4]: `` Mr Talbot .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 2]: You !
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 5]: This is a surprise .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 14]: It is delightful to see you again , but we are so upset !
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 12]: We are in the throes of spring-cleaning , as you perceive .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 6]: Have you come from town ?
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 10]: Agatha , Chrissie , bring in a few chairs !
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 28]: This is the only room that has a pretence of a carpet , but at any rate we can give you a chair to sit upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 8]: `` But I do n't want one .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 26]: I have been sitting in the train , and would rather stand for a change , or , still better , help with some work .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 9]: Please do n't treat me as a visitor !
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 9]: What were you about when I came in ?
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 4]: Laying a carpet ?
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 4]: Six of you !
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 14]: It does n't take six women to lay one carpet , surely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 4]: Nan groaned dismally .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 13]: `` It does indeed , and then they ca n't do it !
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 24]: It 's nasty , horrid , rough , heavy work , only fit for men , and not for our poor little fingers .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 32]: We had just succeeded , with immense labour , in fastening it all round when we made the cheerful discovery that a boxful of nails are scattered over the floor beneath .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 23]: You came in at the ghastly moment when it had dawned upon us that it had all to come up again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 69]: Nan waved her hand with a tragic movement towards the little heap of nails , then , making a sudden step forward , caught her foot in a loose piece of braid at the bottom of her skirt , and went rushing forward at a headlong run , to be caught in Ned Talbot 's arms , and so rescued from destruction against a corner of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 12]: `` Nan , I told you that that braid was torn !
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 8]: I told you to sew it up !
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 34]: I _ told _ you you 'd trip and hurt yourself , '' cried Maud reproachfully ; but the culprit only laid her hand over her heart , and gurgled in impenitent amusement .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 9]: `` But I did n't , you see !
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 6]: I came off all right .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 13]: It 's only a little end -- not worth talking about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 31]: -- and she took a couple of pins from the corner of her apron and began fastening up the offending loop , while her sister lifted her hands in disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 3]: `` Pins ?
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 5]: They wo n't hold !
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 9]: Better go upstairs and sew it at once .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 44]: If you do n't , I warn you , Nan , '' -- but Maud did not get any further in her prophecy , for Ned Talbot came over to her side , and looked down at her with kindly , anxious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 8]: `` Maud , you look so tired !
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 16]: Do n't trouble any more about the carpet ; I 'll manage it for you .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 20]: What 's the good of a great lumbering six-footer if he ca n't manage a little job like that !
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 28]: I 'll have it up and down again before you can say ` Jack Robinson , ' and then we will have our talk in comfort . ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 38]: `` It 's more difficult than you think , '' said Maud dolefully ; but Ned only laughed , then proceeded to take off his coat and go down on his knees to attack the obstinate rings .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 58]: The workers took advantage of the opportunity to adjust hair-pins , and divest themselves of soiled aprons , while Lilias , having no such defects to remedy , developed sudden interest in the work on hand , and knelt down on the floor beside him , holding out first one implement and then another for his use .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 58]: The softly-tinted face and cloudy golden hair looked lovelier than ever about the long white smock which she had adopted as her working costume , and poor Maud stared at her own heated reflection with increased disfavour , the while she whispered in Nan 's ear -- `` I suppose he expects to stay for the evening .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 3]: So awkward !
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 15]: Can we ask him , do you think , when mother 's away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 44]: `` Mother would be very much annoyed if we sent away an old friend , who has stayed in the house dozens of times , without even offering him a meal ; especially when he has travelled twenty miles to see us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 11]: `` But , my dear , what have we got ?
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 7]: I ca n't give him dinner .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 11]: There 's nothing in the house but cold meat . ''
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 12]: `` Cutlets and tinned fruit -- the refuge of the destitute !
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 9]: Send Mary flying to the butcher 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 7]: `` It 's Thursday afternoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 14]: Nan 's groan of dismay brought Ned Talbot 's head round in inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 29]: The rings were giving way obediently in his strong grasp , and Lilias was clapping her hands at each fresh success , and chatting away in animated fashion .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 16]: The sisters waited until the work was resumed , and then continued the whispered conference .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 12]: `` It always _ is _ Thursday when we want anything .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 10]: People should never be allowed to shut their shops .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 16]: Cold meat it must be , then , and nothing else , I 'm afraid .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 44]: We might manage to manufacture a few made dishes from the tinned things in the store-room , but _ entrees _ and savouries seem out of place in the middle of spring-cleaning , and the dining-room is impassable -- a perfect block . ''
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 18]: `` We might alter that if we put out the things that are needed for this room .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 36]: We had better go and do it now , for we do n't seem needed here any longer , '' -- and Maud cast a wistful look towards the two kneeling figures in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 34]: She envied Lilias her position ; but it never entered into her honest heart to mistrust her sister 's loyalty , or to put a cynical construction upon this sudden show of industry .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 20]: All the girls were fond of Ned ; it was only natural that Lilias should want to help him .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 22]: She held out her poor , roughened hands , and looked appealingly at Nan as they stood outside the drawing-room door .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 23]: `` I might wash them , might n't I , and put on a pair of cuffs , and a fresh tie ?
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 36]: I wo n't change my blouse , of course ; but he is a man , and would n't notice what I 'd done -- only perhaps that I looked a little bit nicer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 18]: Nan nodded silently , a lump rising in her throat at the sight of the wistful face .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 32]: She was the only one of the sisters who had been told the secret of Maud 's heart , and the bond between these two girls was very strong and tender .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 28]: She watched Maud until she disappeared from sight , with her lips screwed tightly together , and her eyebrows meeting in an ominous frown across her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 70]: She felt very fierce and formidable at that moment , and it was a positive relief to be able to vent some of her pent-up irritation in work , so for the next ten minutes she dragged and tugged at the piled-up furniture , making order out of confusion , and carrying the lighter drawing-room articles into the hall , in readiness to be put into their proper places .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 62]: Then Maud reappeared , smartened up by those subtle touches which every woman knows how to bestow , and no man is able to understand , though the result is patent to his eyes ; and after a second consultation on the subject of dinner , a return was made to the drawing-room , to see how the carpet-laying was progressing .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 33]: Ned Talbot was still on his knees , but now he was fastening instead of unfastening the rings , while Lilias was exhibiting a cup full of sharp , jagged little nails .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 26]: The dreaded task was almost accomplished , and that in less time than would have been possible with the united efforts of the feminine household .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 5]: `` Done already ? ''
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 14]: cried the new-comers ; and Agatha shook her mane with a melancholy air .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 6]: `` It 's s-imply wondrous !
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 13]: He just pulls , and the thing meets as easy as winking .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 8]: It does n't seem a bit difficult .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 9]: And to think how we almost killed ourselves !
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 5]: It 's humiliating ! ''
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 9]: `` Do n't feel it so at all .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 15]: If I am beaten at carpet-laying all my life , I 'll never repine .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 59]: It 's a woman 's duty to do nice things , and pleasant things , and pretty things , and leave the men to do the hard bits , '' said Elsie , standing on one leg to relieve the pain which had come from long kneeling , and looking with melancholy significance at her thin little arms .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 8]: `` Look at those compared to his !
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 22]: Nature never intended me -- '' Ned fastened the last hook , and straightened his back with a sigh of satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 3]: `` Done !
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 5]: That 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 14]: I 'm glad I came in time , for it 's stiffish work .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 31]: I am staying in town for a few days , and thought I would chance it this afternoon , and run down to see you for a few hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 33]: He looked at Maud as he spoke , and she hesitated uncertainly , thinking once again of her mother 's absence , the disordered rooms , the prescribed contents of the larder .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 14]: `` It was very good of you , and we are very pleased .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 15]: Will you -- er -- will you be able to stop and dine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 6]: `` Thank you very much .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 7]: Your sister has already asked me .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 12]: If it would n't be giving you too much trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 6]: `` Oh , no trouble !
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 36]: I mean , of course , we are very much upset , and I do n't quite know what we can give you , but if you will stay we will do our best ! ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 11]: `` Now , Mr Talbot , listen to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 4]: interrupted Nan decisively .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 16]: `` There are two alternatives open to you , and you can take your choice .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 71]: Would you rather sit here by yourself , looking at albums and illustrated books while Mary changes her dress , and cook flies into a temper preparing a proper dinner , and Jane helps to tidy the dining-room , and Maud ransacks the store -- room , and Elsie polishes up silver , and Chrissie cuts flowers , and I -- '' Ned Talbot threw up his hands in despair .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 3]: `` Mercy !
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 3]: What next ?
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 5]: Please stop , Nan .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 9]: You make me feel the most shocking intruder .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 20]: If I am to cause such an upset , the sooner I rush back to the station the better .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 5]: What is the alternative ?
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 6]: Tell it me at once .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 8]: You said I had a choice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 42]: `` The alternative , '' said Nan slowly , beaming upon him the while , in a friendly , encouraging fashion , `` the alternative is what would happen to us if we were alone , and you had not arrived .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 22]: Dinner in the schoolroom , with the library pictures ranged along the walls , and the books piled on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 13]: No flowers -- no fruit -- no waiting -- no evening dress .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 13]: Everything on the table at once , and very little of that .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 8]: Cold beef -- very good cold beef !
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 30]: I 'll answer for that , for we 've had it two days already -- potatoes in their jackets , perhaps one other vegetable ... '' `` Nan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 20]: cried Maud protestingly ; but Talbot gazed at her with a smile , shadowed only by a faint anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 4]: `` Pickles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 4]: he queried eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 15]: `` Put my mind at rest on that point before we go any further !
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 6]: Surely there are pickles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 5]: `` Pickles , cer-tainly !
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 34]: As many as you like ; but mostly onions , I am afraid , for we like the cauliflowery bits best , and poke about with the fork to get them out first .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 7]: But there are lots of onions .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 47]: Cold beef and pickles , then , and something plain and wholesome in the shape of a pudding , such as stewed prunes and rice ; biscuits and cheese to follow ; and a really good cup of coffee made by our own fair hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 9]: `` It 's a feast for the gods !
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 6]: Nothing I should like better .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 29]: Do n't you know , Nan , that nine out of ten Englishmen would rather be set down opposite a joint of meat than half a dozen kickshaws !
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 43]: It will be like old times to have a meal in the schoolroom , and if you will really let me stay , and treat me exactly like one of yourselves , I shall enjoy it more than a dozen dinner parties .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 16]: You will promise faithfully to make no alteration whatever in the _ menu _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 9]: `` Certainly , if you wish it . ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 17]: `` And -- er -- you will not feel it necessary to dress on my behalf !
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 18]: I can make no change myself , so please do n't confound me by your magnificence . ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 26]: Lazy Nan consented readily enough , but once more the thought of the blue silk blouse sent a pang of disappointment to Maud 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 21]: She should not be able to wear it after all , and the long hoarding up had been in vain .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 37]: She reflected on the disappointing nature of earthly hopes , with a melancholy which would have done credit to Elsie herself , as she took her way downstairs to interview cook on the subject of dinner .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 67]: It is one thing to give a promise to make no difference in a _ menu _ , and another to keep that promise to the letter , as every housekeeper knows ; and even if circumstances did not allow of any substantial addition to the meal , there were a dozen little contrivances by which it could be given an air of elegance and distinction .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 50]: They took time to arrange , however , as all such contriving do , and cook was cross at being asked to undertake fresh duties , and wished to know what people wanted coming worriting about a house when a child in arms could see he was n't wanted !
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 58]: Maud smiled at the reflection that , in this instance , the child would be vastly mistaken in his views , but did her best to soothe the offended dignitary ; and finally matters were smoothed over by Mary being told off to help in the kitchen , while Maud herself undertook the arrangement of the table .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 57]: `` Nan will help me , '' she told herself encouragingly , as she mounted the staircase and saw through the window a procession of girlish figures making their way down the garden path , escorting Ned to a survey of the daffodils and spring bulbs , for which Mr Rendell was famous among amateur gardeners .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 40]: Lilias walked first , a dainty figure against the background of fresh green ; slim little Elsie picked her way daintily over the gravel ; Agatha followed , large and beaming ; and Christabel majestically brought up the rear .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 15]: Maud pressed her face against the window and watched with a spasm of envy .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 29]: Oh , to be out , enjoying herself with the rest -- to let everything take care of itself , and take her place by Ned 's side !
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 28]: Too bad to be kept indoors when her opportunity had come at last , and the sun was shining , and all Nature seemed bright and gay !
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 48]: No one seemed to have thought of her , or of offering to help , except Nan -- dear , good , thoughtless , and yet most thoughtful of Nans ; and here she came , flying three steps at a time , upstairs to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 7]: `` Oh , you are here !
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 6]: I 've been searching downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 4]: Out you go !
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 13]: If there 's anything to do indoors , I 'll do it .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 8]: Your place is in the garden . ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 22]: `` I 've been in the kitchen , and cook was so cross that I told off Mary to help her .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 8]: I promised to lay the table . ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 9]: `` I 'll do it for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 6]: Maud tried not to smile .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 16]: Well she knew what would happen if the work were left in Nan 's care .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 44]: Crooked cloth , forks and spoons looking as if they had been tossed upon the table ; as likely as not , no cruets nor water-bottles ; and a general air of slipshod carelessness , which would more than defeat all her arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 27]: `` I -- er -- think I ought to look after it myself , '' she said apologetically ; `` but please help me , dear !
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 28]: If we work together we 'll get it done in no time , and then I can go out and enjoy myself with an easy mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 8]: `` I want you to go now .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 13]: If you think I ca n't manage alone , send in Chrissie .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 21]: She 's even more particular than you , and I 'll do as she tells me like a lamb ! ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 22]: said Nan , not one whit offended at the implied slight on her own powers ; but Maud shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 5]: `` I could n't !
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 18]: I never ask help in an ordinary way , and I could n't do it to-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 5]: `` Too proud ? ''
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 4]: `` Much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 5]: `` Good for you !
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 6]: I 'd feel the same .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 15]: Come on , then ; let 's set to work and get it over .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 9]: He 'll be wondering what you are doing .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 6]: Where are the things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 16]: `` Mary has taken up some already , and the rest are in the pantry .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 24]: I 'll tell you what I want , and you can carry up a trayful at a time while I set the cloth .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 13]: I know exactly how I want everything laid , you see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 8]: `` Do n't apologise , my love .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 20]: I know I 'm no good at finnicky work , but I 'll fetch and carry with the best .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 4]: Knives -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 4]: Glass -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 4]: Plates -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 14]: Leave the plates till the last , and bring up the rest first .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 4]: Yes ` um !
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 3]: I understand !
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 6]: Knives and tumblers for seven .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 14]: They shall be yours before you can say ` Jack Robinson . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 8]: `` Not too quick , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 53]: cried Maud warningly ; but Nan was off , leaping downstairs in a succession of daring bounds , swinging round corners at break-neck speed , and singing at the pitch of her voice , after the usual decorous and ladylike manner in which she was wont to descend to the lower regions .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 46]: Left to herself , Maud took a couple of steps towards the window , turned back resolutely , spread the cloth over the table , and went back at a run to peer behind the curtains and see what was going on in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 43]: Chrissie and Agatha were strolling about arm in arm ; Elsie walked apart , bowed in thought ; Lilias flitted among the flower -- beds , gesticulating with graceful _ abandon _ as she called Ned 's attention to the choicest blooms .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 18]: Maud could hear her pretty ecstasies as plainly as though she had been standing by her side .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 5]: `` The little dears !
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 9]: Are n't they just _ too _ sweet ?
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 9]: Do n't you love the first spring flowers ?
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 10]: They seem so full of hope and promise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 49]: She had heard it all before , every time that a visitor was taken round the garden ; and just for a moment a wish passed through Maud 's mind that her beautiful sister were not quite so fond of acting a part for the benefit of strangers !
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 26]: As a matter of fact , Lilias took less interest in the garden than any of the girls , yet she always gushed the most !
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 28]: The next moment she pulled herself up sharply , abashed to have cherished such uncharitable sentiments , and went on resolutely with the laying of the table .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 29]: Spoons and forks had been neatly laid in their places before Nan 's approaching footsteps could be heard ploughing upstairs to an accompaniment of jingling glass and steel .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 24]: She had taken the warning to heart , apparently , for there was a noticeable pause between each footstep ; but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 20]: when the top of the stair was reached , there came a sudden and violent change in her procedure .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 67]: Maud heard a gasp , and then , even as she started forward to investigate the cause , in rushed Nan , head foremost , the contents of the tray raining on the ground , while she stumbled helplessly forward , and finally collapsed on the floor in a nest of knives and broken glass , to lift up her voice in a wail of anguish .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 7]: `` Oh , oh , oh !
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 5]: I caught my foot !
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 18]: That horrid braid tripped me up at the very last step , and sent me flying forward .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 6]: What shall I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 28]: `` I told you , '' -- began Maud , but stopped abruptly , knowing by experience how trying it was to be reminded of past warnings .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 10]: `` Oh dear , the fright you gave me !
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 9]: To fall down with such a dangerous load .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 7]: Nan , are you hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 6]: `` I 'm killed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 7]: cried Nan , with a sniff .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 14]: `` Talk of your fright , indeed : I 'm shaking all over .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 8]: I 'll run away and drown myself .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 9]: Always make a mess of everything I do !
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 6]: What will mother say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 9]: `` Do n't worry about that , dear .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 24]: You were trying to help , and being so good and kind , and half a dozen tumblers are not a deadly thing .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 6]: That wo n't ruin us .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 8]: It might have been far worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 5]: `` It is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 3]: sighed Nan .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 10]: `` Two water-bottles -- the best ones , too .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 8]: I thought they 'd look so nice .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 18]: Oh dear ; oh dear ; and just when I thought I was getting on so well !
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 11]: I came up so slowly , stopping at every step .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 36]: You might have heard me -- '' `` I did ; but you know , Nan , I said before -- Never mind , it 's done now , so it 's no use groaning .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 16]: You look so white , dear ; I am afraid you have had a shock .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 26]: Do n't try to do anything more , but go to your room and take some sal volatile , and lie down until dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 14]: But at that Nan rose to her feet with a laugh of derision .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 3]: `` I !
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 14]: I act the fine lady , and go to bed for a fall ?
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 3]: Not likely .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 14]: I shall have to work harder than ever to make up for this .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 26]: The knives might as well go in their places first , and then I 'll go down and get something to brush up the glass .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 21]: Do n't you come : it 's dangerous walking over here , and I can do it quite well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 9]: `` Nan , please leave it to me !
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 14]: I am sure you are hurt , though you wo n't acknowledge it .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 14]: Sit down and rest , if it 's only for five minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 7]: But Nan would not be persuaded .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 52]: She picked up the knives and hobbled round the table , laying them in their places and tossing her head with an air of triumph , oblivious of the fact that a drop of blood marked each stage of her progress , leaving a vivid stain on the fresh white cloth .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 33]: A groan of dismay from Maud 's lips aroused her attention , whereupon she flushed red with dismay , and stared down at her cut fingers with an air of shocked surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 48]: It was really too aggravating , and even placid Maud felt aroused to irritation ; but it is difficult to upbraid an offender who is herself overcome with penitence , and who lavishes such violent reproaches upon her own head , as Nan now proceeded to do .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 12]: `` Oh , mussey me , I thought they felt queer !
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 6]: They are cut all over .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 5]: Lockjaw , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 27]: I shall never be able to speak distinctly any more , but have to push all my food between my teeth , like poor Jane Smith .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 21]: Oh , Maud , Maud , I wanted to help , and I 've only made things worse than before !
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 4]: I always do .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 7]: Do please scold and get cross .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 6]: Do n't look so wretched .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 7]: Abuse me as I deserve ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 7]: `` What 's the good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 4]: sighed Maud dismally .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 20]: `` You did n't mean to do it , and it 's done , and ca n't be undone .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 11]: Come to my room and I 'll bandage your hands .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 18]: I 'm not afraid of lockjaw , but you ca n't go about any longer like that .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 13]: Then we must get a clean cloth , and begin again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 3]: Poor Maud !
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 23]: She set her lips and went through the new duties without shirking or skimping , resolutely avoiding a look into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 35]: There was no chance now of being able to join Ned before dinner , and as soon as the meal was over he would be obliged to hurry off to catch the last train .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 20]: After all the longing and expectation , it seemed as though she were to meet with nothing but disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 4]: DOUBT AND DREAD .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 55]: Maud had just time to change her working attire for a dress which was suitable for the evening , though not sufficiently dressy to break the compact which had been made with the visitor , before the gong sounded , and she returned to the schoolroom to join the other members of the party .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 18]: Ned was standing beside the fireplace , and greeted her with a pleasant smile as she entered .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 44]: `` You did n't come out and join us in the garden , '' he said ; and when she replied with a vague murmur , `` Ah , well , '' he added lightly , `` perhaps you were just as wise .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 27]: There is a decided nip in the air still , and if you get out of the sun , you are apt to feel chilled . ''
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 17]: Maud 's eyes opened with a quick glance of surprise , but she made no remark .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 13]: The words had chilled her as no east wind could have done .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 24]: Did Ned really believe that she would have stayed indoors and sacrificed an hour of his society for fear of a slight discomfort ?
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 59]: If he thought this , he was indeed unconscious of the true nature of her feelings towards him ; and though Maud was the last girl in the world to wear her heart on her sleeve , she had been happy to believe that she and Ned understood each other , and could count on a mutual affection .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 25]: She did not know which hurt the more , the suggestion of her own indifference or the unruffled serenity with which it was made .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 38]: As she sat opposite Ned at dinner , she studied his face , to see if she could find there a reflection of the depression which was stealing over her own heart , but looked in vain .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 23]: Truth compelled her to admit that she had never seen him brighter , more radiant , more full of life and animation .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 28]: She tried her best to throw off the cloud on her own spirits and to enter into the conversation , but the effort was not a success .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 14]: The hands of the clock on the mantelpiece held her in fascinated attention .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 29]: Every stroke seemed , to sound the knell of the bright hopes with which she had looked forward to this meeting , every stroke brought the parting nearer .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 41]: If Maud did not speak , the other girls more than made up for her silence , talking all together in true Rendell fashion , and telling the news of the last few months in their usual breathlessly eager fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 33]: Until now , conversation had had no chance of becoming general , and each one had some personal items of information to offer which appeared to her to be of absorbing interest .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 26]: Lilias had paid a visit to an old school friend , where she had had many pleasing adventures , which she related in characteristic manner .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 20]: Her sisters often discussed what it was which gave to Lilias 's stories such a suggestive and flattering atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 61]: It must have been something peculiar in the way in which they were told ; for though she never said such a thing in so many words , the hearers were yet impressed by the fact that she had played a leading part , had been surfeited with admiration , and positively oppressed by the attentions which she had received !
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 44]: This evening was no exception to the rule ; for as she spoke the listeners saw before them a picture of her own lovely figure moving like a queen through the scenes which she described , her humble vassals following in her wake .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 33]: Lilias must be cleverer than most people supposed , Nan told herself sagely , as she watched the face of the visitor , to see how he was impressed by the recitals .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 4]: Impossible to say !
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 12]: Ned stared fixedly at his plate , and made no remark .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 12]: He very seldom looked at Lilias at all , Nan noticed .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 42]: If it was not too absurd , she would have thought that he really avoided looking in her direction , while at every point in the conversation his eyes turned towards Maud , as if asking her sympathy in his enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 28]: Nan 's spirit rose with a bound , and she burst into the conversation once more , talking every one down by her high , clear tones .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 18]: `` Mr Talbot , do you realise that I 've growed up since you saw me last ?
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 15]: I 've said good-bye to childish things , and blossomed into a society dame .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 6]: I 'm a lady growed .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 7]: Did n't you notice it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 20]: Ned 's eyes gleamed upon her with the deep , kindly glow which Maud knew and loved to see .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 11]: `` I did n't , Nan ; I 'm sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 9]: I thought you looked exactly the same ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 13]: `` Never noticed my long skirts , or my done-up hair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 21]: Ned looked surprised , and tilted slightly back in his chair to obtain a better view of Nan 's head .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 34]: It was really rather puzzling to decide whether her curly mop was intended to be up or down ; and the burst of laughter which followed showed how perfectly his uncertainty was appreciated .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 19]: Nan made a grimace intended to express reckless indifference , and waved her bandaged hand in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 9]: `` Well , it _ is _ up !
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 10]: Do n't pay any attention to those silly things .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 21]: I ought to know best , for I 've three separate hair-pins sticking into my scalp at the present moment .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 15]: Jim took me to my first dance when he was at home for Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 5]: It was s-imply lovely !
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 27]: I was awfully nervous , for I generally manage to make an idiot of myself if I get a chance ; but I got on finely .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 24]: I fell down full length as I was entering the room , but that was only because the floor was so beautifully polished .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 15]: I danced every single dance -- all waltzes , and the most ex-quisite music .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 9]: I was introduced to an awfully nice man .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 19]: He had ears like windmills , and the biggest mouth I ever saw ; but he could dance !
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 37]: We went on , and on , and on , as long as the music lasted , and never stopped once ; and when it came to an end I was as red as a lobster .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 6]: It was simply lovely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 9]: Elsie smiled in an elderly and forbearing manner .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 9]: `` More than you were , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 23]: I can just imagine how you looked , with your hair all wild , and a crimson face above your white dress .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 10]: You never think about your appearance , Nan . ''
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 6]: `` Hope I never may .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 14]: I have n't one to think about , and that 's a blessing !
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 19]: It would be so boring to be pretty , and to have to worry about clothes and complexion .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 65]: I 'm thankful there 's none of that nonsense about me , '' cried Nan , beaming ; and every one of the listeners thought how pretty she looked at that moment , as she tossed her saucy head and smiled her dimpling smile ; but they would not for the world have said so , and spoilt the charm of her unaffected self-depreciation .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 22]: Christabel seized the opportunity , and took up the thread of conversation before any one else had time to come forward .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 14]: `` Mr Talbot , I 've been waiting to ask you a question .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 7]: Do you know anybody called Vanburgh ?
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 15]: The Grange is let at last , and the gentleman 's name is Vanburgh .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 12]: We are simply aching to get to know something about them .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 17]: The furniture has arrived , but nobody is in the house yet , except the servants .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 22]: We made up our minds that there would be a family of daughters , but we begin to have qualms . ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 22]: Chrissie was obviously pleased with the effect of that last expressive word , and repeated it once more with artistic relish .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 5]: `` Qualms , yes !
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 3]: Decided qualms .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 6]: The furniture is so massive .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 16]: We ca n't see anything at all that would suit a girl 's room . ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 14]: `` I ca n't give you any help on that point , Chrissie .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 27]: You can judge better than I ; but Vanburgh is an uncommon name , so we ought to be able to find out something about them .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 14]: Do you happen to know where they have been living till now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 17]: `` Here , and there , and everywhere ; wandering over the face of the globe !
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 40]: A great deal of the furniture comes from India and Egypt ; and one of the workmen came over to ask cook for some hot water one day , and said he believed the master had been travelling abroad .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 24]: I wanted cook to pump him to find out more , but she said mother had forbidden her to gossip about the neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 4]: Such a nuisance !
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 7]: I love gossiping about my neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 29]: I remember when I was a little girl , how I used to adore being in the drawing-room when callers came and discussed the affairs of the village .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 43]: I knew I should be sent away if I appeared to listen , so I used to sit and pretend to play with a doll or a book , while my ears were fairly sticking out of my head with curiosity . ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 5]: `` You little hypocrite !
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 12]: I would n't have believed you could have been so deceitful .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 15]: But do tell us if you know anything of the Vanburghs , Mr Talbot .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 11]: Did you ever meet any one of the name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 14]: `` I met a man once -- a fellow about my own age .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 14]: He was at Oxford with me , but not at the same college .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 8]: I saw very little of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 11]: `` That could not be the father , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 15]: He would have to be a son , and we never arranged for boys .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 8]: What sort of man was he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 7]: `` I beg your pardon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 6]: `` What does that mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 14]: What sort of man is supposed to be represented by ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 5]: may we ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 2]: Silence !
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 14]: Ned Talbot screwed up his lips and shook his head with determined obstinacy .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 13]: The girls stared at him in silence for a good two minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 5]: Then Maud spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 18]: `` Do you decline to say anything but ` Humph ' on the subject , Ned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 4]: `` Absolutely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 6]: `` How very interesting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 7]: Nan clasped her hands in delight .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 4]: `` How mysterious !
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 3]: How gloomy !
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 4]: How frightfully suspicious !
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 26]: I 'm sure there 's something very dreadful about him , and in that case he will be even more interesting than the girls . ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 4]: `` Nan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 7]: `` I ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 20]: We know so many estimable people that it would be delightful to meet somebody bloodthirsty , for a change .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 22]: Everything in Waybourne is so painfully commonplace that we are simply spoiling for a mystery , as the Americans would say .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 22]: Now , Mr Talbot wo n't commit himself to a definite charge , but his silence is more impressive than words .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 18]: I 'm sure there 's a mystery : something too gruesome and terrible to be divulged . ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 8]: `` You leap to conclusions , Nan .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 30]: Perhaps I had better state at once that there is nothing at all mysterious about the man I mentioned -- nothing of the kind , I assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 5]: `` Nor bloodthirsty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 12]: `` Nor in the faintest shadow of a degree bloodthirsty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 11]: `` Nor thrilling , nor gloomy , nor terrible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 10]: `` The farthest possible remove from such qualities . ''
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 5]: Nan groaned with disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 5]: `` What a blow !
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 3]: Another nonentity !
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 21]: I hope , then , that your Vanburgh has nothing to do with ours , for he sounds terribly uninteresting .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 38]: Never mind ; when you come down to see us in the summer , we shall have solved the mystery for ourselves ; and you will be obliged to come down for our sale , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 9]: Have you heard anything about our sale ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 17]: `` I -- er -- yes ; I heard something , '' -- began Ned hesitatingly .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 40]: He half turned his head towards Lilias , and then once more stared down at his plate , while she continued for him , in her sweet flute-like voice -- `` Oh yes ; I told him about it .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 13]: He has promised to come and help me when I get tired .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 10]: I ca n't manage the punt all alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 50]: Once again was noticed the subtle suggestiveness of Lilias 's manner ; but this time it was her pleasure to pose as a martyr -- a poor , fragile martyr , to whom had been deputed a hard and ungrateful task , while her companions played in the sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 48]: Nothing could be said against an unspoken accusation , especially in the presence of a stranger ; but the sisters exchanged meaning glances across the table , and Nan stamped _ so _ violently upon Elsie 's foot that that melancholy young person writhed on her seat .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 23]: The best safeguard to the feelings of the family was to change the subject , which Chrissie at once proceeded to do .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 13]: `` But sha 'n' t we see you again before midsummer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 4]: she inquired eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 16]: `` Is this really the only visit you are going to pay us this time ?
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 4]: Three skimpy hours !
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 11]: You generally come and stay over a Sunday at least .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 10]: Ca n't you come again before you go north ?
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 10]: Mother and father will be home on Thursday . ''
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 13]: Ned Talbot flushed suddenly , and bit his lips under his moustache .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 36]: He was evidently struggling with a spasm of nervousness ; and Maud noticed as much , and wondered as to its meaning , even as she blessed Christabel in her heart for her welcome suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 8]: Surely , surely Ned would not refuse !
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 11]: `` You are very kind , '' he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 11]: `` I had thought of asking if I might come .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 9]: I am anxious to talk to Mrs Rendell .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 28]: If it would not be inconvenient to have me from Saturday till Monday so soon after her return , I should very much like to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 16]: He looked inquiringly at Maud as he spoke , and she smiled a happy assent .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 27]: `` I am quite sure it will be convenient ; but I 'll tell-mother the moment she returns , and she will write to you herself .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 8]: You will probably hear on Friday . ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 9]: `` Thank you ; I hope I may .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 17]: This afternoon has been all too short , and I have not had time for anything .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 9]: Not even a glance of ` Kittay . '
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 26]: It 's absurd to pretend to have been to Waybourne when one has not seen ` Kittay ' ; is n't it , Christabel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 16]: Chrissie dropped her eyelids , and twisted her lip with an expression of supreme disdain .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 15]: `` I do not say ` Kittay ' ; I say ` Kittee . '
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 5]: You are too sillay .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 11]: Whatevah I say you mock me in this ridiculous mannah .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 13]: I sha 'n' t speak to you at all next time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 27]: Talbot made a gesture as of one heaping ashes on his head , and then , glancing at the clock , rose hurriedly from the table .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 5]: `` I must go !
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 7]: Just time to catch the train .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 10]: I had no idea it was getting so late .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 8]: That comes of enjoying myself so much .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 7]: I have had a jolly afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 13]: Do n't know when I have had such a good time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 29]: He held out his hand to Maud , and she took it , trying hard to smile as brightly as himself , but it was a difficult task .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 12]: She would rather he had been less bright , less complacent .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 21]: She could have been happier if he had gone away with a shadow of her own depression upon his brow .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 3]: Poor Maud !
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 11]: she turned back from the door with an aching heart .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 11]: The schoolroom seemed on a sudden unbearably grey and gloomy .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 11]: Her former peace had given place to an aching doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 4]: THE VANBURGHS ARRIVE .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 65]: The next day , when Kitty arrived at Thurston House , she was informed of Ned Talbot 's visit , and promptly remarked that it was a `` mean shame '' -- the shame consisting in the fact of the visit having been so timed that she herself had been deprived of the pleasure of seeing one who was honoured by her special approval .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 37]: All interest in Ned and his doings was soon wiped away , however , by a piece of intelligence so exciting that the listeners could only gasp , and hold on to their chairs for support .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 11]: It was Maud who brought the news to the schoolroom .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 22]: She had been in the kitchen interviewing the cook , and had received it straight from the lips of that authority .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 6]: `` Children , children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 10]: she cried breathlessly , `` the Vanburghs have arrived !
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 9]: They came late last night , cook says .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 24]: She saw the table laid for breakfast this morning , and the postman said he had taken some letters to the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 4]: `` Arrived ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 12]: The girls stared at one another in mingled excitement and disgust .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 7]: `` And we never saw them !
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 20]: How simply disgusting , when we have been sitting staring out of this window for the last three weeks !
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 4]: Late at night !
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 3]: What sneaks !
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 16]: Why could n't they come in the daylight , in a decent , honest fashion ?
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 7]: They might be ashamed of themselves !
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 12]: How many are there , and what are they like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 46]: But Maud knew nothing beyond the mere fact of the arrival , and the schoolroom party were obliged to control their curiosity as best they might until lessons were over , and they were free to station themselves once more in their place of observation .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 50]: If the Vanburgh family had ventured out of the house about noon , they would have been slightly disconcerted to see the row of heads in the window opposite , all craning forward to watch their slightest movement , and bobbing behind the curtains when they imagined themselves observed .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 4]: But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 6]: they did not come out .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 23]: The nailed door remained closely shut , and the disappointed watchers tried to console themselves by inventing satisfactory reasons for their non-appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 8]: `` They are busy , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 7]: There is so much to unpack .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 17]: Gabrielle is hanging her ball-dresses in the wardrobe and covering them over with muslin curtains . ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 10]: `` She would n't unpack for herself , silly !
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 16]: They have a French maid who does all that sort of thing for them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 12]: `` I know they have ; but Gabrielle is so particular !
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 27]: She ca n't bear any one to touch her dresses but herself ; besides , Therese has enough to do attending to the other young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 7]: Evangeline has a bad sick headache .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 13]: She is lying down in that room where the curtains are drawn .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 8]: Travelling always does make her ill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 7]: `` Ermyntrude is arranging her treasures .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 20]: Her bedroom looks out on the garden , and she is nailing up pictures , and draping the mantelpiece .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 10]: She has piles and piles of photographs to arrange .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 8]: They will keep her busy all day .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 18]: It 's ridiculous to suppose that they would go out the very first morning after their arrival .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 18]: You know how it is with us when we come home after a few weeks ' holiday !
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 10]: There are a thousand things to be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 8]: The girls unanimously agreed in this decision .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 34]: Nevertheless , the hope that one of the four Miss Vanburghs might appear at the windows kept them glued to their own posts until it was time to start for the daily walk .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 45]: The conversation turned exclusively on the subject of the new neighbours , as the little procession of girls and governess filed dejectedly down the street , and great ingenuity was exhibited in expressing disappointment in the language which was the order of the day .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 11]: `` C'est un horrible shame , '' sighed Kitty sadly .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 40]: `` C'est tout bien pour vous , parce que vous etes toujours ici ; mais moi , je suis chez moi , et si elles sortez quand je ne suis pas ici , je serais _ mad _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 10]: `` J'expect qu'elles sorteraient quand nous sommes tous loin .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 6]: C'est toujours le fashion ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 22]: sighed Chrissie , acutely conscious that her French was superior to that of her friend , but politely ignoring the fact .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 22]: `` Je demanderai a ma mere -- er -- er -- -LRB- how do you say ` pay calls ' ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 11]: -- a faire une visite , aussitot que possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 8]: `` Moi aussi , '' assented Kitty .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 27]: `` Et puis vous savez , elle peut dit : ` J'espere , Madame Vanburgh , que vos mademoiselles seraient tres grand amies avec mes filles .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 12]: Voulez vous permittez qu'elles venez a the mercredi prochaine ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 12]: `` Oui , et puis elles nous inviteraient en retourn . ''
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 12]: Christabel tossed her mane over her shoulders and smiled in anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 38]: She made up her mind then and there to decorate her bedroom with her most treasured nick-nacks on the afternoon of the Vanburghs ' visit , and to keep her new hair ribbon unused for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 6]: But no Miss Vanburghs appeared !
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 29]: The next day passed , and the next , and still another , and still no sign of a feminine presence lightened the dark windows of the Grange .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 48]: The solemn butler flitted to and fro ; the figure of a white-haired man could be dimly discerned , stretched upon a sofa , in the oak-panelled apartment immediately facing the porch-room of Thurston House ; but that was all that the most unremitting scrutiny could discover .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 39]: Nan shivered at an attic window for an hour on end , with no more exciting result than a glimpse of a tablecloth and a row of silver dishes ; and the great nailed door remained persistently closed .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 6]: And then the blow fell !
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 6]: There were no Miss Vanburghs !
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 8]: There was not even a Mrs Vanburgh !
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 40]: Could it be believed there was no woman in the family -- no one but an old invalid gentleman , who spent his days on a sofa , or in a wheeled chair being slowly driven about the garden ?
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 9]: A solitary man as tenant of the Grange !
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 11]: The finest house in the neighbourhood monopolised by an invalid !
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 30]: The ball-room , the billiard-room , the music-room , given over to the possession of one who would never use them ; the stables unused ; the gardens deserted !
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 8]: The Rendell girls could not believe it .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 8]: It was too horrible to be true .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 10]: Ermyntrude , Evangeline , and Gabrielle had no existence .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 14]: The happy dreams which had been woven about them could never be fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 9]: It was indeed a cruel and crushing disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 18]: `` What can he want with a house like that , the selfish , horrid creature ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 7]: demanded Agatha , nigh to tears .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 24]: `` If he is an invalid , what is the use of having a house big enough to hold a regiment of soldiers ?
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 22]: There are hundreds of villas where he might have been as ill as he liked , without monopolising our only Grange !
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 39]: What is to become of us , if all the best houses in the country are sold to hermits , and invalids , and white - haired old patriarchs , with not a single child to boast of !
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 2]: Selfish !
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 3]: Inconsiderate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 23]: `` I 'm sorry his back is bad ; but he had no business to come here , '' agreed Chrissie firmly .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 7]: `` We do n't want invalids .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 18]: We want a nice , big , lively family , with plenty of money and hospitable hearts .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 6]: I 'm lonely without Gabrielle .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 9]: I 'd taken such a fancy to her !
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 15]: This is worse than if the place had never been sold at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 14]: `` But still , you know the old man may be nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 4]: Kitty suggested hopefully .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 21]: `` Would n't it be lovely if he took a fancy to us , and made us all his heirs ?
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 4]: A million each !
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 29]: I 'd buy a pony-cart and a phonograph -- a friend of father has a phonograph at his home , and it 's such fun listening to it .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 22]: The cornet-solo is fine , and there 's a cylinder of a baby crying which sounds just like a dog barking .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 30]: The poor little soul was quite good , but its parents thought it would be nice to preserve its howls ; so they pinched it and made it cry .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 6]: Mean , I call it !
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 20]: Imagine her feelings when she is grown up , and this wretched thing is wound up to amuse strangers .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 3]: So degrading !
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 9]: Parents ought to consider their children 's feelings .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 35]: I read an awful story once of a girl who was looking over old magazines with some friends , and she came upon a photograph of herself as an advertisement of Infants ' Food !
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 17]: If that had happened to me , I should disown my parents and leave the country .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 21]: Mr Vanburgh has n't any children of his own , but he may like us all the more for that .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 23]: It would be an interest in life for him to make us happy , and we should reward him by our devotion .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 19]: It sounds like a book , and perhaps it may turn out for the best , after all .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 6]: I believe it will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 8]: `` Do n't be so horribly resigned !
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 12]: I hate people who are resigned when I am miserable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 4]: said Chrissie sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 22]: `` I want some nice girls , and I do n't care a rap about phonographs -- silly , squeaky things !
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 19]: There was one on the parade at the seaside last year , and it irritated me beyond words !
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 30]: Besides , I do n't think it 's at all nice to make up to a person just because he is rich , and might leave you some money .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 6]: I would n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 32]: It 's toadying ; and if there is one thing I detest above anothah , it is -- '' `` I never said I would ` make up ' to him .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 8]: I never hinted at such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 26]: We were not supposed to dream that he would leave us anything until he was dead , and then we would be overcome with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 11]: I should hope I detest toadying as much as you !
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 5]: Toady , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 12]: and Kitty tossed her head and curled her lip in disdain .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 23]: Both girls were upset by the sudden overthrow of their hopes , and therefore inclined to take offence more readily than usual .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 41]: Christabel retired to the window in dignified displeasure , while Kitty wriggled into the corduroy jacket , stuck the Tam O'Shanter on her head at a rakish angle , and hitched her books under her arm in preparation to depart .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 25]: Agatha 's expressive frowns and smiles were of no avail towards a reconciliation , and the parting took place in forced and chilly manner .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 5]: `` Good by-ee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 5]: `` Good by-ee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 34]: Then the door banged , and Kitty went stalking home , to drown her woes in afternoon tea , and to have her ruffled feathers smoothed down by her mother 's kindly sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 39]: Mrs Maitland regarded the disappointment from a personal standpoint , for the discovery that there was no Mrs Vanburgh was almost as great a blow to her as the absence of daughters had been to the schoolroom party .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 38]: She agreed with Kitty that it was most officious of a solitary male to monopolise the Grange , and bemoaned the loss to the neighbourhood in a manner tragic enough to satisfy even her daughter 's requirements .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 4]: `` Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 3]: oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 11]: and I was looking to her for so many subscriptions !
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 16]: I had put her down for two five-pound notes , and half a dozen guineas .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 22]: I meant her to take half my stall at the hospital bazaar , and to be the secretary of the Mission .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 12]: How useful I had made that woman , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 12]: and now she has vanished into thin air before my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 16]: I 'm terribly disappointed , Kit ; but we must make the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 6]: Poor , lonely old man !
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 11]: He will be bored to death in that silent house .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 16]: Lies on his back , you say , and is wheeled about in a chair ?
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 12]: That means paralysis , I suppose , or very bad rheumatism .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 14]: It 's sad to be old , and ill , and lonely . ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 18]: Mrs Maitland stared thoughtfully before her , cup in hand , and her eyes grew suddenly moist .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 68]: She was thinking how blessedly well off she was in her cheery , sunny little home , with husband and child to love her , and good health to enable her to do her work , and to find pleasure in the doing ; and the picture of the strange old man lying on his couch in the dim oak-panelled halls seemed by comparison gloomier than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 9]: `` We 'll help him , Kit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 4]: she said briskly .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 10]: `` We 'll help him , you and I !
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 19]: We 'll make his life brighter for him , and cheer him in every way we know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 34]: But , as it turned out , Mr Vanburgh was not anxious to be cheered , and Mrs Maitland found it more difficult than she expected to put her good resolves into practice .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 4]: NED 'S MISSION .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 15]: On Thursday evening , Mr and Mrs Rendell returned home from their Continental trip .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 42]: The house was spick and span , the girls were blooming in pretty evening dresses , and the travellers themselves looked immensely benefited by their holiday , so that the kissings and huggings of welcome were exchanged under the happiest conditions .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 42]: Nan was thankful to feel that no shade of displeasure lurked behind the tenderness of her mother 's greeting , and before the evening was over actually screwed up courage to put a question concerning the discovery of the scattered rice .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 6]: The explanation was disappointingly simple .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 19]: Mr and Mrs Rendell exchanged a smiling glance , and appeared much amused by the girls ' discomfiture .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 46]: `` Well , my dear , we had the carriage to ourselves as far as Dover , and your mother suggested in her thoughtful way that it would be wise to get some wraps ready , as it was often very cold on the pier .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 16]: Obedient as ever , I unstrapped the bundle , and discovered your nice little plot .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 40]: We lifted the cushions , poured all the loose rice on the seats , shook the cloaks out of the window , put down the cushions again , and had everything clear and tidy in ten minutes ' time !
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 18]: It was a nice little diversion , which came just as we had finished reading our papers .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 11]: Most thoughtful of you to provide it for us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 9]: `` And you had no stray pieces left ?
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 13]: None that caught in your clothes , and shook out afterwards ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 16]: `` I had a cloth brush in my bag , and I used it well .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 18]: I am sorry to distress you ; but we were not once mistaken for Edwin and Angelina .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 16]: It was a brilliant inspiration on your part , and I sympathise with your disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 13]: I said at once , ` This is Nan 's doing ! '
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 14]: and wished I was near , to pay you out for your audacity .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 10]: I hope your other pranks afforded you more satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 17]: I expect you have been up to all manner of mischief while we were away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 15]: `` I 've been most industrious , father , and good , and docile .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 7]: Ask Maud if I have n't .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 15]: I had a few accidents : they _ will _ occur , you know !
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 16]: Trays , for instance , jumping out of my hand , and smashing the glass .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 10]: It 's a mercy I was not killed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 3]: `` Glass ?
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 4]: What glass ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 15]: queried Mrs Rendell quickly ; and Nan smiled back at her with infantile candour .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 44]: `` Better tell her the first evening , when she ca n't find it in her heart to be cross , '' she had decided diplomatically ; and there was certainly no nervousness apparent in the manner in which she made her confession .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 7]: `` Oh , only some tumblers .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 4]: Not so many .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 6]: Seven or eight , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 19]: They were not the best ones ; none of the best set were broken except two little water-bottles .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 9]: Such a mercy , was n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 24]: She affected not to hear Mrs Rendell 's groan of dismay , and spread out her scarred hands with an air of thanksgiving .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 13]: `` As for me , I ca n't imagine how I escaped .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 24]: There were knives on the tray , and they fell in showers round me -- literal showers -- and dug into my hands !
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 6]: The blood -- oh-oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 12]: Nan rolled her eyes to the ceiling , and shuddered dramatically .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 4]: `` Ask Maud !
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 13]: She wanted me to go to bed , but I struggled on .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 15]: We were particularly busy that night , and wanted to help the servants . ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 6]: `` Ned Talbot was here .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 20]: He appeared suddenly , when we were laying carpets , and went down on his knees to help us .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 30]: He seemed to expect to stay to dinner , so we gave him a scramble meal , and he left by the 8:30 train , '' explained Maud hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 47]: She , like Nan , had decided to give her own special piece of news on the evening of her parents ' return ; but though she appeared to be looking in an opposite direction , she was acutely conscious of her mother 's searching glances .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 4]: `` In-deed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 5]: Mrs Rendell said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 12]: `` He is staying in town , then , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 8]: Is he to make a long visit ?
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 9]: Shall we see him again this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 32]: `` He said of his own accord , mother , that he would like to come from Saturday until Monday if it would not inconvenience you so soon after your return .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 17]: I promised to give you the message , and said you would probably write yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 13]: `` He said he wanted particularly to speak to you and father .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 5]: I wonder what about !
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 29]: He does n't generally care to be with you as much as with us ; but he said it as if he meant it -- he really did .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 9]: I ca n't imagine what he wants ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 28]: said Agatha the tactless , blurting out her thoughts as usual , and beaming round the company , unconscious of the consternation which her words had caused .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 4]: Maud flushed crimson .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 36]: Elsie and Nan blushed in sympathy for her confusion , and Chrissie from sheer rage and irritation , and longing to take the big , blind blunderer by the shoulder and administer a good shaking .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 28]: Only Lilias remained cool and self-possessed , and came to the rescue with a change of subject , for which her sisters blessed her in their hearts .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 56]: No further reference was made to Ned Talbot that evening , nor was any letter forwarded to his London address ; but next day , as Maud passed the morning-room on some domestic errand , a voice called her by name , and she entered , to find her mother seated before an open desk .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 22]: `` I am writing to Ned Talbot , '' she said , `` and I wanted to consult you before finishing .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 12]: I think the time has come for plain speaking , Maud .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 18]: Am I to tell this young fellow that we shall be pleased to see him or no ?
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 41]: It has been easy to see that he has had a special attraction in this house for some years past ; and now that his position is established , he may have made up his mind to state his wishes .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 28]: I have little doubt what they will be , nor , I think , have you , so it lies with you to decide the question . ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 19]: Maud laid down her bundle , and grasped the sides of the table to steady her trembling hands .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 13]: `` Mother , I do n't know -- I 'm not certain !
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 20]: I have only thought at times that perhaps -- perhaps he cared -- '' `` Of course , dear .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 4]: I understand that .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 15]: He could not show his feelings too plainly while he was unprepared to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 9]: That is all right , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 10]: What you have to consider is your own attitude .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 29]: If you do not care for him , or do not wish to be hurried into a decision , we will postpone this visit until a future occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 23]: He himself doubted whether I could receive him so soon after our return , so that I can easily make an excuse .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 28]: On the other hand , Maud , if you would like to see him -- '' She paused significantly , and looked full into Maud 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 36]: For a long silent minute that gaze continued , the mother sitting with raised head , the girl standing before her , flushed and shy , yet showing no sign of shrinking before her scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 8]: `` Yes , mother , I would .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 9]: I 'd rather you let him come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 14]: A quiver passed over Mrs Rendell 's face , and her eyes dropped .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 44]: No mother in the world can hear that her daughter 's heart has gone beyond her keeping , without feeling a pang of pain mingling with the joy ; and this was a peculiarly tender mother , despite her little airs of severity .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 28]: There were a few minutes when she dared not trust herself to speak , then she held out her hand and drew the girl to her side .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 7]: `` Bless you , my daughter !
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 10]: My good girl -- my dear , kind helper .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 22]: I 'll miss you sorely ; but I am glad of anything that makes for your happiness , now and always .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 11]: You know that , do n't you , darling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 24]: Maud put down her head and shed a few tears of happiness and excitement , which had in them no trace of bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 56]: When the time arrived for leaving home , that would doubtless be a real trouble ; but at present she could not realise the wrench , while her mother 's certainty concerning Ned 's love was the best medicine possible for the doubts which had been so distressing since the occasion of his last visit .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 58]: In ten minutes ' time she returned to her work , with no stain of tear-marks to tell of her recent emotion , but with a quiet illumination in her face which satisfied the mother that this attachment to Ned Talbot was no mere girlish fancy , but the deep faithful love which endures for a lifetime .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 47]: The important letter was posted , and the invitation which it contained accepted by telegram within an hour of its arrival , and half Friday night Maud lay with wide , bright eyes staring through the darkness , too excited , too happy , to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 6]: Ned arrived on Saturday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 41]: It was a glorious spring day , the sun shining so powerfully that for the first time in the year afternoon tea was carried out to the summer-house , while the family gathered around on various garden stools and chairs .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 34]: They were hardly seated when Ned came walking across the lawn , a tall , handsome figure , in a spring-like suit , his dark face lit up with a smile of pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 34]: Maud looked at him , aglow with love and pride ; but as he drew nearer she busied herself with the teacups , and had only a casual word of welcome to offer .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 38]: It would not do to appear too glad , she told herself ; and when there were so many , an individual greeting was hardly noticed , nor was there any opportunity for _ tete-a-tete _ conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 44]: When the tea-things had been carried away , however , and the girls began to wander about the garden in twos and threes , Maud found Ned by her side , waiting for her , and allowing the others to walk on ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 16]: She looked up with a questioning glance , and met a smile of frank affection .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 18]: `` Well , have you finished your duties , and got five minutes ' leisure for once ?
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 10]: Come along , and have a walk with me .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 13]: I never met such a girl for being busy all day long .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 13]: Do n't think I have ever seen you sitting with idle hands .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 14]: You remember Jim 's old nickname , ` Maud of all work ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 4]: A capital title !
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 18]: But he would have missed it badly if he had not had you to wait upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 13]: I used to tell him I envied him such a sister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 9]: Maud smiled vaguely and turned her head aside .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 35]: It was all very kind , very flattering , very friendly , yet somehow it failed to satisfy ; and even as she listened the old ache of uncertainty came back to her heart .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 24]: It was difficult to say why , unless perhaps it was that Ned 's manner was a little too friendly to be welcome .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 63]: In the old days he had not been so much at his ease ; they had talked merrily enough together while the others were present , but so soon as they had been left alone a constraint had been wont to fall upon them , -- a silence , awkward , embarrassing , yet in some inexplicable way more eloquent than words .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 33]: Maud thought of the past with a quick catching of breath , and through the whole of that afternoon and evening the vague depression deepened , and refused to be argued away .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 39]: Ned , it was true , took advantage of every opportunity of being near her , yet the time had been when he had seemed shy of approaching ; and she preferred the shyness to this open friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 15]: He talked to her more than to any one of her sisters , yes !
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 25]: in frank , cheery words with unlowered voice , as a brother might talk to a sister , or a son to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 15]: He looked at her with kindly affection , and the look chilled her heart .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 26]: Once again Maud passed a sleepless night , but the darkness was no longer illumined by rosy dreams , but black with fear and dread .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 38]: Sunday was a glorious day , and Maud felt it another drop in her cup to be obliged to wear winter clothes instead of blossoming out in the pretty spring costume which she had hoped to possess .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 70]: The dressmaker had proved faithless , like the rest of her kind , and , being unable to finish two dresses by the promised time , had followed her usual custom and sent home the one destined for the younger sister ; for , in spite of her gentle manners , Lilias had `` a way with her '' which carried infinitely more weight than Maud 's good-natured placidity .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 46]: The sisters were standing in the hall providing themselves with hymn - books from the pile laid out on the top of the oak bench , when Lilias came tripping downstairs in her pale grey draperies , a very incarnation of the beautiful spring morning .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 25]: Maud looked at her with ungrudging admiration , then turned instinctively to see how Ned in his turn was affected by the charming vision .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 41]: She saw him flash one quick glance at Lilias , and immediately turn on his heel and walk to the other end of the hall , and throughout the walk to church she puzzled over the meaning of such behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 15]: Why should the sight of Lilias in her fresh beauty disturb Ned 's equanimity ?
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 21]: Was it possible he had taken a dislike to her , or felt a masculine disdain for her innocent vanity ?
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 41]: Maud honestly hoped not ; for , though she desired above all things to possess Ned 's love for herself , it would be still necessary for her happiness that he should accept as his own her five beloved sisters .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 8]: The day passed without any important developments .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 65]: Maud went off to teach her Sunday-school class in the afternoon , trying hard to conquer the spasm of envy which overcame her at the sight of Lilias seated in the garden hammock , swinging herself to and fro on the tips of her little shoes , while Ned mounted guard by her side , and Agatha and Chrissie paced lazily up and down .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 37]: Maud was devoted to her `` boys , '' but on this occasion there was no denying that it was an effort to tear herself from home , and she would gladly have welcomed a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 30]: Her path led through the garden , and as she approached the gate the hope flitted through her mind that Ned might offer to accompany her on her walk .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 40]: It would be an opportunity for a quiet _ tete-a-tete _ , which was rarely to be gained in the midst of such a large family ; and if Mrs Rendell 's surmises were correct , surely -- surely !
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 24]: But Ned did not even rise from his seat beside the hammock : he only waved his hand and nodded an unclouded farewell .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 51]: The twelve mischievous little boys behaved with unprecedented decorum that afternoon ; for , in spite of their elfish ways , they were devoted to Maud , and the ringleader sent round an imperative message to the effect that `` Teacher was bad , and must not be worried . ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 32]: It was characteristic of Maud also that she did not allow the lesson to suffer because of her own depression , but rather put into it more than the usual earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 72]: She had always felt a heavy sense of responsibility in taking this class , and every week , as she looked at the eager young faces , she was thrilled with a fresh longing to help them to grow up into strong , upright men , who would be a power for good in the world , -- `` gentlemen of Christ , '' as the grand old phrase has it .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 47]: When they were indifferent or callous , after the manner of boys , she strengthened herself against disappointment by remembering how words committed to memory in her own careless youth remained indelibly printed on the brain , to be a strength and solace in after years .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 56]: The hymns and chapters were learnt as lessons now , but in time to come their true meaning would be revealed ; and she loved to combat the suspicion that the Bible was a dull , uninteresting book , by relating the histories of its heroes in a manner most calculated to arouse schoolboy enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 31]: Brave , lovable David , with his chosen friend Jonathan , the type of princehood ; the gloomy but majestic figure of Saul , trustful Abraham , and fearless Daniel .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 24]: It was a joy to make them live in the boys ' imagination , and see the bright interest on the listening faces !
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 39]: When Mrs Rendell said good-night to her daughter , she was especially tender in her manner , for she vaguely felt that all was not going well , and took herself to task for having forced a confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 13]: Could it be be that she had taken too much for granted ?
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 16]: that her motherly pride had given her an exaggerated idea of Ned Talbot 's feelings ?
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 86]: He had shown no anxiety to speak to her in private , and at one time it seemed as if he would go back to town without touching on any but impersonal topics ; but on Monday morning , after wandering restlessly about the house for some time after breakfast , Ned seemed suddenly to take his courage in both hands , and , coming up to his hostess as she sat writing notes , begged the favour of a few minutes ' private conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 20]: Mrs Rendell looked up sharply , met an embarrassed yet steadfast glance , and felt a throb of relief .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 4]: `` Certainly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 22]: `` In ten minutes from now I shall have finished my household arrangements , and will meet you in the summer-house .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 13]: Go into the garden and enjoy a smoke until I come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 22]: Ned walked away obediently , and Mrs Rendell thrust the half-finished note under her desk , too agitated to complete it .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 38]: She had shown no signs of surprise to the young man himself , but her heart was beating quickly , and she bundled away her writing materials in a haphazard fashion very unlike her usual methodical ways .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 48]: Her first thought was for Maud , and most of the ten minutes of Ned 's waiting were taken up in interviewing the girl , and deputing to her a dozen little shopping commissions which would keep her occupied in the village for an hour to come .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 14]: `` I am going to have a talk with Ned in the summer-house .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 9]: You will find us there when you return .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 14]: Come straight to me , and tell me how you have succeeded . ''
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 30]: These were her last instructions , and when she had given them she turned sharply aside , lest her face should betray the meaning that lay behind her words .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 16]: Ned was waiting for her with an evident nervousness mingling with his usual kindly courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 26]: He made no attempt to open the conversation with meaningless commonplaces , and , after they were both seated , several moments passed in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 31]: Then suddenly the two pairs of eyes met ; the young fellow flushed and paled , and laid a hand on his hostess 's chair with a boy-like pleading gesture .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 21]: `` Oh , Mrs Rendell , '' he cried , `` I have a great favour to ask you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 4]: A TRAGIC SURPRISE .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 22]: Half an hour later , Nan Rendell let herself out of the front door , and ran hurriedly down the steps .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 49]: Her sailor hat was perched uncertainly on the top of her heavy braids , the buttons of her jacket were unfastened , and she drew on her gloves as she walked , as if she had been in too much haste to finish dressing before leaving the house .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 36]: Several acquaintances saluted her as they passed , but she rushed along unconscious of their greetings , and presently arrived at the point in the high road where houses stopped and the little township began .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 29]: The shops which Mrs Rendell patronised were indiscriminately situated on either side of the road , which no doubt accounted for Nan 's erratic dives to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 62]: She peered her head round the corner of the draper 's door , dashed across the road and craned through the grocer 's window , stood on tip-toe to investigate the interior of the post office , then ran back once more , to interview the fishmonger , and ask if Miss Rendell had yet called to leave the morning order .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 15]: It was in the confectioner 's that Maud was run to earth at last .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 29]: She was coming out of the doorway counting her change into her purse , when suddenly Nan 's face confronted her , and she started back in surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 4]: `` You ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 7]: `` Yes , it 's me .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 9]: I 've been looking for you everywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 10]: `` But I thought your were going to work ?
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 7]: I left you hard at it .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 5]: Got a headache ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 4]: `` Fer-ightful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 24]: said Nan ; and her looks justified the word , for her cheeks were pale , and her eyes looked worn and strained .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 8]: `` I could n't work any longer .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 18]: I thought a little walk would do me good , so came out to meet you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 11]: `` But -- er , '' -- Maud hesitated uncertainly .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 35]: She did not wish to appear inconsiderate towards her beloved Nan , but , remembering her mother 's instruction , she could not bring herself to stay away from home longer than was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 15]: She looked at her sister appealingly , and slid a hand through her arm .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 21]: `` But -- I 've finished my shopping , dear , and mother said I was to go straight back .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 13]: Would n't it do just as well to sit in the garden ?
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 20]: You would get the air without fatigue , and I 'd make you so cosy in the deck chair .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 14]: You know , Nan , I -- I want to go back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 15]: Nan turned her head aside , and spoke in a queer , muffled tone .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 13]: `` Very well ; but we 'll go round the back way .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 12]: It 's only five minutes longer , and it 's quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 9]: I do n't want to meet any one .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 22]: You 'll do that to oblige me , wo n't you , Maud , as you have finished your shopping ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 5]: Of course she would .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 26]: Maud gave a little grip to her sister 's arm , and turned willingly enough up the side street which led off the high road .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 16]: As in all small towns , the change from town to country came surprisingly quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 27]: Three minutes ' walk took the sisters into a pretty lane running parallel with the High Street , and commanding a sweeping view over the countryside .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 24]: Here were no houses , only an avenue of beeches , with here and there a seat in a position of welcome shade .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 33]: Maud often returned home by this quieter route , and seated herself on one of the benches to make up her accounts and enjoy the view at one and the same time .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 28]: It was a favourite spot ; but after this morning she could never pass it without a shrinking of the heart , a sickly remembrance of misery .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 48]: At the first seat Nan slackened her pace insinuatingly , while Maud marched ahead , intentionally obtuse ; but at the second a hand was laid on her arm , and such a trembling voice besought her to stop , that she forgot herself in sympathetic alarm .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 10]: `` Nan , you _ do _ look ill !
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 6]: As white as a sheet .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 18]: Lean forward and put your head on your knee , as low as you can get it !
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 12]: That is the best thing to do if you feel faint .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 16]: Sit still for a minute , and then we will make another dash for home .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 7]: You ought to lie down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 13]: But Nan sat bolt upright , clasping her fingers in nervous misery .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 6]: `` I 'm not faint .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 9]: I 'm thinking of you , not myself !
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 34]: -- Maud darling ; it 's been a mistake -- we were all mistaken ; but you are so good , you will be brave for our sakes , if not your own .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 11]: It would break our hearts to see you suffer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 19]: She stopped short with a little sob of agitation , and Maud stared at her with wondering eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 3]: `` Suffer !
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 2]: I ?
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 6]: Why should I suffer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 27]: Then the colour rushed in a sudden wave to her cheeks , and her voice broke in the single , stifled inquiry , `` Ned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 4]: It is Lilias !
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 7]: He has asked mother for Lilias .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 20]: She came upstairs and sent me out to meet you , so that you might not hear it suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 10]: She thought you would rather have it so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 6]: `` How kind of her !
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 8]: That was good of you both ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 4]: said Maud calmly .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 50]: Her heart had stopped for a moment , and was now beating away at extraordinary speed ; a singing noise was in her ears : it was as if some one had dealt her a violent blow , and she was as yet too stunned to realise its nature .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 15]: She turned her head aside , and _ gazed _ vaguely up and down .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 27]: A nursemaid wheeled a perambulator on the opposite pavement , while a little white-robed figure trotted at her side , tossing a ball in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 8]: Maud watched her movements with fascinated gaze .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 21]: It seemed as though some tremendous issue depended on whether the ball was caught in those tiny , uncertain fingers .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 11]: `` Ned wants to marry Lilias , does he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 20]: Her voice sounded strange and far away , and she noted as much , and pondered on the peculiarity .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 8]: `` They will make a handsome couple .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 5]: Lilias is so fair .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 8]: She will look well beside him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 6]: `` Maud , do n't !
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 12]: For pity 's sake do n't take it like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 21]: The tears were raining down Nan 's cheeks , and she seized her sister 's hand in a passionate grasp .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 7]: `` I know all about it .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 9]: I am almost as wretched as you are .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 6]: Do n't pretend to me .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 20]: Say what you feel to me , at least , and it will help you to bear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 13]: `` But I do n't feel anything , '' said Maud dully .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 7]: `` It seems like a dream .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 2]: Lilias !
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 15]: He loves Lilias , and not me ; he never loved me at all !
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 10]: He has been thinking of Lilias all this time .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 7]: It 's -- very -- strange !
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 13]: I think what I feel most is shame for my own conceit .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 15]: I have been deceiving myself all along , and that is a miserable thought !
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 24]: You should not sympathise with me , Nan : you should scold me , and tell me to be ashamed of myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 22]: She spoke in the same dull , strangled note , and Nan continued to cry and clasp her hand in distress .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 17]: `` I could never do that , or be anything but proud of you , darling !
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 17]: It was no conceit at all on your part , for we all thought the same .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 19]: He always seemed to prefer being with you , and to be so shy and constrained with Lilias .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 14]: I suppose that was a sign , but we did not recognise it .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 16]: Even mother was sure it was you : every one was , except Lilias . ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 7]: Maud gave a quick glance upward .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 5]: `` Did Lilias guess ?
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 9]: Did she know that this was coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 19]: `` I have not seen her ; but from what mother said , I imagine she did . ''
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 12]: `` And she will -- she cares for him too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 33]: It was a very low little yes , almost a whisper , but at the sound of it Maud shrank as at a blow , and her face became drawn with pain .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 50]: For the first time a realisation of what the news meant , broke upon her , and she cried aloud in a voice sharp with misery -- `` They will be engaged ; they will be married ; and I shall have to stay at home and look on !
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 15]: I shall have to take part , and pretend that I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 12]: Oh , I ca n't -- I ca n't do it !
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 44]: If it had been some one at a distance , some one I need never have seen , I could have borne it ; but my own sister , living in the same house together all day long -- that is too bitter !
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 9]: I 'd rather die than face it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 8]: `` Then I 'll die too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 4]: cried Nan hotly .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 17]: `` Whether Ned cares for you or not , you are all the world to me .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 11]: You do n't know how I love you , Maud !
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 30]: It would have broken my heart if you had married and gone away , and I never want to marry myself , if you and I can live together .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 8]: No man could make up for you .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 5]: I hate them all !
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 2]: Wretches !
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 7]: Nothing but misery wherever they come .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 43]: I 'll never fall in love , and you 'll get over this in a few months , and we will look forward to having our own little house , and growing old together , -- wo n't we , darling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 11]: `` Yes , we will , '' assented Maud meekly .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 26]: She looked at her sister and tried hard to smile ; but the prospect seemed so dull -- oh , so heart - breakingly dull !
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 31]: -- after the rosy dreams of the past , that what was meant as comfort proved , after all , the last strain which was to break down her composure .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 20]: She threw up her hands to her face , and rocked to and fro in an abandonment of distress .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 14]: `` Oh -- oh , the days , and weeks , and months !
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 21]: They will be so long ; I ca n't realise it yet , but I know how I shall suffer .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 19]: Oh , Nan , is n't it hard , after being so happy -- after feeling so sure ?
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 35]: I never had a doubt all these years except just this last week , and then I thought it was my own foolish imagining ; -- and now to have it end like this !
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 6]: I ca n't believe it !
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 9]: Are you sure , are you quite sure ?
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 8]: It seems like a hideous mistake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 10]: Nan shook her head , and her face hardened .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 22]: `` There 's no mistake on my part , but there 's one on his , and a big one too .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 11]: He 'll find it out , that 's one comfort !
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 6]: He 'll suffer for it !
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 22]: If he thinks Lilias is going to be the sort of wife he needs , he 'll find out his mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 36]: He thinks himself well off because he has a few hundreds a year , and is as proud as a king because he has a house of his own in a dull little country town .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 17]: Lilias 's ideas of poverty and his of wealth will come to much the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 15]: She hates the country , and flies off to town at the least excuse .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 22]: Ned is quiet and book-wormy ; and she wants some one who is fond of life , and likes gadding about .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 30]: They do n't suit each other in any one way that I can see , and before a year is over they will have found it out for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 7]: Then he will be sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 8]: Maud cut her short with uplifted hand .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 11]: `` Do n't , Nan ; you make it worse !
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 20]: You mean to be kind , but it does n't comfort me to think that he will be disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 26]: I love him , you see ; and I ca n't change in a moment because I discover that he does n't care for me .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 7]: I want him to be happy .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 16]: It would make me more miserable than ever if I thought it was a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 7]: You are too hard on Lilias .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 22]: She is very sweet and amiable , and if she really loves him she will not mind little things like that .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 21]: We never spoke about him together , she and I , and she has only done what I did myself .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 9]: No one is to blame -- no one !
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 15]: It was my own foolish mistake , and I must bear the consequences . ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 13]: `` You are an angel , and too good to live ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 7]: cried Nan , with a gulp .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 11]: `` I blame everybody , and myself worst of all .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 19]: Prided myself on being sharp - sighted , and could n't save you from a blow like this !
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 11]: ... Maud , you do n't want to go home ?
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 9]: You would rather not see him this morning ?
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 34]: Mother said she would give no definite answer before talking to father , but would let him see Lilias for half an hour , and then pack him off by the midday train .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 41]: She was going to tell him that under the circumstances she would prefer that he did not stay to lunch , so there would seem nothing strange about it if you and I were not back before he left . ''
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 8]: `` No , '' agreed Maud softly .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 13]: She drew her watch from her belt and looked at the hour .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 8]: `` Perhaps you are right , Nan .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 14]: It would be better not to try my strength too much this morning .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 31]: In a day or two I shall have gained a little courage , but this morning I -- I 've had rather a shock , and feel weak and nervous .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 12]: We will sit here and wait until he is gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 10]: `` Would n't you rather come for a walk ?
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 11]: The time seems so long when you are sitting still .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 9]: A nice brisk walk through the woods ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 14]: suggested Nan insinuatingly ; but Maud drew back with a quiver of pain .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 5]: `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 4]: Not this morning !
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 6]: I should remember it always .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 23]: Every step of the path would bring back this wretched day in the future , and I do so love the woods .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 11]: Let me keep them free from association , at least .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 18]: It will be bad enough to dread this road , as I always shall after this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 19]: `` Just as you like , dear , just as you like ; but what will you do ?
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 12]: You ca n't sit still and think all the time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 31]: `` I 'll make up my accounts , '' said Maud simply ; and , despite her sister 's cry of protest , she insisted on doing as she said .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 35]: Pencil and note-book came out of her pocket , and one item after another of the morning 's shopping was jotted down , and the result compared with the change in the housekeeping purse .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 6]: How could she do it ?
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 24]: Nan tried to imagine how she herself would have acted in similar circumstances , and felt her heart beat fast at the possibility .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 32]: Rage , storm , despair ; drown herself in the nearest stream ; lie down beneath the express train ; bid farewell to the world , and retire into a nunnery .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 19]: All these alternatives seemed natural and easy ; she could imagine taking refuge in any one of them .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 31]: But to go on with ordinary , everyday work , to take up the `` next duty '' and perform it in quiet , conscientious fashion -- that was impossible !
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 15]: -- the last thing in the world that she could bring herself to do .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 36]: She did not realise that the bent of a lifetime is not reversed in a moment , and that even the pangs of slighted love must be borne according to the temperament of the sufferer .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 21]: Dear , placid , domesticated Maud found her best medicine in the `` trivial round , the common task . ''
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 45]: Nan , looking over her shoulder , saw that the little rows of figures were as neat and accurate as ever , and caught a sigh of satisfaction when they were added together , and the change in the housekeeping purse was proved correct .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 25]: Even in the midst of her distress , Maud was conscious of a distinct sense of satisfaction in balancing her accounts to a penny .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 4]: THE FIRST ENGAGEMENT .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 16]: The remaining hours of that day were the most painful which Maud had ever known .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 43]: The sisters returned to find the household in a state of wild excitement , for such secrets seemed to leak out in the air , so that the very servants suspected the truth , and walked about the house with curious smiles .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 26]: The housemaid confided to the cook that the missis had come in from the garden all of a tremble ; had replied , `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 3]: Certainly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 25]: when asked for instructions , and had then sent Miss Lilias to see Mr Talbot in the drawing-room all by her very own self .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 11]: What did that mean , she would like to know ?
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 39]: And cook shook her head , and said it was n't for nothing she had fallen up the cellar stairs the week before ; and a very good thing too , if one of them did go off !
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 21]: When there were six of them waiting for their turns , the elders ought to hurry up and make room .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 68]: Mary , the waitress , shed tears over her silver in the pantry , because there was a look about the back of Mr Talbot 's head that reminded her of her young man , who had gone abroad to prepare a home ; and all three flattened their noses against the window when Ned departed , in the hope of witnessing a tender and affecting farewell .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 28]: They were disappointed , however , for Lilias did not leave the drawing - room , and only Mrs Rendell accompanied the young man to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 59]: She had put on her bonnet , and followed him slowly down the road , for ordinary duties must be attended to , even on the exciting occasion of the first engagement in the family , and on this particular morning there happened to be a committee meeting at the vicarage , which she felt bound to attend .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 40]: When Maud returned , therefore , only her sisters were at home to receive her , and she had barely entered the house before Agatha rushed forward , flushed and beaming , and drew her forcibly into the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 8]: `` Maud , Maud , such news !
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 3]: Such excitement !
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 4]: Have you heard ?
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 5]: Did Nan tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 5]: Is n't it lovely ?
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 4]: The first engagement !
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 22]: Oh , how I have longed to have a wedding in the family , and now it 's really coming off !
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 8]: It 's too good to be true !
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 5]: Ned Talbot , too !
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 5]: Such a scrumptious brother !
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 17]: I always hoped he 'd ask one of us , but I thought it was you .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 6]: Funny , was n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 37]: I said to Chrissie -- '' `` It was very bold and interfering of you to say anything of the sort , then ; what business have you meddling with other people 's love affairs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 22]: interrupted Elsie sharply ; and Maud glanced at her , and turned away quickly to avoid a look of sympathetic understanding .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 40]: Elsie was old beyond her years , and had been quick to understand the true position of affairs ; but Maud hardly knew which was more painful -- Agatha 's tactless speeches , or the other 's undisguised commiseration .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 24]: It was a relief to turn to Lilias and meet her lovely eyes , guilelessly free from any feeling but her own happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 33]: Lilias had little natural insight , and was , besides , so wrapped up in her own interests , that she was as blind as a bat to what was passing around .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 41]: She came forward , smiling and blushing , and Maud kissed her , as was expected , and murmured words of congratulation , feeling meantime that this very unconsciousness would be her greatest assistance in the difficult time to come .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 10]: `` I 've heard all about it , Lilias .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 8]: I hope you will be very happy .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 12]: It is really all settled , and you are engaged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 5]: `` Yes -- no !
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 6]: Not formally , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 41]: Mother wo n't consent to anything definite until she has consulted with father ; but , of course , we , '' -- Lilias dimpled and smiled seraphically over the unaccustomed word -- `` we feel that it is settled .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 11]: We are quite sure of ourselves , at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 26]: `` Then I 'd get married as soon as you could if I were you , in case you changed , '' said Agatha darkly .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 12]: `` You do change most awfully , Lilias , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 27]: When you bought your last hat you said it was a ` simple love , ' and the next month you pulled it all to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 23]: And you used to adore Fanny Newby , and now you go out of the side door when you see her coming .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 17]: Get married in summer and have a rose wedding , and we 'll all be bridesmaids .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 24]: I pine to be a bridesmaid , with everything new from head to foot , and no nasty old clothes to wear out .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 9]: That 's the worst of being number five !
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 8]: I never have everything new at once .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 20]: There 's always a hat , or a jacket , or a blouse that has to be finished off .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 10]: Let 's sit down and talk about it now !
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 17]: There 's half an hour before lunch , and it 's impossible to do any work .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 17]: Maud , sit down and take off your hat , and let 's be comfy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 7]: `` No , she ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 4]: I want her !
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 23]: I do n't care who is going to be married ; I 'm ill , and I want Maud to nurse me .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 5]: My head is smashing .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 15]: I believe it 's sunstroke , for I sat out yesterday without a hat .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 15]: I shall go crazy in a moment if somebody does n't do something ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 17]: cried Nan loudly ; and her sisters stared in dismay at her flushed , heated face .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 107]: It was so evident that she was in pain that even Agatha submitted to a postponement of the longed-for `` talk , '' and the conclave broke up for the time being , the sisters separating , to go off in various directions : Lilias to be petted and cross-questioned by the two schoolgirls ; Elsie to indite a melancholy entry in her diary , beginning , `` Yet another example of the strange intermingling of joy and pain '' : and Maud to lead Nan to her own room , and devote herself to the work of nursing , at which she was so clever .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 73]: Perhaps Nan 's head was really aching , perhaps the morning 's excitement had brought on an attack of neuralgia , but whatever her ailment , she certainly made the worst of it , groaning and rolling her eyes to the ceiling as one in mortal agony ; for she was wise enough to realise that nothing would take Maud so much out of herself as the necessity of waiting upon another .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 35]: When Mrs Rendell entered the room , and recognised the odours of eau-de - Cologne , menthol , and sal volatile , her first thought was of poor brokenhearted Maud ; but , behold !
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 18]: it was Maud who was playing doctor , and buxom Nan who lay prone upon the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 21]: A few inquiries and expressions of sympathy were spoken , and then a gesture bade Maud follow into another room .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 30]: She went , shrinking from the ordeal , yet longing to have it over , and for a few minutes mother and daughter gazed at one another in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 25]: The girl 's face was grave and set , but self-composed in comparison with that of Mrs Rendell , which was quivering with distress .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 5]: `` My dear child !
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 7]: What can I say to you ?
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 12]: I can never forgive myself for my part in this disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 36]: I should not have spoken as I did the other day , but I thought at the time that it was the right thing to do , and I had no doubts on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 16]: What can I do to help you , dear , through this difficult time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 18]: `` Speak as little as possible about it , mother , please , '' said Maud softly .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 23]: She pressed her lips together , wincing with pain , and Mrs Rendell 's eyes flashed a look of approval in reply .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 25]: Of Spartan bravery herself , it delighted her to see her daughter bracing herself up to bear her trouble without useless outcry and repining .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 12]: `` I quite agree , darling , '' she said warmly .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 23]: `` After to-day we will never mention the subject ; but there are one or two things which must be said first .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 12]: To begin with , Ned has no suspicion of our mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 28]: I took care of that ; and it may help you to know that , after all , we were not so very far from the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 21]: He spoke quite openly , and it seems that for the first two or three years you were the attraction !
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 22]: He said he had been sincerely attached to you , but that he saw you regarded him simply as a friend .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 39]: Then Lilias came home , with her more demonstrative ways ; he turned to her for comfort , and now , '' -- She stopped with a little eloquent gesture , while Maud gave a groan of pain .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 28]: `` Oh , mother , that is hard -- to think that it came so near , and that I spoiled my life by my own mistake !
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 31]: I suppose my very anxiety not to show how much I cared made me seem stiff and constrained ; but I never meant him to take it in that way .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 14]: It makes it worse than ever , and yet I 'm glad too .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 13]: It 's a comfort to feel it was not all imagination . ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 16]: `` I thought you would feel it so ; that is why I told you .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 13]: But you must not talk of your life being spoiled , dear .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 21]: These are early days , and I hope there are many , many blessings which still remain open to you .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 16]: It is a great mistake to think that marriage is the only gate to happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 13]: A single woman may have a most full and useful life . ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 6]: `` Yes , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 4]: assented Maud dutifully .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 3]: Poor Maud !
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 67]: her heart died down within her as she spoke , and her thoughts flew away to old Mary Robins in her lodging , and Miss Evans in her stuffy little cottage , and she wondered if it were really , really possible that she -- Maud Rendell -- could ever grow like them , and feel satisfied with the duties and pleasures which constituted their lives !
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 6]: `` Full and useful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 24]: It sounded estimable enough ; but her young heart hungered for happiness also , and at the moment that seemed lost for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 20]: The downcast face was so pitiful that the tears came into Mrs Rendell 's eyes as she watched it .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 15]: `` Do n't think of the future , dear , '' she said fondly .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 26]: `` Take each day as it comes , and try to bear it bravely , and I 'll help you in every way I can .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 49]: Ned will come down pretty often , for I must consider Lilias as well as you , and we can not consent to have a formal engagement until they know each other more intimately than at present ; but it will not be so hard as you expect .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 58]: You must be at home sometimes , for the last thing we want to do is to arouse suspicion ; but I will arrange that you have as many changes as possible ; and in any way that I can help I am at your service , dear , if you will only let me know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 32]: `` Thank you , mother , '' said Maud again , and made a little involuntary movement towards the door , whereupon Mrs Rendell dismissed her , after a lingering embrace .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 30]: She saw that it was misery to the girl to discuss her disappointment , and realised that it would be the truest kindness to allow the subject to drop .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 38]: It was only natural that Maud should find it easier to talk to a friend of her own age , and Nan would be able to help more than any one else in these first painful days .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 41]: Later on her own turn would come ; and all day long the mother 's mind was busy weaving plans by which Maud could be shielded from suffering , and her life made bright and interesting during the months ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 36]: Lessons came off badly that afternoon , for the girls were too much absorbed in the excitement of the prospective wedding to be able to fix their attention on the problems of arithmetic and geography .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 61]: When the great problem of the hour was to decide the number of bridesmaids and what kind of frocks they should wear , how could they be expected to feel any interest in discovering how many yards of paper it would take to cover the walls of a problematical chamber , or in describing the eccentricities of the Gulf Stream ?
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 52]: Miss Roberts realised the impossibility of the situation , and shortened the hours in considerate fashion ; and no sooner had she taken her departure than the three girls rushed to the porch-room , surrounded Lilias in a whirlwind of excitement , and dragged her to a chair in their midst .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 7]: `` At last we can talk !
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 28]: Such a pity Nan is ill , and wo n't let Maud leave the room ; but we can have it all over again with them to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 2]: Talk !
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 10]: I feel as if I could talk for ever !
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 9]: Oh , Lilias , how do you feel ?
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 15]: If I were engaged , I do n't know what would happen to me !
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 11]: I should go stark , staring mad with excitement . ''
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 6]: `` How nice for him !
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 16]: You would have another person to consider then , remember , '' said Lilias prettily .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 19]: `` I am not at all inclined to go mad , though I am certainly very much excited .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 8]: It is difficult to describe my feelings .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 17]: I ca n't realise it yet , and feel all -- '' `` Jumbled up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 4]: suggested Agatha sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 6]: `` Of course you do .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 4]: I should myself .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 10]: Oh , Lil , do have them in yellow !
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 18]: I 've been thinking about it all the afternoon , and I think yellow would be sw-eet !
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 5]: With bouquets of daffodils !
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 21]: Very few people have yellow , and it would be so uncommon , and make us look much paler too .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 17]: I shall have a face like a beetroot with excitement ; I know I shall . ''
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 4]: `` I daresay !
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 13]: And how should I look , I 'd like to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 4]: queried Christabel loftily .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 7]: `` Sea green , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 17]: I 'm sallow enough as it is , but imagine my appearance in a yellow dress !
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 7]: I should present a shocking spectacle !
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 19]: Nothing is so nice as pink : it suits every one , and is so bright and pretty .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 9]: Pink silk dresses , with Leghorn hats . ''
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 6]: Elsie grimaced in disapproving fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 4]: `` So commonplace !
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 5]: Every one has pink .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 9]: We must have something altogether unique and striking .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 19]: No use deciding now , for we will change our minds a dozen times before the time arrives .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 9]: When are you to be married , Lilias ?
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 6]: What is the date ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 9]: `` My dear , I 've no notion !
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 17]: I am not even properly engaged yet , so how could we begin talking about marriage ?
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 26]: I believe we are to be put on probation for some months , so it will certainly not be this year at any rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 5]: `` What a bore !
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 12]: I 'm longing to stay with you in your own house .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 18]: It 's my idea of happiness to go and stay with you girls when you are married .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 12]: You will ask us all in turns , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 27]: I 'd like to come with Chrissie ; and then , if you and Ned get too affectionate , we can amuse ourselves in another room .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 12]: It will be lovely having no grown-up person in the house .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 29]: Oh , well , of course , you are grown-up , if it comes to that , but only young grown-up , and that makes all the difference .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 45]: You wo n't make us do things because they are ` good for us ' -- send us a walk when we do n't feel inclined , for instance , or to bed early , or make us eat ` good plain food . '
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 50]: When I come to stay with you , I should like never to go out unless I have something special to do , and to have tea for lunch , and nice rich cake , and laze about from morning till night , just as I felt disposed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 31]: `` And you 'll ask people to meet us , wo n't you , Lil , and take us about , and give us all your old gloves and ribbons ?
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 30]: Marie Elder 's sister is engaged , and he wo n't let her wear any gloves that are the l-east little bit soiled ; so Marie gets them all .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 12]: I hope Ned will be fussy about your things , too .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 7]: What shall you call your house ?
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 8]: I hope it 's a nice one .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 27]: Florrie Elder is going to have a blue drawing-room , and Marie is working her a cushion of the most ex-quisite ribbon-work you ever did see .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 18]: Florrie says she would quarrel with her nearest and dearest if he dared to lean against it .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 18]: If you like , I 'll ask her for the pattern , and do one for you .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 17]: It would n't matter having them the same , when you live so far apart . ''
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 6]: `` What will Jim say ?
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 21]: Ned and he vowed that they would be bachelors all their lives , and live together when they were old .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 12]: Now he will be obliged to marry himself , in revenge .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 7]: How I shall detest the girl !
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 26]: She wo n't be half nice enough for him , and he will like her better than us , and that will be horribly exasperating .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 17]: I do n't envy her when he brings her to see us , that 's all !
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 24]: Six sisters all glaring at her in a row , and saying to themselves , ` I do n't like her nose ! '
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 9]: ` I do n't like her eyes ! '
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 6]: ` What a hat ! '
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 11]: ` However could he fall in love with her ! '
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 13]: And mother all icy kind , and father smirking behind his moustache .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 30]: That 's what will happen to you one of these days , Lilias , when you go north , ` on view , ' to Ned 's people . ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 14]: Lilias rolled her eyes , and affected to tear her hair in despair .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 6]: `` Oh , do n't !
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 7]: I pray you , do n't !
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 6]: I shall die with nervousness .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 4]: Poor little me !
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 22]: His parents are reserved and undemonstrative , like most North-country people , he says , but are very tender-hearted at bottom .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 32]: That means , I suppose , that they would be stiff and polite all the time I was there , and begin slowly to unbend just as I was coming away .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 24]: Frederica , the girl , goes in for higher education , and does n't care a bit about going about with other girls .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 9]: I know they will be disappointed with me .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 14]: Ned is so silly , and he is sure to tell them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 25]: -- She stopped , sweetly simpering , and the hearers had little difficulty in guessing what it was that Ned would tell his people .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 40]: He would say that his _ fiancee _ was the loveliest girl in the world ; that she had hair like spun gold , a complexion of milk and roses , and eyes soft and dewy as a violet .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 20]: Then Lilias would arrive in person , and his people would think that he had not said half enough .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 58]: Each of the three hearers had a vision of Lilias advancing to meet the new relatives with lifted eyes , and a smile that would melt a heart of stone ; each one saw in imagination the sudden thaw on the watching faces , and beheld Lilias installed forthwith as the pride and darling of the household .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 46]: They smiled at one another in furtive amusement , but discreetly avoided putting their thoughts into words , for Lilias fished so transparently for compliments , that it had become an unspoken law never on any condition to encourage her by giving the desired assurance .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 20]: Agatha turned aside to hide her amusement , and , the next moment , gave a jump of astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 4]: `` Keep still !
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 4]: Do n't move !
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 11]: For your lives do n't look out of the window !
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 10]: Sit where you are , and go on talking .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 8]: My dears , he is watching us !
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 3]: The Vanburgh !
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 10]: I distinctly saw him lean forward and stare across .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 17]: He is in the room directly opposite , and he dodged back the moment I looked .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 14]: Fancy his being as much interested in us as we are in him !
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 4]: How exciting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 24]: `` We must look very ridiculous , sitting here in a row , chattering and waving our hands as if we were mad .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 15]: I do n't wonder he stared , but I do want to stare back .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 54]: Let us take it in turns to peep beneath our eyelashes , while the others go on talking , '' suggested Elsie ; and the proposal was carried out forthwith , each girl watching till the coveted glimpse had been obtained , and informing her companions of her success by groans and exclamations .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 8]: `` I see him , I do !
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 5]: He is staring across .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 5]: He looks very ill .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 6]: His hair is quite white .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 11]: Poor old man , how dull he must be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 32]: When it came to Chrissie 's turn she stared across with undisguised curiosity , and refused to accept her sisters ' reproaches when the white head was hurriedly withdrawn from view .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 6]: `` I was the last !
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 20]: You had all had your turns , so I have not deprived you of anything , '' she maintained .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 15]: `` I only meant to smile at him in a kind , neighbourly fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 14]: He will look out again in a few minutes , never fear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 37]: But Mr Vanburgh 's face appeared no more at the window , and it seemed as if the knowledge that he had been observed had been so unwelcome as to put an end to his scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 39]: The girls could only comfort themselves with the remembrance that their mother had promised to call at the Grange during the next few weeks , when , no doubt , first-hand information would be forthcoming about its occupant .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 4]: NOT AT HOME !
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 81]: After due consultation , Mr and Mrs Rendell decided to sanction a private engagement between Lilias and Ned Talbot for a year to come , with the understanding that if the young people remained of the same mind , no objection would then be put in the way of their speedy marriage ; and as they would be allowed to correspond , and to meet as often as opportunity offered , the decision was received with satisfaction by the lovers .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 72]: Lilias complacently settled to be married in fifteen months ' time , and was resigned to a probation sweetened by the receipt of constant letters , presents , and adulation ; while Ned , with characteristic honesty , confessed in his own heart that he had no very deep acquaintance with his beloved 's character , and that he could not be better employed than in the study of the same .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 38]: Lilias 's exquisite girlish beauty had so dazzled his senses , that he had been shy and ill at ease in her presence , and their conversations together had been of the lightest , most impersonal nature .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 58]: It would be an entrancing occupation to discover all the hidden charms possessed by this sweetest of created beings ; for , like most young men , Ned was convinced that a lovely body must needs be an index to a lovely mind , and that beauty of face was but a reflection from the soul within .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 28]: Every month that passed would draw Lilias and himself more closely together , as each came to know and understand the depths of the other 's nature .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 29]: So Ned told himself happily , as he came down to Thurston House for his first visit in the new character , a week after the all-important interview .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 22]: Lilias met him at the door , and led him into the drawing-room , all fragrant with spring flowers and plants .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 43]: She looked like a flower herself , with her soft pink and white colouring , and to the last day of his life Ned Talbot could never inhale the fragrance of a narcissus or a hyacinth without a spasm of painful remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 12]: It brought back so vividly the intoxicating joy of that meeting .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 84]: They talked together in lover-like fashion , Lilias alternately shy and reticent , and queening it over him with absurd little airs of authority , at which he laughed with a lover 's delight , until presently a tap came to the door , and Agatha 's face peeped round the corner to announce that tea had been taken out to the garden , and to ask if the lovers would rather come out , or , have it sent to them indoors .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 9]: `` Here , please , '' said Lilias .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 28]: `` Oh , we 'll come out certainly , '' cried Ned in the same moment , and then turned to her with a smile of apology .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 9]: `` If you do n't mind , dear !
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 6]: I want to see Maud .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 35]: She was out when I left the other day , you remember , and I ca n't feel that I am really received into the family until Maud has given me her blessing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 9]: `` Just as you wish , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 16]: It does seem a pity to stay indoors when the weather is so glorious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 4]: assented Lilias readily .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 31]: Though inwardly annoyed that she should have appeared more anxious than Ned for an extension of their _ tete-a-tete _ , she was far too proud to show her vexation .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 49]: Nothing could have appeared more ready or more natural than the manner in which she rose from her seat and slipped her hand through Agatha 's arm ; but even while she smiled and chatted she was registering a vow to punish Mr Ned on the first opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 30]: Out in the garden Maud sat , busying herself with the teacups and nerving herself to face the dreaded moment , as footsteps approached nearer and nearer her seat .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 4]: `` Maud ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 19]: cried Ned , and gripped her hand with affectionate fervour , `` I was longing to see you .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 15]: It seemed too bad going away without a word from you the other day .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 11]: We have so much to say to one another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 14]: `` Yes , indeed ; but meantime I must pour out the tea !
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 14]: Are you going to make yourself useful and hand round the cups ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 17]: replied a laughing , self - possessed voice , which Maud hardly recognised as her own .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 50]: It was easier to play a part than she had expected : the looking forward had been worse than the reality ; and , as she met her mother 's smile and Nan 's approving glance , she even began to feel a dreary pride in her own composure .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 38]: Lilias had seated herself between two of her sisters , an intentional revenge for the slight which she considered herself to have received , and Ned was therefore left free to devote himself to his old friend .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 30]: `` Of course you saw -- you knew what was coming , '' he whispered confidentially , when the general conversation made it possible to exchange a quiet remark .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 26]: `` I realised that I gave myself away by my awkwardness and stupidity whenever she was present , but I was powerless to prevent it .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 21]: And you were so good to me , Maud , always doing your best to help and make things easy .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 10]: I can never be grateful enough for your friendship .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 13]: I am so thankful to feel that you are at home still .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 31]: It seems an assurance of safety ; for you 'll look after her , and see that she gets into no danger through all this long year of waiting . ''
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 14]: He looked at her appealingly , and she gave a forced little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 13]: `` Oh yes , I 'll ward off the beasts of prey .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 14]: There are so many , you know , roving about this sleepy place .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 8]: She will meet so many dangers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 7]: `` Do n't laugh at me !
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 7]: I ca n't help being anxious .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 13]: She is so young and child-like , and there are dangers everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 6]: Illness , accident , infection .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 17]: I shall think of them when I am far away , and worry myself to death .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 24]: But you are a bulwark of strength , Maud , and if you will take her in charge -- '' Maud laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 18]: It seemed so ridiculous to think of any of her sisters promising to take Lilias in charge !
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 17]: Lilias , the most cool - headed , independent , and self-confident member of the family .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 44]: She was infinitely more capable of taking care of the whole family than the family was of influencing her movements ; but Ned could not be expected to realise as much , and he was obviously wounded by the absence of expected sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 51]: An exclamation from Christabel , calling attention to Kitty Maitland 's figure crossing the lawn , came as a welcome interruption , and Ned took the opportunity to cross to a seat on the other side of the group , while Maud watched his departure with mingled relief and concern .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 15]: `` He thinks I am hard and prosaic , and is disappointed in me .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 5]: Well , better so !
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 23]: He wo n't confide his rhapsodies in my ear any more , and that would be really more than I could bear .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 15]: The old days are over , and he must look elsewhere for sympathy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 18]: Meantime Kitty had seated herself on the grass , and was proceeding to account for her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 15]: `` Please I hope you do n't object to my coming back so soon !
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 31]: Mummy has gone with father to call on Mr Vanburgh , and I walked with them to the Grange , and came in here to wait until she comes out .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 14]: She put on all her new things , and looks a perfect duck .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 24]: I expect he will like her awfully , and I told her to introduce my name into the conversation as often as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 41]: ` My daughter likes this ' ; ` My daughter likes that ' ; ` As my little girl says to me ' ; -- that sort of thing , do n't you know , just to attract his attention .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 24]: Perhaps he will tell her to bring me with her next time she calls , or even ask me to tea by myself .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 26]: He may have nieces or grandchildren who will come to stay , and then it would be useful to know a girl in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 14]: I think he is certain to ask me -- '' `` Mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 27]: interrupted Chrissie shrilly ; and her voice was so sharp with distress that every one stopped talking , to listen to what she had to say .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 14]: `` Mother , Mrs Maitland has gone to see Mr Vanburgh before you !
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 6]: I asked you to go !
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 26]: I had set my heart on your being the first caller ; and now it 's too late , and you can only be second .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 5]: I told you so !
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 10]: I _ said _ how it would be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 18]: Mrs Rendell lifted her brows with the little surprised air of reproof which Chrissie knew so well .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 57]: `` I regret to have disappointed you , my dear , '' she replied , with elaborate politeness ; `` but I fear I should hardly have been the first caller , even if I had gone the day after my return , and I have been too much occupied this week to pay outside visits .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 33]: I am sure you will be delighted to hear Mrs Maitland 's report , and will not grudge Kitty the pleasure , if she makes Mr Vanburgh 's acquaintance before yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 51]: Chrissie collapsed into silence ; but , veiled by her thickly-flowing hair , she grimaced to herself and scowled at her friend , who was regarding her with that air of enjoyment which it is impossible not to feel when a companion receives a nice little snub for her pains !
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 42]: Agatha and Elsie had already begun to invent forecasts of the news which Mrs Maitland would have to tell , when , to the amazement of all , who should appear round the corner of the house but that lady herself !
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 34]: She carried her card-case in her hand , and waved her hand in greeting ; but , for once in their lives , the girls were too much overcome with surprise to respond .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 20]: Back already , when she had barely had time to go up to the door and retrace her steps !
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 5]: What did it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 4]: Not at home ?
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 8]: But Mr Vanburgh was always at home .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 28]: According to report , his farthest expedition was into the garden , where surely he would be able to receive a visitor on a bright spring afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 40]: Surprise held them dumb , until Mrs Maitland had reached speaking distance , when , with one accord , they deafened her with inquiries , to which she did her best to reply after the first greetings were over .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 9]: `` How do you do , Mrs Rendell ?
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 6]: Good afternoon , Mr Talbot .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 28]: I am one of the privileged _ few _ who have been told your secret , and I wish you every happiness , and dear Lilias also .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 20]: I tell every engaged couple I meet that I hope they may only be as happy as I am .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 18]: My dear children , do n't pull me to pieces ; this is my very best dress !
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 11]: I 'll tell you all about it in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 22]: I am so glad to have this opportunity of seeing you all together , for I was longing to come over .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 5]: May I sit here ?
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 45]: Well , then , to begin at the beginning ... '' She put her card-case on her lap , and clasped her hands together in preparation , and the girls watched her with approving eyes , for Mrs Maitland was a most satisfactory story-teller .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 50]: She began at the beginning -- the very smallest possible beginning -- instead of halfway through the narrative , as other grown-up people had a habit of doing , and went straight through to the end , noticing every detail , and describing it in racy , picturesque language .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 14]: `` Well , we went up to the door and rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 41]: It is not an ordinary everyday bell , but a quaint , wrought-iron handle , hanging on a chain from a sort of signpost arrangement , and I could hear it pealing away in most melodious fashion inside the house .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 24]: The curtain inside the glass panels of the door was caught slightly back , and I could get a peep into the vestibule .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 35]: The oak has been left untouched , and there are palms on either side sunk into great pots of copper with snakes and dragons and all kinds of uncanny animals standing out in relief .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 34]: I was still peering through when the inner door was thrown open , and the butler appeared , upon which I straightened myself at once , and tried to look stately and dignified .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 89]: I had just one minute to take in the inner hall , so can not tell you much about it , except that it is a perfect museum of wonderful and beautiful things -- pieces of tapestry hung on the walls , carved oak cabinets full of curios , a figure of a knight in armour , and curious Eastern-looking lamps burning dimly in the distance ; but the butler looked so very solemn and imposing that I dared not stare as much as I should have liked .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 8]: ` Is Mr Vanburgh at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 13]: I asked ; and he inclined his head in a gracious bow .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 15]: ` He is at home , madam , but is not receiving visitors . '
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 18]: I drew out my cards , and said , ` I am sorry to miss seeing him .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 12]: I hope he is not more unwell than usual to-day ? '
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 46]: He bowed again , like a mechanical figure , and said , ` Mr Vanburgh charges me to say , madam , that as he is unable to return visits , he must deprive himself of the pleasure of receiving them while in Waybourne . '
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 9]: I never felt so small in my life .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 12]: Dismissed on the doorstep , and sent away like a child !
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 13]: I do n't know how I looked , or what I said .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 34]: My one idea was to get out of the man 's sight as quickly as possible ; and the door had no sooner closed on him than I began dreading Kit 's disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 7]: It was a most trying experience !
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 19]: Father has gone for a walk , and I came in to break the news to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 17]: She looked appealingly at Kitty as she finished , and met a glance of blackest gloom .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 6]: This was indeed a blow .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 23]: Not only were there no Miss Vanburghs , but the only Vanburgh who was left refused to open his door to visitors !
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 4]: `` Piteous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 12]: cried Chrissie ; and Agatha struck her hands together in despair .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 24]: `` There ought to be a law about it -- a law to prevent hermits from buying the best houses in a neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 12]: Does he mean to say that he will see nobody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 13]: `` Perhaps he did n't know who you were , Mrs Maitland .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 20]: He takes an interest in us , we know , for we have _ seen _ him staring across .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 16]: Perhaps if he had known you belonged to Kitty , it might have been different .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 13]: Mother , you will go all the same , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 9]: You wo n't give up without trying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 6]: Mrs Rendell shrugged her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 29]: `` I am not particularly anxious to be turned away from the door , and I see no reason why I should be treated better than Mrs Maitland .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 10]: The servant is evidently entrusted with a general message .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 25]: I think the best thing will be to send father across on Saturday afternoon , to see if the rule applies to ladies only .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 17]: If Mr Vanburgh really wants to be quiet , we ca n't force ourselves upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 22]: I am sorry the Grange is not let to more interesting people , but we must make the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 43]: It has evidently been chosen as a museum in which to store a collection of art treasures , and , after all , you must remember it is no more closed to us now than it has been for years past . ''
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 6]: `` Dear me , no !
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 10]: We can live without the Grange , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 12]: Let the poor old dear shut himself up if he likes .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 10]: He will be the loser , not we ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 6]: cried Mrs Maitland , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 8]: That was the worst of grown-up people !
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 8]: They were so aggravatingly reasonable and resigned !
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 5]: DIOGENES AT THE WINDOW .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 7]: After a storm comes a calm .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 33]: As in Nature , so in the affairs of human life , and the Rendells found another example of the truth of the old adage in the month following Lilias 's engagement .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 43]: Nothing seemed to happen ; even the interest which had been taken in the new occupant of the Grange died away after Mr Rendell 's failure to gain admission , and one day jog -- trotted away after another in monotonous fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 33]: They were dreary days to Maud , but at the end of even the longest and dreariest she acknowledged to herself that the battle was not so hopeless as she had expected .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 38]: The trouble was there , the difficult moments arose , the quick stabs of pain following happy memories , but she herself was strengthened to bear them in a manner which she could not have believed possible .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 48]: Maud was one of the sweet , open characters who are religious by nature ; but though she had asked for God 's help every night of her life , she had never been conscious of its presence in such abundance as in this hour of trial .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 31]: It almost awed her at times to realise her own strength , and this testing of the power of faith was a ray of light shining out of the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 41]: Passages from the Bible which she had known all her life became suddenly instinct with new and wonderful meaning ; the words of Christ went straight home to her sore heart and comforted it as no earthly power could do .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 32]: The new communion had a joy and a sweetness which she had never known before , and her character grew daily stronger and deeper under the influence of sorrow nobly borne .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 29]: Her mother 's tenderness , moreover , manifested itself in a hundred little schemes for her distraction , and Nan 's demonstrative affection heartened her for the fight .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 41]: The world was not all lost because Ned had chosen another ; and , so far from neglecting her old duties , Maud worked away more industriously than ever , finding her best medicine in a busy , occupied life .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 36]: Ned Talbot had gone back to the North , whence he could not return for two months to come , and Lilias settled down contentedly to play the interesting part of the _ fiancee _ .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 46]: She did not fret for her lover , but seemed abundantly content to receive his letters , and pen lengthy answers ; and though the date of her marriage was so far ahead , she began at once to make preparations for her future home .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 32]: One rainy afternoon she shut herself in her bedroom , and rearranged all her belongings , leaving the lowest drawer in the wardrobe empty , and covered with fresh white paper .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 34]: Then she wrote something at her desk , lingered outside the door for a minute , and finally rejoined her sisters , with a mischievous smile curving the corners of her pretty lips .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 54]: Presently Chrissie ran upstairs on some trifling errand , and came to a stand-still on the landing , uttering sharp cries of surprise ; then Agatha followed to discover the cause of the excitement , and guffawed with laughter , when Nan and Elsie jumped from their chairs and ran helter-skelter in pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 41]: They found the two younger girls leaning up against the wall , staring at the door of Lilias 's room , on the centre of which was tacked a square of paper , neatly lined and lettered : -- NOTICE !
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 7]: TO ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 45]: Miss Lilias Rendell desires to inform her friends and the public generally that she has just opened a Bottom Drawer , and that every description of household goods , useful and ornamental , will be gratefully accepted towards the furnishing of her future home .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 10]: _ NB _ -- Carved oak articles especially welcome !
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 8]: `` That 's one for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 5]: cried Nan , grimacing .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 17]: `` What is your especial fancy , my love -- a side-board or a dining-room table ?
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 7]: Do n't be bashful , pray !
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 14]: Aim at the sky , and you may succeed in hitting the tree .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 18]: I should n't wonder if I rose to a milking-stool , if you asked me nicely . ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 50]: `` And I 'll work you a kettle-holder , sweet one , as soon as the sale is over , and Chrissie a -- '' `` Twine bag , '' said Chrissie , simpering ; `` but until July you might as well give up the idea , Lilias .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 24]: Every moment we have , we must use for sale - work , and every penny we can save in to the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 10]: We ca n't attend to you just yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 24]: `` I thought perhaps you might start me with a few contributions from the things you have made , '' said modest Lilias .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 18]: `` The drawer looks lonesome with nothing in it , and I 've made it so tidy !
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 19]: It would be a comfortable home for that little blue cushion , and the mats with the roses .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 8]: And you would never miss them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 6]: `` Would n't we just ?
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 7]: The very best things we have !
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 12]: It is a pity your modesty does n't equal your taste .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 60]: I should miss the smallest thing we have made ; and whenever I get low-spirited , I turn them all out of the box and gloat over the collection -- eleven pin-cushions , three sets of mats , a table centre , three work-bags , two handkerchief sachets , six babies ' shoes , and a nice wool shawl !
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 24]: It 's not bad for a start , and there are lots of things on hand , besides Nan 's carving and brass-work .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 40]: It would be like tearing my heart out of my body to give anything away , and I do n't think it would be at all a nice idea to start your collection by stealing from the poor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 26]: Lilias looked appalled at the suggestion , but all the same she was not too much shocked to seize on the chance of future spoils .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 7]: `` Agatha , how can you ?
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 15]: I am the last person in the world to think of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 33]: I suggested the sale , remember ; you would not have had it at all but for me ; but how could a little thing like a pin-cushion be called a theft ?
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 20]: However , it 's all right ; do n't give them me at present if you would rather not .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 29]: After the sale there are sure to be some things left , and then -- You would not mind giving them to me then , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 85]: At least I am quite willing if the others are , '' said Agatha , looking round inquiringly ; upon which Nan and Elsie nodded assent , and Chrissie bargained , `` Unless I am engaged myself by that time , when , of course , they must be equally divided , '' -- a contingency so remote that Lilias congratulated herself on a good morning 's work , and felt that so far as pin-cushions were concerned the future held no further anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 69]: Work for the sale had , indeed , been carried forward with great zest ; and now that the days were lengthening , there was a good two hours after tea , when Kitty could join the party in the porch-room , and stitch away at some dainty task while carrying on that breathless stream of conversation which never seemed to run short , despite the daily meetings .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 93]: Nan brought down her carving , and worked at a little table of her own ; Elsie cut and planned with delicate , accurate fingers ; and the three younger girls sewed away in characteristic fashion : Agatha bending double over the seam ; Christabel , erect and stately , drawing her thread to its full length with leisurely , dignified movements ; and Kitty , with her spectacles on the tip of her nose , peering over them from time to time in grandmotherly concern at the frivolity of her companions .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 64]: Nothing more had been discovered about `` Diogenes , '' as Mr Vanburgh had been nicknamed since his refusal to receive visitors ; but on fine days his couch was wheeled close to the window , and as he lay looking out , it was inevitable that the movements of the girls in the sunny porch-room immediately opposite should attract his wandering attention .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 49]: When they glanced across in their turn , he politely turned aside , and appeared engrossed in his book ; but no sooner were they at work again than the tired eyes would be lifted once more , to dwell with wistful interest on the bright young faces .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 21]: One afternoon in especial , as Nan sat bending over her carving , the conviction strengthened that she was observed .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 29]: She peered under her eyelashes , smiled mischievously to herself , and suddenly leapt from her seat in a manner most startling to the nerves of her sisters .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 57]: She hopped on one foot and waved her arms in the air ; she swooped down on Chrissie 's work and threw it wildly to the ceiling ; she thrust her face into Elsie 's and went off into a peal of maniacal laughter , which sent that nervous young person flying to the farthest corner .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 37]: She seized a bundle of ribbons and danced an impromptu skirt dance , flourishing them to and fro , while he onlookers scuttled together like rabbits , and felt that their lives trembled in the balance .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 52]: Finally , after succeeding in turning the room topsy-turvy , and raising the most powerful doubts as to her own sanity , Miss Nan tottered out on to the landing and collapsed in a breathless heap on the lowest stair , while her sisters looked on askance from a discreet distance .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 6]: `` H-have some sal volatile !
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 8]: I 'll get it from my room .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 12]: Never mind , dear , you 'll be better soon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 22]: stuttered Elsie fearfully ; but at that the crazy creature laughed afresh , though in a more restrained and natural fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 9]: `` Oh no ; I am not mad !
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 15]: I did it for a purpose , my dear , as you shall hear .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 37]: That poor old Diogenes was lying on his couch , looking across with such a dull , pathetic face , and I felt so sorry that the poor dear had nothing more exciting to amuse him .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 40]: He must be precious dull when he takes so much interest in girls like us , and I felt grieved to think how little fun we had given him , sitting sewing day after day like so many machines .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 39]: I says to myself , says I , ` It is in your power , Margaret Rendell , to infuse some brightness into the lot of this poor lonely sufferer , and you are going to do it !
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 15]: He shall have some excitement before the day is over , bless him ! '
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 26]: Therefore , as you perceived , I executed a new and original war-dance for his benefit , and sent you all attitudinising about the room .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 49]: That 's the reason of this thusness , and Diogenes is now , no doubt , full of agitation , believing that one so young and fair has suddenly lost her wits , and imagining you all occupied in binding me to the bedpost till help arrives ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 16]: `` I do n't know how he feels , but I feel extremely ill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 10]: grumbled Elsie , her sympathy suddenly changed to resentment .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 13]: `` Sticking your face into mine and laughing in that crazy fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 5]: Never do it again !
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 15]: My heart is right up in my throat , and thumping like a steam-engine .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 7]: I ca n't work any more .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 12]: I am going to recover my equanimity in the garden ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 3]: Poor Diogenes !
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 43]: It was baffling to curiosity that all the actors should have disappeared at the most exciting moment of the play ; and the actors themselves were fully aware of the fact , and with child-like enjoyment determined to lengthen out the mystery .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 51]: The porch-room was abandoned for the afternoon , and such sequestered nooks in the garden as were invisible from the Grange were chosen as resting-places , while Kitty willingly consented to walk an extra half-mile on her way home , so as to avoid going out by the front gate .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 46]: Such a reversal of the usual comings and goings would , it was hoped , give the final touch to Mr Vanburgh 's curiosity , and teach him a wholesome lesson on the folly of shutting himself up and holding no communication with the world .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 46]: When Agatha suggested that the poor old dear might lie awake all night from agitation , Nan cold-bloodedly hoped that he would , since he , on his part , had been so cruel as to shut the doors of the Grange against his neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 23]: She would have been much surprised if she had known how , and for whom , those doors would first be opened !
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 5]: A VISIT OF CEREMONY .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 17]: At the beginning of May the first returning ray of brightness came into Maud 's life .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 37]: A letter arrived from a friend of the family who had been living abroad for her daughter 's education , and had now reached Paris , preparatory to returning to England in a month 's time .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 38]: It had been all work and no play for the girl during the winter , her mother wrote , and it had been long promised that the month in Paris should be entirely given over to pleasure-seeking .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 26]: Mabel had drawn out a programme so lengthy and varied , that Mrs Nevins doubted whether she herself would have strength to go through it .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 45]: One thing at least was certain , that the girl 's enjoyment would be doubled by the presence of a companion of her own age , who would be able to share her ecstasies , as a tired-out , middle-aged woman could never do .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 6]: Therefore , might Maud come ?
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 18]: Could Maud be spared for a month to give Mabel the very great pleasure of her society ?
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 16]: She should have every care , and be brought back to London early in June .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 42]: Mrs Rendell carried the letter up to Maud as she practised in her room , and handed it to her with a smile ; and Maud flushed and paled , and laid her hand affectionately on her little mother 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 3]: `` Mummy !
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 12]: how much from you , and how much from Mrs Nevins ?
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 15]: You have had something to do with this , I 'm sure you have .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 11]: The suggestion came from you in the first instance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 4]: What a child !
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 7]: Such notions as she takes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 5]: cried Mrs Rendell laughingly .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 26]: `` How it comes about is little matter ; you do n't need to be told how truly delighted Mabel will be to have you .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 9]: You can believe in that , at least .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 3]: And Paris !
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 12]: You have always wanted to go to Paris , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 8]: `` Yes , mother , I have .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 6]: Oh yes , always ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 17]: Maud smiled bravely , trying hard to appear as pleased and elated as her mother expected .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 29]: It was not the first , nor the second , nor the twentieth time that she had discovered schemes for her own benefit during the last few weeks .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 29]: School friends had been invited on visits ; books for which she had wished had opportunely arrived from town ; concert tickets had been purchased with unprecedented frequency .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 52]: Maud fully appreciated the kindly purpose of these attentions , and , to a certain extent , enjoyed the amusements provided ; but she was conscious of a dreary regret that these long-wished-for pleasures should arrive at a time when it was impossible to throw herself into them with whole-hearted enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 49]: The regret was particularly keen at this moment , for to her , as to so many girls , the first trip abroad had been the dream of a lifetime , and a pang came with the realisation of how different from her expectations the realisation must be .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 31]: The ache at her heart would cloud the brightness of the beautiful city , -- she would look at everything , as it were , through a veil of crape .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 34]: The tears rose to her eyes despite all her efforts , and she turned hastily aside , fearing that her mother might think her ungrateful for receiving the news in such churlish fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 38]: Mrs Rendell , however , affected to notice nothing unusual , and talked away in cheery accents , discussing various practical matters concerning the proposed visit , in which it was impossible not to feel an interest .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 23]: Maud 's tears dried gradually ; she found herself suggesting amendments to the plans , and growing momentarily more interested and eager .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 28]: She was to be entrusted with a sum of money with which to buy presents for her sisters , besides a well-filled purse for her own use .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 31]: She and Mabel could choose their summer clothes together , amid the bewildering fascinations of Parisian fashions ; and there was absolutely no limit in the amount of sight-seeing permissible .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 29]: She could run the whole gamut , from the Louvre to the Catacombs , and get to know her Paris almost as well as she knew her London .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 32]: What girl of twenty-three would not feel her woes assuaged by such a programme , especially in the company of a bosom friend to whom she had been devoted from childhood ?
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 58]: Mr and Mrs Rendell rejoiced to see Maud 's brightening face , and to hear her voice raised to its old happy ring , as she busied herself with preparations for her journey ; and Nan rejoiced as much as they , and racked her brains to discover how she could best assist in the same preparations .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 9]: `` Let me do some sewing for you !
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 6]: Do let me help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 55]: she pleaded , and proceeded to stitch up the seams entrusted to her with such unprecedented care and neatness , that Maud hid the garments at the bottom of her box , not having the heart to disclose that the seams were on the wrong side , and must needs be as laboriously unpicked !
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 46]: She upset a box of tooth-powder over a blue serge skirt ; squeezed a bundle of boots on the top of a chiffon bodice , and went beaming downstairs , feeling that at last she had learned to be domesticated and to render efficient service !
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 26]: Maud departed smiling and cheery , and all the members of the family drew a breath of relief as she drove off from the door .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 38]: The secret consciousness of her suffering had been a cloud over their spirits for the past month , and now , as was only natural , a reaction set in , when restrained spirits found their vent .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 37]: Mr and Mrs Rendell went up to town for a couple of nights to attend a dinner-party and reception , and the girls discussed how they could best organise a little festivity on their own account .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 51]: It was decided to hold the first picnic of the season , bicycling to a favourite spot in the woods , where primroses and bluebells were luxuriant , and to invite Mrs Maitland and Miss Phelps to drive up in a pony cart stored with provisions for an out-of-door tea .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 51]: Everything was arranged -- cakes were baked , sandwiches cut , cream and milk corked up in bottles , and a basket packed with every requisite -- when , `` of course , '' as Elsie had it , the rain descended in sheets , and the project was frustrated .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 19]: The usual scene of grumbling and ejaculating followed , before the girls could resign themselves to their fate .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 47]: To settle down to practise and study seemed unbearably dreary after looking forward to such a charming excursion ; but there was nothing else to be done , so they marched sulkily to their different occupations , and did not meet again until after four o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 31]: Then the schoolroom party joined Lilias in the library , and were about to summon Nan from the attic , when Mary entered , bringing a card on a salver .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 24]: Some one had been brave enough to face the elements , and pay a call in the midst of a downpour of rain .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 5]: Whom could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 16]: Lilias examined the card with curious eyes , and turned in surprise towards her sisters .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 4]: `` Miss Thacker !
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 7]: Do n't know her from Adam .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 9]: Who in the world is Miss Thacker ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 16]: `` Oh -- er -- er -- Wait a moment and I 'll remember ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 9]: cried Agatha , ruffling her hair in reflection .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 14]: `` I 've heard the name , I 'm sure -- I know !
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 11]: She 's the creature who 's come to Willow Cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 27]: She called once before , and mother said she could not for the life of her decide whether she was quite mad , or only three-quarters .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 6]: What can she want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 10]: `` Have to go and see , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 34]: Or stay , I 'll bring her in here , to have some tea , and then you can help me to entertain her ; but whatever you do , do n't laugh !
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 13]: It 's awfully bad form to make fun of a visitor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 25]: And Lilias left the room , to return followed by a tall female figure , which certainly approached perilously near the grotesque in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 47]: An old-fashioned poke bonnet and a gauze veil shaded a solemn white face , braids of red hair fell over the cheeks , horn-rimmed spectacles covered the eyes , while the absence of two front teeth gave a singularly blank and unpleasant expression to the mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 21]: A merino shawl was folded across the shoulders , and a venerable silk skirt dripped with rain upon the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 78]: An extraordinary-looking figure indeed ; and it would appear that eccentricity was not confined to appearance only , for the stranger returned the girls ' salutations with wriggles of the body , and began at once to talk in a soft guttural voice , running her words together without any stops , and at such express train speed that every now and then she was obliged to stop short , and give a deep gasp of exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 17]: `` S-S-Sorry your mother is from mome me dears quite counted on finding her rat ome .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 24]: Said to myself at lunch must go and see Mrs Rendell s ` afternoon such a kind woman full of sympathy for rothers !
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 25]: Hurried out and thought as had come so far might come in and see Miss Rendell as servant said at tome and disengaged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 25]: The big mouth opened in a gasp for breath , which was heard throughout the room , and Lilias stammered out a dismayed assent .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 6]: `` Certainly -- of course .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 5]: So glad you did .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 19]: If I can do anything I shall be most pleased -- '' `` Of course , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 5]: Your mother 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 6]: Knew it by your face .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 23]: Not tany tea , thank you , bad for digestion enjoyed bad health for many years and can only stay a minute .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 10]: Called at four rouses already to-day with no result .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 25]: Breaks your rart to see the callous sardness of the human race , every luxury and ease themselves and cold as sice to others .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 14]: Would n't believe it unless you were present to see rebuffs si get .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 44]: Ladies not a mile from this souse -- could mention names but wo n't -- pay pounds and pounds for gloves and dats and not talf-a-crown to spare for crying need , but said to myself all day , Mrs Rendell will help !
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 8]: I 'll get ta welcome there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 31]: `` Oh yes , I 'm sure mother would be pleased , '' stammered Lilias , more and more puzzled to understand the drift of the strange woman 's remarks .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 20]: From the farther end of the room a little squeaky sound was heard , elaborately turned into a cough .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 29]: Lilias grew hot with embarrassment , and Miss Thacker peered suspiciously over her spectacles as she produced a circular from her satchel and handed it over for inspection .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 26]: It bore the heading `` Waybourne Home for Incurables , '' and set forth a plea for help with which the girl was already familiar .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 23]: She read it over , however , once and yet again , puzzling her head meantime as to what to do next .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 52]: To refuse to give a donation was to class one 's self at once among those whose `` callous sardness '' had been denounced , and Lilias 's love of appreciation was so intense , that even before this unlovely stranger she could not bear to appear in an unfavourable light .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 45]: She determined to delay the evil moment , and leave to her mother the unpleasant task of refusal ; for it seemed in the last degree unlikely that Mrs Rendell would desire to supplement her ordinary subscription by a gift to an unauthorised collector .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 36]: `` I am very sorry you should have had your walk in the rain , '' she said sweetly , `` but , of course , in mother 's absence I can make no promises .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 19]: She will be home the day after to-morrow , if you could call again to see her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 22]: She flattered herself that she had evaded the difficulty very cleverly , but Miss Thacker rounded on her in unexpected fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 10]: `` Should n't dream of asking you my love .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 21]: Too much respect for your dear mother but wished to appeal to young and generous sarts like self and sisters !
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 5]: Any contribution however small !
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 4]: Every little helps .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 11]: Most grateful I am sure , subscription or donation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 35]: `` But -- but , '' Lilias heard three separate gasps of dismay from the window , and realising that no help was forthcoming from that quarter , nerved herself to the unpleasant task .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 35]: `` We should like to subscribe very much indeed , if we could , but we have only a small allowance , and at present are doing all we can to assist another charity .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 31]: I fear that we can not spare any more money -- '' Miss Thacker peered at her solemnly through her spectacles , and shook her head from side to side .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 13]: `` Ah , yes , my dear , can if you will !
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 13]: Every luxury and comfort , cup overflowing , only Will is lacking .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 15]: Look into your rart and ask yourself what can I deny myself for rothers ?
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 27]: Some worldly bauble , some article of adornment which you had planned to get , which you could do without , and reap pa rich reward .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 20]: What is a hat , a dress , a fan , compared to the succour rof suffering garts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 43]: Now , as it happened , Lilias was bound for town the very next day to buy a supply of those fineries which her soul loved , so that this suggestion was so aptly timed as to strike her dumb with confusion .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 58]: She could have gushed over the poor incurables for an hour on end ; was ready to shed tears at a recital of their woes ; but to give up a new hat in order to devote the money to their use , this was a flight of generosity to which Miss Lilias Rendell could never attain !
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 34]: She grew hot with anger at the inconsiderateness of the stranger in proposing such a sacrifice , hotter than ever at the thought of the three young sisters agape to hear her answer .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 29]: Here was a pretty alternative , to consent and go without some detail of her summer outfit , or to refuse and be branded as vain and selfish ?
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 23]: Lilias chose a middle course , and , extracting half a crown from her purse , handed it over with melancholy resignation .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 25]: `` I shall be pleased to give you a small donation , but I would rather my name did not appear in your list .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 9]: Put it down as from a friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 10]: `` Or a Giver -- a Cheerful Giver ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 19]: cried Miss Thacker , with an accent on the adjective which brought the blood into Lilias 's cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 47]: The wretched woman seemed to have fathomed her reluctance , and to be scoffing at her beneath a pretence of approval ; but surely , now that she had got what she wanted , she would take her departure , and end this most trying scene .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 17]: She made a little movement of dismissal , whereupon Miss Thacker glanced appealingly at the window .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 40]: `` And our rother dear young friends , '' she was beginning , when suddenly she put her hands up to her face and made a curious spluttering noise , at sound of which the sisters started in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 27]: She recovered herself at once , and continued her harangue with redoubled energy ; but suspicion had been aroused , and could not easily be allayed .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 3]: That laugh !
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 22]: It had been so like , so extraordinarily like ; and yet that hair -- that complexion -- those missing teeth !
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 5]: It could not be !
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 43]: Chrissie drew nearer and nearer , staring at the stranger with searching scrutiny , met a direct glance of the eyes , and straightway flew upon her , wrenching off bonnet and veil , and twitching the horn-rimmed glasses from her nose .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 51]: She squeaked and struggled , and fought the air with her woollen gloves , but it was of no avail : there she sat , discovered and exposed , with Nan 's dark tresses streaming down behind the auburn front , Nan 's dimpling smile breaking over the whitened face .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 5]: `` Such callous sardness !
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 8]: Dragged my hair out by the roots !
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 15]: Is that the way you treat your visitors , my dear young friends ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 24]: she stuttered ; but her dear young friends had no sympathy for her woes , and crowded round her , breathless with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 14]: `` Wretched , miserable girl , so it was you all the time !
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 7]: What made you do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 18]: `` Wanted to amuse you on a wet day , and could n't think of anything better .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 7]: Did I do it well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 4]: `` Abominably well !
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 12]: I could never have believed we should have been so deceived .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 20]: How you managed to disguise your voice I ca n't think , and to make yourself look so awful .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 14]: You are as white as a clown ; and your teeth , Nan !
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 8]: What has become of your teeth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 11]: `` Covered them with black sticking-plaster , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 17]: Not even for your benefit , my dears , could I extract my two front molars .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 14]: I smeared my face with cold cream , and then rubbed in flour .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 19]: Sticky , but efficacious , and sucked a chocolate all the time , to make my voice thick .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 7]: I 'll swallow it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 11]: Nan gulped , and rolled her eyes in expressive enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 28]: `` When I was dressed , I stole downstairs , let myself out of the side gate , and rang at the bell as bold as brass .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 29]: Mary did not recognise me , so I felt I was safe ; but my one terror was lest you should go upstairs to call me down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 12]: `` And you found all the clothes in the dressing-up box !
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 18]: It is so long since we used it that I had almost forgotten the dear old things .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 18]: The shawl and skirt I recognise , of course , but you have trimmed the bonnet yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 23]: I will say for you , my dear , that you made the most appalling old woman I have ever encountered . ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 23]: `` But I do n't quite approve of making fun of anything so very , very sad as those dear incurables ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 4]: said Lilias solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 28]: `` Well , perhaps you did n't make fun of them exactly , but it was not quite a nice subject to choose for a practical joke .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 8]: We ought to think of them tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 12]: -- By the by , I want that half-crown , Nan .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 7]: Give it back to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 4]: `` N-ay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 22]: drawled Nan , shaking her head , and speaking in broad , North - country dialect , `` N-ay , lass !
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 7]: I 'll none give it oop .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 9]: It mun bide with me till I dee !
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 38]: I 'll give you back good coin of the realm instead , but this precious piece is mine , and shall be pierced with a hole , and chained to my side , to commemorate the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 12]: It will be good for you as well as for me .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 14]: You can look at it , and remember how generous you were ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 17]: said Lilias , and turned to the tea-table to pour out the long - delayed tea .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 58]: It was too strong to drink ; and when Mary appeared in response to the bell , it was a treat to see her stagger back at the sight of the dishevelled figure in the arm-chair , and to watch the smile of benign condescension with which Nan wrinkled up her face and inclined her red-brown head .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 26]: Mary was an old friend of the family , and on sufficiently intimate terms to express her opinion in terms unchequered by forms of politeness .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 46]: She wished to be informed what Miss Nan would be up to next , and repeated with unction her own description of the `` Hugliest old woman you ever set eyes on , '' as given to cook in the kitchen , ten minutes earlier .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 18]: `` We 've been talking about you ever since , and wondering what you were after . ''
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 5]: This was fame indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 42]: The girls shared in the reflected glory of Nan 's performance , and only regretted that it had not been witnessed by a larger audience , while Chrissie , in especial , bewailed the absence of her _ alter ego _ .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 17]: `` Kitty will never forgive us if she does n't see you , '' she declared .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 13]: `` Oh , Nan , do go and call upon Mrs Maitland !
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 16]: Then Kitty would see you , and you might get some more money from her !
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 8]: It would be the most splendid fun .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 6]: Oh , Nan , do !
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 12]: I 'll love you for ever , if you will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 16]: Elsie and Agatha swelled the chorus by groans of appeal , and Nan visibly wavered .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 49]: She could do nothing until she had had tea , she declared , but after that , if the rain grew less heavy , she would consider the matter ; and hesitation being taken for assent , she was plied with cake and waited upon with obsequious attention .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 41]: The elements seemed in favour of the scheme , for , by the time that tea was finished , the downpour was exchanged for a gentle drizzle , which could afford no excuse to a weather-proof creature like Nan Rendell .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 57]: She was therefore shawled and bonneted once more , escorted to the front door by a giggling and excited quartette , and set off forthwith to tramp half a mile of muddy high road , half abashed at finding herself abroad in such a strange guise , altogether delighted at the madcap nature of the expedition .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 37]: The visit to Mrs Maitland was a huge success , for Kitty sat staring solemnly over her spectacles , while her mother had obviously much ado not to laugh outright at the eccentricities of her visitor .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 28]: In the matter of donations she presented a firmer front than Lilias had done , but Nan would not allow herself to be foiled without a struggle .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 43]: When Mrs Maitland said bravely , `` I can not see my way to giving anything more at present , '' she bridled as with indignation , and replied -- `` But you must not consider yourself , you must consider Me !
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 52]: Here am I , tramping through mud and mire , drenched with rain , and chilled with cold ; here rare you in your comfortable home , surrounded with luxury and dease , and you turn a deaf ear to the cause si plead , and let me toil in vain .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 48]: I can not gaze upon your good , kind face , and believe in such callous sardness ... The smallest trifle , if it be but half a crown -- '' Well , it seemed a cheap price to pay to get rid of the terrible creature !
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 23]: Like Lilias , Mrs Maitland meekly handed over the desired coin , and rose to her feet with an air of determination .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 10]: `` And now , if you will excuse me !
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 31]: I am rather busy , and -- '' Nan bowed and smirked , then suddenly swooped across the room to where Kitty sat , her arms stretched wide in invitation .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 16]: `` And will the dear child give me a sweet kiss before ri go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 47]: The consternation of the `` dear child '' and her mother can be imagined ; but discovery came with the next moment , together with such shriekings of delight , such shakings and scoldings , such questionings and exclaimings , as were proper to the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 30]: Nan returned home in high glee , chuckling over the success of the afternoon 's escapade , and far from suspecting that the chief adventure still was to come .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 17]: Such was the fact , however , and this is the way in which it happened .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 38]: She had passed along the high road in safety , meeting few inhabitants , owing to the inclemency of the weather , and looking forward with delight to the welcome which she would receive from her sisters .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 39]: Presently Thurston House came in view , and , sure enough , there were four excited heads bobbing to and fro at the window , four broad beams of amusement to testify to the grotesqueness of her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 34]: Nan lifted a solemn glance in return , and Chrissie , seized with a sudden demon of mischief , pointed a forefinger at the door opposite , and gesticulated violently in its direction .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 17]: As plainly as words could speak , that forefinger said , `` Call at the Grange !
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 11]: There 's an adventure for you , if you like !
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 7]: Beard the lion in his den .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 7]: I dare you to do it !
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 6]: You dare not go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 26]: It was done on the impulse of the moment , and on the impulse of the moment Nan turned and skipped obediently across the street .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 56]: She never thought of possible consequences ; her one idea was to horrify her sisters by pretending to carry out the suggestion , and the sight of their agitated faces pressed against the pane was sufficient encouragement to sustain her courage , as a pull at the bell sent a pealing chime through the house .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 23]: The appearance of the old butler in the doorway did indeed evoke a thrill of nervousness , but then , what mattered ?
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 21]: Visitors were never admitted , and she would certainly be dismissed , even as the others had been before her !
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 27]: She quite prided herself upon the _ sang-froid _ with which she made the usual inquiry -- `` Mr Vanburgh is at home , I presume ?
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 11]: Will he be able to see me this afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 5]: `` Certainly , madam .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 5]: Will you walk in ?
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 8]: Mr Vanburgh is quite at liberty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 13]: The horror of it seemed to take away all power of resistance .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 19]: Did the man drag her in by force , or did she obey him of her own accord ?
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 5]: Nan could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 22]: The awful truth remained that the next moment she stood within the hall , and the door was shut behind her !
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 4]: DIOGENES AT HOME .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 8]: `` This way , please , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 6]: Will you come up-stairs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 49]: said the butler ; and Nan stumbled blindly forward , past the branching palms , the Indian cabinets , the knight in his glittering armour , past a hundred treasures , with never an eye to notice one of them , and a heart beating fast with agitation .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 45]: The ascent seemed to last for a year , yet it would be over far too soon ; the dreaded moment of introduction would arrive , and , in the name of all that was horrifying and perplexing , what should she do then ?
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 8]: By what name should she be announced ?
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 11]: What should she state as the object of her visit ?
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 9]: What excuse could she offer for her intrusion ?
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 28]: `` If I ever get out of this alive , I 'll first pay out Miss Chrissie , and then turn over a new leaf for life !
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 8]: No more practical jokes for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 14]: said Nan to herself , and pulled her bonnet resolutely over her face .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 30]: The butler had paused , and was looking at her inquiringly as he threw open the door of his master 's room , and waited to announce her name .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 46]: She croaked at him , -- there is no other word to describe the inarticulate sound which issued from her lips , -- then swept forward , and the man retired , no doubt thinking the stranger 's manner on a par with her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 36]: Left to herself , Nan took a few steps forward and stopped abruptly , finding herself in a room which was at once the most beautiful and the most extraordinary which she had ever beheld .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 41]: In every direction in which she turned her eyes , they were greeted by some quaint treasure , which had been brought from the ends of the earth to be stored against a background of tapestry and carved oak panel .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 33]: It was like stepping back hundreds of years , and finding one 's self in an old baronial castle ; and the occupant of the room was in keeping with his surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 51]: He lay on his couch , staring at her with sunken eyes , a picturesque-looking old man , with a complexion of bleached transparency ; a white head , covered by a velvet skull-cap , and a wasted form , wrapped in a dressing -- gown of embroidered Oriental silk .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 31]: He looked both sad and suffering , and Nan recognised as much with a pang of regret for all the hard terms she had lavished upon his want of hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 4]: Yes , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 17]: he looked too ill to receive visitors ; too weary to be troubled with the commonplaces .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 10]: What could she say to explain her own visit ?
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 11]: What in the world should she find to talk about ?
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 8]: `` Wo n't you sit down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 5]: said a melodious voice .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 6]: `` Pray take a seat !
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 20]: I can not wait upon you myself , as you see , but I can recommend that old saddle-bag .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 6]: It is most comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 31]: As he spoke , the invalid waved his hand towards a chair near his own , and Nan seated herself upon it in silence , glancing timidly in his face .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 5]: This dumbness was appalling .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 31]: She racked her brains to think of something to say , but no ideas were forthcoming ; she could only twist her fingers in embarrassment , and wait another lead .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 24]: `` It is most kind of you to come to see me on such a tempestuous afternoon , '' Mr Vanburgh continued politely .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 8]: `` I did not expect any callers .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 25]: Ladies , as a rule , are not fond of venturing out in the rain , unless they have special business on hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 2]: Bravo !
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 7]: Here was a lead at last !
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 15]: What could be better than to follow up the suggestion of a business call ?
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 5]: Nan asked herself eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 51]: Mrs Maitland had regretted the loss of subscriptions upon which she had counted from the wealthy owner of the Grange : would it not be a good action if she could draw Mr Vanburgh 's attention to the needs of the Incurables , and induce him to promise a subscription ?
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 22]: She would not take the money , but leave the address of the secretary , to whom it could be forwarded .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 10]: Oh , it was admirable -- an admirable idea !
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 11]: The afternoon 's escapade would lead to good after all .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 19]: Nan 's elastic spirits rose with a bound , and she smiled upon her companion with restored equanimity .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 7]: `` I have a special business .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 25]: I did not come merely to pay a call , but to ask your help for a cause in which I am much interested .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 54]: I hoped that you might feel inclined to give a subscription , and can assure you that any sum which you may decide to give -- '' To her dismay , the benevolent expression upon the watching face disappeared , as she spoke , to give place to one of suspicion and distrust .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 26]: Mr Vanburgh moved himself on his pillows , so as to face her more fully , and stared at her fixedly , beneath frowning brows .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 6]: `` You want a subscription !
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 13]: You have come here to beg -- to ask for money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 7]: `` But not for myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 4]: explained Nan eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 19]: The scrutiny bent upon her was so searching that she felt bound to protest against a personal interest .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 18]: `` It was for a charity , a local hospital , which is in want of funds .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 31]: It was thought -- I thought that , as a newcomer to the neighbourhood , you might like to hear about the various organisations , and to give some support .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 23]: There is a large poor population at Sale , a mile from here , and the committee is always short of funds .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 20]: Many of the old residents have left , and the new ones do n't -- do n't always . ''
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 25]: -- Her remembrance of odd sentences heard at committee meetings came to a sudden end , and the voice trailed off in inarticulate murmurings .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 10]: `` Do not always come forward in their place .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 3]: Just so !
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 24]: And I am to understand that you are deputed by these various charities and organisations to plead their cause and collect subscriptions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 6]: Nan cleared her throat vigorously .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 23]: It was the only way she could think of by which to gain time , and decide how to evade the question .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 11]: `` They are most grateful for all they can get .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 11]: The committee would send you an acknowledgment of your subscription .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 16]: It would be better to send it direct , instead of giving it to me .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 23]: I just wish to call your attention -- to tell you particulars and enlist your interest -- '' `` Just so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 19]: said Mr Vanburgh again ; and Nan fancied that there was a slight softening in the watching eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 4]: `` Just so .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 13]: And for what special charity do you wish to plead to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 8]: `` For the Home for Incurables ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 11]: The word came with a hiss from between closed teeth .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 8]: You choose your object well , madam !
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 7]: I congratulate you on your discretion .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 7]: The cause is truly fitting . ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 40]: She had made a false move this time , there was no doubt about it , for the old man 's voice was sharp with displeasure ; but blundering Nan could not even now imagine wherein lay the offence .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 12]: She gaped at him , with a stammering -- `` Fitting !
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 3]: Why fitting ?
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 9]: I do n't understand what you mean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 28]: `` Only that being incurable myself , I need your charity every whit as much as those for whom you come asking help -- '' `` Incurable !
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 6]: You wo n't get better !
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 10]: Never get better until you -- '' `` Die ?
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 2]: Precisely !
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 6]: That is what it means .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 42]: I shall spend my life upon this couch , or being wheeled about in a bath-chair , suffering torments of pain and weariness until death comes to set me free -- the kindliest friend that could step inside my door ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 4]: cried Nan sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 15]: The tears rushed to her eyes , and she trembled from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 46]: It was terrible to listen to those words , terrible to her youth and strength to hear death spoken of in those yearning tones ; her heart -- Nan 's big loving heart -- went out in a rush of sympathy towards the lonely sufferer .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 16]: She stretched her hand towards him , and cried brokenly , `` I 'm sorry !
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 6]: Oh , I 'm sorry !
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 23]: We knew , of course , that you were ill , but we never thought it was as bad as that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 3]: `` We !
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 5]: Who are we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 38]: Mr Vanburgh 's fingers closed over her hand , and he held it firmly in his own , while he gazed at her with a gentleness of mien before which Nan 's resolution died a sudden death .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 7]: `` My -- my sisters ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 4]: she stammered humbly .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 9]: `` Oh , Mr Vanburgh , forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 5]: I 'm Nan Rendell .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 10]: I live in the house just across the road .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 16]: I 'm not an old woman at all , only a stupid girl dressed up .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 29]: I never meant to come , but Chrissie dared me , and I thought I would come to the door and ring , to give her a fright .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 9]: I never thought you would let me in .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 9]: You had refused to see all other visitors .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 21]: My father and mother called , and Mr and Mrs Maitland -- '' `` They did , and many others .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 14]: It was very kind , but I felt too ill to receive them .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 17]: With you , however , it was different , for I seemed to know you already .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 20]: I had seen so much of your life through ` my study window ' -- '' `` Saw me !
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 10]: Then you knew all the time who I was ?
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 8]: You knew -- '' `` I did !
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 5]: It was very interesting .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 11]: I wondered how long you could keep it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 7]: `` But how -- how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 5]: Mr Vanburgh smiled quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 26]: `` My couch is placed near the window , and during my long lonely days I devote a good deal of attention to the passers-by .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 23]: About three o'clock this afternoon I observed a black robed figure steal out of your side gate and approach the front door .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 8]: I saw her admitted by the servant .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 21]: I saw her go out once again , and , like her sisters , kept watch for her return . ''
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 17]: `` And you saw Chrissie point across to your door , and heard my ring ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 4]: `` I did .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 13]: And rang myself , to give orders that you should be admitted .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 11]: That is the true and authentic account of the mystery .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 12]: It is not so mysterious after all , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 7]: `` It 's very embarrassing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 36]: Nan was suddenly overcome by a consciousness of how ridiculous she must have appeared in her assumed character , and collapsed into feeble laughter , `` What _ must _ you think of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 12]: `` To tell the truth , I prefer your ordinary appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 10]: It is difficult to recognise you in this attire .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 16]: Would you think it a liberty if I asked you to resume your ordinary guise ?
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 3]: Please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 22]: and he waved his hand with an appeal which had in it an element of authority , despite all its courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 52]: Nan felt very small , very much like a mischievous child who has spilt the ink-bottle , and is sent upstairs to be washed and tidied ; but , all the same , she was not sorry to remove the ugly trappings , and appear in her true guise once more .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 38]: Bonnet , veil , spectacles , and cloak came off in succession ; her dark hair curled in little rings round her forehead , and the round young throat rose like a pillar above the quaintly-cut bodice .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 35]: If Lilias had been in her sister 's place , she would have reflected that her antique costume was appropriate to her surroundings , but such thoughts as these never occurred to honest Nan .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 32]: She was merely concerned to see that the last remains of powder were wiped away , and , being satisfied on this point , smiled at Mr Vanburgh in friendly fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 6]: `` That 's better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 4]: he said cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 8]: `` I begin to recognise you again .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 20]: I have seen you only from a distance so far , but I seem to know you very well .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 20]: You are ` Nan , ' you say , and you are what -- number three , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 27]: The young lady who went away the other day is the elder sister , and after her comes the fair one with the golden locks . ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 3]: `` Lilias !
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 28]: Yes ; she is the beauty of the family ; I come next , and then Elsie , the little one , with big , dark eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 22]: We call her ` Mrs Gummidge , ' because she is melancholy , and feels things ` more than others . '
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 8]: Then comes Agatha ; you know Agatha !
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 29]: the great big girl with the huge feet and the rosy cheeks ; and Christabel , the youngest -- '' `` Oh yes , I know Christabel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 30]: said Mr Vanburgh , smiling , `` and her friend who comes to lessons every day : the brown-legged stork , with the red cap and the curly locks .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 5]: I like that child .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 6]: She looks honest and straightforward !
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 5]: Who is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 8]: `` Why , that 's Kitty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 24]: replied Nan , in a voice of surprised reproof , for surely every one in Waybourne must know an important personage like Kitty !
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 63]: `` Her name is really Gwendoline Maitland , but everybody calls her Kitty ; and she was longing to know you , and made her mother come to call in her new spring clothes , with a promise to bring in her name at every turn of the conversation ; and then , after all , you would not receive her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 6]: `` That was very sad !
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 33]: I am afraid I must have appeared churlish ; but , as a matter of fact , I came down to Waybourne to avoid old friends , rather than make new ones .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 8]: I am too ill to be sociable .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 14]: It is a trial to me , nowadays , to meet strangers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 14]: `` And yet -- '' `` And yet I wished to see you !
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 10]: That seems rather a contradiction , does it not ?
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 23]: But I have always been fond of young people , and I seemed to have made your acquaintance in spite of myself .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 17]: Perhaps you are hardly aware how plainly one can see into your sitting-room from here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 22]: Nan smiled and bent forward to look across the street , in response to a wave of the invalid 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 21]: The porch-room was exactly opposite , and the three-sided windows did indeed allow an extraordinarily clear view of the interior .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 47]: The girls had always believed themselves out of range of vision when they were seated at the table ; but at this moment Nan could distinctly discern four anxious faces scanning the opposite house , catch Agatha 's craning movements , and Lilias 's waving hands .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 21]: The sight provoked an irresistible chuckle of amusement , and Mr Vanburgh 's eyes turned towards her in wistful scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 11]: `` You seem very merry together , you young people .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 9]: Life is full of happiness to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 9]: `` Oh , we have our trials ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 4]: said Nan quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 22]: `` We are awfully happy together ; but still , of course , it is n't all as we should wish .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 25]: Each one of us has a grievance , and could talk about it for hours at a time , if we had a chance .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 8]: Sometimes we have dreadful fits of dumps .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 15]: Elsie has them chronically , but the rest of us are up and down .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 15]: I 'm generally up myself ; but still , I have my moments ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 9]: `` I should think they are very rare !
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 13]: Would it be indiscreet to ask what is your peculiar cross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 15]: Nan pondered with raised brows and an expression which grew more and more uncertain .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 14]: `` It 's rather difficult to say straight off , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 16]: There _ is _ something , I know , but I forget what it is .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 26]: I am always making stupid mistakes for one thing , and that is so awkward , now that I am supposed to be grown up .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 11]: I 'm eighteen , so I ought to know better .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 17]: I went out to my first dinner-party this winter , and the most awful thing happened .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 31]: A stupid male creature took me in , with a collar about a foot high , and such an affected drawl that I could hardly understand a word he said .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 11]: However , I talked away and tried to be pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 22]: I have a habit of waving my hands when I talk ; we all have -- perhaps you have noticed it !
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 30]: I was telling a story , and came to a point where it seemed necessary to lift my hand suddenly , to give emphasis to what I was saying .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 27]: Well , I did it , and at that crucial moment if the waiter did n't go and hand a sauce-bowl over my partner 's shoulder !
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 29]: My hand met the bowl , and ... Maud was sitting opposite , and she said that never in all her life had she seen anything so appalling !
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 23]: The bowl flew up in the air , turned a somersault , and the sauce rained down in showers upon his knees !
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 17]: He had his serviette spread open , of course , but still it was bad enough .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 8]: There was silence all round the table .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 39]: He sat stock still , staring at his hands , all brown and dripping ; then he said , in a very small , exhausted voice , ` I think I had bettaw -- go up-sta-ahs ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 15]: Mr Vanburgh lay back against his cushions and pressed his hands to his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 14]: His shoulders heaved , and a curious muffled sound emerged from his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 54]: He tried to strangle it , tried to frown , to choke the inclination in his throat , but it was of no avail : laugh he must , and laugh he did , his slight form shaking with merriment , the tears rising in the tired eyes and streaming down his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 31]: Nan laughed afresh at the comical spectacle , and as she looked a door behind the couch was pushed gently open , and a startled face peered round the corner .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 24]: It was the face of the dark-skinned foreigner who was the invalid 's attendant , and his master greeted him with affectionate freedom .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 5]: `` Yes , Pedro !
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 5]: It is quite true !
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 4]: I was laughing !
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 16]: It is a long time since you have heard such a sound from my lips .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 6]: No wonder you are startled .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 12]: It is this young lady who has wrought the miracle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 24]: The dark eyes rested on Nan 's face with a glow of gratitude which made the girl 's heart beat fast with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 19]: The eloquent Southern glance conveyed many meanings , but he said simply , `` The signorina is welcome !
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 8]: I hope the signorina comes again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 17]: and left the room in the same quiet , unobtrusive manner in which he had entered .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 4]: THE CURTAINED PICTURES .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 21]: When Mrs Rendell returned home and heard of Nan 's latest escapade , she was breathless with horror and consternation .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 19]: `` I do n't know what I am to do with you , child , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 22]: `` Every time I go away there is a fresh outbreak , and you seem to grow worse instead of better .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 8]: It is useless to warn you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 7]: `` Oh , mummy dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 20]: Nan 's voice was full of protest , and she stared with reproachful eyes in her mother 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 9]: `` It 's not fair to say that !
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 8]: I always do as you tell me .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 8]: I never do what you have forbidden .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 27]: You ca n't think of a single instance where I have played a trick the second time , when you have cautioned me against it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 19]: `` But what is the good of that , when you immediately hit on something even worse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 5]: queried her mother despairingly .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 30]: `` What sane woman would ever dream of forbidding a girl of eighteen to walk about the streets in disguise , and go begging for subscriptions at strange houses ?
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 12]: It takes away my breath , even to think of it !
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 9]: All sorts of things might have happened ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 10]: `` But only nice things did happen , dear !
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 18]: I always fall on my feet , you know , and Mr Vanburgh is an old love .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 36]: He sent his respects to you , and hoped you and father would do him the favour of paying a second call , as he would much like to make the acquaintance of my parents !
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 31]: It was the first time in my life that I had heard you spoken of as adjuncts of my noble self , and I can tell you I felt proud .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 22]: Really and truly , it was a blessing I went , for you ca n't think how he enjoyed seeing me .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 25]: I said good-bye three times over before he would let me go , and I told him every single thing about our family ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 9]: `` I 've no doubt you did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 12]: Mrs Rendell groaned aloud , and stared helplessly at the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 45]: `` Please add to your list of prohibitions for the future , my dear , that you are forbidden to go outside the door in an assumed costume ; and do try to behave like a reasonable creature , instead of a hare-brained schoolboy !
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 17]: I ca n't make any promise about calling again until I see what father says . ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 42]: Nan was comfortably secure that her father would do as he was told , and had little difficulty in persuading the good man that , above all things in the world , he desired to make the acquaintance of his neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 59]: There was little fear that the visit would be deferred too long ; for with five daughters vying with each other to introduce the subject on every possible opportunity , and to discuss times and seasons at breakfast , lunch , and dinner , it speedily became an object to get the call paid as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 73]: On the very next Saturday afternoon , therefore , Mrs Rendell attired herself in calling array , was carefully surveyed by a critical audience , pronounced to be a `` credit to the family , '' and despatched to the Grange , with a score of divergent instructions as to what to do , what to say , and , above all , how to lay the foundation-stone of a future intimacy .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 75]: Perhaps , if the truth were known , Mrs Rendell was scarcely less excited than her daughters at the prospect of being admitted into the presence of the mysterious stranger ; but if this were so , she was doomed to disappointment , for the invalid seemed too weary and dispirited to enter into conversation , and it was only by a most apparent effort that he roused himself to reply to her remarks .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 28]: Mrs Rendell would have felt repelled by his coldness of manner , had it not been for one redeeming point -- his unaffected interest in her children !
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 46]: The wan face brightened into a smile at the mention of Nan 's name , and he begged that the girl might be allowed to come over to see him `` often -- as often as possible , '' in a tone of unmistakable sincerity .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 49]: Mrs Rendell assented graciously ; and , mindful of the reproaches which would be hurled at her head if she returned without doing her best for every member of the family , suggested that perhaps Mr Vanburgh would like to make the acquaintance of the other girls also !
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 13]: He hesitated for a moment , but looked gratified by the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 10]: `` If they would not find it too dull .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 18]: I am fond of young people , but am always afraid of boring them by my company .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 7]: Our lives lie so far apart .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 18]: Perhaps they would come over at different times , and let me make their acquaintance by degrees .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 19]: The two younger ones especially -- your own daughter and the little girl who is her friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 31]: On the score of this distinction , Christabel and Kitty were the first couple to take advantage of the invitation and cross the road to interview Diogenes in his den .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 28]: They confided in each other that they were `` simply dying of fright , '' but contrived to conceal their expiring condition beneath haughty and dignified exteriors .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 37]: The manner in which Chrissie requested the old butler to inform his master of their advent would have done credit to a princess of the blood , while Kitty stalked upstairs behind her with majestic gravity .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 46]: Outside the dreaded door , however , it was impossible to resist exchanging a grimace of agitation , and it was another instance of the contrariety of men that the butler should turn his head at that inopportune moment , and discover them so employed .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 56]: Chrissie grew red with mortification , and Kitty spluttered with laughter ; so , after all , it was in the guise of two blushing , giggling schoolgirls that they made Mr Vanburgh 's acquaintance , instead of that of self-possessed women of the world , as they had fondly hoped would be the case .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 37]: He looked from one to the other as they sat before him -- big , bonnie , well-grown girls , with flaming locks and fresh complexions , and there was a great wistfulness in his gaze .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 33]: The girls felt it ; and though the meaning thereof was a mystery , they understood that here was an understanding , sympathetic soul , and immediately lost their feeling of shyness .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 41]: In ten minutes ' time they had confided to him their dream of the `` Select Academy , '' and he had promised to recommend the school to his friends , with a seriousness which was balm to their vanity .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 80]: Nothing is more annoying to mature women of fourteen than to be treated as if they were children ; and when Mr Vanburgh discussed at length various points of management on which the future partners were at variance , and gave valuable suggestions on architectural designs , Christabel screwed up her eyes at him with her most approving smile , and reflected that seldom , if ever , had she met a grown-up person with so much common sense !
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 38]: Tea was brought in for the girls ' benefit , and Kitty poured it out , spilling the milk over the cloth , and covering the wet spot with the muffin dish with admirable presence of mind .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 37]: She felt so much at home that she helped herself to cake a second time without being asked , drank three cups of tea , and only refrained from a fourth because the pot was drained .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 88]: After tea , conversation turned on hobbies , and it being discovered that one girl had a mania for miniature jugs , and the other for foreign post - cards , the Italian servant was summoned , and received instructions in his own tongue , which resulted in an addition being made to each collection : Kitty returned home hugging `` a little d-arling '' jug of Italian pottery , while Chrissie exhibited a Chinese post-card , and pictures of Mongolian belles printed on transparent rice paper .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 26]: The glories of the interview lost nothing from their descriptions ; and Lilias and Elsie sighed continuously until the time came for their own visit .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 33]: In each heart the thought lay concealed that if Mr Vanburgh had been so kind to the other girls , he must of a surety extend a still greater favour to herself .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 41]: The mirror assured Lilias that she was a sight to `` make an old man young '' ; while Elsie shook her head over the reflection that only those who have suffered themselves can sympathise with the woes of others .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 4]: But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 51]: disappointment awaited them ; for , strange to relate , the invalid found Lilias 's fragile charms less attractive to his eye than the healthful vivacity of her sisters ; while condolence was so distasteful to his ears , that he fairly scowled down Elsie 's plaintive assurances of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 42]: As a matter of fact , it was brightness and amusement of which the recluse was in need ; and as the last visitors were the least humorous members of the family , it followed that their presence was least welcome .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 44]: Awkward silence recurred at intervals ; and when the girls rose to say good-bye , no request was made for a further visit , though a message was sent to Nan , begging her to come by herself on the first convenient occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 36]: Elsie made a public announcement in the schoolroom that evening that she washed her hands of Mr Vanburgh , finding in him a cold and unresponsive soul ; but Lilias was not so easily discouraged .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 36]: It rankled in her mind that she had failed where others had succeeded , and she determined to break down Mr Vanburgh 's prejudice and win the post of favourite , cost what it might .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 12]: She had not had a fair chance when Elsie was present .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 46]: The members of one 's own family are apt to betray surprise at injudicious moments , to check one 's innocent rhapsodies by counter-assertions , and even to quote words used on previous occasions , as a proof that conduct does not coincide with theory .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 54]: There were a dozen pretty little speeches she had been longing to make , but it was impossible to deliver them when Elsie was sitting there , listening with all her ears , ready to repeat them to a schoolroom audience , or even commit them to the surer testimony of her diary .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 14]: Some day she would make excuse to go alone , and then -- !
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 28]: Lilias nodded her head in assured self-confidence , and watched Nan 's air of proprietorship with a smile , convinced that her own triumph was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 58]: She was beginning to realise that a declared understanding was less exciting than an incipient love affair ; the thirst for fresh conquest was upon her , and in default of any more interesting prey , she determined to turn her attention to Mr Vanburgh , and raked her silly little head to devise schemes for subjection .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 51]: Honest Nan had no scheme at all , nothing but the kindliest desire to cheer a lonely old man , and was so entirely her bright merry self at the second interview , that again , and yet again , the sound of laughter broke the silence of the room .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 63]: She discovered that the old man had a keen sense of humour , though it had long lain dormant ; and as it seemed to please him to hear her chat away in unconstrained fashion , chat she did , with such an accompaniment of sparkling eyes , waving hands , and sunny smiles , as was a positive tonic to behold .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 51]: She told stories of her own adventures or misadventures , which Mr Vanburgh capped by remembrances of his own boyhood ; they compared notes as to their mutual sensations at critical moments , and so sympathetic did they appear , that the girl was forced into an expression of astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 6]: `` You remember so well !
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 25]: Most old people seem to forget how it feels to be young , especially people who have not had any children of their own .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 11]: How have you managed to remember all these things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 8]: The old man looked at her quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 23]: The smile left his face , and the lines round his lips and eyes seemed to deepen in sudden , mysterious fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 17]: Nan divined that she had touched a hidden wound , and waited anxiously for his reply .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 16]: It was a long time in coming , and then it was altogether a surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 27]: Mr Vanburgh touched the bell which lay near at hand , and spoke a word of direction to the Italian , who appeared at the summons .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 16]: `` Take this young lady into the study and show her -- my pictures ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 17]: he said slowly ; and Nan followed Pedro out of the room in perplexity of spirit .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 30]: The man 's dark eyes studied her face critically , but no words were said until the room was reached , and they stood together before a curtained alcove .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 43]: `` It is his sorrow , the sorrow of his life , '' murmured the soft voice plaintively , as the curtain was drawn back , and Nan gazed with awed eyes upon four portraits hung against a fluting of crimson cloth .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 41]: The rich frames , the carved table beneath , with its bank of white flowers , gave the alcove the appearance of a shrine ; and a shrine it was indeed , dedicated to the memory of a lost happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 49]: The first portrait was of a man , the second of a woman , with a beautiful and gentle face , which bore so strange a likeness to those of a boy and a girl on either side that it was easy to trace the relationship between them .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 63]: The girl bade fair to become as lovely as her mother ; the boy was a magnificent fellow , with waving locks , thrown back from a noble brow , and such an air of pride and candour in the carriage of the head and the flash of the eyes as would have filled a parent 's heart with pride to behold .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 31]: Nan 's eyes passed by the other two portraits to dwell on this with wondering admiration ; and something in the appearance of the beautiful young lad seemed strangely familiar .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 66]: Family likeness is a marvellous thing , revealing itself in the most unexpected fashions ; and though at first sight no two people could have been more unlike than this incarnation of youth and strength , and the bleached and weary invalid in the next room , it was certainly of Mr Vanburgh , and no other , that Nan was reminded at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 24]: The shape of the eyes was the same , the curve of the lips , the growth of the hair on the forehead .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 15]: She looked back at the first picture , and gave a start of recognition .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 11]: She had not realised it at first , but yes !
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 27]: that handsome , happy , self - confident face had once belonged to Mr Vanburgh himself ; it was his own portrait at which she looked .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 16]: Nan wheeled round to the servant with an agitated question : `` It is himself !
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 6]: But why is he here ?
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 36]: They are dead , these others , but he -- '' `` He also is dead , signorina , '' the man replied , and bent his head as if in obeisance before the picture .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 8]: `` He died with those he loved .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 11]: Something lived on , perhaps , but not my master .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 15]: He lies buried with them -- his wife -- his son -- his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 5]: All that he had .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 6]: Ah , what a tragedy !
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 22]: One day all happiness and love ; the next it is done , it is over , his heart is broken !
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 26]: We were out yachting together , and my master and I have gone on shore on business -- to make purchases , to buy provisions .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 32]: We should join them again next day ; and meantime they went a little cruise to pass the time -- an excursion to a bay which the signora wished to visit .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 27]: It was all calm when they started , but those are treacherous seas ; a squall sprang up , and they were driven on the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 20]: The gale lasted two days , and at the end pieces of wood were washed ashore from the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 9]: There was nothing else -- no , nothing !
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 19]: We were like madmen both , searching about , and waiting , always waiting , year after year .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 30]: ... They might have been picked up , and landed at some far-away port ; they might for a time have lost their minds and been unable to remember .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 10]: Such things have been ; and why not again ?
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 12]: But at last hope died away , and strength with it .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 21]: He took no rest , no care for himself , and so the illness came which ends as you see .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 25]: Then I took him away , for the living must come before the dead , and I had my duty to him to remember .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 23]: We have wandered over the world , signorina , in search of health and peace , but they come not with money .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 38]: Everything else , '' -- he waved his hand round the exquisite room , with its paintings , its carvings , its china , its treasures of ancient art -- `` everything else , but not these .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 14]: So at last we came home , to rest -- and die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 6]: Nan trembled and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 34]: She had no words in which to express her passion of pity , but the Italian understood , with the quick insight of his race , and flashed a grateful glance upon her .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 13]: `` It is not every one to whom he shows these pictures .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 32]: They are covered with a curtain , so that they are hidden from the stranger ; but every morning we come together , he and I , and put fresh flowers .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 19]: It is a great sign of his favour to the signorina that he should have sent her here .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 24]: He has opened his heart to her as is not usual with him , and she can help him if she will . ''
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 6]: `` Oh , I will !
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 3]: I will !
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 11]: I long to help him , '' murmured Nan brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 24]: She stood gazing at the pictures until the curtain dropped once more , and she found herself being escorted back to her seat .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 7]: Mr Vanburgh looked at her silently .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 32]: It was not possible for him to be whiter than usual , but his lips were contracted in a nervous pressure , and a nerve was throbbing visibly at his temples .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 32]: Nan stretched out her hand impetuously and laid it over his ; the fingers were icy cold to her touch , and she rubbed them between her own with tender care .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 5]: `` Thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 12]: he whispered breathlessly , and looked at her with kindly eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 7]: `` You are a wise child .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 6]: You understand how to console .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 5]: Words are too weak .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 19]: You judged too quickly , you see , in taking for granted that I had always been alone .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 10]: Fifteen years ago -- you saw their portraits ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 12]: They are all beautiful ; and oh , the boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 5]: `` My son ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 5]: sighed the father softly .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 11]: `` Yes , if you could have seen my son .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 25]: It was not only I , but every one who met him said the same thing : that they had never seen his equal .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 19]: All that I did was for him , to prepare for the time when he should succeed me .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 19]: He was so strong , so full of life ; it seemed impossible that he could die . ''
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 10]: `` Mr Vanburgh , how did you bear it ?
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 10]: How can people go through such trials and live ?
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 22]: To lose everything at once , and live on , and keep one 's reason -- I ca n't understand it .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 7]: You must be very good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 6]: The old man smiled sadly .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 10]: `` No , child , I am not good .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 29]: I had my time of madness and rebellion , and my old self died , never to revive again ; but I have kept my faith in God .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 14]: I could not afford to lose that , as well as everything else .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 58]: He has taken from me all that made life beautiful -- first my dear ones , and then the strength which might have made it possible to find fresh interests ; but such discipline must be for some great end , and I am growing nearer and nearer to the time when I shall know the reason .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 16]: There is an explanation ready for me , and I am waiting to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 33]: You will never have a trouble sent to you in life , child , without the strength to bear it ; and the greater the trial the greater may be the reward .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 44]: Even in this life I have had compensations ; when the sun of prosperity is shining we do not realise our need of God , but when the clouds gather , we turn homewards like tired children , and the help never fails .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 24]: In my loneliness I have learned to know Christ , and the peace which is His gift to those who trust Him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 37]: He shut his eyes and remained silent for a long time , while Nan studied the emaciated face with anxious gaze ; but when he looked up again he was calm and collected , almost smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 23]: `` My little friend , I have shown you my Holy of Holies , but we will never speak of it again .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 14]: You know my sorrow , and we will understand each other without words .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 23]: I have learned to be thankful for the unexpected blessings which come into my life , of which your companionship is one .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 36]: You will always be welcome when you can spare an hour to sit with a lonely old man ; and I am glad to have made the acquaintance of some young people for another reason .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 31]: My nephew , my heir , '' -- he drew his brows together with a frown of pain , -- `` is coming next month to pay me a visit .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 28]: He will be with me for some time , and if you will be kind enough to extend your friendship to him I shall be grateful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 4]: `` We will !
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 3]: We will !
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 10]: But oh , I wish he were a girl !
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 17]: Are you sure you have no girl nieces that you want to invite as well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 5]: `` More girls ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 5]: Mr Vanburgh smiled faintly .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 16]: `` I should have thought you had enough , with five sisters of your own .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 23]: A boy would surely be more change , though , as far as that , Gervase is more than a boy now .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 23]: It is three years since he left Oxford , and he is quite a man of the world by this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 4]: Nan groaned deeply .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 5]: `` I know them !
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 10]: I know them well , and I detest them !
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 35]: Really old men are quite sensible and humble , but the young ones put on as many airs as if they owned the world , and did n't think much of it at that .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 37]: I like schoolboys immensely -- mischievous , grubby little schoolboys , who keep white mice in their bedrooms , and are full of pranks and jokes ; but no young men for me , thank you !
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 27]: Jim , our brother , is the only really nice one I know , and even he thinks that the world was made for his convenience .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 46]: No one dares to contradict him ; and it is the most maddening thing in the world to argue with him , for he never even takes the trouble to answer , but simply chuckles in condescending fashion , and chucks you under the chin .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 40]: We know another very nice man , too -- Ned Talbot ; but for a clever man who has taken degrees and scholarships and appointments above everybody else , you would n't believe how stupid and blundering he is .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 6]: As blind as a bat .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 6]: He -- but never mind !
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 32]: I did n't mean to speak about him , only to say that if your nephew is coming down at all , do have him in June instead of next month !
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 23]: Jim is coming home then , and Ned will be here , and we have all sorts of plans in the air .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 26]: It would be nicer for him when there would be some men to take him about , and he would have a really good time .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 11]: Do n't you think he could come in June ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 12]: `` He could probably arrange to stay on a little longer .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 24]: He will be with me for some considerable time , as there is a great deal of business which we must do together .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 25]: I will tell him what you say when I write , and impress upon him that June is a period of special attraction ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 11]: `` And then he will be at our sale ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 26]: said Nan gleefully to herself ; and the same thought occurred to each of her sisters , when this latest piece of news was unfolded .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 5]: `` How lovely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 3]: gushed Agatha .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 8]: `` Now he can buy my shaving-case !
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 32]: Father said it was a useless bauble ; but a rich young man can afford baubles , and I feel sure he would like the look of it upon his dressing-table .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 18]: I 'll mark it ` Sold , ' and say I kept it specially for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 11]: `` I do n't believe he will come at all .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 24]: Men detest bazaars ; but if he does , we must make him buy far more than that , '' said Elsie firmly .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 28]: `` If we ca n't sell that veil-case , we will pretend it is for ties , and that no gentleman 's wardrobe is complete without it .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 13]: And we 'll raise all the prices whenever he comes near ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 22]: `` I do n't suppose he 'll eat toffee , but he must hand round the tea and make himself useful .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 28]: We can keep him busy at our stall , '' said Chrissie ; while Lilias stared into space , and smiled in a soft , dreamy fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 25]: `` After all , '' she said thoughtfully , `` after all , I think he had better help me , instead of Ned !
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 29]: Ned knows quite a number of the people , and could make himself agreeable going about and talking ; but this poor fellow will know nobody but us .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 2]: yes !
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 10]: he shall be my assistant in the punt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 5]: A BUDGET OF LETTERS .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 45]: One bright May morning Mrs Rendell sat by her desk ostensibly busy with accounts , but in reality watching the movements of her daughter Lilias , who lounged on the window seat reading the letters which had just been delivered by the second post .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 31]: Mrs Rendell herself had brought these letters into the room , and consequently knew full well who were her daughter 's correspondents , and which envelope contained the separate effusions .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 114]: The dainty grey , with its edging of white , came from Lilias 's bosom friend , a certain Ella Duckworth , whose sayings and doings were so constantly quoted in the schoolroom that her very name had become the signal for groans of disapproval ; the fat white packet bore the magic name of the _ Bon Marche _ , Paris , and contained patterns of material for the frock in which Lilias intended to array herself at the garden parties of the coming season ; and the narrow envelope , with its bold , even writing , was a familiar object in the Rendell household , whose authorship required no explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 36]: Mrs Rendell handed this letter to her daughter with a smiling remembrance of the days when such letters used to come to herself -- of her eagerness and delight , her insatiable appetite for more .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 50]: As she added up her weekly bills and balanced her accounts , soft little trills of laughter greeted her ears from the other end of the room , and she smiled again in enjoyment of her child 's happiness , and lifted her head to regard the pretty picture .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 59]: The sun shone on Lilias 's fair head , transforming it into an aureole of gold ; pink and white were the colours of her morning dress , pink and white was her face , and the blossom on the hawthorn tree which shaded the window seemed made on purpose to form a background to the charming figure .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 47]: Mrs Rendell 's eyes softened with motherly pride ; but the next moment her brows contracted and her expression grew troubled , for there on the seat lay Ned Talbot 's letter unopened , while Lilias smiled and dimpled in enjoyment of her friend 's effusion .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 40]: It seemed strange that a girl should show so little eagerness to read a lover 's letter ; but Mrs Rendell reflected that perhaps Lilias preferred to leave the greater treat to the last , and comforted herself thereby .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 23]: When Ella 's letter had been read , then of course Ned 's would be even more eagerly devoured ; but no !
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 32]: Lilias regretfully folded away the sheet in its envelope , regarded the two unopened envelopes with languid indecision , and finally selected the packet from Paris as more worthy of attention .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 78]: If she had looked up at that _ moment _ and caught the flash in the watching eyes , Miss Lilias would have been on her guard ; but , as it was , she complacently settled herself to the study of patterns , holding up the little squares of gauze to the light , laying them against her dress , and pleating them in her fingers with an absorption which rendered her unconscious of her surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 44]: Five minutes passed , ten minutes , and still she turned from one novelty to another , unable to make a choice among so many temptations ; and still her mother watched from her corner , the pencil stayed in her busy hands .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 53]: The irritation had faded from Mrs Rendell 's face , and given place to an expression of anxious tenderness ; for Lilias 's indifference to Ned 's letter was but another strengthening of the growing conviction that the girl 's feeling for her lover fell short of what it should rightly be .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 38]: A dozen signs , too subtle to be put into words , but none the less eloquent , had attracted Mrs Rendell 's attention within the last few weeks , and sent a chill to her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 53]: Above all things it was imperative that Lilias should love her future husband with all the strength of which she was capable , for Lilias 's mother knew that no other power but love could develop a selfish nature , and make a noble woman out of a vain and thoughtless girl .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 63]: Love has wrought this miracle before , and will again ; and through all her grief for Maud 's disappointment , Mrs Rendell had comforted herself by the reflection that Lilias was the one of all her children who was most in need of a softening influence , the one to whom the love of a good man might be most valuable .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 34]: Dear , sweet Maud could not be selfish if she tried , but an early engagement might be the only means of saving Lilias from the injurious effect of flattering and worldly friends .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 30]: So the mother had reasoned with herself ; but her arguments would lose all their force if Lilias herself had no love in her heart for her future husband .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 32]: A loveless marriage is a catastrophe for any girl , but for Lilias it would mean moral suicide : a deliberate settling down into a selfish , self - seeking life !
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 31]: Was it possible that she had accepted Ned for no higher motive than a love of excitement , and the puny triumph of making the first marriage in the family ?
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 34]: Mrs Rendell would not judge the girl so harshly without unmistakable proof , but , her suspicions being aroused , she could not be content until she grasped the true position of affairs .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 35]: A broken engagement was the last thing which she desired to have in her family , but better that , a thousand times over , than that two lives should be wrecked for ever !
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 24]: She waited patiently until , at last , Lilias deigned to read her lover 's letter , watching her face with scrutinising eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 39]: It was evident that something in the closely-written sheet did not commend itself to the girl 's approval ; for as she read the white forehead grew fretted with lines , and the lips took a sullen droop .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 31]: The smiles faded away , and it was a very blank , dejected edition of Miss Lilias Rendell who looked up at last , to meet her mother 's glance .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 9]: `` Well , what is it , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 4]: You seem troubled .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 8]: No bad news , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 10]: `` Oh no -- nothing serious , at least .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 4]: Ned seems worried .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 17]: Things do n't go smoothly in the new Works , and he has such high-flown ideas .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 20]: It seems to me he makes troubles , by expecting every one else to be as quixotic as himself .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 14]: He is not likely to find high-flown notions among ordinary business men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 20]: `` And since when , my dear , have you become acquainted with the feelings of business men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 33]: inquired Mrs Rendell sharply ; then , in a softer tone , `` My dear child , I implore you not to begin your engagement to Ned by discouraging his highest motives .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 29]: Men , as a rule , are not overburdened with sentiment , and it is the duty of a wife to encourage all that is good and generous .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 22]: You would be grieved , I am sure , to feel that your influence had a sordid or worldly direction ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 6]: `` Oh , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 40]: protested Lilias , shocked beyond words at the possibility of such a charge , as we are all shocked when our secret thoughts are put into words , and we see them before us in all their naked hideousness .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 14]: `` Oh , mother , as if I could do anything so dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 55]: Ned says I am his good angel ; of course , of course , I want him to be good ; but it is depressing , is n't it , when as soon as one gets engaged business begins to go wrong , and every letter brings news of some fresh worry or unpleasantness ?
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 10]: It is enough to make one feel melancholy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 15]: `` Yes , dear , it is , and I 'm sorry for you .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 30]: It is a disappointment to us all to hear that Ned is so unhappy in his new position , for it seemed to promise so well six months ago .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 36]: Father is anxious to have a talk with him on the subject , and see if he can help to smooth the way , so the sooner he can come the better it will be .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 19]: Does he make any suggestion in his letter as to the date that will suit him best ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 4]: `` Y-es ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 10]: said Lilias ; and her face clouded once more .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 29]: `` He wants to come on the twentieth ; and it is so awkward , for the Duckworths want me to go to them for that very week .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 21]: They are having a tennis party , and their first day on the river , and several teas and dinners .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 8]: It would be such a delightful week !
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 14]: I thought , perhaps , Ned might put off his visit until June .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 24]: Maud would be home by that time , and they would both be sorry to miss each other if he came earlier . ''
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 44]: Mrs Rendell looked at her with a mingling of exasperation and relief -- relief that she should be so ignorant of Maud 's feelings , exasperation that it should be possible for one sister to be so oblivious to the sufferings of another .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 54]: She could not but realise also that Lilias would prefer a week of gaiety at Richmond to a visit from Ned Talbot ; and her distress at the thought made her voice sound somewhat sharp as she replied -- `` There is some one else to be considered besides yourself , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 24]: You forget that your father and I would prefer to see Ned at once , and would not approve of postponing his visit .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 43]: It is you , and not Maud , whom he comes to see ; and you would surely not choose to spend the time in frivolity which might be given to helping and comforting the man you have promised to marry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 12]: `` No -- no , of course not , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 14]: cried Lilias , shocked once more at the suggestion of her own selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 18]: `` I 'll write at once , and say that the twentieth will suit us all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 71]: She gathered her letters together as she spoke , and rose to leave the room , holding her head well in the air , and keeping up an appearance of composure so long as she was in her mother 's sight , but once outside the door the tears of disappointment rushed to her eyes , and she brought down her foot on the floor with a stamp of irritation .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 13]: She felt jarred and disappointed , and thoroughly ill-used into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 30]: Only two months engaged , and already involved in trouble and anxiety , and expected to give up her own pleasure in order to condole with a dejected lover !
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 41]: She had imagined that it would be Ned 's place to console her ; and if his fears should prove well founded , surely it would be she who needed consolation in the prospect of a long , uncertain engagement .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 35]: Lilias had known one or two girls who had waited year after year while their _ fiances _ struggled against adverse circumstances , and she was by no means anxious to follow their example .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 31]: They lost their beauty , and grew thin and pale ; people spoke of them with expressions of commiseration ; the subject of marriage was studiously avoided in their presence .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 18]: Lilias grew hot at the thought that any one might possibly regard her in such a fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 53]: When she had become engaged to Ned Talbot , the future had appeared _ couleur de rose _ , and she had sunned herself in the prospect of increased importance at home , and the honour which would be paid to the beautiful young bride by her husband 's friends and relatives .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 33]: How miserable , how humiliating , if all these dreams came to naught , and she found herself bound to an unsuccessful man , with all her ambitions nipped in the bud !
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 59]: Lilias 's thoughts roamed back over the past , and a dull resentment against her _ fiance _ grew in her mind ; for did it not seem that he had always been unlucky , that the brief space of prosperity that had preceded her engagement had been the exception , not the rule , in his experiences ?
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 48]: Old Mr Talbot had died while Ned was still at college , and the necessity of looking after the business for the benefit of the family had compelled the young fellow to sacrifice his own hopes of a profession , and settle down to a commercial life .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 20]: Mr Talbot had owned `` Works '' of some kind ; Lilias had the haziest idea of their purport .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 31]: Ned manufactured `` engines and things , '' she told her friends vaguely , and spent his days amidst clanking machinery , in an atmosphere impregnated with steam and oil .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 31]: A dozen years before , `` the Works '' had been a profitable concern , but it had steadily declined in value , as more powerful firms monopolised the trade .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 74]: Ned had struggled hard against the tide , but his term of management had been far from prosperous , and when , a year ago , his most formidable rival had come forward with an offer to take over the smaller firm , and instal him in the position of manager over the united businesses , he had been thankful to accept , and to believe that his anxieties were at an end .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 21]: Six months -- scarcely six months -- and already he was beginning to feel uneasy , to suspect trouble ahead !
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 14]: Lilias tightened her lips , and her eyes gave out an impatient flash .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 27]: It requires a noble nature to preserve unswerving confidence in a man through a period of reverse , and Lilias was not capable of the effort .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 43]: It seemed to her that such a want of success must surely be Ned 's own fault , and something startlingly like dislike sprang up in her heart , as she realised how closely she herself would be involved in his failure .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 56]: Her mother had declared that it was her duty to encourage Ned in his quixotic scruples ; but surely , surely , it was also Ned 's duty to consider her interests , and to be ready to sacrifice his scruples , if they threatened injury to the future which she had agreed to share !
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 50]: Lilias was as angry as it was in her nature to be , but her love of approval made her unwilling to exhibit herself in so unamiable a mood , and she rushed upstairs to the porch room to recover her composure before joining her sisters in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 59]: The worst of belonging to a large family , however , is that it is exceedingly difficult to secure privacy , and , as fate would have it , who should be seated in the porch room but Nan herself , the very last member of the household whom Lilias would have wished to meet in the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 52]: Her flushed face and tearful eyes could not escape attention , but while Maud would have been tactfully silent , Elsie sympathetic , Agatha gushing , and Christabel apparently unconscious , Nan must needs stare with all her eyes , whistle like a schoolboy , and exclaim inelegantly -- `` Halloa !
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 4]: What 's up ?
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 13]: What in the world are you in a rage about now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 6]: `` Now , '' indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 18]: As if she were in the habit of flying into rages every ten minutes of the day !
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 17]: As if it were not universally acknowledged that she had the sweetest temper in the family !
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 30]: Lilias felt more irritated than ever , and would have enjoyed nothing so much as taking the big blundering creature by the shoulders and giving her a good shaking .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 24]: She controlled herself , however , and answered with a gallant attempt at pathos -- `` Rage is hardly the word , Nan .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 7]: I am very , very miserable .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 16]: You do n't understand , and I am not at liberty to explain the reason .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 9]: I am in trouble -- horrible trouble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 4]: quoth Nan sceptically .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 12]: `` Does n't seem to have a chastening effect upon you .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 9]: It affects us all differently , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 18]: I should have said you were in a savage rage , if you 'd asked me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 21]: `` But I did n't ask you , you see , and it is very wrong of you to judge .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 23]: If I could tell you the truth , you would realise your mistake , but I must keep my own counsel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 7]: `` Of course , of course !
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 39]: Do n't tell me , I beseech you ; I ca n't keep a secret if I 'm paid for it , '' said Nan calmly , and with an absence of curiosity altogether maddening to the listener .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 27]: There was nothing Lilias wanted more than to be coaxed to tell her trouble and pose as a suffering martyr , for her sister 's benefit .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 23]: She flounced out of the room in high dudgeon , and Nan stopped her work and looked after her with thoughtful eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 21]: `` This is the beginning , '' she said tragically to herself -- `` the beginning of the end ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 4]: NED IN TROUBLE .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 20]: When Ned Talbot arrived a fortnight later , his face showed that his anxiety had been no imaginary thing .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 30]: He looked , indeed , so worn and aged , that his friends were shocked to see him , and tears of commiseration rose in Lilias 's pretty eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 34]: The consciousness that Ned looked to her for consolation roused a natural womanly tenderness in her heart , and nothing could have been sweeter than her behaviour on the day of his arrival .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 56]: As for Ned himself , fresh from the grim northern town , with the everlasting clang of machinery sounding in his ears , it seemed a very foretaste of paradise to find himself in the fragrant southern garden , seated beneath the shade of the trees , with Lilias 's lovely face smiling upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 36]: He told her as much in lover-like fashion , and she protested modestly , and smiled more angelically than ever for the rest of the evening , in order to live up to her reputation .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 10]: `` We wo n't talk about disagreeable things to-night !
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 7]: We will just be happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 28]: she said coaxingly ; and Ned assented , only too thankful to banish anxiety for a few hours , and to talk sweet nothings among the flowers .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 37]: Lilias was the most delightful plaything in the world , and queened it over him with such amusing little airs of sovereignty , that he asked nothing better than to play the part of adoring slave .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 21]: So the first evening passed happily enough ; but the next day brought the lovers face to face with reality .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 64]: When a great anxiety is tugging at a man 's heart , it is not possible to banish it for more than a few hours at a time , and Ned yearned for his sweetheart 's sympathy , and felt a corresponding chilling of heart when she persistently checked his confidences , and tried to continue the playful banter of the first interview .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 35]: He could not respond , could not laugh and jest and pay compliments ; the cloud of coming disaster seemed to blot out the sunshine , and the light words jarred upon his ears .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 27]: `` It is no use , dear ; I am sorry to be such a doleful companion , but I can not pretend to be cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 26]: You must bear with me , for my anxiety is on your account even more than my own , '' he told the girl tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 60]: `` I can not bear to think of bringing anxiety upon you , when I had hoped instead to have shielded you from it all your life ; but trouble is said to draw hearts more closely together , and if we stand shoulder to shoulder now we may find unexpected sweetness in the midst of our trial . ''
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 14]: He looked at Lilias entreatingly , and she gave a forced little smile .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 14]: `` I should like to know exactly what the trial is , Ned .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 18]: You have said a good deal about being unhappy in your letters , but nothing really definite .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 42]: I can understand that , after being your own master , it is trying to accept a subordinate position , and that many little things jar and fret you , just because it is a new thing to be under subjection .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 29]: It is certain to be trying at first , but if you have patience -- '' Ned stopped her with an exclamation , half amused , half irritated .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 5]: `` Patience -- patience !
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 14]: My dear girl , you do n't understand of what you are talking !
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 17]: You surely do n't imagine that it is about my own dignity that I am anxious !
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 25]: I should not allow any personal slight to disturb my equanimity , for I did not make this change without counting the cost . ''
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 13]: `` But it is so different when it comes to the test .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 17]: However brave you have resolved to be , you can not help being annoyed and fretted .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 3]: I know !
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 26]: Oh , I know quite well , '' declared Lilias , with an elaborate forbearance which seemed to have an irritating effect upon the hearer .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 27]: He drew in his lips , as if struggling against a hasty reply , and when he spoke it was in a tone of studied moderation .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 15]: `` Come and sit down , dear , and let me thrash this out !
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 21]: It is your right to know exactly how matters stand , and I will try to explain them to you .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 17]: What affects me affects you now , so I look to you to advise and counsel .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 38]: No one can help me as you can ; no one has so much right to speak ; so let me begin at the beginning , and try to make all clear to your dear little mind .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 36]: You know that at my father 's death I had to give up my own dream of going into a profession , in order to carry on the Works for the benefit of the family .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 34]: It had been decided that Frank , the second boy , should take this place , but he was still a youngster , and could not then have taken so responsible a post .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 41]: It was a blow to me , for it was anything but the sphere which I should have chosen , and it was hard to have to give up all my own dreams -- '' `` It must have been !
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 12]: I can sympathise with you , for I know the feeling .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 31]: Nothing tries me more than to have my plans upset , and it is constantly happening in a house like this , where there are so many others to consider .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 36]: And it must have been bad for the business too , for you knew nothing about it , and had no experience -- '' Ned coloured , and made an uneasy movement with his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 41]: As a matter of fact , his early days of authority had been accompanied by mistakes which he had been glad to forget , though he had mastered the details of the business in a surprisingly short space of time .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 46]: It was not pleasant to hear a reminder of his inexperience from the lips of his _ fiancee _ , and he could not stifle a reflection that it would have been kinder on her part to have spared him even so covert a reproach .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 39]: He tried to hide all signs of annoyance , but there was an edge in his voice as he replied -- `` I was inexperienced , no doubt , though perhaps not so much so as you imagine .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 55]: All my life I had been accustomed to spend a great deal of time at the Works , and as I grew up my father had taken me into his confidence about his growing anxieties , for even in his days he was beginning to feel the strain of competing with the bigger firms .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 38]: The day for small men is over , Lilias , and one by one the private manufacturers go under , ruined by the struggle to compete with the great firms who are backed by practically unlimited capital .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 65]: It was a dying cause which I had to fight , and I became more and more convinced of the folly of holding on until everything was lost ; and then , in the very nick of time , as it seemed , our most powerful rivals stepped forward and offered to take over our business and to give me the post of manager .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 39]: There could be no doubt about accepting such an offer , and all my friends rejoiced with me in the belief that the lean days were over , and that a long lease of prosperity lay ahead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 20]: `` But why did they make you such an offer when your business was so bad as you say ?
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 19]: I can understand that it was a capital thing for you , but where did they come in ?
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 46]: They must have had an idea that it was for their advantage as well as for yours , or they would not have tried to get you , '' said Lilias , with a shrewdness that brought the smiles back to her lover 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 10]: `` Why , what a cute little woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 4]: he cried fondly .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 8]: `` She grasps the position at once !
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 63]: Yes , of course , they made the offer for their own advantage , not mine , for , you see , dear , there were a certain number of good old-fashioned customers who still kept to us , and their business was well worth having , though not valuable enough to make our Works pay when the smaller orders dropped off .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 24]: By taking over our connection they made a considerable addition to their profits , even allowing for the handsome salary given to me .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 32]: Looking at the offer from a business point of view , I saw no reason to doubt its good faith , but six months ' experience has raised some ugly doubts .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 15]: More than once of late I have felt convinced -- '' `` Of what ?
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 5]: What are your doubts ?
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 10]: What do you believe they mean to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 22]: Ned jumped to his feet , and stood facing the girl , with clenched hands and a face convulsed with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 12]: His eyes flashed , the veins stood out upon his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 46]: `` I believe that they mean to suck my brains , -- to get all they can out of me , -- experience , introductions , connections , to suck me dry as they would an orange , and then throw me on one side !
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 54]: I believe that the salary was a bait to bribe me to give up my independence , and that it did not matter to them that it was unusually large , since at the very moment of offering it they had determined that my lease of office should be of precious short duration .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 67]: They can not , for shame 's sake , for their own reputation 's sake , dismiss me already , but in a hundred ways they are bringing pressure to bear ; in a hundred ways which you could not understand , they are making it impossible for me to go on , -- forcing me into resignation -- '' `` Oh , hush , hush !
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 5]: Do n't get excited .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 9]: You frighten me when you are so fierce .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 7]: I am sure you are mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 18]: You are worn out after all these years of anxiety , and imagine what is not true .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 33]: I am sure they do not want to get rid of you ; and if they did , what does it matter , since you say yourself they dare not dismiss you ?
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 22]: Come , be a good boy , and be happy with me , and forget all about this horrid old business .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 17]: All men have worries , but they should try to forget them when they come home !
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 22]: I give you full notice that I shall forbid business to be mentioned in our house when we get one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 29]: The glance which accompanied these words was meant to be irresistibly coaxing ; but , so far from being sobered yet , Ned seemed goaded into fresh irritation .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 3]: `` Worries !
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 2]: Worries !
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 31]: You call it by a contemptible little name like that , when I am face to face with ruin , -- when our whole future is trembling in the balance ?
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 33]: Do n't you understand that there are things that a man may not do , and that orders may be put upon him which he can not obey and preserve his self-respect ?
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 30]: He may be forced to resign even when he would gladly work his fingers to the bone , if by any fair means he could keep his post ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 4]: `` Ah-ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 30]: cried Lilias , with a deep , indrawn breath , as if now , at last , she had come to the real pivot on which the question hung .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 49]: `` Ah , yes , Ned , I understand that if you once get the idea in that romantic head of yours that you are being coerced to do what is not according to your lights , there is an end of all peace until you are undeceived !
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 19]: We have known you so long , remember , and heard all about your college days from Jim .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 20]: ` Don Quixote , ' they called you , because you were always taking up high-flown notions of duty .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 31]: It was delightful at Oxford , and such a good example to the other men ; but in business -- you ca n't keep it up in business , Ned !
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 21]: I am only a girl , but I hear people talk , and I know quite well how it is .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 30]: It is impossible to make a living at all , if you are too particular what you do , and are always stopping to consider other people besides yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 41]: You say that you were beaten by the other firms when you were managing your father 's Works , and now you will let yourself be beaten again , if you give way to these foolish prejudices and scruples . ''
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 17]: Lilias finished with a breathless gasp , and Ned stood looking down at her in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 36]: An expression of absolute horror had grown in his eyes as he listened to her words , and now he threw himself down on the chair beside her , and grasped her hands in appeal .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 3]: `` Lilias !
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 2]: Lilias !
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 4]: -- do n't !
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 8]: Do n't speak like that , darling !
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 12]: My little white girl , do n't turn pleader against me !
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 30]: You are to be my helpmeet , my good angel , the inspiration of my life ; do n't begin by wishing me to do less than my best !
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 39]: I am not imagining difficulties -- you know I am not -- but even if I were , would it not be better to lose something for conscience ' sake , than deliberately to sell myself for gain ?
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 14]: I am in great perplexity , Lilias , and need all my courage .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 9]: I beseech you not to discourage me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 37]: His words were , in effect , a repetition of Mrs Rendell 's on the same subject , and now , as then , Lilias was shocked into a softer , more unselfish frame of mind .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 15]: The ready tears started to her eyes , and her voice quivered with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 11]: `` Indeed , indeed , I long to help you !
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 9]: I would not hinder you for the world .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 24]: I was trying to reconcile you to your position -- to save you , if possible , from worse trouble in the future .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 26]: I know you will never consent to do what is wrong , but if you are firm and patient , all may still be well .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 21]: It is worth trying , at least , for if you threw up this post what is to happen next ?
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 8]: You would have nothing to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 14]: `` I could always earn a salary of a few hundreds a year .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 30]: If they have done nothing else , these last years have given me a thorough technical knowledge of my own business , and that has a marketable value nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 29]: With the influence of the old name to back me up , I could find some firm ready to take me in and give me a subordinate post .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 45]: If I had only myself to think of , I should not worry my head , for I have never had any ambition to be a rich man ; and the mater has her private income -- I need not be anxious about her .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 16]: The change would fall heaviest on you , and it is of you I think .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 25]: I meant to give you a home worthy of yourself , with every luxury and comfort , but that may not be possible now .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 16]: Can you forgive me , dear , for bringing all this trouble upon you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 21]: He looked wistfully into the lovely face , and Lilias pressed her lips together , staring fixedly at the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 27]: At that moment she could not bring herself to say that she forgave him , or to express any complaisance at the thought of the future .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 32]: Imagination ran riot , and she saw as in a picture a little house in a smoky manufacturing town , and shrank with distaste from its narrow walls and meagre furnishings .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 4]: Yes , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 22]: Ned might well declare that she was the greatest sufferer , and it was only right that he should pity her .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 43]: If this breakdown had happened three months before , her parents would not have consented to her engagement , and it should have been his duty to be well assured of his position before involving another , as she was now involved .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 21]: The swelling of resentment grew so strong , that , against her better judgment , it forced itself into speech .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 7]: `` You seem fated to misfortune !
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 7]: It follows you wherever you go .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 14]: But this can not all have sprung up within the last two months .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 22]: You must have known something about it in March , -- in April , -- before you spoke to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 30]: From the flash in Ned 's eyes she feared that he was about to make some hot reply , but he checked himself , and answered with gentle forbearance .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 37]: Only , if she had had eyes to see it , the shadow had fallen deeper than ever over his face , and his shoulders bent , as if an additional burden had fallen upon them .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 9]: `` No , Lilias , I knew nothing !
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 18]: I would never have proposed to you if I had not honestly believed in my good prospects .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 25]: The difficulty has arisen since then ; but do n't be afraid , I shall not urge you to any sacrifices on my behalf .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 20]: I will work hard , and you shall stay at home until I can give you all you desire .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 16]: I will not ask you to share a poverty which you dread so much . ''
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 9]: `` I would n't mind it for myself .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 8]: It is of you I think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 4]: murmured Lilias sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 30]: `` I should love nothing so much as to help you , Ned , but I am such a useless little thing that I should only be a drag .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 12]: If it had been Maud , it would have been different .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 39]: Maud is cut out for a poor man 's wife , and would be blissfully happy living on twopence-halfpenny a week , and making it go as far as half a crown , but I am so stupid .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 21]: My money seems to fly away , and I could not be economical if my life depended on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 13]: Ned sighed , and looked round the garden with a wistful air .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 9]: `` I wish Maud were at home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 9]: `` She is always so good and helpful .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 12]: It puts new strength in a man to hear her talk .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 13]: The house does not seem like itself when Maud is away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 3]: GERVASE VANBURGH .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 22]: remarked Miss Nan to herself the next afternoon , as she watched the lovers pacing the garden walk , `` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 15]: unless my eyes deceive me , relationships are strained between our dear young friends .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 25]: The atmosphere seems charged with -- not electricity , but an amount of ice which is suitable neither to the season nor the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 12]: Strikes me , I 'd better be out of the way !
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 31]: I 'll do an act of charity to another and a good turn to myself at one and the same time , and go and have tea with Diogenes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 76]: She spoke with a certainty of welcome , justified by the delight with which Mr Vanburgh invariably greeted her appearance , for she had discovered that nothing pleased him so much as to see her running in and out of the house , popping in for ten minutes ' chat on her return from a walk , or livening a dull afternoon by taking her work across the road , and stitching by his couch .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 49]: This latter attention had also brought about the happy results of interesting the invalid in the coming sale , and more than one of Nan 's efforts was bought before it was completed , thereby affording that young lady a terrible temptation to scamp the work which remained .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 39]: On the present occasion , however , she was in a lazy mood , and frowned sternly on her conscience , when it suggested that she should make use of the opportunity to finish a certain table centre .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 15]: No , indeed , she decided , she would do nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 36]: Unwilling work was invariably a failure , and she felt no vocation to do anything more energetic than sit still and eat Mr Vanburgh 's delicious cakes , and drink Mr Vanburgh 's excellent tea .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 59]: She stood up then , and , as a preliminary step , regarded herself critically in the mirror , for among other things which had been borne in upon her concerning her new neighbour , one was that he was exceedingly fastidious about appearances , and as sharp as a needle to discover any discrepancies in her attire .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 53]: He was too polite to put his criticisms into words , but his face spoke volumes , and certain historic occasions , when she had sat smarting beneath the consciousness of a missing button or a crooked tie , had made a lasting impression on the mind of the careless young woman .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 23]: Nowadays , however fleeting might be her visit to the Grange , she never went without a careful examination of her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 70]: A shop window answered the purpose of a mirror , if nothing better could be found , and one morning , as Agatha and Christabel walked along the village street , they had been reduced to a state of speechless amazement by discovering Nan twisting and turning before the wired windows of the Bank , with as much concern for her appearance as though she had been Lilias herself .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 29]: On the present occasion there were only a few stray locks to be pinned in order , and then the glass reflected a charming picture of happy girlhood .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 31]: The pique skirt was fresh and neat ; the pink shirt belted in by a natty white band , and the dark hair curled softly round the fresh bright face .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 68]: Nan stared at herself solemnly , contorting her face into the curious , strained expression with which nine women out of ten regard themselves in a mirror , twisted round , to be sure that her belt showed no unsightly gap , pulled her tie accurately into the middle of her collar , and finally fastened on a sailor hat , and ran gaily across the street .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 54]: She did not go to the front door this time , for -- unique and extraordinary sign of favour -- to her , and to her alone , had been granted permission to use the garden gate , enter the house by the side door , and so make her way upstairs unannounced .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 42]: Mr Vanburgh had been anxious to put every facility in his favourite 's way , for only an invalid can appreciate the brightness which had come into his life since this merry - hearted girl had taken compassion upon his loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 40]: To see her bonnie face peering in at the door , to hear her ringing laugh , and listen to her voice , was better than any tonic , and seemed to put fresh strength into his feeble body .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 22]: Up the stairs , then , Nan ran , and made straight for the study where the invalid spent his afternoons .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 54]: The door was closed , but to wait to announce her arrival by a knock was a proceeding far too dignified for one of her impetuous nature ; she merely turned the handle , thrust a mischievous face round the corner , and announced boldly , `` I 've come to tea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 38]: There was no answering exclamation of delight , and Nan had just discovered , with a gasp of surprise , that the couch was empty , when a tall , fair-haired man rose suddenly and confronted her .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 13]: `` Oh , '' cried Nan , and stood agape with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 52]: `` I beg your pardon , '' drawled the stranger , and stared back out of a pair of handsome , sleepy eyes , `` You -- er -- you expected to see Mr Vanburgh ; I am sorry to say he is not very well -- '' `` Not well ?
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 7]: Oh dear , I 'm sorry !
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 6]: And are you the doctor ?
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 8]: -- Have you come from town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 5]: `` Oh no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 21]: The tall man smiled , as if , for some reason , the idea seemed quite preposterous to his mind .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 7]: `` I am not the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 7]: I am Mr Vanburgh 's nephew .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 38]: I was coming to visit him shortly in any case , and as I heard that he was not well , I thought it better to come down and see for myself exactly how he was . ''
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 29]: I am so vexed that I did not know about it , but I have been so busy this week that I have not seen him since Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 5]: He is really ill ?
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 3]: In bed ?
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 7]: Not able to get up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 40]: `` He has kept in bed for two days , but is coming in presently to join me at tea , so I hope that you -- er -- you will fulfil the intention with which you came ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 17]: and the speaker smiled at the pretty girl with a sudden lighting of the sleepy eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 23]: He was thinking to himself what a marvellous difference her coming had made in the aspect of the dim , solemn room .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 34]: All day long he had roamed about the house and grounds with the eerie feeling of being alone in an enchanted castle , where a spell of sleep was laid on the occupants .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 44]: Wherever the eye lighted , some rare and costly treasure greeted the sight ; the great rooms opened one into the other , while rare Venetian mirrors reduplicated the tapestries on the walls and seemed to open out fresh vistas before the eye .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 28]: It was a palace among houses , a very storehouse of treasures , but the want of life chilled the blood in the young man 's veins .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 31]: Not a human soul to be seen but the silent-footed servant with his foreign tongue , and the crippled master , dead already to all that makes life worth living !
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 55]: All day long he had been alone , struggling with a depression which seemed to close more and more heavily around him ; but here , at last , was a creature like himself , young , radiant , full of life , with the glow of health and happiness on her rosy cheek .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 24]: His glance was so undisguisedly friendly that Nan responded to it with a smile , and seated herself forthwith on her accustomed chair .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 36]: Shyness not being a complaint by which she was troubled , she saw no reason for refusing the stranger 's invitation , or for disguising the keen interest which she took in his own individuality .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 15]: `` Thank you ; I 'd like to stay , '' she said frankly .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 16]: `` I am so pleased to meet you , for I know all about you .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 34]: ` Gervase Farrington Vanburgh ' , '' -- she checked off each word on uplifted fingers , and nodded her head with an air of triumph at the completeness of her information . ''
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 9]: ` The Boundaries , Lipton , Devonshire . '
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 17]: I have posted ever so many notes to you , and once I addressed an envelope .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 14]: Perhaps you remember my scrawly writing , with long tails to the letters ?
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 40]: We were dreadfully disappointed that Mr Vanburgh had no daughters , for we have not many friends of our own age , but he tried to console us by saying that you were coming to pay him a visit .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 32]: I asked him especially to arrange it for June , for we shall have our brother home then , and several things going on which will make it livelier than usual .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 12]: We have made all sorts of plans for your amusement ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 11]: `` That is kind ; I appreciate it very much .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 19]: I have heard of you too , and of the pleasure which your acquaintance has given my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 25]: He was giving me an account of you all last night , from which I have no difficulty in recognising you from your sisters .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 6]: You are Miss Lilias ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 3]: `` Lilias !
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 3]: -- I !
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 3]: Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 7]: Whatever made you think that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 38]: gasped Nan , staring at him with eyes so clear and honest , that , though an adept in the gentle art of flattery , Gervase Vanburgh found himself incapable of explaining the reason of his mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 39]: He could not tell Nan Rendell that , after hearing Lilias described as the beauty of the family , he had at once identified her with the charming figure whose presence had brought sunshine into the gloomy house .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 20]: He murmured some vague excuse , while Nan proceeded to expatiate on the difference between herself and her sister .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 25]: `` Lilias is fair , and I am dark ; she has golden hair , and is quite grown up and staid and proper .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 43]: I am supposed to be grown up too , in the afternoons and in the evenings , but the mornings are my own , and then I am disgracefully young , and behave as badly as if I were a child again .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 5]: I wish I were !
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 17]: I shall never be so happy again as I was in the dear old school-days . ''
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 46]: Nan 's eyes roamed wistfully across the road to the porch room , where Elsie 's sleek head could be seen bent over her work , with Agatha and Christabel vaguely outlined at the table ; then suddenly her face lit up with mischievous smiles .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 9]: `` If they could only see me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 5]: she told herself ecstatically .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 16]: `` If the girls could see me sitting here talking to this strange young man !
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 6]: They 'd have a fit !
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 7]: They 'd go crazy with excitement !
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 18]: I must , I must lure him to the window , and let them see us together !
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 10]: They will never believe me unless I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 21]: She looked up , to meet Gervase 's eyes fixed upon her , and found inspiration in his first remark .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 13]: `` You are looking at your own house , are you not ?
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 9]: It is exactly opposite this , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 11]: My uncle pointed it out to me last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 6]: `` Yes , just opposite .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 19]: It stands on the road , as this one does , but we have a lovely garden behind .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 12]: You can see a little bit of it from here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 32]: and wily Nan led the way to the window , secure of bringing Gervase in her train , and keeping him in evidence until it pleased her to finish her explanations .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 29]: The appearance of her own light dress was sufficient to attract Elsie 's attention ; but what of the agitation of the three at sight of her companion ?
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 54]: Elsie fled into the background -- `` The better to see you , my dear , '' -- and Nan 's keen eyes could discern the three patches of white made by the gaping faces , the while she smiled and posed , far more for their benefit than that of her companion .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 53]: Presently Elsie disappeared , and Nan knew as well as if she had heard the words spoken , that the object of her flight had been to bring the opera-glasses from the drawing-room , when the three would take turns to stare at the stranger , and speculate as to his identity .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 36]: In the first mischievous enjoyment of the moment she found it impossible to face her companion , but when at last she did venture to meet his glance she was vastly impressed by his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 20]: A superfine specimen indeed , this Gervase Vanburgh , with his frock-coat , well-creased trousers , and immaculate linen .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 42]: Even Nan , the unnoticing , noted the faultlessness of detail which characterised his attire , and had an instant perception that Ned Talbot would look rough and countrified by his side , and even Jim himself suffer from the contrast .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 40]: Evidently this was a dandy of the first water ; yet , despite his languid bearing , his face was full of intelligence , and decision of character was proclaimed in the large nose and square , clean-cut chin .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 10]: `` What a mercy I tidied my hair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 40]: sighed Nan to herself ; and at that moment the door opened , and in came the Italian servant , pushing his master before him in the wheeled chair in which he was moved from one room to another .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 35]: The invalid was looking more death-like than ever , but his face lighted with pleasure at the sight of Nan , while she ran to the sofa and arranged his cushions with loving solicitude .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 39]: When he was settled she knelt beside him to exchange greetings , putting her hand on his with a caressing gesture , and he held it firmly while he replied , as if gaining strength from the contact .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 41]: Gervase Vanburgh thought he had never seen so typical a picture of youth and age as that made by his uncle and the bright-faced girl , and mentally contrasted this welcome with the one given to himself the day before .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 46]: His uncle had never shown such pleasure on his arrival ; but he felt no jealousy of the girl who was so evidently preferred before himself ; for , whatever his faults might be , he was free at least from any tinge of self-seeking .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 18]: The lazy smile lingered on his face as he listened to the exchange of question and answer .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 10]: `` This is a pleasant surprise , little woman !
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 6]: When did you come across ?
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 9]: I did not hear of your arrival . ''
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 21]: `` Bounced in ten minutes ago , and had such a fright to find a stranger here instead of you .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 16]: Why did n't you send at once to tell me that you were worse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 13]: `` Because I could not have seen you if you had come .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 25]: On my bad days I am best alone ; but I am pulling round again , and am glad to have Gervase 's company .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 11]: You have made each other 's acquaintance , I see !
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 15]: I suppose neither had much difficulty in guessing the identity of the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 8]: `` He thought I was Lilias ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 10]: said Nan , glancing at Gervase with laughing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 5]: `` Think of that !
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 13]: He will be surprised when he sees her , wo n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 10]: But I knew who he was in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 13]: Now , tell me honestly , would you rather I went away ?
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 31]: I came meaning to stay to tea , but if you do n't feel able to talk to two people at once I 'll come again when you are alone .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 9]: I wo n't be a scrap offended ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 4]: Mr Vanburgh smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 18]: `` I am sure you would not , but I should like you to stay , please .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 30]: We want you to pour out tea for us ; and I wo n't attempt to talk , but just lie still and amuse myself listening to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 16]: `` But I never can be amusing when I try , -- can you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 11]: said Nan , appealing to Gervase with a friendly smile .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 37]: `` The girls at home think I am amusing , because I generally say the wrong thing at the wrong moment , which may be entertaining to them , but is very poor fun for me .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 15]: Maud says I speak first and think afterwards ; but what can I do ?
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 30]: I once made a vow to cure myself of being impetuous by counting twenty slowly before I began to speak , and I kept it religiously two whole days .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 43]: They seemed like a month ; and if I had persevered I should have become dumb , for by the time I had counted twenty the conversation had hopped on to another subject , and any remark was hopelessly out of date !
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 22]: So now I have gone back to my old ways , and say my say , and take the consequences . ''
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 37]: `` You do n't look to me as if you were given to making painful remarks , '' Gervase remarked in a conciliatory tone , and Nan straightened her back in defence of her own behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 7]: `` Would n't hurt a fly !
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 8]: That 's the worst part of it .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 62]: For I am so soft - hearted over other people 's woes , that I shed tears regularly every time I meet a tramp , and he tells me that he is a discharged seaman who has lost his certificate , and only needs four and sixpence to take him to a port where he is certain to find fresh work .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 26]: They always have lost their certificates and want a railway fare , but I ca n't help relieving them and handing-over last Saturday 's money .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 30]: But a tender heart is not much use if you make awkward remarks and quote people 's own doings to their faces , as capital jokes against somebody else !
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 37]: I got into terrible trouble in that way with a caller only the other day , and if I had had any sense I should have stopped in time , for I had plenty of warning .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 26]: Her face grew all stiff and rigid , and I wondered what in the world had given Elsie such a cough all of a sudden .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 25]: Is there any cure , do you think , for a habit like this -- anything I could do to make myself careful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 30]: There was a pause while the two men looked at the eager face , smiled , and grew sober , as the question awoke memories from their own past .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 30]: `` A practical kindness of heart , Nan , which is not satisfied with facile tears and offerings , but takes continual thought of the feelings of others ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 7]: `` Or a severe lesson ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 6]: added the younger man thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 25]: `` If you wounded some one very near and dear , and saw them suffer through your thoughtlessness , you could never forget it .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 39]: I learnt that for myself long ago , when -- '' But Nan heard no more of what he said , for , with a flash , her eager mind had leapt to the solution of the mystery .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 3]: More love !
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 6]: That was what was needed .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 9]: Love , the cure for every human fault .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 15]: She applied the test to her own experience , and found it abundantly proven .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 22]: Had any word or deed of hers hurt Maud through the period of ultra-sensitiveness through which that dear sister had passed ?
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 6]: Ten thousand times , no !
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 30]: On the contrary , she had been quick to ward off blows , to turn dangerous conversations into new channels , to stand between the sufferer and the world .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 32]: Where she loved it was obvious that she could show both care and tact ; it was want of love which lay at the root of her thoughtless acts and speeches .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 40]: Gervase looked up at the conclusion of his story , to find the girl staring blankly across the room , with a glimmer of tears in the brown eyes , and was at a loss to guess the meaning .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 16]: `` I 'll begin this instant , and love every one in this world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 7]: Nan was saying to herself determinedly .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 13]: `` It will be fatiguing , but so good for my character .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 25]: I 'll think of what they will like , and what I can do for them , and spend my time in good works .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 10]: What can I do now for these two men ?
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 38]: It 's no credit pouring out tea , for I want some myself ; but I might do something for that poor Gervase to-night , when Mr Vanburgh goes to bed , and he is left alone .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 31]: He looked dolefully dull when I came in , and I believe he would enjoy coming across and seeing us all , as he has heard so much about us .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 13]: I 'll ask him anyway , and see what he says . ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 47]: The idea was so pleasant that the dimples came back to greet it ; she looked across at Gervase with a brilliant smile , and struck amazement to his heart by inquiring blandly -- `` Would you like to come to dinner with us tonight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 15]: Gervase Vanburgh stared , as well he might , at so informal an invitation .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 55]: His uncle also struggled with a smile , and Nan , tardily conscious of her lack of formality , plunged headlong into explanations -- `` I meant to say that it will be lonely for you after Mr Vanburgh goes to bed , and I am sure mother would be delighted to see you .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 31]: We have Ned Talbot , a friend of Lil -- of my brother Jim staying with us , so that there would be two other men to keep you company .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 53]: When father and Jim are away , we never ask gentlemen to the house , for mother says seven women at one time are too great a tax on any man 's nervous system ; but you would n't be afraid of us when there were two other men , would you ?
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 19]: The schoolroom girls do n't come down until after dinner , so we are really only three . ''
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 33]: Gervase Vanburgh laughed aloud , and Nan looked up with a quick flash of approval , for a laugh has a tell-tale sound , and this one rang unmistakably honest and true .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 14]: `` I am not in the least afraid , '' he cried boldly .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 12]: `` I 'd like to see you all , school-girls included .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 30]: It is most kind of you to think of it , and if Mrs Rendell will really allow me , I shall be delighted to accept your invitation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 41]: So Nan ran across the street , and entered the house with the great news that Gervase Vanburgh had arrived , and -- given a formal invitation -- was coming that very evening to make the acquaintance of the family .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 4]: AMONG THE ROSES .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 42]: By no one was the news of Gervase Vanburgh 's advent greeted with more enthusiasm than by Lilias herself , for , truth to tell , the day had seemed interminably long in the company of a depressed and anxious lover .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 46]: The points of view from which Ned and herself regarded his position seemed to grow more hopelessly far apart the more it was discussed , and the consciousness that he was disappointed by her lack of sympathy did not tend to raise Lilias 's spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 47]: If the question at stake had not touched the all-important subject of future comfort , she would have been willing to sacrifice her own wishes in order to preserve Ned 's approval , but in this crisis of their fate she would allow no such weakness .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 78]: If her own parents seemed to place Ned 's scruples before her interests , if Ned himself were so ignorant of what was due to his _ fiancee _ as to talk calmly of accepting the position of a clerk on a few hundreds a year , it behoved her to be firm , and make Ned understand that she would never be his wife until he could provide something more than the bare necessaries of life .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 28]: Nevertheless , the task of opposition was far from pleasant , and the grave wonder of his glance cut like a knife into her vain little heart .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 39]: It was a relief to know that the presence of a stranger would prevent further reference to the subject for this evening at least , while the Vanburgh nephew and heir was in himself a sufficiently interesting person .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 55]: Lilias put on her prettiest dress , and sat trifling with a book until the company had assembled in the drawing-room , and the time was ripe for an effective entrance , when she glided into the room , and smiled sweetly at the stranger , while Nan watched his face with mischievous enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 11]: He was surprised -- there was no mistake about that !
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 29]: When Lilias raised her face to his , he gave a distinct little start of surprise , and the sleepy eyes looked for once quite wide-awake and animated .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 12]: `` And the stupid fellow actually mistook me for her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 36]: chuckled Nan to herself , with that pride in her sister 's beauty which the Rendell girls shared so loyally , looking upon it as a family possession which reflected credit on one and all .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 22]: `` That 's one mistake he will never make again , however much confused he may get among six sisters ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 62]: Conversation at the dinner table was of a general character ; but every now and then Nan found an opportunity of exchanging a few quiet remarks with Gervase Vanburgh , who sat next herself , the result of which was to assure her that she had found a character as diametrically different from her own as it was possible to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 39]: She was full of energy , he was languid to the verge of apathy ; she had hard and fast opinions to offer on every topic , known or unknown , while his `` Do n't know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 7]: and `` Could n't say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 6]: repeated themselves with wearisome echo .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 65]: She was afire with ardour , with enthusiasm , with the burning desire to right all wrongs , redress all evils , bring peace on earth , and start the millennium without a moment 's delay ; judging from appearances , he seemed incapable of any sort of emotion , and possessed with the conviction that nothing was really worth taking any trouble about .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 50]: Nan grew irritated beyond measure , wriggled about on her seat , shrugged her shoulders , and crumbled her bread , unconscious alike of her father 's smiles and her mother 's frowns , and , when actions failed to relieve her feelings , was forced into emphatic speech .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 10]: `` Nothing interests you , nothing gives you pleasure !
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 10]: You care for nothing , you hope for nothing !
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 13]: I would n't be like you for the whole wide world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 38]: she declared ; and Gervase Vanburgh fixed his melancholy eyes upon her , and said tragically -- `` And I would give the whole wide world if I could once more care and hope like you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 4]: This was disconcerting .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 35]: Nan had not expected so speedy a concession , and she followed her mother from the room oppressed by the remembrance of that melancholy look , and consumed with curiosity as to its cause .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 36]: Money anxiety it could not be , seeing that Mr Vanburgh 's heir need never fear want ; but a broken home , disappointed love , and faithless friendship held out wide avenues for speculation .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 30]: Nan sat and pondered , listening meekly to her mother 's reproofs , while inside the dining-room Mr Rendell could not resist putting a home question to his visitor .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 11]: `` You were amused by my little girl 's enthusiasm !
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 20]: I saw her growing hot and eager , and had a strong suspicion that you were leading her on !
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 23]: She is a most fervent young person , and can not understand being less than in deadly earnest over any question . ''
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 9]: `` She is er -- refreshingly young ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 9]: replied Gervase in his soft , drawling voice .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 35]: He took no notice of the charge made against himself , but went on peeling his fruit with an air of pensive exhaustion , at which the two elder men exchanged glances of amusement .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 40]: He looked at once so young , so healthy , and so prosperous , that this affectation of depression had somewhat of a ludicrous air to men who knew the world and had acquaintance with real and pressing anxieties .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 40]: Ned Talbot looked across the table at the handsome youngster , and heaved a sigh to the memory of the good old days when he also was happy enough to invent troubles , and philosophise darkly concerning unknown woes .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 52]: He had come south with a heart heavy with care , yet with an expectation of comfort which had taken away half the sting , but that hope had been doomed to disappointment , and on the morrow he must return to his work with an added fear in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 11]: Could it be that he had been mistaken in Lilias ?
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 42]: As a man eating a soft bloomy peach jars his teeth suddenly against its stone , so had Ned found himself confronted with a hardness in his _ fiancee 's _ nature which had brought with it a shock of disillusionment .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 59]: Surely , surely , if a girl were ever to be sweet and sympathetic to the man whom she had promised to marry , it was when he was threatened by misfortune ; but Lilias evidently refused to believe in his version of affairs , and cherished a grudging conviction that he was sacrificing her to romantic scruples .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 21]: He had talked , and pleaded , and reasoned -- it was like hitting one 's self against a wall .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 26]: She never swerved from her position , her voice never lost its tone of studied toleration ; and now he sat , the poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 24]: listening dreamily to the conversation between the other two men , too weary and depressed to take any active share in it himself .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 45]: When a movement was made towards the drawing-room half an hour later , however , Lilias was discovered leaning against the lintel of the window , looking so young , so sweet and fragile , that every chivalrous instinct rose up in her defence .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 14]: Such a girl was not made to endure hardships , Ned reflected tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 21]: The man who was lucky enough to own her should be prepared to carry all burdens on his own shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 4]: He was ready !
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 23]: Oh yes ; if Lilias would but love him faithfully , he would work for her with the strength of twenty men .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 39]: He was eager to tell her so , to apologise for his harshness of the afternoon ; and , stepping past into the garden , he caught her hand in his , and tried to draw her away .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 7]: `` Come , dear , come !
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 7]: Let us walk round the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 9]: I want to speak to you alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 19]: Lilias laughed , gave a caressing little squeeze to his hand , but stood firmly in her position .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 27]: Gervase Vanburgh and her father were approaching , and a general conversation seemed at the moment more interesting than a _ tete-a-tete _ with her lover .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 22]: So far she had had little opportunity of speaking to the stranger , and his appearance both interested and perplexed her .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 28]: The air of languid elegance which provoked Nan , filled her sister with admiration , yet there was something baffling in the expression of the sleepy eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 36]: Lilias had an uncomfortable impression that those eyes might be very keen on occasions , and would have suspected a quizzical expression at the present moment , had the idea not been so palpably absurd .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 10]: Why should Gervase find anything amusing in her attitude ?
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 49]: It was surely a most natural thing that she , as the eldest daughter at home , should wait for the gentlemen , while her sisters went out into the garden , and , that being so , where should she stand , if not by the window ?
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 50]: Nevertheless , the slow , quiet smile which followed his glance around , sent the blood into her cheeks , and seemed to intimate that he was as well aware as herself of the appropriateness of the background , and the care which had devised that seemingly careless pose !
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 70]: So disconcerted was she that she would have been inclined to retire in Ned 's company had he pressed his request a second time , but he was silenced by the first refusal , and the little group stood together exchanging commonplaces , until a white dress appeared among the rose-bushes , and Nan 's voice called out an unabashed summons -- `` I thought you were never coming !
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 7]: Why do n't you come out ?
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 6]: It 's perfectly lovely here .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 31]: The roses smell so delicious in the dusk ; and oh , father , there are two whole flowers on the little pink-belled saxifrage you brought home from Norway ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 24]: cried Mr Rendell in tones of incredulous ecstasy , which stamped him on the spot as one of the noble army of gardeners .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 29]: He hurried forward to inspect the new treasures , while Nan went down on her knees to hold up their tiny heads and expatiate on their fragile beauty .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 32]: When she arose five minutes later , she found two surprises awaiting her , the first being the presence of Mr Vanburgh by her side , and the second , alas !
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 26]: two large green stains on her white skirt , in the middle of the front seam , where she had knelt on the dewy grass .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 50]: Her face of dismay as she pointed downwards evoked a laugh from the two men , but Mr Rendell checked himself , glanced over his shoulder towards where his wife paced to and fro , and said quickly -- `` Better run upstairs , dear , and change it .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 20]: No need to be distressed ; you have plenty more , I suppose , and it will wash . ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 12]: Nan groaned in a sepulchral fashion , and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 6]: `` You do n't understand !
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 13]: It 's an evening skirt with trimmings , not an ordinary pique .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 5]: My very best too !
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 17]: I put it on because Mr Vanburgh was coming , and now it 's spoilt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 6]: `` Oh , surely not !
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 13]: Do n't say that ; it makes me feel so horribly guilty .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 65]: Let me try if I can rub it off , '' cried the visitor eagerly ; and , before Nan could protest , out came a superfine hemstitched handkerchief , and Gervase began rubbing the damaged skirt with such vigour , that the stains grew larger and larger , and increased their borders so rapidly that they met and blended in one great whole .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 31]: His face lengthened with horror as he withdrew his handkerchief , and gazed upon the results of his labour ; and Nan said dismally -- `` Thank you so much !
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 6]: It 's much worse now !
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 15]: Wish I were old enough to wear black always , and not be bothered .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 13]: My life 's a burden to me because of my clothes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 13]: `` For the mother 's pride the child must suffer pain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 6]: cried Mr Rendell , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 24]: `` That is what Kitty said , is n't it , when her mother insisted on pinning down the end of her collar ?
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 12]: Better confess at once , Mops , and get it over !
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 20]: Tell your mother she can send it to the cleaner 's , and I 'll stand the racket . ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 7]: `` Come and tell her yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 5]: D-oo , ducky darling !
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 14]: Sweetest father in all the world , come and plead for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 41]: coaxed Nan , hanging on to his arm , and rubbing his face with her soft cool cheek , while he affected to push her away , and in reality allowed himself to be led where she would take him .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 32]: Mr Vanburgh followed , stroking his moustache to conceal his smile , and Mrs Rendell 's quick eyes saw their approach , and fixed themselves sternly upon Nan 's ruined skirt .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 9]: `` Another accident , Edith , worse luck !
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 32]: The grass would get damp , and Mops and I were so interested in looking at our plant that we forgot everything else , and -- '' `` So I observe !
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 11]: It is a pity , but I am not surprised .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 11]: What can one expect from Nan , but destruction ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 17]: Mrs Rendell spoke with melancholy resignation , while the assembled sisters looked on with solemn eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 35]: Dainty Lilias , pensive Elsie , kindly Agatha , Christabel the immaculate , they stood gazing in a solid phalanx of disapproval , while Nan the culprit hung her head and flushed with embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 41]: A moment later Mrs Rendell had turned the conversation into another channel , unwilling to prolong the present discussion in the presence of a stranger , and Nan seized the opportunity to escape to the far end of the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 22]: Gervase Vanburgh stood in her path , and spied the glimmer of tears on the dark eyelashes as she passed by .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 38]: Then she disappeared , and Elsie 's chin dropped with amazement as she saw the elegant stranger deliberately mark a stone on the path , and kick it savagely with the toe of his patent leather shoe .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 16]: `` Bland of exterior , but concealing beneath the surface secret and violent impulses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 32]: Such was the character given to Gervase Vanburgh in Miss Elsie Rendell 's diary that evening ; and perhaps for once the youthful author was not far wrong in her conclusions !
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 5]: A VOW OF FRIENDSHIP .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 27]: The next morning at ten o'clock the Italian servant was entrusted with a message from his master which created a wild excitement in the Rendell family .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 50]: Mr Vanburgh was restored to his usual health , and wished to celebrate that fact , and provide at the same time a little entertainment for his nephew , by giving an _ alfresco _ luncheon in the garden , to which he invited his friends at Thurston House .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 25]: The meal would be served under the beech-tree on the lawn , and Mr Vanburgh hoped to welcome his guests at one o'clock precisely .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 7]: `` But not all of us !
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 15]: There are six of us -- six women -- not to mention Mr Talbot .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 11]: Mr Vanburgh can not mean to include the school-room party !
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 18]: The elder ones will be delighted to accept , but -- '' '' _ Mother _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 3]: gasped Christabel .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 38]: Agatha laid hold of the back of a couch , and prepared to faint on the spot , and the Italian looked from one to the other , a gleam of amusement showing in the dusky eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 10]: `` My master would be much disappointed , madam .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 7]: He wishes especially the young signorinas .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 16]: I am to bear an invitation also to Mrs Maitland and to Miss Kitty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 5]: That settled the matter !
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 52]: If Kitty were going , it would be nothing short of cruelty to keep her companions at home , so Mrs Rendell sent a general acceptance to the invitation , and shrugged her shoulders resignedly as each of the five girls hugged her in turns , and deafened her with questions .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 9]: `` Mother , what shall I wear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 14]: `` Mother , my pique skirts have not come home from the wash !
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 9]: I wish you would leave that horrid laundry .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 16]: It 's the third time -- '' `` Mother , will my pink blouse do ?
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 34]: It 's the nicest I have , and it 's only a little bit soiled on the sleeves , and if I wore clean cuffs -- '' `` Mother , need I change ?
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 12]: Ca n't I go as I am , and be happy ?
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 17]: I might want to climb over a fence , and it 's such spiky work . ''
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 27]: `` Mother , I think we should all go dressed alike in white dresses and blue ties , and march across the road in a crocodile .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 4]: Do let 's !
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 7]: It would be such fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 12]: Mrs Rendell pressed her hands to her head in distracted fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 29]: `` If every single one of you is not out of this room in two minutes from now , I 'll retract , and send a refusal instead !
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 6]: Get away to your work !
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 29]: I 'll see you separately later on , if you want instructions , but surely girls of your age ought to be able to dress without my assistance !
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 38]: The only thing I bargain for is that you are _ not _ alike , for that would only accentuate your number , and as it is I feel ashamed to appear with such a battalion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 8]: `` Lilias , need we go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 20]: Ned Talbot slid his hand through his _ fiancee 's _ arm , and drew her into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 26]: `` If the party is too large , why should we not reduce it by two , and have a quiet little lunch by ourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 35]: I must leave before four o'clock , and if we go to the Grange it will mean that we have no more time together , for we can not run away immediately after lunch .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 13]: Mr Vanburgh would understand our position if we sent an excuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 6]: `` Oh , Ned ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 23]: cried Lilias , and the tone of reproach was so eloquent that there could be no mistaking her wishes on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 13]: `` Oh , Ned , the first time we have been asked !
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 4]: Our first invitation !
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 10]: You could n't really wish me to refuse it .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 7]: I should be so dreadfully disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 27]: You do n't know how much we have longed to be asked , or what castles in the air we have built about this day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 11]: `` Very well , dear ; do n't trouble yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 13]: We will do just as you please , '' said Ned wearily .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 46]: He tried to convince himself of the reasonableness of Lilias 's position , and to show no sign of resentment ; but the jar was there all the same , and seemed to set up a barrier between them in all they did and said .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 38]: If any one had foretold that he should feel time drag heavily in Lilias 's company , and cast about in his mind for subjects on which to talk , how he would have derided the idea !
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 36]: yet , alas , it had come true , for he felt a distinct sense of gratitude towards Nan when she thrust her head out of a bedroom window and summoned Lilias to her assistance .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 28]: When there is no sympathy in the great principles of life , small talks become increasingly difficult , as this poor fellow was discovering to his cost .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 30]: Punctually at one o'clock the door of Thurston House was thrown open , and Mrs Rendell was discovered standing upon the threshold , issuing final directions to her flock .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 4]: `` Stop talking !
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 22]: My dear , good girls , if you insist upon speaking all together , how am I to make myself heard ?
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 10]: Pray calm yourselves , and behave like reasonable beings .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 27]: Do n't let me have the humiliation of taking about a crowd of excited children who might never before have been outside their own gate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 40]: Then she marched majestically ahead , with the demure Elsie as her companion , while the engaged couple followed , and each of the three remaining girls fell back in turns to cast a critical glance at her companions .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 39]: Half-way across the road Nan 's belt was discovered to have parted company with the skirt , and the most strategic measures were necessary in order to secure it before her mother reached the door of the Grange .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 17]: `` And remember , all of you , not to put your arms round her waist !
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 40]: The pin will stick out , whatever I do with it , '' said Christabel darkly ; then the door was thrown open , and the butler led the way across the hall towards the entrance to the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 40]: Each member of the visiting party was consumed with curiosity to examine the beautiful objects on either side , but had too much ado to keep her footing on the slippery oak floor to have any attention to spare .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 50]: Lilias clung to Ned 's arm , Mrs Rendell and Elsie minced along with tiny footsteps , and Nan waited until no one was looking , and then gave giant strides from one mat to another , or clung to a friendly rail to help her round slippery corners .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 44]: Then at last the garden was reached , and there , beneath the trees , stood an enchanted table , laden with everything that was beautiful in the way of glass and china , and banked up with a wealth of pink roses .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 39]: Mr Vanburgh 's couch was drawn up at its head , and Kitty Maitland sat at his side , bearing herself with that preternatural solemnity of manner which she invariably adopted along with her best dress and hat .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 60]: A moment later Mrs Maitland and Gervase appeared from behind a tree , and the elders shook hands and murmured the meaningless speeches common to such occasions , while Kitty took an early opportunity of stepping to Chrissie 's side , and calling her attention to the splendours on the table in a series of awed and breathless whispers .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 4]: `` Gold spoons !
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 3]: Venetian glass !
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 8]: It breaks if you look at it !
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 17]: I dare n't drink a drop out of those tumblers , and I 'm so thirsty !
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 3]: Such cream !
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 3]: Such strawberries !
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 14]: -- big as peaches , my love , and such lots of them .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 8]: I feel like the Queen of Sheba .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 17]: There 's no spirit left in me , it 's all so grand and gorgeous . ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 5]: `` I like it .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 4]: It suits me !
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 7]: I was born to splendour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 7]: said Chrissie , with an air .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 15]: `` I call it awfully sweet of him to do the thing so well .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 10]: But what a dreadful number of knives and forks !
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 8]: I shall never know which to use .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 20]: I wish I had asked mother about it before we came , for I do so detest making mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 9]: Before a butler , too -- so humiliating !
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 14]: And yet I do n't want to refuse anything I can help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 5]: `` Do n't refuse !
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 17]: Take all that comes , and crumble bread until you see how other people eat it .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 13]: That 's my dodge when I go out to lunch with mother .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 10]: I say , how do you like the nephew ?
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 18]: Does n't he look ex-actly like the tailor 's advertisement that you see in the shop windows ?
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 24]: I have never seen any man look like that before , and want to pinch him , to see if he is real .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 25]: Do you suppose it 's possible to be so handsome , and yet as nice as if he were ugly , like Jim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 3]: `` Jim !
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 4]: Jim ugly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 7]: gasped Jim 's outraged sister furiously .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 8]: `` Gwendoline Maitland , you are raving !
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 30]: Jim is the best-looking man I know , and I 'll tell him the moment that he comes home that you said -- '' `` Jim wo n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 8]: I told him so myself last year .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 27]: He asked how I liked his moustache , and I said it was ` stubbly , ' and he said moral worth was better than brilliantine .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 11]: There 's none of your nasty pride about Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 30]: Chrissie glared , but Kitty refused to be annihilated , and crinkled her nose in sauciest defiance , whereupon her companion stared into space with an expression of disdain .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 53]: An onlooker would have concluded that a serious quarrel had taken place ; but such small interludes were of common occurrence in the friendship of these two young women , and five minutes later they were pinching each other in the most amicable manner , and whispering , `` Sit by me !
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 5]: Sit by me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 10]: as if true happiness could not be enjoyed apart .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 61]: During the meal which followed there was ample opportunity of `` crumbling bread , '' for the Vanburgh cook had received instructions to eclipse himself for the young ladies ' benefit , and the succession of curious unknown dishes which he sent to table would have puzzled more experienced `` diners out '' than the members of the present party .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 45]: A prettier scene could hardly be imagined than the table under the trees , with the green lawn sweeping away on either side , the foreign servants flitting to and fro , and the six girlish faces of the guests beaming with delighted approval .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 26]: Elsie 's eyes grew large and dreamy , as she mentally rehearsed the most appropriate language in which to chronicle the event in her diary .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 44]: Such expressions as `` Arabian Nights entertainment , '' `` Green sward , '' and `` Princely Splendour , '' figured largely in the description , which ran to an inordinate length , and still seemed to have left half the wonders untold .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 17]: Nan spoke little during the meal , but , like the proverbial parrot , noticed much .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 50]: She noticed that , though the utmost courtesy was maintained between uncle and nephew , the elder man was evidently annoyed by the persistent nonchalance of the younger ; and she had a shrewd suspicion that Gervase knew as much , yet did not trouble himself to rectify it .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 42]: She noticed that , while Ned was depressed , Lilias 's mood was of the gayest and sweetest ; and she noticed that Gervase noticed as much , and studied the lovers narrowly from his point of vantage across the table .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 41]: She heard dear old Agatha discussing politics with her host , and quoting her father wholesale in her gallant attempt to be grown up and important ; and she chuckled audibly over the two schoolgirls ' enjoyment of the fare .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 29]: Then at last the meal was over , and she heaved a sigh of relief that all had passed off without catastrophe and with credit to the family .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 26]: No one had broken the fragile glass , no one had betrayed a plebeian ignorance of the _ convenances _ , nor showed ill-bred surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 50]: They had examined the _ menu _ with an understanding air , as though every other name was not as Greek to their ears , and had refrained from any signs of approval more noticeable than pressures of feet under the table , and occasional sly joltings of elbows .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 39]: The two ladies stayed beside Mr Vanburgh , while the younger members of the party strolled about the grounds , Gervase Vanburgh first walking with Lilias , and then making an excuse to cross to Nan 's side .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 23]: He smiled as he came , and his first words showed that he had grasped the situation without any need for words .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 13]: `` I shall get myself disliked if I stay there any longer !
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 23]: Mr Talbot leaves in another hour , I think , so it is hardly fair to him to engross your sister . ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 11]: `` But how do you know anything about Mr Talbot ?
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 52]: I never told you , '' cried Nan in amaze ; and Gervase smiled in his aggravating , lazy fashion as he replied -- `` Oh no , you simply said that ` a friend of Lil -- a friend of my brother Jim ' was staying with you at present .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 7]: That was all , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 7]: You gave me no information . ''
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 26]: `` Which means that I did , of course , and blurted out everything in my stupid , headlong fashion , '' sighed Nan dolefully .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 34]: `` It does n't matter much in this case , for a good many people know ; but mother wishes it kept as quiet as possible , because -- '' `` Just so .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 32]: But I assure you that even without your hint I should have discovered for myself that they were at present engaged ; so there is no necessity to blame yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 9]: Nan wheeled round upon him with flashing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 11]: `` Why do you say ` at present ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 10]: she demanded ; and Gervase smiled in impenetrable fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 6]: `` Did I say so ?
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 3]: Foolish slip !
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 7]: They are engaged , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 16]: I wish Miss Lilias every happiness , and congratulate Mr Talbot on his good taste .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 8]: She is certainly a lovely girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 8]: `` Oh , is n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 6]: cried Lilias 's sister gladly .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 8]: `` I knew you would say so .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 22]: You see now how absurd it was to mistake me for her , and what a difference there is between us !
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 10]: I knew quite well you would be surprised . ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 52]: Gervase Vanburgh put back his head , and stared at her with a scrutiny which was not without a touch of cynicism ; but the eager face he met was at once so frank and so honest , that the sneer faded from his lips and gave place to a smile .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' he said slowly , `` there is a great difference .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 9]: I can not imagine two people more unlike .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 9]: You are complete contrasts in every respect . ''
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 32]: `` She is so fair , and I am dark , '' sighed Nan , a trifle abashed by so vehement an assent , but striving loyally to conceal her discomfiture .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 29]: `` Lilias is our beauty , and we are all very proud of her ; but you can not really know the family until you have met Maud .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 15]: Maud is the eldest sister , and the best and sweetest of them all .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 17]: She is n't pretty , but she is such a dear that every one loves her .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 22]: ` Maud of all work ' Jim calls her , because she is always helping other people and forgetting herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 8]: `` Most exemplary , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 4]: Excellent example ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 21]: drawled Gervase with a yawn , at the sound of which the last trace of Nan 's patience gave way .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 35]: She stood still in the path and fixed him with a glittering eye ; but the speech which swelled in her throat was slow in coming , choked back by very excess of emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 22]: Gervase , in some alarm , demanded the cause of her agitation , and received a straighter answer than he expected .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 19]: `` I do n't care to speak about Maud to a person who only sneers at her goodness .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 45]: If you do n't mind , I 'd rather talk about the weather , and the garden , and things that do n't matter ; and then I can keep as indifferent as you are yourself , and we sha 'n' t quarrel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 4]: `` I sneer !
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 48]: I beg a hundred pardons , Miss Nan , if I have appeared to sneer at anything you say ; but I assure you that I have never yet voluntarily sneered at goodness ; so that in this instance at least you are doing me an injustice .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 15]: You must believe me , please , for I am thoroughly in earnest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 8]: `` Yes , I see you are .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 9]: I 'm sorry that I misjudged you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 7]: `` And I am sorry too .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 24]: You are sorry , I am sorry , we are both sorry , so now suppose we drop this subject and start afresh .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 37]: I 'd like to be friends with you if you will ; for I expect we shall see a good deal of each other in future , and it would distress my uncle if we disagreed .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 14]: Do you think you could sign a treaty of friendship with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 37]: `` Well , '' said Nan slowly -- and then paused , too honest to pledge her word without counting the cost -- `` I could , but I 'm not sure that it would last .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 5]: We are so different .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 9]: Would you mind answering one personal question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 15]: `` I 'll answer fifty with pleasure if it 's in my power . ''
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 9]: `` Then have you known some awful trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 26]: Has something dreadful , heart - breaking , happened to you , which you are trying to cover up and hide from the world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 13]: Gervase stared at her in amazement , which ended in a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 4]: `` Certainly not !
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 21]: I have had an absolutely smooth life -- too smooth , I am afraid , for the growth of character .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 15]: Now I wonder what made you take such an idea into your head ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 25]: `` I thought perhaps your heart was broken , and that was why you took no interest in anything that was going on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 7]: `` Do I take no interest ?
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 23]: I was under the impression that I took a great deal -- sometimes ; but I have learned to conceal my feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 17]: You may not perhaps be aware that English boys are educated in this fashion , nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 18]: At a public school it is considered ` bad form ' to be enthusiastic on any subject .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 25]: ` Not bad ' or ` pretty decent ' are the superlatives of praise , and anything more emphatic is sure to be snubbed .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 13]: Perhaps I have been too apt a disciple in that school . ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 8]: `` I call it a hateful school !
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 21]: and if I had a hundred sons I would not let one of them be trained under such an influence .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 20]: If a boy is not to be enthusiastic when he is young , when will he be , pray ?
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 16]: Youth is the time for noble dreams , for enthusiasm which carries all before it .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 12]: It is the enthusiasm of youth which keeps the world moving .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 9]: None of your languid half-measures for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 22]: declaimed Nan dramatically , backing into a flower-bed in her earnestness , and trampling half a dozen begonias beneath her heels .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 10]: `` Life is real -- life is earnest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 35]: `` It is indeed , '' cried Gervase , laughing ; `` and so , if you will permit me to say so , is my uncle 's gardener , when he is roused !
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 10]: Begonias , I fancy , are his special passion .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 34]: Miss Nan , you will have to be friends with me whether you will or not , for our natures are so different that we could be of infinite service to each other .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 23]: You could inspire me with your own enthusiasm , and I , in my turn , could curb and restrain you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 20]: `` But , dear me , '' cried Nan , `` I do n't want to be curbed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 12]: Then she looked at the begonias , and her face fell .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 39]: `` But I suppose , like all disagreeable things , it would be good for me ; so I 'll be friends , if you like , Mr Vanburgh , and take my share of the discipline . ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 6]: `` I feel much honoured .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 39]: It shall be my endeavour to be as little disagreeable as I can , '' said Gervase Vanburgh , with his courtly bow ; and thus were the deeds signed in a friendship destined to have far-reaching consequences .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 3]: LILIAS INTERFERES .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 31]: Nan 's compact of friendship with Gervase Vanburgh was announced to the family , and received with acclamation by the younger sisters , and with shocked disapproval by grown-up Lilias .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 5]: `` Most improper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 4]: she pronounced it .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 39]: `` You ought to remember , Nan , that you are no longer a child in the schoolroom , and that such an intimacy with a man of Mr Vanburgh 's age is simply another word for flirtation .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 20]: It is all very well to call it friendship , but everybody knows perfectly well what it means ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 20]: She stopped short with an expressive wave of the hands , and Nan glared at her with flashing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 70]: `` If there is one thing more than another that I loathe -- and detest -- and scorn -- and despise , '' she replied , dropping out each word with vindictive emphasis , `` it is looking upon every man one meets in the light of a possible husband , and taking for granted that you ca n't be civil to him without making a fool of yourself !
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 44]: I do n't know quite what you mean by ` flirting , ' unless it is giggling and making eyes , as some idiotic girls do ; and I am quite sure that I am in no danger of following their example ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 36]: `` You know perfectly well , Nan , that it means much more than that ; and Mr Vanburgh is a man of the world , and understands exactly to what you are lending yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 14]: Judging by his manner , I should call him an accomplished flirt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 17]: `` Very well , then , I will ask him about it on the first opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 24]: I will tell him what you say , and find out what his ideas are , before things have gone any further . ''
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 46]: A gasp of dismay sounded round the schoolroom , for the listeners knew that Nan was perfectly capable of putting her threat into words , and , moreover , that in her present state of indignation it was certain that she intended to do so .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 17]: Lilias broke into angry protests , but Nan 's icy , `` Do n't be alarmed !
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 43]: I shall not mention your name , '' showed that the true reason of her discomfiture had been gauged , and she could only hope that no opportunity would occur for the putting of such a question before Gervase left the Grange .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 33]: In this hope , however , she was doomed to be disappointed ; for Mr Vanburgh invited Nan to tea on the following day , and she departed , primed with determination .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 84]: It seemed at first that she would have no opportunity of broaching the all-important subject ; but when tea was over , Gervase proposed a walk round the grounds , and Nan was no sooner clear of the house than she gave a preliminary little cough , and said , in sententious accents -- `` Mr Vanburgh , we have agreed to be friends , but I should like to hear , as a preliminary measure , exactly your definition of the term .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 6]: What is a friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 42]: Gervase 's eyes twinkled and his lips twitched beneath his moustache , but he made a gallant attempt at seriousness , and replied -- `` A friend is a comrade who is faithful not only in words , but in deeds .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 37]: My friend is one who will make personal sacrifices to ensure my welfare ; who will not hear me maligned behind my back , but will reprove me to my face when I have done wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 30]: My friend is one who cares for me for myself , apart from my circumstances , and will be most loyal and loving in the time of trouble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 3]: `` Bravo !
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 3]: Bravo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 4]: cried Nan enthusiastically .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 5]: `` That 's good !
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 4]: I like that !
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 17]: Those are exactly my own sentiments , only I could not have put them into words .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 9]: I had no idea you were so eloquent .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 7]: Now , another definition , please .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 6]: What is a flirt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 5]: `` A flirt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 40]: An expression of the most complete amazement passed over Gervase Vanburgh 's face as he echoed the word , for this was , indeed , the last question which he had expected to hear from Nan Rendell 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 9]: `` You want me to define a flirt ?
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 16]: That is a little more difficult , but I will try what I can do .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 32]: ` One who practises the art of flirting , ' the dictionary would tell us , with its usual admirable candour , but that does n't seem to give much enlightenment .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 39]: A flirt , I should say , is the antithesis of a friend , for he affects more than he feels ; he flatters and makes pretty speeches , while in effect he may be critical and disparaging .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 34]: He thinks of himself and his own amusement , and is so much concerned for the gratification of his own vanity that he often inflicts serious wounds on the hearts of others . ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 6]: `` So bad as that ?
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 8]: Horrid things , how I despise them !
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 12]: I ca n't imagine how people can make themselves so contemptible .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 31]: Well , whatever may be my faults , I can honestly say I am not a flirt ; but some people are so suspicious that they are always imagining mischief .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 41]: Some one said to me -- I mean , I 've heard it said -- that when a man and a girl like you and me agree to be friends , it is just another way of beginning a flirtation .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 34]: It made me very angry when I heard that ; but now that I have asked you , I am quite satisfied , for it seems impossible to mix the two things together .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 26]: You ca n't flatter a person when you have agreed to tell him his faults ; you ca n't feign a sentiment which is real .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 75]: I knew I was right , though I could not argue it out ; but for the future I sha 'n' t mind a bit when you say nasty things to me , for I shall feel they are a proof of friendship ; and I shall find fault with you on every possible occasion , just to show that I am not flirting , and have only your own good at heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 21]: Nan stopped short , quite out of breath with eagerness , and Gervase looked at her with a scrutinising smile .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 4]: `` So ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 13]: he was saying to himself , `` Somebody said , did she ?
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 20]: I wish Somebody would mind her own business , and not put foolish ideas into your innocent little head .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 78]: Somebody has her own hands pretty full , I imagine , and might be better employed looking after her own affairs ; '' but aloud he said simply -- `` We will make a compact that we will never flirt with each other , but be the truest and most candid of friends ; and , to begin as we mean to go on , lay your instructions upon me now for my conduct during my absence .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 38]: You know my life -- an idle one , unfortunately -- living in my own place , among my own tenants , in a sleepy little corner of the earth , which affords no opportunity for adventure .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 15]: I fear I shall come back with no heroic deeds to recount ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 30]: ` Do the work that 's nearest , Though it 's dull at whiles , Helping , when you meet them , Lame dogs o'er the stiles ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 4]: quoted Nan impressively .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 31]: `` That 's one of my pet verses , which I quote to comfort myself when I am burning to do great deeds , and have to hem dusters instead .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 31]: Be thankful you are a man , and have not to hem dusters ; and try to take an interest in your tenants , and help them over their stiles .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 41]: I 'm sure many of them are lame , and longing for you to come to their aid ; and really and truly it would do you all the good in the world to think of something beside yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 21]: `` I have never yet found any one who interested me so much ; but I will make the effort .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 57]: And for yourself -- look where you are going , think what you are doing , be a trifle more circumspect in coming downstairs and bicycling round corners , and I will hope to meet you again in health and strength and with as few broken limbs as may be at the end of another month .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 5]: Goodbye , little friend !
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 7]: All good be with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 45]: He held out his hand , and smiled upon her in the slow , kindly fashion which already seemed familiar in her eyes , and Nan felt a sudden warmth at her heart , as at the realisation of a new joy in life .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 16]: `` Good-bye , '' she cried heartily ; `` and I 'm glad I promised .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 11]: I 'm glad we are going to be friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 3]: JIM RETURNS .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 33]: `` In work , in work , in work alway , let my young days be passed , that I may fade away and die , as I am doing f-ast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 57]: sighed Kitty Maitland one afternoon a month later , as she sat in the porch-room , surrounded with a mountain of needlework , on which she was laboriously stitching labels , while the elder girls consulted together as to prices , and Elsie plied an iron at a side-table , smoothing away disfiguring creases and crumples .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 28]: It was amazing to see the quantity of work which had been gathered together , and nobody was more surprised at the amount than the workers themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 27]: When the contents of drawers , ottomans , and cupboards had been gathered together and laid on the table , the girls had gasped with amazement .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 15]: Who could have believed that their little efforts could have achieved such a whole ?
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 17]: Who could have credited that friends would have come forward with such generous and ready help ?
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 42]: During the last few days parcels had arrived by every post , and from the most unexpected sources ; while good , kind Maud had come home from Paris with a box full of spoils from the Louvre and Bon Marche .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 59]: Lilias declared that her heart leapt within her when she reflected that she had originated the beneficent scheme ; but Nan vowed that it made her tired even to look at the things , and reflect how hard-worked she must have been ; and Kitty , as has been seen , went in absolute fear of her life !
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 15]: `` I never want to see another pin-cushion so long as I live ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 25]: she announced tragically , as she tacked the label on the last of these useful articles , and tossed it impatiently to her companions .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 29]: `` If you charge more than one and six for that beauty , it 's a cheat , for it 's a regular museum of odds and ends .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 2]: Heigho !
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 4]: this grows monotonous .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 12]: Let me go out into the garden and begin preparations there .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 11]: My master mind is wasted sitting here sewing on labels .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 7]: I want scope -- variety ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 17]: `` You ca n't get it then , until you have finished the work on hand .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 24]: It ought not to matter to you what you do , so long as you are helping forward , '' said Lilias severely .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 14]: `` To-morrow morning will be plenty of time to arrange the tables . ''
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 6]: `` If it is fine !
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 13]: I am sorry to discourage you , but it is raining already .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 30]: I see five drops on the window-pane , '' announced Elsie in a tone of satisfaction , born of the remembrance that she had `` told them so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 53]: months ago , and that they had refused to believe her ; but her triumph was short-lived , for the girls only laughed at her five drops , called her their `` faithful croaker , '' and altogether played such havoc with her dignity that she retired within her shell in displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 72]: Had the occasion been less important , she would have flown to her room to pour out her woes to the ever-sympathetic diary ; but no personal slight could be allowed to interfere with work to-day , for at four o'clock Jim would arrive , and never should it be said that the Rendell girls were engaged on their own devices when the one and only brother returned to his home !
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 34]: The first few hours after Jim 's arrival could be spent in no other way than gazing upon him , in drinking in his words , and hanging around him in adoring admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 45]: By four o'clock the porch-room was abandoned , and each sister , attired in her best blouse and freshest skirt , was craning her head out of the dining-room window , while Kitty Maitland hovered in the background , scarcely less excited than themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 3]: He came .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 29]: He stepped out of the fly , paid the cabman , and lounged up the path , lifting his head to nod in patronising fashion to his adorers .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 55]: He was no Apollo of beauty , no Samson of strength , but just an ordinary-looking young man in an ordinary grey suit , with ordinary irregular features redeemed from plainness by an expression of quizzical good humour ; yet each of the eight beholders gave a gasp of adoration as she beheld him .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 42]: His mother 's eyes swam with tears as she embraced her boy ; Maud felt a ray of pure , unselfish happiness ; even Lilias overlooked the fact that his collar was of an unfashionable shape in the delight of meeting .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 36]: As for the younger girls , they fell upon him , and hugged and kissed , and kissed and hugged again , until he was obliged to beat them off with his long grey arms .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 5]: `` Now , then !
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 4]: Now , then !
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 5]: Leave a fellow alone !
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 10]: I wo n't stand being mauled to death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 24]: cried the ungrateful male , scrubbing his cheek with his handkerchief , as if contaminated by the touch of so many feminine lips .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 23]: `` Take it easy , and I 'll speak to each in turn , but I ca n't tackle the bundle together .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 4]: Where 's Maud ?
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 5]: Where 's my Maud ?
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 18]: Come over here , Maud , and do n't let these youngsters keep you in the background !
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 13]: Holloa , Nan , what 's the matter with your back hair ?
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 6]: Done it up , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 22]: Does n't look half so well , you know , but I suppose you take it out in honour and glory .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 11]: Best respects , Lilias ; how 's the young man ?
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 16]: You kiddies are getting too tall -- that 's what 's the matter with you .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 11]: I shall feel quite an old man at this rate .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 16]: Do you mean to say that is ` Cath-er-ine Maitland ' I see before me ?
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 5]: Kitty , my own !
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 9]: How _ large _ you have grown ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 7]: `` Jim , you rude man !
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 7]: Behave , if you can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 6]: retorted Kitty with admirable promptitude .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 32]: It was an old habit of these two to converse in couplets , though Kitty lived in chronic dread of an hour when she should fail to invent an appropriate reply .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 55]: Her present success filled her with satisfaction , and evoked a burst of laughter from her companions ; and though Jim rolled his eyes at her in threatening manner as he entered the drawing-room , he refrained from a further effort , and devoted his attention to the admirable tea provided for his benefit .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 34]: His sisters waited upon him obsequiously , while his mother sat with folded hands gloating over the sight of the tall , masculine figure seated in state on the centre of the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 17]: What joy to behold him again -- her only son , her pride , her darling !
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 20]: How she glorified him , and exulted in him , and rejoiced in every evidence of his beautiful manhood !
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 40]: The sight of the thick-soled boots gave her a positive thrill of joy ; she looked unmoved at the mud on the carpet , and did not even wince when he crumpled her best silk cushion behind his back .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 22]: Jim looked across , caught her glance , and flashed back an answering message which made her heart swell with joy .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 16]: Her boy loved her , and had no fear to meet his mother 's eye !
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 16]: That was all she wanted to know , and she knew it without further questioning .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 39]: Jim was not given to words ; and even if he wished to speak , how could the poor boy _ get _ a chance , with seven excited girls all talking to him at the same moment ?
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 38]: Jim listened blankly for some moments before he could understand the drift of the remarks , but gradually the words `` Sale '' and `` Bazaar '' disentangled themselves from the clamour and awoke a dim remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 9]: `` Oh , the sale for the Mission !
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 8]: You did tell me something about it !
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 7]: Coming off to-morrow , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 5]: That 's a bore !
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 12]: Why did n't you get it over before I came ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 29]: The girls shrieked aloud in dismay , and , under cover of their protests , Maud whispered an eager -- `` Take an interest in it , do !
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 17]: They have worked so hard , poor dears , and they want you to help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 15]: -- which had the effect of rousing him to the importance of the position .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 13]: `` All right , girls , I 'll see you through ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 22]: he announced , with the self - confidence which a man assumes as if by instinct in discussions with his womenkind .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 49]: He had the vaguest ideas of what was expected , no knowledge at all of the difficulties of the position ; but it never occurred to him to doubt his own ability to overcome these difficulties , and put the final triumphant touch on the girls ' labours .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 8]: `` I 'll see you through ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 45]: he repeated ; and his sisters chorused their thanks and murmured grateful acknowledgments , while Kitty Maitland kept silent and eyed him askance through her spectacles , registering a vow to speak faithfully on the subject of masculine vanity on the first convenient opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 19]: The next morning each of the six Rendell girls awoke with a start and a shiver of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 4]: What had happened ?
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 21]: For a moment they could not tell , yet a cloud of depression was there ; and then , alas !
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 12]: in each case a glance at the window answered the question .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 35]: Down fell the rain , splashing the panes , soaking the trees , turning the paths into pools of water , weighing down the heads of flowers , and scattering blossoms over the grass .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 4]: Alas and alas !
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 32]: it was almost too dreadful to be believed , that after weeks of fine weather such a downpour should time itself to arrive on the very day of the long-expected sale .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 12]: `` If Elsie says , ` I told you so ! '
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 7]: I shall do her an injury .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 8]: I shall -- I know I shall !
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 11]: I sha 'n' t be able to help it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 10]: protested Nan ; but Elsie made no such statement .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 44]: To do her justice , she deeply regretted her prophecy , and felt as much distressed as if she were to blame for its fulfilment , while her morbid mind had much ado to countenance such unreasonable behaviour on the part of Providence .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 19]: `` I do n't understand why it is allowed to rain when so much depended on good weather !
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 52]: The work wo n't look half so well cramped up in the house , and we can make no money on the river , and the people who live at a distance will think it too wet to turn out , and it will all be a dead , dismal failure .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 53]: It seems to me very strange that we should try to do a good deed only to be frustrated by something over which we have no control , '' she lamented ; and though the other girls snubbed her promptly , it was difficult to banish the same thought from their minds .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 30]: If only , only it had kept fine , how different it would have been , and with what glee and zest they would have set about their preparations !
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 59]: As it was , they were all more or less depressed , and had it not been for Jim 's presence they would have been a sorry company ; but Jim rose to the occasion with such a succession of quips and jests , such schoolboy tricks and merry whistlings , as could not fail to be infectious .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 55]: He was not much use , so far as arranging the work was concerned ; but , as he himself expressed it , he played the part of beast of burden , dragging tables into the library , fitting them together to take the place of stalls , and undertaking a dozen onerous duties .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 49]: With the best will in the world , however , it was impossible to make the room larger than it was , or to prevent an amount of crowding which left many precious treasures hidden from sight , instead of being displayed in the sunshine of the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 29]: The girls sighed , and resolutely turned their eyes from the window ; and thus it happened that certain things took place which they were far from suspecting .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 78]: Whether the rain had spent its strength , or was put to shame by the sight of the mischief it had already wrought , it would be difficult to say ; but certain it was that the downpour changed gradually to a drizzle , the drizzle grew lighter and lighter until it ceased altogether , the clouds rolled away to the east , and through the grey of the sky there broke a feeble , struggling light .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 37]: Brighter and brighter it grew , stronger and stronger , until of a sudden a ray of sunshine danced across the floor of the room , and electrified its occupants in the midst of their work .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 5]: `` What 's that ?
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 4]: What 's that ?
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 3]: The sun !
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 4]: The sun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 25]: cried every one in chorus , and a stampede was made to the door to see if the good omen could possibly be true .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 27]: The ground was soaking with moisture , but oh , the freshness , the sweetness , the delightful earthiness of the scent which greeted their nostrils !
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 4]: `` Mff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 13]: cried Nan , opening her mouth wide to draw in deep breaths .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 4]: `` Ouf ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 4]: gasped Agatha rapturously .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 7]: `` Do my eyes deceive me ?
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 7]: Has it actually stopped raining ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 15]: cried Christabel elegantly ; and Jim executed a jig of triumph on the doorstep .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 6]: `` It has stopped indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 36]: The clouds have rolled away , the sun is coming out ; in another hour it will be beaming , and you will have such a day as you have not had for weeks past .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 5]: I told you so !
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 17]: If you had only listened to me , you would have been spared all your misery .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 10]: I told you so -- '' `` Excuse me !
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 7]: You did nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 40]: You remarked to me on my arrival that it looked ` Jolly bad , and that it was going to be a brute of a day , ' '' interrupted Kitty severely ; but Jim affected a convenient deafness .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 15]: `` Now then , '' he cried , `` all hands to the pumps !
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 40]: I 'll set James to work to mow the lawn , and by the time it is cut and swept and the sun has shone on it for a couple of hours it will be as dry as tinder .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 30]: We 'll have the paths swept too , and put a few planks across where the water has settled , and all will be as right as a trivet .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 18]: Put on thick boots , and set to work to undo all you have done this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 8]: There is no time to lose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 28]: There was not , indeed ; but willing hands made light work , and a more cheery band of workers it would have been difficult to find .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 76]: To see Nan rushing in and out of the house , clad in a short bicycling skirt , with snow-shoes covering her slippers , and Jim 's cap stuck on the back of her head , was a sight funny enough to have cheered the most melancholy of patients ; but when she executed a dance of triumph before her completed stall , her sisters held their hands to their sides in convulsions of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 40]: A deeper laugh joined in with theirs , a lazy musical laugh , which could only have come from one person ; and Nan , hearing it , wheeled round fully prepared to see Gervase Vanburgh standing before her .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 50]: Not one whit disconcerted did she appear at the sight ; but , holding out her skirt on either side , so as to display the huge cloth boots to the fullest advantage , she dropped him a curtsey and cried , `` Pleased to see you , sir !
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 7]: I hope you admire me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 5]: `` I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 28]: said Gervase in his soft drawl ; and there was an accent of sincerity in his voice which brought Jim 's eyes upon him in curious scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 35]: A word from Lilias had introduced him to this heir of the Mr Vanburgh of whom he had heard so much , and now he eyed him narrowly , forming his own swift conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 3]: `` Dandified !
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 2]: Affected !
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 8]: Fine face , though ; good expression !
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 16]: Decent fellow , I should say , if the nonsense were knocked out of him .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 8]: Uncommonly pleased to see Nan , too .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 7]: This must be looked into ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 25]: Then he was obliged to laugh again at the downright fashion in which his sister demanded the reason of the stranger 's sudden appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 8]: `` What have I come for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 6]: Gervase raised his hand deprecatingly .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 14]: `` To see if I could be of any use , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 36]: My uncle was anxious to know if he could lend anything in the way of tents or bunting , or if you would like one of his gardeners to come across and help your man .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 43]: A hamper of strawberries is to be sent over presently , with the palms and plants , and the cook is concocting something very special in the shape of ices , but you are to ask for anything and everything you want .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 8]: He is most anxious to help . ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 5]: `` Bless him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 4]: cried Nan devoutly .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 24]: `` Give him my love , and say that I shall thank him on my bended knees the moment the rush is over .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 29]: The gardener would be most useful , for James has more than he can do , and we are all taken up with our own special departments . ''
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 5]: `` And for myself ?
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 8]: Can I do nothing to help you ?
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 21]: I came last night on purpose for this sale , so I hope you will make me of use . ''
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 33]: He looked at Nan as he spoke , but it was Lilias who replied , taking him at his word , with an assurance which virtually monopolised him for the entire afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 18]: `` Oh , thank you so much ; then will you please help me in the punt ?
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 46]: I am going to take out small parties at sixpence a head , and intended to ask Jim to help me ; but as he knows the people , it would be better if he were free to walk about , and make himself agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 17]: Will you walk down to the river with me now , and have a little practice ?
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 24]: Jim will send across for the gardener , and we ought to try how we get on together , ought n't we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 5]: `` Certainly we ought .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 18]: It is most necessary , '' replied Gervase , and his face was absolutely devoid of expression .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 34]: Whether he was disappointed or pleased , annoyed or elated , it was impossible to guess , but he turned aside without another word and followed Lilias down the path which led riverwards .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 26]: By three o'clock preparations were completed , and everything done that could be thought of to exhibit house and garden in their most favourable light .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 49]: In the drawing-room the best cushions and table-covers were displayed in all their glory ; in the dining-room the table was set out with the precious china tea-service , which saw the light only on festive occasions , while every silver article was polished up to reflecting point .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 28]: Seven girls robed in robes of spotless white flitted to and fro in the garden , while Japanese umbrellas made picturesque splashes of colour amongst the green .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 41]: The visitors were polite enough to declare that it was well worth paying the admission fee to see so pretty a scene , and were altogether in such an affable frame of mind that they were the easiest of preys .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 26]: Nan 's objects of `` bigotry and virtue '' were speedily purchased , while Kitty and Christabel did a roaring trade in toffee and confectionery .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 26]: Agatha looked wistfully at their empty stalls while she displayed pinafores and petticoats to the county visitors , heard them murmur `` Very useful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 50]: and rustle on without dropping a solitary sixpence into her box ; but she consoled herself by the reflection that her turn would come later , when the villagers arrived to make their purchases , and meantime frequent doses of strawberries and fruit salad helped to sustain drooping spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 46]: Elsie smiled pensively across a mountain of fancy articles , Maud helped her mother to receive the newcomers , Jim flirted violently with all the prettiest girls , and Lilias was a vision of loveliness as she punted admiring crews up and down the stream .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 65]: Gervase Vanburgh had attired himself for his work in the most immaculate of flannels , and as he stood behind his companion plying his long pole , it is safe to say that every feminine beholder remarked to her own heart that the young people were made for each other , and that it would be a sin to divide such a beautiful couple !
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 52]: It was true that there was some talk of an engagement to an old family friend , but as it was not officially announced it could not be binding , and dear Lilias would do well to reconsider her position , now that this charming stranger had appeared upon the scene !
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 36]: Dear Lilias smiled back with sweet unconsciousness as she met her friends ' glances , but she was at no difficulty to read their meaning , and heaved a sigh for the contrariety of fate .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 27]: If only , only , it had been Gervase instead of Ned -- or rather , if the positions of the two men could be reversed !
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 38]: It would be delightful to float along the stream of life as they were even now floating down this sheltered river , a charming companion by her side , the eyes of friends turned admiringly upon her .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 37]: How different from the life before her in the bleak North - country town , with poverty and anxiety for daily guests , and Ned 's worn face looking sadly at her from across the table !
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 15]: Lilias shivered for all the blazing sunshine , and her heart swelled with anger .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 19]: It was not fair , it was not right that her future should be blighted in this fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 17]: Ned should realise that she was not bound by a promise given in completely different circumstances !
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 59]: It was some days since she had heard from him , for his letters had been less frequent of late ; and though at the bottom of her heart she knew that her own chilly replies were to blame for this diminution of her lover 's ardour , she chose to count his silence as still another offence .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 12]: He was neglecting her , and she would not stand it .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 24]: Like a flash of inspiration it darted into her head that she would free herself from this entanglement while there was still time .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 29]: It would seem unwomanly to desert a man in the hour of misfortune , but she would act at once , and not wait until the worst happened .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 33]: She would tell her mother that she was not happy ; and though Mrs Rendell might disapprove her past promise , she would never persuade her to keep it in the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 4]: Yes , yes !
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 21]: she would be free , she must be free , and then -- who could say what would happen then ?
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 23]: The long summer lay before her , with its intimate friendship with one of the richest and most charming of his sex .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 21]: Lilias raised her head with a gesture of determination , and met Gervase Vanburgh 's eyes fixed steadily upon her .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 24]: His glance did not waver as it met hers , and she blushed beneath it with a new and strange feeling of discomfiture .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 21]: It was as though that steady gaze had pierced beneath the surface , and read her poor , unworthy thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 4]: THE GARDEN SALE .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 28]: `` Forty-three pounds seven and twopence , nearly fifty pounds , my darlings , in solid coin of the realm , and all of our amassing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 35]: cried Nan three hours later , as the last visitor drove away from the door of Thurston House , and the contents of the cash-boxes were counted over by half a dozen eager workers .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 32]: `` Here 's a triumph for us , for our hopes never soared above a modest twenty pounds , and where it has all come from , I do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 38]: A great deal of work is left , so that , I fear me , our friends must have wasted their substance on eating and drinking and riotous living , as exemplified by sails in the punt .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 24]: I could have sold my carvings three times over , and the compliments which were showered upon me I would blush to repeat !
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 23]: My cheeks ache with smiling polite acknowledgments , and indeed I 'm nothing but a mass of aches from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 24]: How on earth do poor girls manage to stand behind a counter all day , and not snap off the customers ' heads ?
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 10]: My poor feet are in a lamentable condition ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 45]: `` I 'm sorry to hear it ; but they look , if you will allow me to say so , considerably better than they did a few hours ago , '' said Gervase , glancing at the white shoes with an approving smile .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 14]: `` Why do n't you sit down , if you are so tired ?
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 33]: There is a delightful seat waiting under that tree , and no more work to do , so that I should say the sooner you take possession of it the better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 6]: `` Oh yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 6]: Let 's all go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 16]: gushed Agatha , leading the way onward , unconscious of Gervase 's look of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 13]: `` Let 's go and rest , and talk it all over !
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 32]: The best part of an entertainment is when the people go , and you can quiz them , and make remarks , and -- '' `` Eat up the scraps ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 31]: concluded Kitty aptly , seizing a plate of cakes from a table as she passed , and illustrating her words with the aid of the daintiest morsel she could select .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 6]: Christabel ejaculated `` Kittay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 47]: in a tone of dignified remonstrance ; but the protest was for form 's sake merely , for hers were the next pair of hands to rob the dish , and it was neither _ one _ macaroon , nor two , which satisfied her appetite .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 34]: `` I really think it has been a great success , '' she said , munching away , and using an even greater amount of emphasis than usual in her elation of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 6]: `` The people behaved splendidly !
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 11]: Miss Shorter 's behaviour I consider simply _ noble _ !
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 7]: Do you know what she did ?
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 33]: Refused to buy anything at all , my deahs , until every one else had chosen , and then went about buying up all the old rubbish which no one would have .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 28]: It would have made you _ weep _ to see her collection of atrocities , and the old dear beamed away as if she were quite delighted .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 19]: I call it Christian to buy straw spill-boxes and cork frames for the good of your fellow-creatures ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 18]: `` But think of the ni-ice little fire they will make when the weather turns chilly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 34]: said Jim wickedly , as he jolted Chrissie 's elbow , jerked the plate out of Kitty 's hand , and made a snap at Agatha 's cake , held temptingly before him .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 46]: He could never by any chance sit near the girls without teasing them in some such schoolboy fashion ; and though they made a great show of indignation , they would in reality have been much disappointed if he had taken them at their word .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 30]: In the present instance all three girls fell upon him at once , and , having reduced him to a state of submission , continued their song of jubilation .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 11]: `` We took five pounds at the refreshment stall alone .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 20]: It would make a scandal in the parish if I divulged how many plates of strawberries the vicar ate .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 8]: Mrs Bolter bought up all the macaroons .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 6]: ` Home-made , my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 2]: X-ellent !
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 8]: I must really beg the recipe . '
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 15]: Mrs Booth asked the price of everything , and sniffed , and walked away .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 4]: What a woman !
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 11]: Mrs Raleigh seemed quite indignant because I had no eggs .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 4]: ` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 11]: I quite _ counted _ on getting fresh eggs ! '
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 9]: Mr Vanburgh had only one cup of tea .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 12]: I do n't call that helping the cause of charity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 24]: `` I was busy in another direction , and if I neglected the tea , I did my duty nobly by the lemonade .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 26]: I am afraid we did not make very much money , but , considering the low rates , it came to more than I expected .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 11]: How much did we take altogether , Miss Lilias ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 15]: `` Two pounds , one and sixpence ; and all pure profit , remember !
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 27]: We had no outlay to deduct , '' replied Lilias , with the shrewd little air of business which contrasted so strangely with her child-like looks .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 21]: `` Looking at it in that light , I think ours was the most profitable of all the departments . ''
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 6]: `` And I made nothing !
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 52]: I feel quite guilty among you all , for I took not a single coin the whole afternoon , '' said Maud the modest ; but Jim would not allow his favourite sister to decry herself in his presence , and was up in arms in a moment in her defence .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 7]: `` And why not , pray ?
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 20]: Because you were doing the thankless work , as you always are , and fielding for every one else .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 24]: That was my task , too ; and let me tell these young people that they have to thank us for their success .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 24]: You tackled the dowagers , and put them into a good temper by asking after their ailments , and I managed the girls .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 12]: Bless their pretty hearts , they would do anything for me !
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 27]: You should have heard me complimenting 'em , and quoting poetry by the yard , and all the while luring 'em on towards the fancy stall .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 14]: Then I 'd nothing to do but remark , ` See that cosy ?
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 6]: I drew the design . '
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 5]: ` Observe that cushion ?
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 20]: that 's my favourite colour , ' and they fairly jostled each other in their eagerness to buy it .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 24]: It was our gentle influence behind the scene which helped you on , young women ; and do n't you forget it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 30]: Maud smiled ; but the smile flickered out all too quickly , as her smiles had a habit of doing nowadays , and her brother glanced at her sharply .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 19]: Maud was not herself , and he feared that he knew too well the reason of the change .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 47]: The news of Ned Talbot 's engagement to Lilias had smitten him dumb with surprise ; but as none of the home letters breathed a hint of a like feeling , he had tried to persuade himself that he had been mistaken in his earlier surmises .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 34]: This had been easy to do , for Master Jim was not given to distressing himself unnecessarily ; but since his return home his fears had sprung into life again in unwelcome fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 29]: When Maud returned to the house he rose as if to follow , but , changing his mind , turned back and took possession of Kitty Maitland instead .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 10]: `` What is the matter with my Maud ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 17]: he asked her the moment they had turned a corner and were safely out of hearing .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 20]: `` She has n't half the life and go in her that she had last time I was home .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 15]: What have you been doing to her , I should like to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 16]: Kitty elevated her eyebrows until they were almost lost to sight beneath her curling hair .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 17]: `` Personally , '' she said , `` personally I have treated her with every consideration .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 17]: Maud is Maud , and no one in this neighbourhood would dare to treat her otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 32]: Of course if other people -- from a distance -- choose to make lunatics of themselves , and -- and -- '' `` All right -- you need say no more !
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 29]: I thought as much ; and as you and I had discussed the situation together last year , I wanted to see if your ideas agreed with mine .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 19]: I could have sworn we were right , and ca n't imagine how this muddle has come about .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 25]: It 's a big mistake anyhow , and some one will find it out before long , or my name 's not James Rendell .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 30]: It 's not my business , I suppose , but I -- I should uncommonly like to kick somebody , just as a small relief to my feelings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 25]: `` Oh , so should I -- badly ; but I 'm afraid I could n't kick hard enough , '' said Kitty humbly .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 27]: `` The worst of it is you have to be civil , because to show your suspicions would be the most unkind thing you could do .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 23]: I know Nan agrees with us , and I think Elsie too , but the others seem quite pleased and satisfied . ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 21]: `` Well , let it be a lesson to you , never to allow yourself to be influenced by looks .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 15]: ` Appearance is deceitful , and beauty vain , ' '' quoted Jim sententiously .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 40]: `` That Vanburgh fellow , for instance , is , I suppose , better-looking to the casual glance than I am myself , but I do n't need to point out to you the infinite superiority of my character .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 38]: Whenever , my estimable Katherine , you meet with a man who is popularly styled handsome , take my word for it , he is a wolf in sheep 's clothing , and ought to be avoided .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 41]: People like you and me , with noble hearts and ugly faces , '' -- but at this point even Kitty 's forbearance came to an end , and she stalked off to the house in a fume of indignation .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 21]: Feminine fourteen does not find the consolation it should in nobility of character at the cost of plainness of feature !
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 21]: Gervase and Nan , left alone on the garden seat , had meantime turned towards each other with inquiring smiles .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 25]: It was the first time they had found themselves alone , and each was anxious to question the other concerning the time of absence .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 26]: `` Well , '' quoth he , `` and how have you been , and what have you been about all this long month ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 25]: `` Quite well , thank you ; and I 'm proud to say , slaving like a nigger for the good of my fellow-creatures .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 30]: An ignorant man can hardly realise the amount of work it takes to get up a sale like this , but I shall bear the marks to my grave .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 5]: Look at that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 28]: and she held out towards him a pair of sunburned hands , shapely enough , but disfigured with sundry scars and bruises inflicted by hammer and chisel .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 62]: Her look of pride in her wounds was comically in contrast to her companion 's distress , as his glance wandered from the little hard-worked fingers to his own white hands , -- almond-nailed , soft-palmed , taper-fingered , the hands of a man who has lived an idle life , and known little or nothing of the reality of work .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 13]: Nan 's eyes followed his , and she laughed in amused fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 15]: `` Mine look like the man 's , and yours like the woman 's !
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 8]: The contrast makes mine browner than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 11]: How do you manage to keep them so white ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 5]: `` Do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 4]: said Gervase shortly .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 13]: `` I am not at all proud of them , Miss Nan .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 24]: They have been useless enough hitherto , and if they find any work now , it is more your doing than their own .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 29]: I have tried to turn over a new leaf since I saw you last , and to remember your axiom -- '' `` And did you find them ?
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 6]: Did you help them over ?
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 11]: Were many lame , and not able to walk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 3]: `` Crowds !
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 2]: Dozens !
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 2]: Scores !
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 23]: The whole parish seems hobbling ; and I foresee that that stile will keep me busy , now that I have begun .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 24]: It was astonishing how many cripples seemed waiting for my advent , and what a lot of ` helping over ' they required .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 30]: When they had recovered from the shock of discovering that I was showing some interest in their affairs , they were not at all bashful about stating their desires .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 26]: One man wanted a new roof to his cottage -- his wife was rheumatic , and objected to the rain coming through on her bed .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 28]: I had previously refused the request through my agent , but when I went to inspect the place , I could not deny that repairs were needed .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 12]: The woman showed me her fingers , too -- most unpleasant !
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 14]: I would rebuild the whole cottage rather than look at them again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 52]: He shrugged his shoulders , with a relapse into his old affectation of manner , which brought Nan 's eyes upon him with a flash of indignation ; but she refrained from remonstrance , as , after all , he had granted her request ; and he continued his story uninterrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 25]: `` Another man begged for an extra strip of land where an invalid daughter might keep chickens , and so contribute towards the family-purse .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 35]: Three widows had sons to place , and seemed to think that a word from me would be sufficient to secure positions with handsome salaries ; half a dozen women demanded letters to hospitals .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 77]: The school marm wanted an additional window in her cottage , which is about as gloomy a little hole as I have had the pleasure of entering ; and the vicar , hearing reports of my new-found generosity , requested a donation towards a new organ , felt he would be the better for a second curate , and remarked _ en passant _ that he had had a lifelong desire to visit the Holy Land .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 57]: I promised to pay the last hundred pounds for the organ when he had made up the rest of the sum , said that the parish was too small to allow two whole curates and myself to live together in peace and harmony ; and congratulated him on his good fortune in not having visited Palestine .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 23]: I have , and ever since my return have been strenuously striving to forget , and work back to my old dreams .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 27]: He went away saddened and surprised ; but as he is neither poor nor hard-worked , I did not consider that he came within my category .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 21]: I was beginning to feel a trifle overworked , and was quite relieved to get away for a rest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 24]: `` I think you have done splendidly , and am sure you have enjoyed it , in spite of all you may say .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 16]: It gives one such a lovely , warm , glowey feeling to help other people !
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 32]: On the rare occasions when I have succeeded in doing it , I have just longed to be a philanthropist , for I felt so deliriously happy and pleased with myself .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 28]: You ca n't look me in the face and deny that you have been far happier this last month , and far less bored and cynical ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 8]: Gervase laughed , and shrugged his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 7]: `` Have it your own way !
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 4]: I deny nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 22]: I am considerably the loser both in time and money by the new arrangement , but perhaps that is wholesome discipline .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 50]: I do n't know that I have experienced much of the ` glow ' as yet ; which is , I suppose , because I have not your affection for my fellow-creatures ; but I hope it is yet to come , for it sounds an attractive sensation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 12]: `` Do n't laugh at me , '' said Nan severely .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 10]: `` I said glowey , and I mean glowey !
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 7]: No other word expresses the sensation .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 21]: You 'll understand some day when you have it yourself , and be sorry that you made fun of me .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 37]: As for liking your people , the more you help them , the more interested you will feel , until in the end you will positively love them as if they were your own relatives . ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 4]: Gervase looked dubious .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 11]: `` If only they would refrain from exhibiting their deformities !
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 52]: I do so strongly object to looking at disagreeable objects , '' he sighed plaintively ; then suddenly his face grew grave , and he added in a different voice , `` It will be a long time , I fear , before I can reach your standard of loving help .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 28]: So far it is a duty only , and a distasteful one in to the bargain ; but I will persevere , in hope of better things .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 19]: There is one person in the parish who has been set in the right way through your instrumentality .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 29]: If the other efforts have failed , this , at least , has been a success , and it was time that some one took him in hand .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 23]: An idle , loafing rascal who thought of nothing but his own comfort , and was the biggest waster in the village .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 22]: He has set to work now , and he shall stick to it , or I 'll know the reason why !
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 39]: I 'll keep a stern hand on him , Nan , for your sake ; for it was you , not I , who set this ball a-rolling , and I am only the executor of your orders .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 24]: It is you who have played the good angel in his life , and he shall have no chance of slipping back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 14]: `` But you must n't be too stern with the poor young man .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 11]: You must make allowances , and be patient and forbearing .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 12]: I shall be so interested to know how he goes on .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 22]: It is nice to have a _ protege _ , and feel that one has had some part in his reformation .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 16]: Tell me his name , so that I may know what to call him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 6]: Gervase looked at her curiously .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 27]: The eager face was without a suspicion of embarrassment , but it coloured over with a quick flush of surprise as she listened to his reply .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 15]: `` His name , '' Gervase said slowly , `` you have heard before .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 6]: His name is Vanburgh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 4]: THE BLOW FALLS .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 76]: Two days later , Maud was sitting reading in the drawing-room , when the door opened , the servant pronounced a name which thrilled her with surprise , and , looking up , she beheld Ned Talbot standing before her , -- Ned Talbot , or the wraith of Ned , for so pale did he appear , so worn and haggard , that it needed no words to tell the nature of his visit .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 72]: Maud had heard about the anxieties of the last few months , and had grieved for Ned in her tender heart , feeling an added bitterness in the lot which forbade her the privilege of comforting him ; but now it would appear that Fate had led them to each other , and even her modesty could not mistake the relief in voice and manner as his eyes rested upon her .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 15]: `` Maud , '' he cried , -- `` Maud , it is you !
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 22]: Oh , this is good , this is better than I hoped for , to find you here , and alone !
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 20]: I was longing for your help ; but you are so much away nowadays that I seldom see you .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 13]: Well , Maud , it has come -- the end has come !
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 24]: I have thrown up my post , and have to face the world again , and the whole weary fight from the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 32]: All these years have been wasted ; the time has gone , and the money , and the strength , and here I am at the end , stranded and beaten !
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 14]: You may wonder how I have the audacity to show myself among you .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 48]: If I had any pride left , I should have stayed away -- '' He broke off with a hard , unnatural laugh , and Maud laid her hand on his arm with a soothing gesture , her own trouble forgotten in the necessity of soothing his .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 11]: `` Come and sit down , '' she said gently .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 11]: `` Sit down , and tell me all about it .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 21]: We are not fair-weather friends , Ned , and will only care for you the more because you need help .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 27]: If you have lost this post , I am sure it is from no fault of your own , so you must not be cast down .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 8]: Tell me about it -- Or stay !
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 5]: Shall I call Lilias ?
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 16]: She is at the Grange , but I could send for her at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 28]: She paused , looking inquiringly into Ned 's face , and he hesitated painfully , the colour flushing in his thin cheeks , his eyebrows twitching nervously .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 7]: `` I think -- not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 6]: he said slowly at last .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 20]: `` She will hear soon enough , and she is so young and inexperienced that she can not understand .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 16]: Let me first talk it over with you , Maud , and then -- No !
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 21]: It was no fault of mine , though in the last instance it was I who gave in my resignation .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 12]: I could not stay on longer , and keep my self-respect .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 12]: Positions were forced upon me impossible to any man of honour .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 23]: My post was deliberately made untenable , and to stay on would have been the act of a coward and a scoundrel .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 18]: They had got what they wanted out of me , and I was of no further use .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 42]: It only remained to get rid of me as quickly as possible , -- and , mark you , by my own doing in the last instance , so that they might preserve some appearance of honour before their neighbours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 8]: `` But can such things be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 4]: Maud wondered incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 38]: `` Is it really possible that men , calling themselves gentlemen and , I suppose , Christians , can be so absorbed in the idea of growing rich that they can be so low , so base ?
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 55]: To go to a young fellow who is fighting against hard odds , to propose a scheme which looks fair and smooth , to suck his brains and steal his business from him , and then -- then -- to treat him as you say , and send him out on the world alone !
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 8]: Oh , Ned , is it possible ?
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 8]: One can hardly believe in such wickedness .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 11]: Are there many such people in your business world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 7]: `` Not many , thank God !
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 23]: but there are a few who are notorious for absorbing small firms , and treating their owners as I have been treated .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 49]: They build up huge fortunes , and we are ruined ; they succeed , and we fail , and the world goes on as usual , and no one sees any difference , or takes any thought of the poor fellows who have gone to the wall . ''
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 5]: `` God does ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 4]: said Maud softly .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 9]: `` God does n't think they have failed !
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 19]: In His eyes they have succeeded , and are rich , while the others are ruined and outcast .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 13]: Do n't be cast down , Ned -- do n't lose hope !
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 15]: God is on your side , and has some good purpose behind this trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 23]: The clouds are dark to-day , and you can not see it , but in years to come it will be plain .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 16]: Keep a brave heart , and do n't grieve too much over what is past .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 14]: You have the future before you , and you are young and strong .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 25]: You would not allow any one else but yourself to call you beaten , and I will not hear it from your lips . ''
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 6]: `` Oh , Maud ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 19]: cried Ned brokenly , `` you always know what to say , you always say the right thing !
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 6]: How can I thank you ?
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 34]: If girls only understood what angels they might be to men , -- if they would remind us oftener that this world is not all , -- what a help it would be !
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 32]: We are out on the battlefield , and it is difficult to remember these things , especially when we are so hard pressed that our thoughts are engrossed with the struggle .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 54]: I felt hard and bitter when I came into this room , for it 's a terrible thing to face ruin , -- a girl can not imagine how terrible , for she is shielded from such trouble , -- but you have put fresh life into me by your sweet words . ''
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 12]: Maud smiled faintly , her brows drawn together in painful fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 55]: She was saying to herself that she knew well what it was to see life robbed of its dearest hope , and realising , as many a girl has done before her , that one of the sorest features of her trial was that she could neither ask nor receive sympathy from her friends .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 37]: The reflection brought her thoughts back to Lilias , and she was once more about to suggest sending a message to the Grange , when the door burst open and Lilias herself danced into the room .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 14]: What a contrast to the pale and depressed couple seated on the sofa !
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 56]: Just returned from a delightful visit to the Grange , love of admiration gratified by Mr Vanburgh 's courtesy and Gervase 's elaborate compliments , her hands full of trophies in the shape of flowers and fruit , she looked the impersonation of happiness and prosperity , and singularly out of sympathy with her companions .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 29]: She was half-way across the room before she recognised Ned , and the sudden change which then passed over her face was far from flattering to his vanity .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 4]: `` You ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 6]: she gasped , in bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 5]: `` Is it you ?
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 5]: When did you come ?
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 6]: I -- I never knew .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 10]: You said nothing in your letter about coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 13]: `` No ; I wanted to tell you the news myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 22]: Ned rose and stood beside her , not attempting any lover-like greetings , but holding her hand tightly in his own .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 56]: His face was pathetic in its wistfulness , and dread of the pain which he was about to inflict , but it was in the tone of a father speaking to a child that he said gently -- `` I have bad news for you , Lilias -- the news which I have been dreading .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 24]: I have sent in my resignation to the heads of the firm , and have practically said ` Goodbye ' to the Works .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 39]: It is a bad business , and very hard on you ; but , as Maud has been reminding me , I am young and strong , and we must not be cast down by a first failure .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 22]: If you will have faith in me , and will wait a few years , all will come right yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 12]: He paused , and Lilias stared at him with incredulous eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 31]: Her glance wandered from him to Maud , from Maud around the pretty luxurious room , through the window to the garden beyond , and finally back to his face .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 13]: Her lips moved , and the words came out in spasmodic snatches .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 5]: `` You have resigned ?
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 5]: You threw it up ?
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 22]: You did it of your own accord , in spite of all I could say -- of my wishes and entreaties ?
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 7]: It is your own doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 23]: Ned dropped the hand which he held in his , and straightened his shoulders with a gesture at once proud and determined .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 16]: His voice took a sharper edge , and the gentleness died out of his face .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 26]: `` Yes , it is my own doing , Lilias , in this last instance , but you know what has driven me to it .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 11]: I have told you in what position I was placed .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 12]: I could not stay on without sacrificing every sense of honour .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 13]: Surely you can understand and sympathise with me in my misfortune ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 19]: Lilias laughed , a high , hysterical laugh , and threw back her head with a defiant gesture .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 8]: `` Oh , I understand -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 7]: I have understood all the time .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 20]: Your ridiculous quixotic notions have ruined your life , and you do n't care if they ruin mine also .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 38]: You think of your own feelings , your own discomforts , but you never think of _ met _ If you really loved me , you would bear a few discomforts for my sake ; but no !
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 12]: it must all go , you must throw it all away .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 21]: I begged , I implored , I did everything that was in my power to prevent it coming to this .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 9]: You ca n't deny that I did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 9]: `` No , Lilias , I can not .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 19]: I am bitterly grieved to remember that you have systematically urged me to act against my conscience . ''
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 23]: It was an unexpected answer , almost awful in its unflinching sternness , and Lilias greeted it by a burst of weeping .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 9]: `` Oh yes , yes , blame me !
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 3]: blame me !
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 25]: It 's not enough that you have brought this misery upon me , but now you must begin to abuse me to my face !
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 13]: It is cruel and cowardly to turn against me like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 12]: `` Hush , Lilias , oh , hush , hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 14]: Maud stood before her -- Maud 's fingers gripped her arm in remonstrance .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 7]: `` Think what you are saying .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 18]: You are surprised and shocked ; but you must not , you shall not talk so wildly !
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 14]: Ned is in trouble , and it is your place to comfort him .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 17]: He has done what is right , and it is harder for him than for you .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 6]: He needs your help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 38]: But Lilias only sobbed the louder , making no attempt to give the desired comfort , and Ned said sadly -- `` I ask no more from you at present , Lilias , than a fair judgment .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 20]: Maud has given me her sympathy and encouragement , but that seems too much to hope for from you .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 16]: Try to believe , if possible , that I was not indifferent to your interests .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 39]: Maud would not allow me to say I had failed because I must suffer temporarily for conscience ' sake ; she believes that the day will come when I shall be thankful for this change in my circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 27]: Ca n't you bring yourself to feel the same ; to look forward to a future when I may meet with success instead of reverse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 11]: `` No , I ca n't ; how can I ?
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 6]: It is contrary to reason .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 21]: You said yourself that you could never hope to be master again , and situations are so difficult to find .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 10]: I 've heard father talking , and I know .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 32]: Sometimes men have to wait years and years before they find an opening , and then it 's a wretched thing with a salary of two or three hundred a year .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 28]: And you have less chance than many , because your own Works did n't pay , and you have left these people after such a short time .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 6]: It will count against you .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 10]: People will think it is your own fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 4]: `` Lilias ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 34]: cried Maud again , and this time her voice trembled with anger , and her eyes sent out such a flash as her sister had never seen before , `` how dare you !
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 7]: How dare you be so cruel !
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 27]: If it were true a hundred times over , how could you have the heart to say so to Ned in the midst of his trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 12]: For pity 's sake , think what you are doing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 10]: `` Do n't distress your kind heart , Maud .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 15]: It is better that I should know exactly what Lilias has in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 7]: She is right in her surmises .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 22]: The changes will tell against me in public opinion , and it is quite probable that I may suffer for them .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 20]: I would not for one moment deny it , so you see there is no injustice in the accusation .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 6]: You are right , Lilias !
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 29]: My chance of being a rich man is sensibly diminished by this last misfortune , and it may be years before I can earn even a bare competency .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 16]: I have never deceived you about my position , and I shall not begin now .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 35]: I knew that my news would be a blow to you , but I could not have believed that you would receive it as you have , without a word of kindness or sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 35]: Apart from the question of love , I should have thought any woman would have taken pity on a man in the first sharpness of his misfortune , and have spared him her reproaches .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 19]: Maud has been an angel of kindness , but you have had no thought of my sufferings . ''
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 10]: Lilias gave a gasp of mingled anger and mortification .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 42]: This was what she had feared , this was what she had determined to avoid ; but once again Fate had been too strong for her , and had precipitated the calamity before she had had time to obtain her freedom .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 40]: Now every one would call her heartless and unwomanly ; her parents would look coldly upon her , she would be branded before the neighbourhood as a girl who had forsaken her love when he most needed her devotion .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 22]: A great wave of anger swept over her , her heart thumped against her side , and her breath came fast .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 26]: She hardly knew what she was saying , but the words rushed out in a breathless string -- `` Oh yes , Maud -- Maud !
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 3]: Always Maud !
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 15]: I 'm sick of hearing Maud quoted , and held up as a pattern !
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 10]: Maud is always right , and I am wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 12]: Maud is an angel , and I am an unwomanly wretch !
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 19]: Why did n't you get engaged to Maud , when you liked her so much better than me ?
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 20]: If I have made a mistake , so have you , and you have no right to reproach me .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 25]: I 'll go away and leave you , since I make you so unhappy , and you prefer Maud 's company to mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 28]: She was out of the room even as the last word was uttered , and the two who were left stared at each other with horrified eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 33]: Maud 's face was crimson , from the tip of her chin to the roots of her hair , but she was the first to speak and recover some semblance of composure .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 9]: `` Oh , do n't listen to her !
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 6]: Do n't listen to her !
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 9]: She does not know what she is saying .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 10]: She is excited , and has lost her self-control .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 9]: In a few minutes she will be sorry .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 22]: Oh yes , I know she will ; she will be wretched , and come to beg you to forgive her .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 11]: Wait , wait , and do n't judge her hardly .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 19]: She is so young , as you said , and she did n't know what she was saying .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 6]: Try to forget it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 15]: But Ned sank down in a chair and covered his face with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 7]: `` But it is true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 3]: he moaned .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 12]: `` It is true , and I ca n't deny it !
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 13]: Oh , how blind I have been -- how blind and foolish !
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 12]: I have ruined my own life as well as hers . ''
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 3]: A MILESTONE .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 5]: It was all over .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 18]: Ned had gone away , and the diamond ring no longer shone on Lilias 's left hand .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 35]: In a storm of tears and sobs she had declared to her mother that she neither could nor would keep true to her engagement , and Ned had received the intelligence with grave composure .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 7]: `` She made a mistake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 4]: he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 7]: `` We both made a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 13]: I can not blame her , for I was in fault myself .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 25]: What we thought was love , was but the attraction of youth and good spirits , which could not stand the strain of adversity .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 10]: Do n't be hard on Lilias , Mrs Rendell .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 14]: I should be sorry that she should suffer any more on my account .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 10]: It has been a painful experience for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 21]: But Mrs Rendell closed her lips in a stern silence , and had no word of pity for her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 57]: It shocked her proud heart that one of her girls should have behaved in a manner so unworthy the precept which she had endeavoured to teach , for she knew well that Lilias would have felt no qualms in preparing for her marriage , if Ned 's story had been one of success instead of failure .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 25]: What Mrs Rendell thought she was accustomed to say , and Lilias came away from the important interview smarting with mortification and wounded vanity .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 79]: She tried to think that the worst was over ; but the bitterest moment was yet to come , when she met her father -- the gentlest and most forbearing of men , who was so slow to blame that his children could count the reproofs of a lifetime on the fingers of one hand -- and he looked at her with a strange , cold glance , in which was no trace of the old fond admiration .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 12]: `` What 's this I hear about you , Lilias ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 4]: he asked sternly .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 16]: `` I 'm not proud of you , my dear , not proud at all !
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 18]: I did not think that a daughter of mine could have behaved in such an unwomanly manner .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 9]: Your affection seems good only for fair weather .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 10]: Talbot is well rid of such a wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 38]: It was not much , and it was the only reference to the broken engagement which she ever heard from his lips , but it pierced the girl 's heart as no other reproach could have done .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 44]: The relationship between a father and a daughter is a very sacred and beautiful one , and the consciousness of his pride in her , his barely concealed satisfaction in the admiration she excited , had been one of her most cherished joys .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 30]: The thought that her father was ashamed of her made Lilias wince with pain , nor did her sisters ' reception of the news help to restore her composure .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 34]: Maud 's principle in life was to say nothing , if it were impossible to say what was agreeable ; but Nan made up for this silence by the candour of her denunciation .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 37]: The two girls came face to face at the top of the stairs , an hour after the great news had circulated through the house , and mutually stopped to gaze in each other 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 4]: `` W-ell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 4]: queried Lilias timidly .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 5]: `` You 've heard !
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 5]: Mother has told you .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 12]: What do you -- what do you think about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 13]: Nan closed her eyes , and tilted her chin in the air .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 4]: `` Sneak ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 12]: she said shortly ; and the other started back in astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 7]: `` Wh-what do you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 3]: `` Sneak !
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 7]: That 's what I called you .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 33]: It 's a mean , sneakish thing to desert a man just when he is in trouble and needs all the help he can -- '' `` It was n't just then .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 10]: I had been thinking of it a long time .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 19]: If he had stayed away a week longer , I would have spoken to mother all the same .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 7]: I had made up my mind .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 20]: You do n't understand what you are talking about , and you have no right to call me names .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 7]: It 's vulgar and unladylike . ''
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 8]: `` I am thankful for that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 4]: cried Nan piously .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 16]: `` If your behaviour is ladylike , I 'll be as vulgar as I can .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 19]: I 'd rather not talk , if you please , until I have got over it a little .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 10]: I 'm afraid of what I may say . ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 18]: She went stalking downstairs , and Lilias turned into the porch-room and sat herself down in despair .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 47]: Elsie was seated at the table engaged in informing the diary of the latest family event , and she turned a look of such sympathetic sorrow upon the new-comer , that Lilias felt that here , at last , she had found a friend in need .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 9]: `` My heart is broken , Elsie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 4]: she sobbed tragically .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 8]: `` Every one has turned against me .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 13]: Father -- mother -- Nan -- they are all cruel to me .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 7]: Their words cut into my heart !
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 13]: I can never forget them -- never feel the same again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 20]: Elsie drew a sigh so long and fluttering that it was almost worthy to be ranked as a groan .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 7]: `` No -- never , never !
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 18]: A blow like this , coming in early youth , will cloud and darken all your life .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 8]: You can never be a girl again .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 29]: The remembrance of all you have suffered , and of the life you have wrecked , will haunt your dreams , and make you old before your time .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 39]: You feel it now , but you 'll feel it more and more , like a leaden weight pressing upon you , crushing out all your joy ... '' `` Dear me , Elsie , how you talk !
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 13]: You might be a penny novel , to prose away like that .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 18]: You are a fine Job 's comforter for a poor girl to come to in her trouble !
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 17]: It 's hard enough for me as it is , without trying to make it worse .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 13]: I shall drown myself , if this sort of thing goes on .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 9]: Maud sulking , Nan raving , you croaking !
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 4]: What a prospect !
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 21]: And I shall have to endure it all my life too , for I shall never marry -- now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 13]: `` No , '' said Elsie judiciously , `` I suppose not .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 7]: Not for love , at least .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 38]: Perhaps , by and by , after years and years , when you are middle-aged , you may make a marriage _ de convenance _ , to some old man who could give you a comfortable home .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 20]: People often do that in books , I notice , when they have had an unfortunate affair in youth .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 6]: And look at Mrs Bailey !
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 46]: Her lover was killed in the Crimea , and when she was fifty-two she married that nasty old man with the snuff on his beard , and -- '' But the rest of the sentence was spoken to the air , for Lilias had fled .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 40]: The prospect of the old man with snuff on his beard was too much for her composure , and she rushed into the garden , to see if there , at least , she might find the much-desired solitude .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 5]: No , not yet !
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 50]: for the summer-house towards which she sped had already been occupied by the three schoolgirls , and there they sat staring at her with big solemn eyes , as if , forsooth , a girl who had broken off her engagement was a new and extraordinary freak of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 35]: Good-natured Agatha made room for the new-comer by her side , and glanced sympathetically at the tear-stained face , but , as usual , her remarks were not the most tactful in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 10]: `` Was it really your doing , Lilias ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 12]: she inquired , `` or was Ned tired of you too ?
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 15]: Kitty says he was , and feels sure he will not mind much . ''
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 38]: That opened Lilias 's eyes with a flash of anger , but Kitty had the courage of her opinions , and said stolidly -- `` I never considered from the beginning that he was really in love .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 17]: I 've seen lots of engaged people , and he was n't a bit like them .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 51]: He used to ask us to go about with you , and be quite disappointed if we would n't , and most couples like to be alone , and make faces at one another when they think you are not looking , to say they wish you would run away .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 17]: I 've had experience , for last summer we stayed two months in a hydropathic . ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 23]: `` Perhaps he really did care for you at first , but was disappointed when he got to know you better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 31]: This from Christabel ; while Agatha chimed in with an eager -- `` But you are glad , dear , are n't you , to think he is not heart-broken ?
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 13]: It makes it easier for you when he does n't care ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 17]: Plainly there was no comfort forthcoming for Miss Lilias from the members of her own family !
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 39]: Meanwhile Jim was seeing his friend off at the railway station , and administering such sympathy as was deserved for Ned 's business reverses , while eclipsing his sisters in candour on the subject of the broken engagement .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 17]: `` If you would be a fool , you must be prepared to suffer for it .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 19]: Never was more surprised in my life than to hear of it , when it first came off .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 8]: Thought you had gone off your head .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 17]: When I was at home with you last , there was no sign of such nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 10]: Ca n't think what on earth possessed you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 18]: `` She was so pretty and charming , and seemed so much interested in all I did !
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 11]: Vanity was at the bottom of it , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 20]: I was flattered and interested , just when I was down on my luck , and needed it most .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 21]: I -- I -- I must make a clean breast of it , Jim , and tell you the truth !
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 53]: Of course , it was Maud I cared for first ; I can see now that I have loved her all through , but she was so reserved with me , and kept me at such a distance , that I thought she wanted to show me that I had no chance .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 17]: Then Lilias came home , and I was captivated by her lovely face and pretty ways .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 38]: She seemed to turn to me for advice and sympathy , to be so pleased to see me , so sorry when I left , that -- that -- ah , well , you know the rest !
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 35]: I was a fool , as I daresay many a man has been before me ; and though I was miserable enough , I never discovered why , until Lilias herself pointed it out .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 27]: She accused me of caring for Maud more than for her -- in Maud 's presence , too -- when we three were alone together ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 9]: Jim 's lips met in a significant whistle .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 5]: `` The little wretch !
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 6]: She ought to be shaken !
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 11]: My poor old Maud , that was rough on her .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 8]: What did she do or say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 19]: `` Begged me to take no notice , and pleaded for Lilias , like the angel she is .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 25]: But I was knocked completely over , did n't know what I was doing , and told her straight out that it was true .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 25]: Perhaps I should not have done it , but I could not help myself , and she gave me one look , just one !
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 29]: Oh , Jim , old man , if this crash has shown me the awful mistake I was making , it will be indeed a blessing in disguise .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 32]: I will work like ten men , I will laugh at difficulties , I will do anything and everything , if only , only I can win Maud in the end .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 10]: You will be my friend , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 13]: You will help me , and tell her what I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 8]: `` Not if I know it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 7]: returned Jim , with masculine candour .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 25]: `` You have done quite enough mischief for the time , old chap , and had better lie low until things have blown over .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 29]: I 've a great deal too much respect for Maud , to suggest that she should adopt you as her lover the moment you are dropped by Lilias .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 28]: Wait a year or two until you have made your position , and then come down and ask her yourself -- '' `` A year or two !
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 24]: And meantime she might think I had changed again , and had forgotten all about her -- That 's too much to expect !
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 55]: I do n't ask you to say anything just yet , but in time to come you might drop a hint , or let her see one of my letters , show her in any indirect way you like that I know my own mind at last , and am working towards an end .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 26]: It is n't much to ask from an old chum -- I 'd do as much for you if I were in your place . ''
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 46]: quoth Jim concisely ; but his grey eyes sent out a kindly gleam , and Ned Talbot went away comforted by the knowledge that his friend would be kinder in deed than in word , and that his message would not fail to be delivered .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 27]: He had another friend at court to whom he gave less thought , but whose loyalty was at least as strong as that of her brother .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 45]: Nan had her own dreams of the future , of which she breathed no word to a living soul , but she set herself to work to clear away such difficulties as lay in Ned 's path , with her accustomed energy and daring .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 36]: `` If I were a nice old gentleman with heaps of money and nothing to do , I would give a good situation to a young fellow who was miserable and ill - treated ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 27]: she announced to Mr Vanburgh , at the conclusion of the story of the broken engagement ; and that gentleman chuckled with enjoyment as he listened .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 6]: `` Would you , indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 5]: And in what capacity ?
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 19]: I do n't quite see what situations I have to offer which would meet Mr Talbot 's requirements .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 38]: There is a good deal of machinery of one sort and another involved in the work of a house like this , but I fear it is hardly the kind which he is accustomed to superintend . ''
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 8]: `` Do n't snub me , please .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 5]: I 'm too reduced .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 19]: I do n't mean in this house , but somewhere else where there are Works like his own .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 32]: If you would just write to the people and say how clever he is , and what a good manager , and that you are sure they would like him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 8]: `` But how can I be sure ?
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 24]: I know nothing about Mr Talbot 's business capacities , and should hardly recognise him if I met him in the street ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 6]: `` But I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 20]: You can trust my word ; and every one likes Ned , for he is so good and noble .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 46]: He did n't want to go into the Works at all , for he is one of those quiet , studenty sort of men , who are never so happy as when they are in the country , alone with their books and their thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 38]: He wanted to be a literary man , but his brother died , and there was no one else to help his father , so he gave up his own plans for the sake of the family .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 27]: That seems to me very hard -- to be unselfish and take up uncongenial work , and then to meet with nothing but failure and disappointment !
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 23]: I should expect to be rewarded by making piles of money , but poor old Ned has lost almost all he has .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 16]: Dear , sweet , kind Mr Vanburgh , find him another opening -- do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 17]: The old man smiled , and laid his worn fingers caressingly over the girl 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 31]: `` I would do a great deal to please you , Nan , if I could find the way , but my word is not so powerful as you imagine .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 41]: I am afraid the managers of the great factories would pay very little attention to my recommendation ; but if Mr Talbot is not set on continuing a business life , it is possible that something else might be found .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 46]: I have a good deal of land which will come to Gervase in his turn , and meantime , as he engages my stewards for me and takes in hand most of the arrangements , you had better speak to him on the subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 4]: `` Oh-oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 16]: cried Nan , and turned towards the young man with hands clasped together in supplication .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 6]: do you -- do you ?
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 13]: Then one of them is a bad steward , is n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 6]: I am sure he is !
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 12]: You want a new one ; I am sure you do !
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 17]: Ned would make a beauty , for he loves nothing so much as a country life .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 6]: He is a splendid shot .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 26]: Jim saw him knock over twelve rocketers running , last time they were out together , and he goes in for all kinds of sport .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 24]: His father had a beautiful country place when they were rich , and he is always talking of what he used to do .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 9]: He looks so sweet in gaiters , too !
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 8]: He would make a lovely steward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 15]: Both men shook with laughter , but Nan 's earnestness could not be shaken .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 24]: She was pleading for Maud 's future , for Maud 's happiness , and neither ignorance nor bashfulness had power to check her .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 23]: She insisted on the wickedness of the present steward with such determination , that Gervase was forced to come to his defence .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 14]: `` Indeed , Nan , he is a most capable and clever fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 24]: I 've not a word to say against him , except that perhaps he is too clever to stay with us much longer .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 23]: Lord Edgeworth has been advertising for a steward , and I think it more than likely that he will get the post .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 9]: If he should -- '' `` He will !
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 4]: He will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 4]: cried Nan excitedly .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 6]: `` I feel a conviction .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 13]: He will get it , and you will offer Ned his place .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 10]: It would be defying Providence to do anything else .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 13]: Oh , how happy I am -- how pleased he will be !
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 23]: And is it a pretty house in a garden , big enough for us all to go down and stay with him ?
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 17]: How soon will it be settled , so that I can tell them at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 49]: So determinedly confident did she appear as to the success of her scheme , that it seemed an ungenerous act to pour cold water on such generous enthusiasm , and each man registered a mental vow to satisfy her , if it were within the bounds of possibility .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 53]: As his custom was , Gervase escorted the visitor on a tour of inspection round the garden before she took her departure , and took advantage of the _ tete-a-tete _ to express a more ardent sympathy with the home trouble than he had cared to show in his uncle 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 44]: The broken engagement had been no surprise to him , for he had summed up the character of Miss Lilias too accurately to have any trust in her stability ; but it had evidently come as a shock to Nan 's unsuspecting mind .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 41]: `` She says now that she has been thinking of it for some time , and he says he was dissatisfied ; yet neither of them spoke a word , but went drifting on and on , waiting upon chance .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 25]: I suppose they would have married each other if this crash had not come , and regretted it for the rest of their lives .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 7]: I ca n't understand such behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 28]: If I feel a thing , I ca n't bottle it up , I simply can not ; out it must come , whatever is the consequence .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 31]: And when it comes to pretending to love a person when you do n't , and to be happy when you are not , that is worse than anything else .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 6]: It 's positively wicked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 6]: `` I agree with you .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 41]: I have always maintained that absolute honesty should be practised in these affairs between a man and a woman , and that far less trouble would arise if each side spoke out plainly as to what was in their hearts .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 45]: I go perhaps a little further in my views than most people , but long ago I made myself a promise that when my own hour came I would act up to my convictions , and I am not going to draw back now .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 55]: Months ago , Nan , you walked into my uncle 's room to meet me , and I knew -- I think I knew almost as soon as I met your eyes -- that here was a new specimen of her kind , a woman who would play a great part in my life .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 31]: I had never known that feeling before , but it has grown in strength ever since that day , until now it is difficult to imagine my life without it .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 20]: You have engrossed all my thoughts -- all my hopes -- '' Nan stood still and stared at him .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 15]: The colour had left her cheeks , and her eyes were wide and startled .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 14]: She laid her hand on her throat and gave a little choking gasp .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 20]: `` Do you mean that you -- that you are -- in love -- with _ me _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 36]: The amazement in her tone , the incredulity of that `` me '' was touching in its humility , and Gervase 's smile was very tender as he replied -- `` I think I am .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 13]: I am , at least , travelling very fast in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 8]: Does that alarm you so very much ?
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 5]: Does it distress you ?
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 13]: Have you no feeling of friendship to offer me in return ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 3]: `` Friendship !
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 22]: Oh yes , but not , '' -- Nan gulped over the word in wild embarrassment -- `` the other thing !
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 5]: It 's too soon .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 15]: I have just left the schoolroom -- I have just put up my hair .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 25]: I could n't think of such a thing for years and years , until I am old , and have got some sense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 4]: Gervase laughed softly .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 29]: `` You have more sense now than any girl I know ; but do n't be frightened , dear , I am not asking for my answer yet .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 19]: You must have time , but I wanted you to know from the beginning what my feelings were .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 50]: As you grow older and go into society , and meet other men , I want you to remember that there is one man who has already given his heart to your keeping , and is waiting in the hope that yours may be given to him in return .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 9]: You are not bound-to me in any way .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 32]: If you meet some one whom you can care for more than for me , I will wish you God-speed ; but until that day comes I will wait in hope .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 49]: I will not trouble you by referring to the subject again at present ; for a year to come I will promise not to allude to it , but by that time you will be twenty , and will have had twelve whole months to think me over .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 16]: You will not forbid me to speak to you again next July , Nan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 4]: `` N-no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 9]: sighed Nan dubiously , `` I suppose not .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 11]: You are very kind , but I am -- frightened .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 15]: Suppose I said ` Yes , ' and then changed my mind like Lilias !
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 12]: That would be dreadful , yet how can one be sure ?
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 33]: I like you very much , better than any other man , but still -- '' `` You must never say ` Yes ' unless you have no doubt in your heart .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 7]: No amount of liking will do .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 49]: If the day ever comes when you feel that your whole heart goes out to me , as mine does to you , when you would choose poverty with me rather than riches with another man , then come to me , darling , but never till then .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 22]: You and I are not the sort to be satisfied with a half-and-half happiness , and we will not risk failure .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 14]: I want to make your life beautiful , not to wreck it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 14]: The tears rose slowly in Nan 's eyes , and her lips trembled .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 24]: `` You are very good to me ; but I feel as if I must be a hypocrite to have deceived you so .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 6]: I 'm not worth it .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 6]: I 'm not , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 19]: If you only knew what a wretch I am , you could n't think of me any more .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 8]: There are such lots of nice girls .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 26]: If you would only choose somebody proper and sensible and accomplished and clever -- '' `` Oh , Nan , I do n't want her .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 9]: Do n't force her on me , please .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 18]: I 've met her such scores and scores of times , and she bored me so unutterably .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 22]: I want just you , and no one else ; but do n't trouble your head about me for another year .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 6]: Live your own bright life .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 17]: I would not for the world shorten your girlhood or make you old before your time .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 39]: It wo n't be a very depressing thought , dear , will it , that somewhere a hundred miles away a man is loving you , and trying to live a better life because of his love ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 15]: Nan could not answer , could only shake her head in a mute dissent .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 22]: No ; it was far from depressing -- it was beautiful , inspiring -- but , oh , what a responsibility !
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 16]: Gervase might say that he would not willingly shorten her girlhood , but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 7]: had he not already done so ?
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 34]: To feel that another heart leant on her own , another life depended on her for happiness -- was this not a reflection to sober the most careless and most light-hearted of natures ?
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 31]: Nan knew full well that this short interview was as a milestone in her life , and that at one step she had left behind the careless days of youth .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 4]: AFTER TWO YEARS .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 53]: Nearly two years had passed by since Lilias had broken off her engagement with Ned Talbot , and Gervase Vanburgh had told Nan of his love , and a stranger passing along the village highroad one bright May day might have discerned an air of unusual excitement and bustle in Thurston House .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 46]: The housemaids were hanging clean curtains in every window from attic to cellar ; the gardener was bedding out plants ; message boys besieged the house with trays of provisions , and the Parcel Delivery van seemed to empty its entire contents at the door .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 46]: Nor did the bustle grow less as one entered the house , for the hall was banked up with plants , and seven girls enveloped in aprons seemed to be chasing one another up and down stairs , so rapid and unceasing were their movements .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 25]: There would have been no difficulty in recognising our old friends , though the years had not passed without bringing changes in their wake .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 41]: Maud 's sweet face had lost its look of sadness , and blossomed into fresh youth ; Lilias was still the professional beauty , whose very apron was donned with an air to effect ; while , wonder of wonders !
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 20]: Nan had grown tidy , possessing hair as daintily coiled and hands as carefully kept as Lilias 's own .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 56]: In the old days it had been hazarded as an occasional conjecture that Nan was pretty ; but there could be no doubt on that question now , for the plump face had moulded into shape , the complexion toned down to a soft pink and white , and the dark eyes shone with happiness .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 67]: Happiness , indeed , seemed to radiate from Nan to-day , as she raced up and down the house , as hard-worked as any of her sisters , yet in some indefinable way distinguished from the rest , for she was given the precedence in all that went on , while every time that she and her mother came together , they embraced with fresh unction .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 46]: For the rest , Elsie had reached her ambition , and the age when she might dress her hair as she chose , and by means of parting it in the middle and plastering it over her ears had given herself an appropriately funereal aspect .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 24]: Even Agatha boasted a coil at the back of her head , while Christabel and Kitty wore skirts which reached to their ankles .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 53]: Advancing years had , however , by no means diminished the girls ' powers of conversation ; and as they banked up plants in corners of the staircase , and rearranged furniture in the sitting-rooms , the babel of voices was as deafening , and seemingly as inexhaustible , as of yore .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 8]: `` Children , children , be quiet !
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 9]: Stop talking , for mercy 's sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 5]: pleaded Mrs Rendell piteously .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 15]: `` I try to ask a question , and can not make myself heard .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 14]: You will make Nan 's head ache if you go on like this .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 13]: Go up to your room to write your letters , Nan dear .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 25]: Do n't attempt to do it here , but take the chance of half an hour 's quiet when you can get it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 54]: Nan rose obediently , and carried her writing materials upstairs ; but it was some time before she sat down at her desk , for the dressing-room door stood open , and therein lay something which exercised an irresistible attraction , something which lay stretched on a sofa , swathed in careful wrappings .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 70]: Nan drew back the sheet with reverent fingers , and there it lay in all its beauty -- a gleaming satin dress , the train folded skilfully in and out , bunches of orange-blossom catching up the lace , which was festooned with as much lavishness as if it had been modest Nottingham , instead of precious Brussels , of that rich mellow tint which comes from age alone .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 48]: A bride 's dress , and a bride 's dress fit for a princess , and in the box beside it a veil of the same old lace , and in the safe in the corner a diamond necklace and stars which represented a fortune in themselves !
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 16]: Could it be , could it really be that all this splendour was for her ?
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 3]: And oh !
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 29]: lucky girl , that she was so happy in love given and received , that they counted as nothing , and less than nothing , in her rejoicings !
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 86]: Could it be that to-morrow morning -- in twenty-four hours from now -- in less than twenty-four hours , she would be transformed from Nan Rendell of the coat and skirt -- Nan , the third daughter in a large family , in constant straits for money and anticipation of her dress allowance -- into Nan Vanburgh in satin and diamonds , Mrs Gervase Vanburgh , with her country seat , her diamonds , her carriages , her expectations of even greater wealth to come !
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 6]: Oh , wonder of wonders !
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 8]: Oh , fairy tale in real life !
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 18]: Oh , dear and beautiful prince , to work such marvels in a poor girl 's life !
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 37]: Nan bent down lower and lower until her lips touched the gleaming folds and her cheek rested lovingly against them , then she drew the sheet forward once more , and went back to her seat .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 29]: To think , not to write , however -- to think over the two years that had just passed , and all the events which they had brought .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 16]: Had she really loved Gervase from the beginning , even as he had loved her ?
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 23]: It seemed as if she had , for after that memorable interview in the garden she had known no doubt nor hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 69]: It was right to wait and let time prove the stability of her feelings , but at the bottom of her heart she had felt no uncertainty as to her final answer ; and oh , how long had seemed the last three months of the year , with what joy she had hailed July -- what a happy ; happy time it had been for all concerned !
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 63]: Mrs Rendell and Maud had been the only members of the family who had known of the intention which lay behind Gervase 's frequent visits ; and if the surprise with which the engagement was greeted was mingled with some envy and disappointment from one of the five sisters , the others more than made up for it by their unaffected delight .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 39]: Gervase had long received the sanction of approval ; and once assured of Nan 's happiness , it was impossible for the most unworldly of relatives to restrain a thrill of satisfaction in the grandeur of the alliance .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 36]: The schoolroom party was inflated with pride at the thought of `` My sister Mrs Vanburgh , '' and even Maud tilted her head and smiled with a complacent air when congratulated on the engagement .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 38]: As for the parents , they were naturally delighted at the prospect of so prosperous a marriage for their dear girl , while old Mr Vanburgh shed tears of happiness over the fulfilment of a cherished dream .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 11]: `` She will be the making of the boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 3]: he declared .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 22]: `` He has always been a good fellow , but too indifferent and lazy to make the most of his abilities .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 12]: Nan 's energy , Nan 's enthusiasm will be his salvation !
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 16]: This is the best news I have heard for many a long , long year .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 12]: It puts fresh life into me in my old age . ''
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 45]: Everybody seemed pleased and approving ; and not the least welcome among the many letters of congratulation was one from Ned Talbot , now some months settled as steward of the Vanburgh property , and his earnest , outspoken appreciation of his new employer .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 25]: When the subject of the marriage itself was broached , however , Mr Rendell obstinately refused to hear of any date within a year .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 16]: `` When she is twenty-one -- not a moment before , '' he said firmly .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 35]: `` I have a parent 's right to my Mops until she is of age , and not one day of the time will I give up for you or any man living . ''
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 36]: `` And I 've a husband 's right to her after that , and not one day longer will I wait , so we 'll fix on her birthday , the twentieth of May ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 12]: said Gervase , equally obstinate ; and so it was settled .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 52]: And the months had seemed as weeks , so rapidly had they flown past , until here was the day before the wedding , with Nan 's new boxes standing in the corner ready packed for that wonderful journey to foreign lands of which she had dreamed all her life long .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 48]: When the gong sounded , Nan looked guiltily at the blank sheet of paper ; but it was too late to begin letters now -- she must go downstairs , and trust to good fortune that the girls would not discover how she had wasted the time !
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 46]: Lunch was a scramble meal to-day , served in the morning-room on three different tables , and in the midst of a medley of boxes and parcels ; but that was part of the fun of the occasion , and added to the general hilarity .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 38]: A formal meal in the dining-room could be had any day , but it needed a convulsion of Nature to induce Mrs Rendell to hold her plate in her lap , and actually -- oh , horrors !
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 11]: to help herself to butter with her own individual knife !
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 19]: The girls chuckled with delight at the spectacle , and then turned to greet Nan on her reappearance .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 11]: `` Well , ` Bride , ' finished your notes ?
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 16]: Hope you have been a good little honest girl , and said what was true .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 16]: ` Dear Mrs Webb , -- Thank you so much for the dear little pepperettes .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 32]: It is so kind of you to think of me , and as I have already had seven pairs sent , I feel no anxiety whatever concerning my future happiness . '
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 21]: ` Dear Mr Cross , -- Thank you so much for the vases which you have so kindly sent me .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 19]: They are quite unique , I am sure , as I have never before seen anything like them .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 27]: I shall put them in my drawing-room whenever I know you are coming , and keep them carefully in a cupboard when you are away . '
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 20]: ` Dear Mrs de Bels , -- How kind of you to send me such a sweet little egg-boiler !
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 53]: We never use such a thing , but it will do charmingly to give away to some one else , and -- ' '' `` It 's to be hoped no one will send you wedding presents , Kitty , if that 's the way you are going to receive them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 15]: said Nan severely ; but her reproof was received with bursts of derisive laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 3]: `` Ho !
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 2]: ho !
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 2]: ho !
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 5]: How innocent we are !
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 7]: how proper all of a sudden !
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 31]: Can you look us in the face and say you have not said as nearly that as you dared -- that you have not deliberately disguised your true sentiments ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 4]: `` I can !
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 3]: I do !
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 17]: I have not written a single word this morning with which you could find fault ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 29]: cried Nan , with a boldness which betrayed her to her sharp-witted adversaries , for the cry was immediately raised -- `` She has n't written at all !
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 12]: She has been sitting dreaming about _ him _ instead . ''
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 12]: `` I think of thee by morn , my love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 36]: chanted Kitty , rolling her eyes to the ceiling with a ridiculous affectation of sentiment ; while Agatha and Christabel went through a pantomime of rapturous greeting , at which Nan laughed in unperturbed enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 28]: She had served a long apprenticeship to her sisters ' teasing ways , and was too happy in her engagement to keep up any pretence of indifference .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 30]: Nan , indeed , won universal admiration in the character of an engaged girl , for there was something inexpressibly winsome in her transparent enjoyment of her own happiness .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 28]: She loved her future husband with all her heart , and saw no reason why she should feign an indifference which she was so far from feeling .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 32]: When Gervase arrived in person shortly after lunch , she went flying to meet him , and came back hanging on his arm , her face sparkling with happiness and contentment .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 5]: `` He has come !
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 4]: He has come !
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 5]: Here he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 33]: she cried , in tones of triumph ; and Gervase was promptly surrounded by his sisters-in-law-to - be , and escorted round the house to see the preparations for to-morrow 's ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 59]: He said little , for the solemnity of the occasion had already laid its sobering touch upon him , but his eyes glowed , and every time he looked at Nan there came an expression into his face so sweet , so true , so tender , that Maud could not see it and keep back the tears .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 31]: She was in a supersensitive mood this afternoon , for not only did the parting with her beloved sister lie ahead , but also a meeting of even more importance .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 37]: Ned Talbot was to be Gervase 's best man , and was even now at the Grange , waiting only to greet his host , before coming to pay his first visit for nearly two years .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 61]: The winter before he had received an invitation to Thurston House , but it had been refused ; and even after that formal intimation that the way was open , he had delayed his coming , modesty and self-distrust alike combining to make him dread that final putting to the test which should `` win or lose it all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 27]: How much Miss Nan had to do with the choosing of the `` best man '' is one of those secrets which are best left alone .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 56]: But presently there he came , walking across the lawn towards the spot where the tea-table was laid , just as he had done on another afternoon years ago ; and there sat Maud , once more busying herself with the tea-cups to hide her confusion , though of a different and far happier description .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 30]: Not in vain had Jim dropped his words of reminder ; not for naught had he handed over letters received from his old friend for his sister 's perusal !
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 38]: Maud knew , and had known for many a long day , to whom Ned 's heart was given ; and Ned knew that she knew , and gathered fresh hope from her sweet , shy smile .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 30]: For himself , he was looking a new man , and Lilias felt a stab of pain as she looked at him and met his calm , scrutinising glance .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 37]: She had loved him once , or had come as near loving him as it was in her nature to do , and she was surprised to find how much it hurt to realise his disenchantment .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 42]: She was as pretty as ever , -- prettier , so her mirror told her , -- but though admiration was hers in plenty , no one seemed to love her , or to turn to her for sympathy and counsel .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 61]: Nan , her younger sister , was about to be spirited away to a life of luxury and affluence ; Maud would certainly follow suit before long ; and she would be left at home with the younger girls , regarded by them as a tiresome elderly person , who refused to move on and make room for her juniors .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 6]: A pleasant prospect , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 35]: yet she could not complain , for if there was little sympathy between her sisters and herself , the fault was her own , and in her heart she confessed that it was so .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 31]: It is impossible to live a selfish , self-engrossed life without suffering for it in hours of loneliness , and Lilias was beginning to learn this lesson to her cost .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 39]: When tea was over , Gervase went back to the Grange to sit with his uncle , while Nan adjourned upstairs to superintend that last trying-on of bridesmaids ' dresses which the younger girls declared to be imperative .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 13]: `` My dear , you do n't know what may be wrong !
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 16]: I slipped on my bodice last night , and it was two inches too tight .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 41]: That does n't matter -- I 'll have a slim figure for your wedding , if I die for it ; but consider -- just consider -- how fe-arful it would have been if it had been too loose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 14]: cried Agatha tragically ; and after that there was plainly no refusal possible .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 59]: Mrs Rendell wished to interview the cook , Jim had a letter to write -- every one , it appeared , had some important and pressing matter demanding attention , save only Maud and Ned , who were left to their own devices , and presently wandered off towards that portion of the garden most sheltered from observation .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 41]: Both knew what was coming , and both were trembling with hardly suppressed agitation ; then presently their eyes met , Ned held out his hand , and Maud 's went out to meet it without a moment 's hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 8]: `` Do you forgive me , Maud ?
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 7]: Can you believe in me again ?
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 30]: Can you give yourself to a man who loves you with all his heart , and can never do enough to show his remorse for his own miserable mistake ?
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 36]: I did you a cruel wrong , but I have suffered for it all these years ... Could you find enough charity in your heart to forgive me , and give me another chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 8]: `` I have nothing to forgive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 4]: said Maud simply .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 3]: Dear thing !
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 31]: and she meant it too ; for when she loved , she found it impossible to blame , and Ned had been her hero for so many a long year .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 21]: `` It was quite natural that you should be fascinated by Lilias , for she is so beautiful and charming .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 21]: I did not blame you , even at the time ; but oh , Ned , I was very miserable !
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 14]: I loved you so dearly , I longed so much to help you !
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 19]: There is nothing in the world which could make me so happy as to be your wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 21]: Ned 's words of love , of gratitude , of almost tearful remorse , are too sacred to be repeated .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 42]: He had reached his goal at last , and , looking back upon the past , felt that all the troubles which had lain in his path were but a light price to have paid for the treasure he had won !
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 50]: Upstairs at the window of the girls ' bedroom Kitty Maitland peered through her spectacles at the flutter of Maud 's dress behind the bushes in the garden , and knitted her brows , in her anxiety to account for the presence of a dark stain around the waist !
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 31]: Presently the bushes parted company for a few yards , and the stain was discovered to be neither more nor less than a coat sleeve belonging to Mr Ned Talbot !
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 64]: Kitty cleared her throat , and chanted in a high , clear tone -- `` A marriage has been arranged , and will shortly take place , between Mr Edward Mortimer Talbot and Maud , eldest daughter of -- '' A stampede towards the window interrupted the conclusion of the sentence , and the sisters stared at the unconscious couple with eager scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 43]: They peered to right and left , craned their necks to one side and then the other , rushed to a second window to obtain a better view , and finally turned back and faced each other with expressions of awed conviction .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 8]: `` It is -- for a ducat !
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 8]: Oh dear , what a nuisance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 4]: cried Agatha pitifully .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 9]: `` What shall we do without our Maud ?
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 16]: First Nan , and then Maud -- the house will be lost without them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 7]: `` Our loss is their gain .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 5]: We must be resigned .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 7]: It is what we must expect .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 15]: One bird after another will fly away , and leave the old nest bare .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 12]: It is the order of Nature , '' sighed Elsie sadly .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 4]: `` Another wedding !
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 5]: Another bridesmaid 's dress .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 5]: How s-implay lovelay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 19]: cried Christabel rapturously ; but Nan stood apart with clasped hands , and dark eyes full of tears .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 22]: `` The only thing , '' she sighed to herself -- `` the only thing I had left to wish for .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 7]: Oh , how thankful I am !
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 7]: What a dear world it is !
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 9]: How good God is to us all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 3]: THE END .
